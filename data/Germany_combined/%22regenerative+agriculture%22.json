LONDON, April 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Mars Incorporated, a global leader in pet care products and services, released new research through its James Wellbeloved brand which uncovers that UK dog owners care deeply about their pets' nutrition, but many don't realise that the journey of their dog's food begins long before it reaches their bowl.(2) 8 in 10 UK dog owners (79%) say they put as much thought into their pet's diet as their own, yet only a quarter (26%) say they have a high level of understanding as to where their dog's food comes from. The new research, surveying UK dog owners, revealed:   * Half (51%) say their pets love playing in soil, yet the same number (49%)     don't realise that     \"healthy soil is critical for growing high-quality ingredients(3) \"   * Over half (51%) say they have limited or no understanding of the connection     between farming practices and the food their dog eats   * Over a quarter (26%) don't view soil as important to the quality of their     pet's food   * 7 in 10 (72%) want to better understand where their dog's food comes from Despite this, almost all UK dog owners (91%) say the ingredients are an important factor in influencing them to purchase food for their pet, and 8 in 10 are more likely to buy food if they know it contains natural ingredients - 52% even research ingredients before purchasing. Nutritional value is another top priority for 39% of dog owners when shopping for pet food, followed by a trusted brand (25%). With experts estimating that 90% of soil could be degraded globally by 2050(4), meaning a deterioration in the soil's quality and diminished capacity to support life such as plants. This deep interest from dog owners in their pet's nutrition can play a key role in raising awareness around soil health. ________________________ To highlight the critical role of soil, James Wellbeloved unveiled a 15-foot giant mucky pup sculpture named Ellie in central London - with Ellie's playful stance reflecting how soil makes dogs happy on the outside while also representing the four football fields of healthy soil degraded every second globally\\xB3. The sculpture follows the launch of James Wellbeloved's Beloved Soil Initiative earlier this year, a regenerative agriculture pilot developed in collaboration with experts, Agrii and Soil Association Exchange, which in its first year will partner with three farmers forming part of our supply chain producing oats and barley. Through financial incentives, education programmes and tailored training the pilot aims to help the farmers to adopt regenerative farming practices, such as crop diversification and restoring hedgerows which can contribute to improved soil health and provide shelter for wildlife. Melodie Nye, Chief Growth Officer, Mars Pet Nutrition Europe commented: \"We're proud to be building on the launch of our Beloved Soil Initiative -we know pet parents care deeply about their pets' well-being, and we want to use this passion to help inspire more awareness and consideration for the essential role of soil. By embarking on our regenerative agriculture pilot, we are beginning to help support farmers to restore and protect soil and highlighting this initiative is an important part of our journey.\" Joseph Gridley, Chief Executive Officer, Soil Association Exchange, added: \"At Soil Association Exchange, we know that the health of our soil underpins the quality of our food - whether it's feeding people or our pets. Through the Beloved Soil Initiative, we're proud to support farmers in adopting regenerative practices and verifying the impact of these changes on soil health, biodiversity, and resilience. It's great to see James Wellbeloved using its platform to raise awareness of soil's vital role, and we're excited to collaborate on this journey towards a healthier future for our soils and our food systems.\" For more information on the mucky pup sculpture and James Wellbeloved's Beloved Soil Initiative and regenerative agriculture journey, please visit here.

LONDON, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Mars, Incorporated a global leader in pet care products and services, releases new research through its James Wellbeloved brand which uncovers that UK dog owners care deeply about their pets' nutrition, but many don't realise that the journey of their dog's food begins long before it reaches their bowl.(2) 8 in 10 UK dog owners (79%) say they put as much thought into their pet's diet as their own, yet only a quarter (26%) say they have a high level of understanding as to where their dog's food comes from. The new research, surveying UK dog owners, revealed:   * Half (51%) say their pets love playing in soil, yet the same number (49%)     don't realise that \"healthy soil is critical for growing high-quality     ingredients(3)\"   * Over half (51%) say they have limited or no understanding of the connection     between farming practices and the food their dog eats   * Over a quarter (26%) don't view soil as important to the quality of their     pet's food   * 7 in 10 (72%) want to better understand where their dog's food comes from Despite this, almost all UK dog owners (91%) say the ingredients are an important factor in influencing them to purchase food for their pet, and 8 in 10 are more likely to buy food if they know it contains natural ingredients - 52% even research ingredients before purchasing. Nutritional value is another top priority for 39% of dog owners when shopping for pet food, followed by a trusted brand (25%). With experts estimating that 90% of soil could be degraded globally by 2050(4), meaning a deterioration in the soil's quality and diminished capacity to support life such as plants. This deep interest from dog owners in their pet's nutrition can play a key role in raising awareness around soil health. To highlight the critical role of soil, James Wellbeloved unveiled a 15-foot giant mucky pup sculpture named Ellie in central London - with Ellie's playful stance reflecting how soil makes dogs happy on the outside while also representing the four football fields of healthy soil degraded every second globally\\xB3.

Agventure was established in 2010 with the mission of enabling Kenyan farmers to develop more sustainable farming practices. Agventure consists of a collective of farmers, researchers, educators, and entrepreneurs working to model, promote, and share regenerative production methods throughout the food system. Today the group supplies over 45,000 tonnes of food crops into the local market, across a range of crops including wheat, barley, maize, canola, sunflower, green peas, chickpeas, lupins, fava beans and others. Through its Centre of Excellence, the company reaches and trains over 700 small and medium sized farmers across the country, encouraging them to introduce rotational crops including canola, into their farming system to help promote soil health. Agventure then provides a guaranteed offtake for the canola seed, which it processes and sells to the Kenyan market. AgDevCo's mezzanine loan of $9.5 million will enable the company to continue to develop its canola oil production capabilities - it sells oil under the Pure Mountain brand in Kenya - allowing the company to increase its volumes purchased from outgrower farmers. It will also help to build Agventure Seed's platform to supply high quality certified seed to farmers. AgDevCo's Managing Director for East Africa, Rebecca Sankar, said, \"We are excited to be supporting Agventure in its journey to add more value commodity crops, which increases the availability of high quality, locally produced food for the domestic market and reduces reliance on imports.\" Agventure's CEO, Don White, said, \"Agventure is looking forward to working with AgDevCo to expand and strengthen our business and in doing so expand availability of regenerative agriculture solutions to many more farmers.\" AgDevCo is a specialist investor in African agriculture, growing sustainable and impactful agribusiness, with USD 280m under management. Its vision is a thriving commercial agriculture sector, which benefits both people and planet by investing in and supporting agribusinesses to grow, create jobs, produce, and process food and link farmers to markets. AgDevCo supports its partners to work towards climate sustainability, and where possible, regenerative solutions. AgDevCo has made more than 65 investments to date.

The two partners have been    collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration    in 2018.     The new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects    and focuses on further advancing business practices with the    goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource    efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve    soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural    regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China,    and the United States.     The collaboration embodies Syngenta's commitment to regenerate    soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide sustainability    priorities announced in April 2024.     Petra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: \"We    are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our    partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts    towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by    innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect    nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global    population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight    climate change and safeguard natural resources.\"     Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China    and the US     Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million    hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant    portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with    the company.     The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded    land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when    expanding their production, instead of clearing native    vegetation. The REVERTE\\xAE program, originally designed by Syngenta    and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential,    includes Ita\\xFA BBA bank as the organization offering a line of    credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria.     Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater    Systems, TNC: \"REVERTE\\xAE aims to demonstrate, through an    integrated solution involving good agricultural practices,    financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic    viability of restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new    cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in    the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits,    increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience    of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program    aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the    Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits    today and in the future.\"     As of March 2024, REVERTE\\xAE has garnered commitments from over 263    farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded    land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome.     China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares    of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat    producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17    thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading    to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m^3 per    hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run    Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil    health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the    soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group's    fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers    that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering    helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting    crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta    Group's recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company    has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to    1000 by 2028.     United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and    launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing    cropland's climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on    water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with    regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the    collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture    practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader    global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative    agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will    bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the    environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving    the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers.    Syngenta Group supports a broad range of sustainability projects    and partners with academia and industry around the world -    demonstrating its commitment to a collaborative approach.     Syngenta Group and TNC will hold a LinkedIn Live event on the    partnership progress.

Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China    and the US     Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million    hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant    portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with    the company.", "It will also leverage Syngenta Group's    fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers    that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering    helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting    crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta    Group's recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company    has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to    1000 by 2028. United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and    launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing    cropland's climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on    water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with    regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the    collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture    practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader    global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative    agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will    bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the    environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving    the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers.

This year, COP15 needs to have as much attention as it focuses on restoring global biodiversity. The European Outdoor Conservation Association (EOCA) team came up with a good explanation when they described the urgency of both topics as an overflowing bathtub \u2013 you should both turn off the taps plus pull out the plug to tackle the problem. Textiles have gained a (false) reputation as the second most polluting industry in the world (apparel is bad, but not that bad). Whatever the numbers, it is common knowledge that there is room for improvement not just for man-made, but in natural materials as well, like cotton. </p><p>In this ongoing discussion, one of the incoming buzzwords involves ReGenerative Agriculture \u2013 but what is it? ReGenerative Agriculture (ReGenAg) is the new way of growing cotton and other crops, but it is just the practice used a century ago. The method is based on four main principles around soil health, irrigation, carbon sequestration and restoring biodiversity. ReGenAg practice could be used immediately; unlike qualification for Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS), which takes three years to swap over from regular farming, a ReGenAg tag can be valid after just a year of better husbandry of the soils. The North Face was the first to use ReGenAg materials when they introduced their Cali wool beanie four years ago. Last year, Timberland (also a VF Corp. brand like TNF) introduced its Earthkeeper range of footwear using ReGenAg leather. The latter is worthy of more attention because cows are seen as almost evil in this world \u2013 they provide a meat diet, they graze inefficiently on pastureland, and rainforests are cleared to grow their winter food-stock of soybeans. There has been a verified study, audited by Quantis, on the White Oaks Pasture farm in the U.S. that has revealed that rather than the usual 33 factor (kgs of CO2 produced per 1 kg of meat) \u2013 ReGenAg beef farming absorbs 3 \u00bd kg of carbon into the soil more than is emitted. It follows that sheep get an endorsement, too, for their wool. Arable crops are even better. Clever herding pays off to more carbon being stored The key aspect is the change of agricultural practice. Everything is focused on the roots of the crop (or the grass for livestock). The science bit is the other side of photosynthesis: we all know that plants take in carbon dioxide and return oxygen, that carbon is sequestered as the foliage or roots of the plant. Hence, the longer the roots, the more carbon is stored. The more growth above the ground, the longer the roots \u2013 so the trick is to move the animals onto fresh pasture before they eat the plant down to soil level. Extra herding equals more labor, but these additional costs break even (reduction in fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals) after four years. For arable crops like cotton, the route is following regular organic cultivation. To use the ReGenAg label, there needs to be an improvement in soil health shown year-to-year; applied correctly, the endorsement can happen after 12 months of the change of technique. Soil health (microbes) is vital for a healthy planet. A good root network will absorb and thus feed the plant with moisture for 30 times longer than rain falling on worn-out soil. The rainwater will also take up to 100 days to reach the river\u2019s flow, rather than the three days it takes to reach it during a flood. Both factors also reduce wind and water erosion \u2013 currently recorded as up to 5 cm each year. Restoring biodiversity also means creating a habitat for arable crop predators so that natural control can take place, in line with the EU Green Deal recommendations. There are many examples of how local networks reward the small farmers, as opposed to money going only to super farms; whereas sequestration (converted to the wool in a jacket) is equivalent to 100 kg of carbon stored in the ground. For manufacturers, this means that for every 10 product units, one ton is saved from the company\u2019s total carbon footprint. It is common knowledge that there is room for improvement not just for man-made, but in natural materials as well. As in so many other areas of the apparel industry, there are several different standards used by the brands. Patagonia has opted for the Rodale Institute, TNF uses Indigo, while Timberland follows the Savory Institute guidelines. The latter audit is also the one chosen by HDWool, as it is the only third-party certified system \u2013 based on the yearly Ecological Outcome Verification of the farms. With the rise in direct B2C communication channels, it is expected that end consumers will opt for carbon-balanced (or even negative) fabrics to facilitate their concern for the environment. Some industry stakeholders see regenerative agriculture as the answer to many (if not all) problems. To quote Rose Marcario when she was Patagonia\u2019s CEO: \u201cAgriculture really represents the best chance that we have of mitigating and ending the climate crisis.

Extension of multi-year agreement that started in 2018, focusing on five strategic projects across the globe.   By 2026, ambitious target to recover over 300 thousand hectares of degraded land in Cerrado Brazil and regenerate agricultural soils in China with a focus to impact the agricultural sector for the adaption of sustainable farming practices. In the US the focus lies in enhancing climate resilience of crop land  Collaboration and innovation drive the transformation of agriculture into a climate solution that regenerates soil and nature.  23 May 2024, Basel, Switzerland / Arlington, Virginia, USA Syngenta Group, the leading global agriculture technology company, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a world-wide conservation organization with the mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends, today renewed their successful collaboration that links conservation goals with economic potential and addresses societal issues like deforestation and land degradation. The two partners have been collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration in 2018.  The new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects and focuses on further advancing business practices with the goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China, and the United States.  The collaboration embodies Syngenta?s commitment to regenerate soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide  announced in April 2024. Petra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: ?We are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight climate change and safeguard natural resources.? Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China and the US Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with the company.  The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when expanding their production, instead of clearing native vegetation. The REVERTE\u00ae program, originally designed by Syngenta and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential, includes Ita\u00fa BBA bank as the organization offering a line of credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria. Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater Systems, TNC: ?REVERTE\u00ae aims to demonstrate, through an integrated solution involving good agricultural practices, financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic viability of\u00a0restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits, increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits today and in the future.?  As of March 2024, REVERTE\u00ae has garnered commitments from over 263 farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome. China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17 thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m3 per hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group?s fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta Group?s recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to 1000 by 2028. United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing cropland?s climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers. Syngenta Group supports a broad range of sustainability projects and partners with academia and industry around the world ? demonstrating its commitment to a collaborative approach.  Syngenta Group and TNC will hold a LinkedIn Live event on the partnership progress.

The Global Alliance, one of the hallmarks of the Brazil's G20 presidency, aims to quickly channel resources towards effective programs that reduce poverty and hunger - two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are currently offtrack. As part of its membership, The Rockefeller Foundation is committing its financial and knowledge support to member countries in their expansion of school meal programs - one of the most beneficial investments countries can make to achieve SDG 1 and 2.</p><p>\"When I say that, I get emotional, because hunger is not a natural thing. Hunger is something that requires political decision. We leaders cannot look only - and all the time - at those who are close to us. We need to be able to take an X-ray and look at those who are far away, those who cannot get close to palaces, those who cannot get close to ministers,\" said Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty and President of Brazil, in a speech at the pre-launch of the Global Alliance in July .</p><p>\"Programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, Food Acquisition and School Meals allow healthy meals to reach the most vulnerable, encourage agricultural production and promote local development. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was born out of this political will and spirit of solidarity.

This return to positive RIG came despite soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions, as well as actions taken to reduce customer inventory. Organic growth was 2.1% in the first half (H1) and 2.3% in the second half (H2), with RIG of 0.1% in H1, improving to 1.4% in H2. Organic growth of 2.2% was impacted by a slowdown in category growth and our own below-market development. We have a clear focus on accelerating category growth and improving our market share performance in 2025 and over the medium term. An important part of how we deliver this is focusing our resource allocation behind our strongest growth drivers: scaling existing winning platforms and brands; accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets'; and building new growth engines that capture emerging consumer trends. On market share performance, in 2024 we gained or held share in approximately half of our business cells by number, but in less than half of our business cells by sales value. The majority of the Group's market share loss is driven by 18 key underperforming business cells, which together account for approximately 21% of Group sales. We are executing our action plans at pace for each cell and are seeing some early signs of improvement. A key element of improving our performance is strengthening our value propositions to consumers and customers. We are increasing investment to deliver superior product taste and quality, unbeatable value, unmissable visibility and compelling brand communication. Price competitiveness is a priority in the context of the high inflationary environment for certain commodities, most notably coffee and cocoa. We are taking an agile approach to passing on input cost increases, selectively investing in price as we focus on restoring competitiveness. To strengthen brand communication, we are stepping up investment and improving efficiency and effectiveness. Advertising and marketing spend as a percentage of sales fell from 9.0% in 2019 to a low of 6.6% in H2- 2022; in 2024, this recovered to 8.1% and is planned to increase further to 9% by the end of 2025. Efficiency and productivity At our Capital Markets Day in November 2024, we announced a new three-year cost reduction program we have called Fuel for Growth, which is in addition to existing cost efficiency initiatives. We target CHF 2.5 billion run-rate cost savings from the new program by the end of 2027, and these savings will be used to fund increased investment in growth. The Fuel for Growth program is expected to drive in-year savings of CHF 0.7 billion in 2025, CHF 1.4 billion in 2026 and CHF 2.3 billion in 2027. By the end of 2027, we expect to have reached the full run-rate savings of CHF 2.5 billion. In 2025, CHF 300 million of the savings impact this year only, with the further CHF 400 million being recurring savings that reduce the cost base on an ongoing basis. Over CHF 300 million of the expected CHF 0.7 billion cost savings for 2025 have already been secured. Approximately three-quarters of the total savings in Fuel for Growth will come in procurement, with the remainder coming from operational efficiencies and commercial investments. Within procurement, the most significant savings will come from AI-powered procurement and supplier management, spend consolidation and aggregation, and e-sourcing expansion and automation. Within operational efficiencies and commercial investments, key initiatives include reviewing operating models as well as opportunities in manufacturing and logistics. The savings in procurement and commercial investments are expected to have limited costs to achieve; operational efficiencies will typically incur one-off costs of approximately 2 times the annual savings. These Fuel for Growth savings are in addition to over CHF 1 billion per annum of ongoing efficiencies from existing Nestl\\xE9 Continuous Excellence initiatives. Expected phasing of Fuel for Growth cost savings program:   In CHF billion                    2025   2026   2027   2025 non-recurring                0.3   2025 recurring savings            0.4    0.4    0.4   2026 recurring savings                   1.0    1.0   2027 recurring savings                          0.9   Total in-year savings             0.7    1.4    2.3   Run-rate savings at end of 2027                 2.5 Strengthening foundations Nestl\\xE9's success depends on alignment and in-market execution, and people are critical to that. 2024 was an important year of change in our leadership. Our new leadership team moved quickly to align and refocus the organization. We have simplified the Group's structure and reorganized Nestl\\xE9 Waters and premium beverages into a global, standalone business. This is complemented by the introduction of a more aligned performance management framework - our 'Operational Master Plan' - to increase Group-wide performance and drive pace of execution across the organization. We have also accelerated our digital transformation as we move to becoming a real-time, end-to-end connected enterprise, powered by data and artificial intelligence. Operating sustainably is an important foundation for Nestl\\xE9, and we made progress across multiple areas. In particular, we delivered our 2025 greenhouse gas emission reduction target one year ahead of plan and made strong progress with our regenerative agriculture agenda. Guidance Our 2025 guidance is in line with the outlook we provided at the Capital Markets Day, with accelerated delivery of cost efficiencies offsetting recent increases in key commodity prices, especially in coffee and cocoa. In 2025, organic sales growth is expected to improve compared to 2024, strengthening through the year as we continue to deliver on our growth plans. UTOP margin is expected to be at or above 16.0% as we invest for growth. Guidance assumes no significant change in key macroeconomic variables. Our objective remains to deliver superior, sustainable and profitable growth. In the medium term, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be at 4% plus in a normal operating environment, with an underlying operating profit margin at 17.0% plus. Financial review Sales Total reported sales decreased by 1.8% to CHF 91.4 billion, including negative impacts of 3.7% from foreign exchange movements and 0.3% from net divestitures. Organic growth was 2.2%. Pricing was 1.5%, reflecting a reduction in inflation across most categories after two years of high input cost and price increases. RIG returned to positive growth at 0.8% and was still impacted by soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands in certain markets. Additionally, actions taken to reduce customer inventory in the second half of the year reduced full-year RIG by approximately 20 basis points. By geography, organic growth was driven by emerging markets and Europe, which together more than offset a decrease in North America. In developed markets, organic growth was 1.2%, with positive pricing and RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 3.7%, led by pricing with positive RIG. Organic growth by product category was as follows:   * Coffee was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth,     supported by the three leading coffee brands: Nescaf\\xE9, Nespresso and     Starbucks.   * Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by KitKat and     key local brands.   * PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for     science-based premium brands Purina ProPlan, Purina ONE and Friskies.   * Nestl\\xE9 Health Science achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit     growth in the second half of the year.   * Water reported low single-digit growth, with solid growth for S.Pellegrino     and supported by the successful launch of Maison Perrier.   * Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, supported by     continued momentum for NAN and Lactogen.   * Dairy posted negative growth, as a decline in coffee creamers and ambient     dairy more than offset growth for affordable milks and dairy culinary     solutions.   * Culinary reported negative growth, with mid single-digit growth in Maggi     more than offset by a decline in frozen food in North America. By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 2.1%. Organic growth of out-of- home channels was 3.2%. E-commerce sales grew organically by 11.3%, reaching 18.9% of total Group sales. Gross profit and operating profit Gross profit was flat at CHF 42.7 billion, and the gross profit margin increased by 80 bps to 46.7%. The gross profit margin reached 47.2% in H1, then declined 90 bps sequentially to 46.3% in H2, driven by higher input costs in coffee and cocoa. Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 8.3%. Marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 90 bps to 19.8%. This comprised: advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales up 40 bps to 8.1%, as we began to step up investment; and administration expenses as a percentage of sales up 50 bps to 11.7% of sales, largely reflecting higher labor costs, the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and one-off items. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 1.8%. Underlying trading operating profit was CHF 15.7 billion, a decrease of 2.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1.3% in constant currency. The underlying trading operating profit margin was 17.2%, a decrease of 10 bps on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. Restructuring and net other trading items was CHF 1.1 billion compared with CHF 1.5 billion in the prior year, with the reduction mainly due to lower restructuring costs. Trading operating profit increased by 0.8% to CHF 14.6 billion. The trading operating profit margin reached 16.0%, an increase of 40 bps on a reported basis and 50 bps in constant currency.

The average cost of net debt was 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2023. The Group reported tax rate was 25.0%, compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to a write-off in deferred tax assets from changes in utilization projections and the absence of the favorable one-off items that positively impacted 2023. The underlying tax rate increased by 70 basis points to 21.9%, driven by higher corporate and withholding tax rates in some jurisdictions, as well as changes in the geographical and business mix of profits. Net profit and earnings per share Net profit decreased by 2.9% to CHF 10.9 billion. Basic earnings per share decreased by 1.0% to CHF 4.19, reflecting the movement in net profit and the impact of the share buyback program. Underlying net profit was CHF 12.4 billion, a decrease of 2.6%, and an increase of 0.6% in constant currency. Underlying earnings per share was CHF 4.77, a decrease of 0.8%, and an increase of 2.5% in constant currency. The share buyback program contributed 1.1% to the underlying earnings per share change, net of finance costs. Cash flow Cash generated from operations increased to CHF 19.6 billion from CHF 19.2 billion in 2023. Free cash flow was CHF 10.7 billion compared to the prior year free cash flow of CHF 10.4 billion, which included CHF 0.6 billion proceeds from the disposal of a financial asset, with the increase primarily due to lower taxes paid and lower cash restructuring costs, as well as reduced capital expenditure. Dividend At the Annual General Meeting on April 16, 2025, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 3.05 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. Nestl\\xE9 has maintained or increased the dividend in Swiss francs over the last 65 years. We remain committed to the long-held practice of increasing the dividend in Swiss francs every year. The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 17, 2025. The net dividend will be payable as from April 24, 2025. Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on April 9, 2025, at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights. Share buyback program In 2024, the Group repurchased 48.2 million Nestl\\xE9 S.A. shares for CHF 4.4 billion under the CHF 20.0 billion share buyback program that began in January 2022 and was completed as planned in December 2024. Under the program, 187.4 million shares were repurchased in the three-year period, of which 143.9 million have so far been cancelled. At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose the cancellation of the remaining 43.5 million repurchased shares, reducing the share capital of Nestl\\xE9 S.A. from CHF 262,000,000 to CHF 257,652,000. We do not currently anticipate initiating a new share buyback program in 2025. Net debt Net debt was CHF 56.0 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared to CHF 49.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase largely reflected cash outflows for the dividend payment of CHF 7.8 billion and share buybacks of CHF 4.5 billion as well as the impact of foreign exchange movements. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.90 times at December 31, 2024, compared to 2.54 times at December 31, 2023. This is towards the top of our target range of 2 to 3 times for net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Return on invested capital Return on invested capital was 14.1%, compared to 13.9% in 2023. This improvement reflects a lower base of average invested capital, mainly linked to working capital, and a reduction in restructuring costs. Minority participations In late 2024, we established Nestl\\xE9 Equity Holdings to consolidate ownership of many of our minority participations, enhancing governance and allowing for a more consistent and efficient approach to managing these interests.

Organic sales growth of -0.5% reflects mixed delivery across the portfolio, in the context of a challenging consumer environment. We delivered RIG-led positive organic growth in approximately two-thirds of the business by sales. This was offset by weak performance in frozen food and coffee creamers. Turnaround plans are underway in both businesses. In Zone North America, UTOP margin increased modestly, which was the result of an improvement in gross profit margin and a step-up in growth investments. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was -0.5%, with -0.8% RIG and 0.4% pricing. Pricing was     negative in H2, driven by competitive dynamics in PetCare and price     adjustments in frozen food and coffee creamers.   * Reported sales decreased by 2.5% to CHF 25.3 billion, including a -2.0%     impact from foreign exchange movements and -0.1% from net divestitures.   * Market share gains were achieved in coffee, while we lost market share in     frozen pizza and coffee creamers.   * UTOP margin increased by 10 bps to 22.3%. Gross profit margin expanded,     supported by pricing, price pack architecture and mix management, and     structural cost control was strong. Advertising and marketing investment was     increased significantly to support future growth. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * PetCare was the largest growth contributor, with low single-digit growth     driven by premium brands, particularly in the cat and therapeutic diets     segments.   * Confectionery grew at a double-digit pace, driven by Tollhouse baking     products and pricing actions particularly in the second half of the year.   * Beverages (including coffee and coffee creamers) delivered positive growth     overall, with new product launches supporting continued strong momentum for     Nescaf\\xE9 and Starbucks, offsetting a decrease in Coffee mate.   * Infant Nutrition saw a sales decrease, with a decline in Gerber in the     context of a category slowdown in baby food.   * Frozen food posted negative growth, primarily reflecting the impact of price     competition in pizza and the winding down of the frozen meals business in     Canada. Zone Europe In Zone Europe, our sales growth was broad-based, with improved market share trends in a number of categories. Growth was mainly pricing led, reflecting the inflationary environment for coffee and confectionery, supported by positive RIG in coffee and PetCare. Growth was impacted by temporary delistings in the third quarter, but recovered in the fourth quarter, driven by coffee and confectionery. UTOP margin increased, with improved gross profit margin and portfolio optimization helping fund the step-up in growth investment. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 3.3%, comprising 0.8% RIG and 2.5% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 1.0% to CHF 18.9 billion, including -2.5% impact     from foreign exchange movements and -1.9% from net divestitures.   * Market share gains were achieved in coffee and PetCare, with losses in     confectionery and water.   * UTOP margin increased by 50 basis points to 16.9%, driven by strong gross     profit margin improvement and supported by portfolio optimization. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\\xE9 soluble coffee and     Starbucks products.   * Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and     key local brands.   * PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, led by Purina ONE, Gourmet and     ProPlan.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional achieved mid single-digit growth, driven by beverage     solutions.   * Water saw low single-digit growth, impacted by supply constraints in the     second half of the year.   * Infant Nutrition posted negative growth, reflecting a category slowdown. Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa We achieved solid organic sales growth in Zone AOA, with most categories and regions reporting positive RIG. We improved market share trends, particularly for key global brands like KitKat, reignited growth momentum in PetCare and significantly stepped up e-commerce growth. Several macroeconomic headwinds weighed on growth, with consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions persisting throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we took action to reduce customer inventories in our infant nutrition and dairy categories. For the year, UTOP margin declined, driven by increased investment in advertising and marketing. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 3.4%, with 0.6% RIG and 2.8% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 4.1% to CHF 16.8 billion, strongly impacted by     foreign exchange movements, which reduced sales by 7.5%.   * Key markets driving growth were Central and West Africa, the Middle East and     North Africa, and the Philippines.   * Key market share developments were gains in PetCare and losses in dairy and     culinary.   * UTOP margin decreased by 20 basis points to 23.3%, driven by increased     investment in advertising and marketing. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\\xE9 soluble and ready-     to-drink offerings.   * Culinary delivered high single-digit growth fueled by strong sales momentum     for Maggi.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional achieved high single-digit growth, with strong     contributions from most geographies and categories.   * Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and     supported by new product launches.   * PetCare achieved high single-digit growth, led by key brands Felix and     Purina ONE.   * Infant Nutrition posted low single-digit growth following actions to reduce     customer inventories.   * Dairy saw a sales decline, impacted by the introduction of a sales tax in     Pakistan as well as actions to reduce customer inventories and reshape the     portfolio. Zone Latin America Sales growth in Zone Latin America was pricing-led growth, with RIG declining slightly. During the year, consumer demand softened and financial pressure on customers increased in several markets due to higher borrowing costs. These headwinds led to actions to reduce customer inventories, which weighed on RIG in Q3. Improved growth in Q4 was driven by confectionery and coffee, with new price increase measures being taken in both categories. UTOP margin for the year declined due to increased investments in growth as well as higher costs linked to the acquisition of the Grupo CRM confectionery business. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 2.5%, with -0.3% RIG and 2.7% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 2.2% to CHF 11.9 billion, with a negative impact     of 4.9% from foreign exchange movements.   * Key markets driving growth were Brazil and Mexico; weaker performance in     smaller markets such as Peru and Colombia.   * Market share developments included gains in portioned coffee and culinary,     with losses in dairy and soluble coffee.   * UTOP margin decreased by 30 basis points to 20.4%. The reduction follows     increased advertising and marketing investments. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Confectionery delivered high single-digit growth, driven by key local     brands, particularly Garoto, and supported by new product launches in     chocobakery.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional grew at a double-digit pace, underpinned by customer     acquisition.   * Coffee saw mid single-digit growth, led by Nescaf\\xE9, with strong growth for     Nescaf\\xE9 Dolce Gusto.   * Culinary reported low single-digit growth supported by strong sales momentum     for Maggi.   * PetCare posted flat growth, supported by Felix and Friskies.   * Infant Nutrition and dairy reported sales declines as robust demand for NAN     infant formula was more than offset by a sales decline in Nido. Zone Greater China In Zone Greater China, growth was underpinned by positive RIG delivery in every quarter despite soft consumer demand and intense price competition in several categories. This performance was achieved by driving faster innovation in key categories and adapting route-to-market and channel strategies to capture new growth opportunities. The decline in UTOP margin reflects increased commodity costs and higher growth investments. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 2.1%, with 4.3% RIG and -2.1% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 1.3% to CHF 5.0 billion, as foreign exchange     reduced sales by 3.5%.   * Market share developments included gains in Infant Nutrition and     confectionery, with losses in culinary and dairy.   * UTOP margin decreased by 40 basis points to 16.1%, reflecting higher input     costs and increased advertising and marketing investments. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Infant Nutrition was the largest contributor to organic growth, with high     single-digit growth, driven by NAN and supported by improved sales momentum     for illuma.   * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by distribution expansion and     new innovations, particularly in Nescaf\\xE9 ready-to-drink offerings.   * Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, with solid growth for Hsu Fu     Chi and Shark Wafer, supported by new product launches and e-commerce     growth.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional delivered low single-digit growth in challenging market     conditions, while culinary and dairy-related categories reported negative     growth. Nestl\\xE9 Health Science Nestl\\xE9 Health Science delivered a significant step-up in growth and margin in 2024, with all segments contributing to the improved performance. Organic growth recovered through the year, with double-digit growth in the second half. A key driver of the improved performance was the resolution of supply constraints for our U.S. vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business. UTOP margin increased strongly, driven by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 6.2%, with 5.5% RIG and 0.7% pricing.   * Reported sales increased by 3.7% to CHF 6.7 billion, including a foreign     exchange impact reducing sales by -2.8%.   * Market share increased in Medical Nutrition and stabilized in VMS after     declining in the second half of 2023.   * UTOP margin improved by 200 basis points to 14.0%. The increase was driven     by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies. Key sales growth drivers   * By geography, North America posted mid single-digit growth, Europe delivered     double-digit growth and other regions combined saw positive growth.   * VMS achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second     half and an improvement in market share trends.   * Active Nutrition posted mid single-digit growth, supported by strong     momentum for Orgain, Vital Proteins and healthy aging products.   * Medical Nutrition delivered double-digit growth, with continued market share     gains. Growth was driven by strong sales momentum for adult medical care     products, particularly Peptamen and Resource, as well as Vitaflo. Sales for     gastrointestinal products continued to grow at a double-digit rate. Nespresso Nespresso delivered solid RIG-led growth, driven by the continued rollout of Vertuo, particularly in the U.S. and continued good growth in out-of-home channels. Q4 saw the highest quarterly growth of the year, supported by strong seasonal campaigns and the impact of pricing actions. UTOP margin decreased as we invested behind the expansion of Vertuo and structural costs increased. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 2.2%, with 1.6% RIG and 0.6% pricing.   * Reported sales increased by 0.1% to CHF 6.4 billion, including -2.4% impact     from foreign exchange movements.   * We achieved market share gains in the U.S., but lost some share in Europe.   * UTOP margin was down 30 bps to 20.0%, driven by increased advertising and     marketing investments as well as higher structural costs. Key sales growth drivers   * By geography, sales in North America grew at a mid single-digit rate with     continued market share gains. In Europe, sales posted close to flat growth.   * By system, growth was driven by the Vertuo system, with strong sales     momentum across all geographies. Sales for out-of-home channels grew at a     mid single-digit rate backed by the continued rollout of the Momento system.

In India, they are facing a triple attack. The prices they get are very low, so masses are stuck in poverty. Food-price inflation is a hot topic in India, so the government wants to depress prices. Its response is therefore to import cheap food. As a result, farm-gate prices don't rise, leaving the farmers worse off. At the same time, farmers are exposed to increasing - and increasingly worse - extreme weather events. Some are hit hard by crop losses. But when poor harvests increase food prices, yet more cheap food is imported. This distortion is possible due to the global trade system, which allows India to import agricultural commodities that are subsidised by other governments. This system rewards industrial-scale farming with massive inputs, and the result is that smallholders are squeezed and cannot prosper. At the same time, industrial-scale farming is harming the climate and thus compounding the extreme-weather risks.</p><p>So, what needs to happen?</p><p>We need to turn the global agriculture system upside down. It must become less input intensive, more rewarding and less risky for farmers. The supposedly modern farming system that you have in Europe, North America and other places is plainly unsustainable. It is harming the climate and depleting biodiversity. India is not so far at that point. EU subsidies are atrocious. You have made farmers depend on state aid, but only the largest farms really thrive. Even in Europe, smaller ones are being crowded out. Only the big farms get enough subsidies to thrive. When the EU decided to modify the system to make it less environmentally damaging, all farmers rose up in protest because they were set to lose money. The reforms were half-hearted to begin with, and now your policymakers have further slowed them down.</p><p>In what sense were reforms half-hearted?</p><p>Well, consider the organic sector as an example. EU policies have created a high-cost niche market for prosperous consumers. Low-income households cannot afford those goods. For farmers too, however, organic production basically means higher costs. To some extent, additional subsidies cover them, but organic farming still requires more labour and is more expensive. Pesticides are comparatively cheap if you consider how much work weeding requires. All in all, the subsidy system is still geared to maximising high-input production on large land holdings. That benefits the agrichemical industry as well as the food-processing multinationals, which like homogenous commodities.</p><p>So, we need regenerative agriculture instead.</p><p>Yes, we do, but the trouble is that multinationals keep hijacking terms like this. They modify their destructive patterns slightly and then claim they are now regenerative. The global food system is incredibly destructive. It is not only exacerbating the global environmental crisis, but also compounding poverty in the rural areas of emerging markets and developing countries because farms there become uncompetitive in view of heavily subsidised products from more prosperous nations.</p><p>Who can make change happen?</p><p>Change is happening where farmers see the benefits of taking a different approach and then opt for more sustainable practices.</p><p>My impression is that this is happening mainly on subsistence farms, which are highly diversified, but hardly allow families to produce enough goods to sell, so they stay trapped in poverty.</p><p>No, I don't agree. I am thinking of things like the Andhra Pradesh Community Managed Natural Farming programme. Andhra Pradesh is a state in South India, and the programme is based on science. It is designed to invest in soil capacities in order to make farms more productive. The results are excellent. </p><p>Farm productivity has stayed the same, but farmers' returns have improved. We need this kind of project to take off in many places. Eco-friendly approaches must reduce farmers' costs and allow their financial situation to improve.</p><p>What would that mean in terms of consumer choices?</p><p>It may surprise you, but as an Indian environmentalist I am not advocating vegetarianism or veganism. Both are quite popular in our country which has a long tradition of vegetarianism. However, we need to consider farmers' livelihoods. In this regard, cows are very important in India. The farmers need the milk, the dung and the meat. India is the world's largest milk producer, but we do not have huge ranches. Typically, a farming family will have one or two cattle and 10 at most. Without these animals, they would be even poorer, so it wouldn't help them if everyone became vegetarian in India.</p><p>But the international scenario is totally different.</p><p>Yes, indeed. At the global level, meat production has become very destructive. It is a driver of deforestation. Huge holdings use antibiotics not to cure, but to prevent diseases - and the result is an increase of drug-resistances, and that can make the treatment of human diseases unviable too. Ranches are using growth hormones and consuming enormous amounts of fodder, especially maize and soya. </p><p>Indeed, humankind is now using more land to grow animal feed than to grow food for human beings. No doubt, high-income countries are consuming too much meat, thus setting the wrong example internationally. But let me emphasise, the question is not do we eat meat at all, but how is the meat that we eat produced. Human diets must include protein, and meat is protein rich. If you want to become vegetarian for personal reasons, that is your choice, and your government shouldn't force it on you. What governments must do, however, is regulate agriculture businesses in ways that prevent environmental harm.</p><p>The topic of what people should and should not eat is very controversial.</p><p>Yes, I know. Your Green party in Germany once fared poorly in elections because it had spoken out in favour of one vegetarian day per week in company canteens. As far as I know, right-wing populists are now agitating for the right to eat meat as though that right was under threat. They deny that consuming too much meat is unhealthy, not only for an individual human being, but for the planet as a whole. We only have one planet, and we must look at diets from the eco-perspective.</p><p>What is your take on sugar?</p><p>I would say it is the new tobacco. Medical science shows that eating too much of it has serious health impacts, but the major food-processing industries do not want people to be aware of it. In fact, salt and fat should be seen in the same light. Consumers should be informed precisely of just how much sugar, salt and fat they can eat and at what point they start putting their health at risk. They should be told that, if they drink this large Coca-Cola bottle, that will be their sugar quota for three days, and if they have this helping of Maggi noodles along with it, that will be their salt quota for one day. Unfortunately, the lobbying power of food multinationals is great, and they oppose appropriate labelling. Therefore, people don't get this kind of information in many countries. That is a tragedy because people do make changes once they really understand the issues.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["For farmers too, however, organic production basically means higher costs.

Sales for the third    quarter 2024 were $6.8 billion, flat compared to the prior year    period (up 4 percent at CER). In Q3 2024, EBITDA more than    doubled to $0.7 billion (159% at CER), compared to a lower    baseline in Q3 2023.      Sales for the first nine months of 2024 were $21.4 billion, down    $3.0 billion or 12 percent year-on-year, compared to a strong    first nine months in 2023. Sales were down 9 percent at constant    exchange rates (CER).      EBITDA for the first nine months of the year was $2.7 billion, 23    percent lower (-12% at CER) year-on-year. The Group's EBITDA    margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 12.9 percent, down    1.7 percentage points compared to 14.6 percent in the same period    last year.      Adverse weather conditions across key markets affected    applications of crop protection products. Sustained price    pressure, particularly in the commoditized segments of the crop    protection portfolio (and notably in Latin America), and reduced    grower profitability had an impact on demand. Crop commodity    prices have continued to decline, reducing farmer income and    hampering demand for input materials.      The crop protection market is showing initial signs of recovery    with channel inventories now closer to normal levels. Syngenta    Group expects the market to further recover after the first half    of 2025 with a market also less impacted by lower crop prices and    overcapacity.      Syngenta Group has continued to implement further initiatives to    drive profitability improvements, streamlining operations and    improving cash flow, including optimizing working capital.

At a    constant exchange rate sales were up 3 percent in the quarter.    Biologicals delivered further growth. Customer buying behavior is    shifting more towards a pre-pandemic pattern, which means    products are being ordered closer to the time of application than    in previous years where products were ordered earlier to account    for extended delivery times.      ADAMA experienced a weaker Q3 of 2024, with a sales decrease of    10 percent amid a challenging environment for suppliers of    post-patent active ingredients. Despite the decline in sales,    ADAMA successfully improved its margins thanks to its ongoing    business improvements and transformation plan.      The Seeds business delivered 3 percent year-on-year sales growth    in the third quarter of 2024 (4% at CER). Growth was partially    offset by lower sales in Argentina where the market was affected    by weather and disease pressure.      In Q3 2024, Syngenta Group China sales increased 11 percent    compared to the same period last year. Sales growth was boosted    by the market introduction of new seeds varieties and a strong    growth momentum for biologicals. In the first nine months of the    year, sales declined 10 percent due to price headwinds in active    ingredients and the proactive reduction of low-margin business.      The Group will continue to leverage its industry-leading R&amp;D    pipeline for sustainable innovation and focus on expanding its    digital platforms to help growers manage weather changes and make    better, data-based decisions.

This calls for increasing agricultural productivity which is traditionally defined as producing more output (harvest) with the same input (area, soil, capital, labour) or the same output with less input. Economists refer to this as 'total factor productivity' (TFP), a widely employed metric for comparing agricultural efficiency among nations and measuring progress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, TFP fails to consider the long-term effects of current agricultural practices on soil, biodiversity, health and people. This is a massive flaw, as increasing short-term productivity may jeopardise conditions for future productivity in many ways. For example, the current use of intensive tilling methods can harm the soil; fertilisers may cause health issues; and the humus layer may deteriorate due to insufficient regeneration periods. By neglecting these concerns, TFP presents an incomplete picture.</p><p>For example, in the 1960s, India initiated the 'green revolution' in response to two famines. Geneticist M. S. Swaminathan spearheaded this effort, introducing high-yielding wheat and rice varieties in the western region of Punjab. This aimed to boost productivity, resulting in record-high output. India's 'green revolution' is praised for successfully feeding the growing population and reducing rural poverty.</p><p>Negative consequences of India's green revolution Decades later, however, the adverse effects are increasingly evident. Punjab, once known as the 'land of five rivers' is projected to transform into a desert within 25 years due to the water-intensive cultivation of rice. Continued soil degradation, declining health and reduced seed variety pose persistent challenges. Moreover, the climate crisis is making wet and dry seasons less predictable.</p><p>Severe social consequences ensued too. Farmers are forced to buy expensive genetically modified seeds and fertilisers from major corporations to grow crops on depleted soil. As a result, many of them have incurred substantial debts, leading to tens of thousands of suicides every year. Additionally, Punjab has gained notoriety as India's 'cancer capital' due to the widespread use of hazardous agrochemicals.</p><p>Despite all this, metrics such as TFP suggest that India's productivity increased following the green revolution. They focus on short-term economic output rather than long-term net gain for the planet and people and fail to take into account potential long-term destruction. However, if agricultural practices undermine the sustained productivity of nature or people, hindering people's ability to lead fulfilled and healthy lives, they should not be labelled as productive.</p><p>Productivity versus reproductivity</p><p>There is a growing consensus that a shift in perspective on agricultural productivity is necessary. Instead of focusing solely on short-term surpluses, we should assess how agricultural practices can be reproduced in the future. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the term 'reproductivity' rather than 'productivity'.</p><p>The conversation around agricultural productivity is shifting towards more sustainability. There is a growing interest in re-designing agricultural systems in the name of agroecology, permaculture, agroforestry and regenerative agriculture. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on involving local communities in decision-making processes.</p><p>Measuring ecological and social sustainability</p><p>The challenging question is how to measure agricultural (re)productivity, regenerativity or sustainability. Obviously, it requires a much broader time frame, but quantifying long-term consequences is difficult due to the inaccuracy of current climate models. The complexity increases when considering long-term ecological and socio-economic effects.</p><p>However, farmers adopting more sustainable methods need to monitor progress. Data providers use modern technology to quantify soil functional biodiversity and the potential to store water and carbon. While quantifying soil biodiversity is rather complex, measuring above-ground biodiversity effects is even more difficult. It requires various data points, such as satellite data, bio-acoustics and samples from environmental DNA (eDNA). Making assumptions about future developments is also necessary.</p><p>Financing is crucial</p><p>Quantifying sustainable agriculture is essential for attracting financial rewards from political schemes, customers and investors. This is crucial because agricultural (re)productivity needs to be sustainable regarding finance too. Simply telling a farmer that a change in practices will start paying out in ten years, but will decrease yields for the next five years, is not a compelling argument without schemes guaranteeing compensation in the meantime.</p><p>Recent developments in the debate on payments for ecosystem services provide hope for innovative rewards for farmers adopting reproductive practices. However, we are still at the very beginning of a new productivity regime, and there is much work ahead. We can start by redefining India's green revolution not merely as a period of productivity gain but as a lesson on how not to measure agricultural productivity in the future.</p><p>Literature</p><p>Schragmann, H., 2024: Produktivit\u00e4t neu denken.

These rights are accessible    through its innovation collaboration platform Shoots by Syngenta.     The rights to certain intellectual property are related to    optimized CRISPR-Cas12a as well as to gene-editing enabled    breeding tools. Through CRISPR gene-editing, it is possible to    deliver an improved plant that does not include DNA from a    different species - more quickly and efficiently than otherwise    possible in nature or through conventional breeding methods.     \"The power of CRISPR technology has incredible potential to    enable crop innovation to deliver value to farmers,\" says Gusui    Wu, Head of Global Seeds Research at Syngenta. \"The increased use    of CRISPR in agriculture can transform the way we approach plant    breeding, accelerating the discovery and deployment of    innovations that provide growers more productive and resilient    crops. We are inviting universities and academic institutions    from around the world to help us drive innovation to improve the    sustainability of agriculture.\"     As a leader in this wave of technological innovation, Syngenta    scientists have been continuously innovating to improve    CRISPR-Cas genome editing technologies. Syngenta's scientists    have engineered CRISPR Cas12a to increase both its efficiency as    well as utility, significantly optimizing it as a tool for crop    improvement.     Syngenta has long been open to sharing technology with public and    private entities, enabling straightforward, quick, and easy    access to its proprietary technologies for academic and    non-profit research use. One example is Syngenta's vegetable    licensing platform, which allows breeding companies and academic    institutes to access and breed with Syngenta germplasm.     The Shoots by Syngenta global innovation collaboration platform    was created in 2023 with a goal to create partnerships aimed at    finding solutions to some of the most complex challenges in food    and agriculture. It brings together the external innovation    ecosystem - comprising academics, research institutes, and other    entities - together with Syngenta's global network of more than    6,000 scientists, to develop solutions that mitigate climate    change, enhance biodiversity, and better serve smallholder as    well as large-scale farmers.

Sales for the first quarter 2024 were $7.4    billion, down $1.8 billion or 20 percent (-18% at CER), compared    to a strong first quarter 2023. First quarter 2024 EBITDA    decreased 34 percent (-26% at CER) from prior year to $1.2    billion.     Sales in the first quarter of 2024 continued to be impacted by    industry-wide channel destocking in Crop Protection as    distributors and retailers further reduced inventories in    response to the pressure to lower working capital in the higher    interest rate environment.     Given the current market environment, the Group remained focused    on measures to improve operational efficiency and productivity to    offset lower volumes and prices. EBITDA margin for the Group was    16.7 percent versus 20.2 percent in the first quarter 2023.

ADAMA also recorded a weaker first quarter compared to Q1 2023 in    a challenging environment for suppliers of post patent active    ingredients, with the business downturn in Asia Pacific    (excluding China) and Europe greatly affecting the comparison.     Syngenta Seeds overall was 8 percent lower than in the first    quarter last year but showed strong growth in Vegetables Seeds,    Flowers and in China.     Syngenta Group China saw a sales decline of 18 percent versus    last year's record first quarter. Its Seeds business maintained    its growth and the branded formulation crop protection business    showed further growth on the back of recently launched products.    The sales decline was partially offset by a better business mix    and cost reductions.

The product received an    emergency exemption from the US Environmental Protection Agency    following the pressing need for a sugar beet herbicide solution.     Syngenta Seeds     First quarter sales of Syngenta Seeds were $1.4 billion, 8    percent lower, with sales and earnings growth in China and    Vegetables and Flowers offsetting particularly lower sales in    Asia, the Middle East and Africa.

In the first quarter of 2024, Syngenta completed the acquisition    of Dafeng Seed in China, greatly enhancing its corn portfolio. In    Brazil, Syngenta Seeds Field Crops announced the acceleration of    its franchise model, thereby creating a more direct,    demand-generating presence in the field with farmers. In Europe,    the company launched the first Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus    resistant barley hybrid, helping farmers to control the disease    without the need for neonic seed treatments.     Syngenta Vegetable Seeds inaugurated an expanded R&amp;D facility in    El Ejido, Spain, and a new state-of-the-art Seed Health Lab in    Hyderabad, India.

Syngenta Group China     Syngenta Group China sales were $2.7 billion, 18 percent lower.    The robust growth in branded formulations, seeds, and    bio-fertilizers was offset by a significant year-on-year price    decline and a strategic scaling back of grain trading operations.     Sales of Seeds grew 25 percent. Sales of Branded Formulation were    3 percent higher. Sinofert sales were 4 percent lower. Yangnong    Chemical was 32 percent lower.

In 2013,    Syngenta was one of the first companies in the industry to launch    a comprehensive sustainability plan. The \"Good Growth Plan\"    successfully served as the organization's sustainability compass.     The new priorities place sustainability at the core of the    company's strategy and demonstrate continued commitment to    sustainable innovation. This approach and clear targets help    integrate sustainability on a strategic and operational level    whilst creating long-term value:       * Priority 1: \"Higher yields, lower impact\" through the        acceleration of crop productivity in the agricultural sector,        while reducing the impact on the planet through more        sustainable technologies.      * Priority 2: \"Regenerate soil and nature\" by enabling the        adoption of regenerative agriculture practices to help        farmers improve productivity, soil health, biodiversity and        climate.      * Priority 3: \"Improve rural prosperity\" by focusing on the        prosperity of low-income and under-served farmers and their        access to inputs, knowledge, finance and markets.      * Priority 4: \"Sustainable operations\" by the means of reducing        the environmental impact of Syngenta Group's own operations        and the supply chain; strengthening a diverse and inclusive        culture and ensuring the health and safety of its employees.     The new priorities leverage the power of innovation, guide    investments and collaboration as well as add a new level of    transparency through a Portfolio Sustainability Framework (PSF).    To find out more about Syngenta Group's new sustainability    priorities, the specific targets and the PSF, please visit the    website Sustainability Priorities.     Today Syngenta Group also published the Syngenta Group and    Syngenta AG ESG reports for the year ended 31 December 2023.      Endnotes     For further information, see the reporting of financial results    for ADAMA Ltd. (SHE: 000553), Sinofert Holdings (SEHK: 0297),    Winall Hi-tech Seed (SHE: 300087), Yangnong Chemical (SHA:    600486) and Syngenta AG.     Unless otherwise mentioned, comparisons are to the same period in    2023. Certain amounts, including components of change (%), may    not add up due to rounding. The results presented in this release    are unaudited and a consolidation of the business units in the    Syngenta Group which includes Syngenta AG, Syngenta Group China,    ADAMA Ltd., Sinofert Holdings, Winall Hi-tech Seed and Yangnong    Chemical.     As a change to previous reporting, Yangnong Chemical sales have    been fully included within the Syngenta Group China results,    including exports, rather than partially appended in the Group's    Crop Protection units as previously presented. In addition, the    regional split of Syngenta Crop Protection, Syngenta Seeds, and    the sub business unit split of Syngenta Group China have been    amended to reflect a revised management structure and operating    model within these units. Comparative figures for 2023 have been    amended to reflect these changes on a consistent basis; total    sales are unchanged.     Results in this report from one period to another period are,    where appropriate, compared using constant exchange rates (CER).    To present that information, current period results for entities    reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into    US dollars at the prior period's exchange rates, rather than at    the exchange rates for the current year. The CER presentation    indicates the business performance before taking into account    currency exchange fluctuations.     EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and EBITDA as defined by Syngenta    Group may not be comparable to similarly described measures at    other companies. Syngenta Group has defined EBITDA as earnings    before interest, tax, non-controlling interests, depreciation,    amortization, restructuring and impairment. Information    concerning EBITDA has been included as it is used by management    and by investors as a supplementary measure of operating    performance. Syngenta Group excludes restructuring and impairment    from EBITDA to focus on results excluding items affecting    comparability from one period to the next.     EBITDA as used in this press release excludes one-time events;    other documents may treat this as an underlying or adjusted    EBITDA. EBITDA excludes other one-off or non-cash/non-operational    items that do not impact the ongoing performance of the business,    as well as the impact of a time-bound, Group launch long-term    incentive scheme for leadership.

Following its recent    registration in Great Britain, farmers in more than 55 countries    globally are now able to access this powerful fungicide, with    strong sales across continents reflecting farmer demand for    effective control of a broad range of crop diseases. The company    is on track to achieve one billion US dollars in sales of    products containing ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology, marking the first time    its active ingredient achieves this milestone in only eight    years.     \"ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology is a game-changer for modern agriculture    and enables farmers to grow crops more sustainably,\" said Ioana    Tudor, Global Head of Marketing at Syngenta Crop Protection. \"It    represents a significant milestone in our efforts to secure high    yields with low impact to the planet and is exciting because of    its high levels of consistency and effectiveness. We're very    proud that our innovation is delivering such impact.\"     Worldwide, farmers lose an estimated 10-23 percent of their crops    to fungal diseases each year. An additional 10-20 percent is lost    post-harvest. In the top five most important calorie crops -    rice, wheat, corn, soybeans and potatoes - fungal infections have    been estimated to cause yield losses that could feed at least 600    million people every day for a year.     ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology offers a new solution that effectively    fights fusarium head blight in wheat, which produces mycotoxins    that contaminate harvests and threaten human and animal health.    In addition, it offers a step-change in performance against a    wide spectrum of other important diseases, such as septoria in    wheat and net blotch in barley. ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology is    registered in more than 100 crops including corn, soybean,    peanuts, vegetables, potatoes, grapes, tomatoes and fruit crops.     ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology embodies Syngenta's commitment to    sustainable innovation, core to its new Group-wide sustainability    priorities announced in April. The effectiveness and long-lasting    activity of the^technology enable low use rates and potentially    fewer sprays especially in leaf spot diseases, while safeguarding    beneficial organisms. It is also an important tool for resistance    management. The technology works by inhibiting the activity of an    enzyme that is essential for fungal respiration, starving the    fungi from the energy they need to survive. It is designed to    adhere to the plant surface and to penetrate rapidly through the    leaf surface - creating a reservoir of active ingredient in the    waxy layer of the plant tissue that enables even distribution and    long-lasting protection as the plant grows.     The technology further highlights Syngenta's success with the    SDHI (Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) mode of action and the    company's ability to effectively design active ingredients that    address various farmer challenges. Following its first SDHI seed    treatment sedaxane, Syngenta launched its SDHI fungicide    isopyrazam which transformed farmers' ability to control sheath    blight in rice, and later SOLATENOL^\\xAE technology to protect crops    against septoria and rusts. In Brazil, SOLATENOL^\\xAE technology is    today regarded as crucial in farmers' fight against soybean pod    anomaly - a new fungal disease which spread within just three    years to 12 states across the country since it was first    identified.     Beyond innovation in research and development, Syngenta's success    is underpinned by its commitment to invest in cutting-edge    manufacturing operations. Strong global demand has fueled    investments aimed at increasing the efficiency of manufacturing    of ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology. These set the foundation for the    production of a growing portfolio of formulations containing    ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology that target specific grower needs in    different markets.     The latest Syngenta innovation in the SDHI family is TYMIRIUM^\\xAE    technology, which was launched globally in 2022. In addition to    protecting crops against key fungal diseases, TYMIRIUM^\\xAE    technology provides broad-spectrum protection against    plant-parasitic nematodes that reduce global crop yield by an    estimated 12 percent a year.

In North and South America, it accounts for the vast majority of farms. Agricultural areas there typically feature farms geared to mass production, with thousands of animals kept indoors and sprawling mono\u00adcultures maintained by chemicals. Even among development policymakers, there are still some who advocate this method as a model for agriculture in Africa or Latin America - although it should be common knowledge by now that industrial agriculture is harmful to the environment, the climate and human health.</p><p>But one of the main arguments still rolled out is that industrial agriculture is the only way to feed the growing world population. The documentary 'Kiss the ground' dispels this myth once and for all. The filmmakers point out that industrial agriculture destroys valuable humus, which acts as a natural carbon sink. In the long run, they explain, that leads to dead soil - soil that can only produce a crop with the help of agricultural chemicals.</p><p>The devastating consequences are already apparent. Two-thirds of the Earth's land area has already turned into desert. Although the film presents horrifying images of dry, dusty fields and parched land, its message is by no means all doom and gloom. It gives plenty of hope - and astonishes the viewer. Desertification can be reversed by a different approach to farming: regenerative agriculture. The film shows examples in many parts of the world where it has worked. The most impressive involves a programme in China where an area the size of Belgium has been regenerated.</p><p>Footage from 1994 shows a hilly desert-like landscape and a desperately poor local population with precious little to eat and no educational opportunities for their children. Within 15 years, the area was transformed into a verdant landscape with a huge diversity of plants and trees. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and local communities can now live on the crops they grow. And - the film points out - their children today attend the best universities in the country.</p><p>According to the filmmakers, all this is possible with the help of regenerative agriculture. The approach is based on a set of four principles:</p><p>no tilling to avoid erosion,</p><p>maintenance of a permanent green cover of diverse plants and trees,</p><p>green manuring, using cover crops that are incorporated into the soil as shallowly as possible and as deeply as necessary to 'feed' soil life and 'rejuvenate' the substrate, and</p><p>controlled grazing by hoofed animals, because grazing is vital to maintain and preserve grasses.</p><p>Advocates claim that regenerative agriculture restores the microbial processes - and thus the life - in the soil that tilling and chemicals destroyed. The soil is restored to health. Crops grown in it have a high nutrient content. Another fantastic effect, according to the makers of 'Kiss the ground', is that regenerative farming takes CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it in soil and vegetation. This makes it possible, they say, to stop global warming within a relatively short time and even start cooling the climate down again within around 20 years. Climate activists also support the regenerative approach - which, among other things, is part of 'Drawdown', a project founded by American environmentalist Paul Hawken to identify and promote the most substantive carbon-reduction solutions.</p><p>In typical American style, the documentary 'Kiss the ground' couches its message in simple, emotive language - which may not appeal to all viewers. But this fact - and the choice of well-known US actor Woody Harrelson as narrator - will help the filmmakers reach a broad and perhaps less aware audience. And that is absolutely necessary and important.</p><p>Film</p><p>Kiss the ground, 2020, USA, directed by Rebecca Harrell Tickell and Joshua Tickell.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://kissthegroundmovie.com\">https://kissthegroundmovie.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://kisstheground.comA\">https://kisstheground.comA</url></p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["Regenerative agriculture means fields with a wide variety of plants and trees. \u00a9 Big Picture RanchRegenerative agriculture means fields with a wide variety of plants and trees.

Syngenta is the only company within the    agricultural sector to be included in the latest EPA's National    Top 100 List of top users of green power from the Green Power    Partnership.      This recognition marks the latest milestone in the company's    actions to decarbonize its operations globally. Dr. Tom Gray,    Head of Active Ingredient Strategy and Operations at Syngenta    Group, said: \"We are proud to be recognized by the U.S.    Environmental Protection Agency for being a leader in the green    power market. The implementation of our global strategy for    sourcing renewable electricity is well underway, and we are    working hard to decarbonize further and improve the energy    efficiency of our operations. We are also collaborating closely    with our partners throughout our global supply chain to decrease    our entire carbon footprint.\"      The St. Gabriel production site is one of Syngenta's global    manufacturing centers of excellence equipped to handle highly    complex processes and meet the most stringent production and    quality standards. The site consumes more than 150 million kWh of    energy annually - equivalent to the annual electricity use of    14,000 homes in the country. Through the purchase of Renewable    Energy Certificates, Syngenta's site demonstrates that it sources    100 percent of its electrical energy from renewable sources such    as wind and solar - fully offsetting its electricity consumption    from fossil fuel-based sources.      Program Manager of EPA's Green Power Partnership James    Critchfield said: \"This list of the largest users of green power    across the nation is proof that good business practices can also    benefit the environment. EPA applauds the leading organizations    in the Green Power Partnership's Top Partner Rankings for their    notable commitment to expanding their use of green power and    protecting the environment.\"      Globally, Syngenta has also invested significantly at its other    production sites, as part of its published commitment to reduce    carbon emissions by 2030. In Switzerland, Syngenta's production    site in Monthey uses hydropower for a sizeable portion of the    site's electricity needs and generates the equivalent of half its    steam consumption by recovering heat from household waste    incineration. In 2023, Syngenta's Monthey site was awarded the    \"Go Carbon Free\" label by the Carbon Free Valais Foundation, in    recognition of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.      In Brazil, Syngenta's R&amp;D and manufacturing sites for its crop    protection and seeds businesses - also source 100 percent of    their electricity needs from renewable sources. This was achieved    alongside comprehensive efforts aimed at reducing water    consumption and waste generation, and at long-term net-zero    energy sourcing.      In China, the Kunshan manufacturing site emerged as Syngenta    Group China's first carbon-neutral facility after Beijing Green    Exchange, a platform for carbon emission trading in China,    awarded it in July for fully offsetting its carbon emissions    generated from its operations. The site is implementing    continuous improvements such as real-time monitoring of    electricity usage, alongside upgrading equipment to be more    energy efficient.      \"Syngenta is fully committed to a long-term journey to reduce    greenhouse gas emissions in the running of our operations,\" said    Gray. \"This is a key focus area for us, even as we drive    innovation to enable farmers to adapt to climate change and    increase the sustainability of agriculture. To this end, we have    invested in building an internal function focused solely on    Sustainable Operations, which will drive these and other    initiatives designed to reduce both our own emissions and those    of our value chain.\"      About Syngenta Group     Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural    technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.    With more than 59,000 employees, operating in more than 100    countries, the company strives to transform agriculture with    science-driven, technological innovations to deliver high    productivity and high-quality food while fighting climate change    and restore nature.

These collaborations, which connect    expertise across industries and sectors, are aimed at making    possible novel solutions to agricultural challenges more quickly    and efficiently.     Two collaborations - with IBM Research and with US    biotech Maxygen - brought their respective pioneering approaches    in data-based predictions modelling, and in the directed    evolution of proteins more commonly leveraged in the    pharmaceutical industry, together with Syngenta's world-leading    agricultural research and proprietary data sets.     \"Helping growers sustainably feed a rapidly growing human    population requires a strong collaboration focus, not just across    agriculture but across industries,\" said Gusui Wu, Global Head of    Seeds Research. \"Collaboration is at the heart of how our    scientists approach innovation every day. It is embedded in our    scientific culture, and we are continually seeking out different    technologies, solutions, and partners to help us better serve    farmers.\"      IBM Research and Syngenta accelerate optimization of chemical    compound synthesis with language models.     Syngenta Group, in collaboration with IBM Research, has enhanced    productivity in chemical synthesis using IBM-RXN - a software    developed to enable the use of language models for the synthesis    of new molecules and materials. IBM-RXN encodes, models, and    predicts chemical reactivity. By combining Syngenta's    world-leading chemistry research and proprietary data sets with    IBM's world-class reactivity modelling capabilities and    leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), IBM's pioneering    modelling approach, enables the partners to deliver scalable,    accurate, and data-based predictions modelling. This enables    Syngenta to investigate multiple related compounds simultaneously    and prioritize routes that offer compounds with the most    desirable commercial attributes.     Syngenta is closing the data loop by connecting the IBM-RXN    platform to the synthesis platform. Reactivity predictions are    now an integral part of the design of synthetic procedures. The    models' outcomes are fully integrated with synthesis planning and    execution, establishing a virtual loop where high-quality data    generate more relevant models that, in turn, inspire better    synthetic procedures. The digitalization of synthetic workflows    and the adoption of predictive reactivity modelling are    increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of the synthetic    process. Both teams worked on extending reactivity modelling to    include bio-catalyzed reactions and metabolic transformations, to    support the design of more sustainable synthetic procedures that    have a better safety and environmental footprint.     As the predictive power of reactivity models increases,    scientists may become increasingly confident in delegating part    of their work to AI-enabled automation. This should allow    shifting the focus to the synthesis strategy and overall chemical    design.      Syngenta collaborates with Maxygen to optimize molecular enabling    technology.     US biotech, Maxygen, which specializes in the directed evolution    of proteins, is collaborating with Syngenta Seeds to optimize its    enabling technologies.     Since the collaboration launched, one of the success factors has    been the consistent and robust level of scientific engagement on    both sides. Both Maxygen and Syngenta adopted an open collegiate    approach from the start, with Syngenta giving the collaboration a    high-priority status as part of its core portfolio, enabling the    project to progress swiftly.     The teams from Syngenta and Maxygen met frequently to review    results, manage decision-making, adjust plans, and mark progress    milestones. This approach has delivered success resulting in    protein variants with highly improved attributes and the subject    of novel intellectual property.     Seeking new collaborators to six challenges     Shoots by Syngenta spotlights specific innovation needs from    across the Syngenta Crop Protection and Seeds businesses.    Science-based innovation challenges are posted on its website    (ShootsBySyngenta.com), inviting anyone with a scientific    interest to submit proposals in response. Proposals are quickly    evaluated, and if there is a mutual fit, progressed to a    collaboration partnership to take forward the research or    technology that might eventually be licensed.     Currently, Shoots by Syngenta lists six challenges, ranging from    identifying new chemical building blocks derived from biomass    waste streams, to developing diagnostic tools for detecting    non-visible indicators of poor crop growth.     \"We're looking forward to connecting with new partners from    academia, research institutes, start-ups, and cross-industry    sectors, to work with our extensive global network of scientists    and to push the boundaries of what is known today in science,\"    said Camilla Corsi, Syngenta's Global Head of Crop Protection    Research. \"We're proud of our strong reputation as a collaborator    of choice and are excited about the potential of the Shoots by    Syngenta platform to generate new possibilities to benefit    farmers and agriculture.\"     About Syngenta Group     Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural    technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

See Endnotes for further information.  Syngenta Crop Protection  Syngenta Crop Protection sales in the first quarter 2024 fell by 24 percent to $3.2 billion compared with a very strong first quarter 2023. All regions saw a decline in sales, except China, where sales grew 14 percent, mainly driven by strong momentum in Biologicals, continued outstanding performance of the ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology and the launch of TYMIRIUM\u00ae technology. North America sales were 44% lower as customers delayed purchasing towards the start of the planting season. Sales in Asia, the Middle East &amp; Africa were 24 percent lower; Europe sales were 28 percent lower. In Latin America, sales were 1 percent lower. In Q1 2024, Syngenta received the re-registration for 15 years in EU for trinexapac, offering farmers long-lasting growth regulation as well as best storage protection for cereal crops. Generally, in Europe, issues in farmer profitability drove cautious purchasing behavior.  ADAMA ADAMA sales declined 16 percent to $1.1 billion in the first quarter 2024. \u00a0 Sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East were 15 percent lower; Latin America declined 18 percent. North America decreased by 9 percent; Asia Pacific (excluding China) decreased 24 percent; sales in China were 16 percent lower. In the first quarter of 2024, ADAMA launched an innovative herbicide solution to control glyphosate-tolerant Palmer amaranth in the US states Nebraska and Colorado. The product received an emergency exemption from the US Environmental Protection Agency following the pressing need for a sugar beet herbicide solution. Syngenta Seeds  First quarter sales of Syngenta Seeds were $1.4 billion, 8 percent lower, with sales and earnings growth in China and Vegetables and Flowers offsetting particularly lower sales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Field crop sales in Europe declined 5 percent; North America fell 7 percent; Brazil Region grew 2 percent, while sales in Latin America North &amp; South were 18 percent lower; Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa decreased 51 percent, while sales in China grew 25 percent. Sales of Vegetable Seeds increased by 10 percent and sales of Flowers were 5 percent higher. In the first quarter of 2024, Syngenta completed the acquisition of Dafeng Seed in China, greatly enhancing its corn portfolio. In Brazil, Syngenta Seeds Field Crops announced the acceleration of its franchise model, thereby creating a more direct, demand-generating presence in the field with farmers. In Europe, the company launched the first Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus resistant barley hybrid, helping farmers to control the disease without the need for neonic seed treatments. Syngenta Vegetable Seeds inaugurated an expanded R&amp;D facility in El Ejido, Spain, and a new state-of-the-art Seed Health Lab in Hyderabad, India.

Syngenta Vegetable Seeds also signed an exclusive global licensing partnership with Emerald Seed Company, strengthening Syngenta?s portfolio in onion seeds, one of the most important crops globally. Syngenta Group China  Syngenta Group China sales were $2.7 billion, 18 percent lower. The robust growth in branded formulations, seeds, and bio-fertilizers was offset by a significant year-on-year price decline and a strategic scaling back of grain trading operations. Sales of Seeds grew 25 percent. Sales of Branded Formulation were 3 percent higher. Sinofert sales were 4 percent lower. Yangnong Chemical was 32 percent lower. MAP sales declined 8 percent, while the farm service business continued its upward trajectory. Grain trading business sales were 55% lower. Based on the 2023 TYMIRIUM\u00ae technology approval in China, the company continued the roll-out of innovative and highly effective nematicides and fungicides containing this ingredient.

In 2013, Syngenta was one of the first companies in the industry to launch a comprehensive sustainability plan. The \"Good Growth Plan\" successfully served as the organization?s sustainability compass.  The new priorities place sustainability at the core of the company's strategy and demonstrate continued commitment to sustainable innovation. This approach and clear targets help integrate sustainability on a strategic and operational level whilst creating long-term value: Priority 1: ?Higher yields, lower impact? through the acceleration of crop productivity in the agricultural sector, while reducing the impact on the planet through more sustainable technologies.  Priority 2: ?Regenerate soil and nature? by enabling the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices to help farmers improve productivity, soil health, biodiversity and climate.  Priority 3: ?Improve rural prosperity? by focusing on the prosperity of low-income and under-served farmers and their access to inputs, knowledge, finance and markets.  Priority 4: ?Sustainable operations? by the means of reducing the environmental impact of Syngenta Group?s own operations and the supply chain; strengthening a diverse and inclusive culture and ensuring the health and safety of its employees. The new priorities leverage the power of innovation, guide investments and collaboration as well as add a new level of transparency through a Portfolio Sustainability Framework (PSF). To find out more about Syngenta Group?s new sustainability priorities, the specific targets and the PSF, please visit the website Sustainability Priorities. Today Syngenta Group also published the Syngenta Group and Syngenta AG ESG reports for the year ended 31 December 2023. Endnotes For further information, see the reporting of financial results for ADAMA Ltd. (SHE: 000553), Sinofert Holdings (SEHK: 0297), Winall Hi-tech Seed (SHE: 300087), Yangnong Chemical (SHA: 600486) and Syngenta AG. Unless otherwise mentioned, comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Certain amounts, including components of change (%), may not add up due to rounding. The results presented in this release are unaudited and a consolidation of the business units in the Syngenta Group which includes Syngenta AG, Syngenta Group China, ADAMA Ltd., Sinofert Holdings, Winall Hi-tech Seed and Yangnong Chemical.  As a change to previous reporting, Yangnong Chemical sales have been fully included within the Syngenta Group China results, including exports, rather than partially appended in the Group?s Crop Protection units as previously presented. In addition, the regional split of Syngenta Crop Protection, Syngenta Seeds, and the sub business unit split of Syngenta Group China have been amended to reflect a revised management structure and operating model within these units. Comparative figures for 2023 have been amended to reflect these changes on a consistent basis; total sales are unchanged. Results in this report from one period to another period are, where appropriate, compared using constant exchange rates (CER). To present that information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into US dollars at the prior period's exchange rates, rather than at the exchange rates for the current year. The CER presentation indicates the business performance before taking into account currency exchange fluctuations. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and EBITDA as defined by Syngenta Group may not be comparable to similarly described measures at other companies. Syngenta Group has defined EBITDA as earnings before interest, tax, non-controlling interests, depreciation, amortization, restructuring and impairment. Information concerning EBITDA has been included as it is used by management and by investors as a supplementary measure of operating performance. Syngenta Group excludes restructuring and impairment from EBITDA to focus on results excluding items affecting comparability from one period to the next. EBITDA as used in this press release excludes one-time events; other documents may treat this as an underlying or adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA excludes other one-off or non-cash/non-operational items that do not impact the ongoing performance of the business, as well as the impact of a time-bound, Group launch long-term incentive scheme for leadership.  When referred to as such, ?the Group? implies Syngenta Group.   \u00a0  About Syngenta Group  is one of the world?s biggest agricultural technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

Liesl Truscott, director of industry accountability and insights at Textile Exchange, assesses the agreement for the fashion, textile and apparel industries in a statement on the Textile Exchange website. Textile Exchange sees the COP15 agreement as the second pillar of a complete transformation of the global economy, which interacts and is mutually dependent on the CO2 reductions agreed upon in Paris: to achieve net-zero climate targets, it is essential to work for biodiversity and net-zero in turn opens the door for nature. For many companies, climate risk has permeated the boardroom and has become part of the conversation with shareholders, investors and other stakeholders. </p><p>This emphasis on climate may have led to \u201ccarbon tunnel vision,\u201d but it has gotten things moving for nature in general, Truscott says. The task now is to advance corporate disclosure frameworks and financing tools for nature, taking into account the lessons of climate change. Accordingly, the space devoted to financing at COP15 was also large. An entire day was dedicated to biodiversity and finance, with 150 financial institutions representing $24 trillion calling on world leaders to adopt an ambitious global biodiversity framework. Not surprisingly, one of the delegates\u2019 biggest concerns is the need for sufficient resources in developing countries to truly mobilize action on the ground. An important element of this is the decision to redirect environmentally harmful subsidies (amounting to over $1.8 trillion per year) toward regenerative approaches. Textile Exchange, in its statement on COP15, welcomes the presence and relevant voice of indigenous peoples, who play a major role in implementing the decisions on the ground. Here, for example, we are talking about the shift to regenerative agriculture: when agricultural land and production activities come up against sensitive biodiversity hotspots in the landscape or where they impede wildlife movements. According to Textile Exchange, it is necessary to take advantage of the wealth of tools and technologies available to make the most of the enormous amount of innovation in this area. Wrapping up, the Textile Exchange statement says: Although the negotiations took some time and developing countries left at the midterm break, the final version of the GBF is ambitious enough that most participants feel they can work with it.

The supply system will eventually be open to other brands across and outside the industry, \u201caiming to significantly scale regenerative sourcing of rubber,\u201d it said.

This revitalizes biodiversity and enhances ecosystem services such as soil health, water cycling, carbon sequestration and the creation of favorable microclimates, Timberland explained.

Syngenta Group sales for full year 2023 were $32.2 billion, down    $1.2 billion or 4 percent year-on-year (-1% CER). Full year    EBITDA decreased 18 percent from the Group's all-time high in    2022 (-14% CER). Sales in 2023 were impacted by continued    industry-wide channel destocking in Crop Protection, with    distributors and retailers actively reducing inventories    previously accumulated in reaction to the supply chain    disturbances of the prior years, while under pressure to lower    working capital due to prolonged higher interest rates.     Fourth quarter sales were $7.9 billion, up 5 percent (+6% CER),    driven by Syngenta Crop Protection and by strong growth of    Syngenta Group China. This compares with a fourth quarter of    2022, when industry-wide destocking began. EBITDA for the fourth    quarter grew 15% (+10% CER), exceeding the record-setting fourth    quarter EBITDA of $0.9 billion in Q4 2022.

The    resulting contraction in demand led to global volume and price    reductions, particularly in Latin America and commoditised parts    of the portfolio. These factors weighed on the comparison with    2022, when Syngenta Group achieved record sales and profits.     Syngenta Crop Protection sales in FY 2023 experienced a modest 5    percent decrease in comparison to the previous year, totalling    $15.5 billion. Syngenta Group's biological solutions grew 11    percent in sales to $0.4 billion compared to last year.     The seeds market continued to be strong and resilient in 2023    despite softer commodity prices towards the  end of the year. The    Seeds business grew 2 percent to $4.8 billion in 2023.     Syngenta Group China maintained its momentum. In 2023, sales of    Syngenta Group China increased by 11 percent (+18% CER) to $9.6    billion, with fourth quarter sales growing as much as 19 percent    (+28% CER) to $1.9 billion.     Full year sales of Syngenta Group China's Modern Agriculture    Platform (MAP) grew 26 percent to $3.9 billion as the number of    MAP centers increased by 113 to a total of 741 centers.     In 2023, Syngenta Group remained focused on measures to improve    operational efficiency and productivity to offset lower volumes    and prices.

The MoU envisions a collaboration in which ADM and Syngenta would    leverage their existing capabilities to accelerate the research,    processing, and commercialization of new, low carbon-intensity    oilseeds, such as Camelina, that are typically grown in the    fallow period of a crop rotation. The companies have broad    capabilities including:      * Syngenta's R&amp;D engine, which offers biotechnology support,        seed treatments, and biologicals that further reduce the        carbon intensity of crops, and agronomic knowledge from a        network of local, field experts combined with excellent        farmer relationships.      * ADM's global scale and logistical expertise, including        unparalleled production and storage capabilities, a vast        logistical network, and relationships with growers and        customers spanning food, feed, fuel, industrial and consumer        products.     ADM and Syngenta envision fostering partnerships with additional    companies to support the creation, commercialization and    processing of next-generation oilseeds.     \"This exciting MoU with Syngenta demonstrates how we are working    with partners to bring the full value chain together to support    new seed technologies,\" said Greg Morris, president of ADM's Ag    Services &amp; Oilseeds business. \"It builds on our unique    capabilities by creating a path to scale the processing of cover    crops, a process we've already successfully piloted. We look    forward to working with Syngenta to advance this work and    continue to meet demand for sustainably sourced fuels and other    products.\"     \"Syngenta is excited to join forces with ADM to bring more    sustainable and profitable solutions to farmers,\" said Justin    Wolfe, President of Syngenta Global Seeds.  \"Sustainability is a    core enabler of our business strategy.  We believe    collaborations, such as this one, are important ways to drive    quicker innovation that delivers higher yield potential while    carrying a lower impact to our environment. Work will begin in    North America.\"     Global demand for biofuels - such as sustainable aviation fuel,    which can be made from a wide variety of feedstocks, including    oilseeds such as the ones envisioned in this MoU - is expected to    grow by 35 billion litres per year, or 22%, over the 2022-2027    period, according to the International Energy Association.     \"Farmers have always been stewards of the land,\" said Alison    Taylor, ADM's chief sustainability officer. \"We're already    expanding our partnerships with farmers through our    re:generations(TM) regen ag program; this MoU represents another    pathway for us to help them drive value by positioning their    businesses to meet global demand for sustainably-sourced    products.\"     \"Transforming agriculture will be fueled by innovation, but it    must be achieved at scale,\" said Daniel Vennard, Syngenta Group's    Chief Sustainability Officer.  \"This cannot be done alone. The    whole food and agriculture system needs to work in partnership    with farmers at the center.  Our collaboration with ADM is a    perfect example of our continued commitment and we are excited to    see what we will do together and how we can inspire the    industry.\"     The companies expect to sign definitive agreements by the end of    the year and are already advancing important work together around    growing and processing next-generation varieties.

Group sales for the first    nine months of 2023 were $24.3 billion, down 6 percent    year-on-year (-3% CER) and EBITDA was 22% lower (-20% CER) when    compared to an exceptionally strong 2022.      In the first nine months of 2023, the industry-wide channel    destocking continued as distributors and retailers further    reduced inventories they built up in response to the supply chain    disruptions of 2022. Overall farmer income and use of    agricultural products, solutions and services remain robust.    However, high working capital costs for customers due to    sustained higher interest rates prompted many channel partners    and farmers to order closer to application. These factors weighed    on the comparison with the same period last year, when the Group    achieved record sales and profits.      Sales of the Group for the third quarter were $6.8 billion, down    13 percent (-13% CER) and EBITDA was $0.3 billion, down 68    percent from prior year. The EBITDA was significantly impacted by    a softer market in Brazil versus a record high in 2022 and a    one-time seed inventory correction in Brazil, in addition to the    timing of a royalty receipt, which was advanced to Q2 as noted in    the H1 earnings release.        9M 2023       9M 2023     9M 2022     Change     Change (CER)      $bn     $bn     %     %     Sales     24.3     25.9     -6     -3     EBITDA     3.5     4.6     -22     -20       Q3 2023       Q3 2023     Q3 2022     Change     Change (CER)      $bn     $bn     %     %     Sales     6.8     7.9     -13     -13     EBITDA     0.3     1.0     -68     -76       Sales of Syngenta Crop Protection and ADAMA were lower compared    to the exceptionally strong first three quarters of the prior    year. Crop Protection in China continued to see strong growth in    the first nine months of 2023, with sales up 16 percent    year-on-year, benefiting from launch of new technologies.    Syngenta Group's biological solutions grew 14 percent in sales    compared to the first nine months of the previous year.      The Seeds business grew 3 percent to $3.3 billion sales in the    first nine of months of 2023. Year-on-year comparison of Q3 was    distorted by an earlier phasing of royalty income, realized in Q2    this year, while being recorded in Q3 last year. The Seeds    business in Latin America saw lower sales and profit due to a    one-time inventory adjustment.      Syngenta Group China grew by 9 percent in the first nine months    of 2023, with total sales of $7.7 billion. MAP, Syngenta Group's    Modern Agriculture Platform grew in the same period by 25 percent    to $3.3 billion, while the number of MAP centers further    increased by 162 to a total of 727.      Syngenta Group continued its productivity improvements, cost    containment and, where applicable, price adjustments to help    mitigate the impact of higher cost incurred in 2022. Syngenta    Group's EBITDA margin for the first nine months of 2023 was 14.6    percent, which is lower than the record high EBITDA during the    same period last year.

In the first nine months, sales in North America grew 2 percent;    sales were 3 percent lower in Europe, Africa and the Middle East    and 5 percent lower in Asia Pacific (excluding China). Sales in    China were up 16 percent. Sales in Latin America were 20 percent    lower as distributors reduced stocks and prices for some products    decreased. At CER, the business grew in all regions except for    Latin America.      Syngenta Crop Protection continued to launch its innovative    technologies across markets globally, with insect-control    products containing PLINAZOLIN\\xAE technology achieving particularly    strong sales across Asia Pacific and Brazil.       ADAMA      ADAMA sales were 18 percent lower at $4.2 billion in the first    nine months of 2023, significantly impacted by channel    destocking.      In the first nine months, sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle    East were 5 percent lower; sales in Latin America were 21 percent    lower impacted by the overall contraction of the crop protection    market in Brazil following channel destocking and softening    pricing. North America sales were 23 percent lower; Asia Pacific    sales (excluding China) were 16 percent lower. Sales in China    were 25 percent lower, largely due to soft demand of    non-agricultural products.      ADAMA launched Almada\\xAE, a triple-mode fungicide based on ADAMA's    proprietary formulation technology against major soybean    diseases. Almada\\xAE is the first ADAMA product containing    Fluxapyroxad for use in soybean.       Syngenta Seeds      Syngenta Seeds sales grew 3 percent to $3.3 billion in the first    nine months of 2023, driven by robust pricing to cover higher    costs.      Field crop sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East grew 12    percent; North America 5 percent; Asia Pacific (excluding China)    19 percent; and China 8 percent. Latin America was 15 percent    lower predominantly due to a one-time inventory adjustment in    Brazil. Sales of Vegetable Seeds grew 3 percent.      Syngenta Vegetable Seeds launched 15 commercial tomato varieties    with Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus resistance, a devastating    virus impacting greenhouse tomato producers across the world, and    the business is preparing to introduce 30 similarly resistant    varieties in 2024 to bring significant value to growers.

COP28 will also be the first to focus on the role of trade in tandem with finance and it will be the COP that brings leaders together from across all levels of government and society - from the local mayors to global leaders- to work towards cleaner, greener, safer cities for current and future generations.</p><p>All thematic days throughout the two weeks will be underpinned with an inclusive approach that prioritizes frontline communities and focuses on how finance, technology and innovation can drive solutions.</p><p>More detailed information about each thematic day will be released in the weeks and months ahead, as the COP28 Presidency continues to ramp up preparations for this year's meeting at Expo City Dubai.</p><p>Below are the key themes and events for each day:</p><p>- 30 November: COP28 UAE opens to the world at Expo City, Dubai. - 1-2 December: World Climate Action Summit - These two days will see heads of   state and world leaders come together to tackle the most pressing climate   issues in dialogue with leaders from civil society, business, youth,   Indigenous Peoples' organizations and others. Typically, the summit helps to   firm up the ambition for the remainder of the COP. For COP28, it will go   further; it is where the first-ever Global Stocktake response and the urgency   of the situation faced will be presented, and the COP Presidency will seek   accountability from the highest levels of global governance on a way forward. - 3 December: Health/Relief, Recovery, and Peace - Climate change is already   impacting human health across the planet, from the quality of the air we   breathe to the water we drink and the places that provide us with shelter. It   is also a major cause for displacement of vulnerable communities, leading to   increased fragility which can compromise peace. This day, a first for COPs,   will explore ways to provide relief to those affected while strengthening   resilience and recovery leading to increased stability. - 4 December: Finance/Trade/Gender Equality/Accountability - Neither global   financial systems that control and impact access and affordability of climate   finance nor international trade networks, are working effectively and   equitably. It is widely acknowledged that leaders of the global institutions   and countries that govern these systems must accelerate and be accountable for   an overhaul. An example of this is freeing up access to international finance   and trade to support the implementation of adaptation and mitigation solutions   without restrictions such as high interest rates that the poorest countries   cannot afford. This is necessary to create fairer and more equal conditions   for the world - and especially the most climate vulnerable countries from the   Global South - to meet collective climate targets. This day will focus on   moving this work forward while championing the importance of gender equality   across the full climate spectrum. - 5 December: Energy and Industry / Just Transition / Indigenous Peoples - The   world needs to decarbonize rapidly while continuing to progress economically.   It is critical that this development happens sustainably and inclusively to   support lives and livelihoods while protecting the planet. This day will focus   on how the world can accelerate the energy transition while ensuring it is   just. The energy needed for day-to-day life must remain affordable but become   cleaner, and jobs must be retained but expand as green technologies emerge and   provide increased and equitable access to opportunities. The day will look at   the broad spectrum of solutions from deploying renewable energy at scale and   how hydrogen can support this, to decarbonizing the energy of today through   carbon capture technologies and rapidly reducing methane emissions from oil   and gas. It will also focus on heavy-emitting industry including steel,   cement, and aluminium. Indigenous Peoples are stewards of 80% of our planet's   biodiversity and Indigenous Peoples Day will recognize the importance of their   intergenerational knowledge, practices, and leadership in climate action. The   day will also strengthen their role in the just transition, reinforcing the   urgency of a fully inclusive, all-of-society approach. - 6 December: Multilevel Action, Urbanization, and Built Environment/Transport -   It is not often that leaders representing all levels of governance, from the   local to the global, come together. This day will provide a rare opportunity   for mayors and governors, ministers and parliamentarians, and global business   and civil society leaders to work together to accelerate climate action   solutions across society in every form . This will include exploring how   greener urban mobility systems can be designed to withstand and adapt to   climate change while supporting the transition to low carbon built   environments and infrastructure, and redesigning our systems of production and   consumption to minimize waste. In addition, this day will showcase how all of   these solutions contribute to safer, healthier and greener cities for current   and future generations. - 7 December: Rest Day - 8 December: Youth, Children, Education, and Skills - Children and youth are   facing disproportionate risks and impacts from climate change as the   generation who will inherit a planet with tougher conditions in which to live   and prosper but which was not responsible for contributing to the problem.   This day seeks to empower children and youth to shape the outcomes of COP28   and beyond and provide them with clear, defined, accessible opportunities to   be a leading part of the solutions proposed at every level. - 9 December: Nature, Land Use, and Oceans - Our world's climate and its   biodiversity are inextricably interconnected, one cannot exist without the   other. Mitigating both crises must therefore be integrated. In a landmark win   for nature, a 30 x 30 biodiversity goal was adopted by world leaders at the   CBD COP15 - to protect at least 30 percent of the planet's land and water by   2030. Contributing to the goal, this day will focus on delivering climate and   nature co-benefits. This includes co-designing approaches to land use and   oceans conservation with local and Indigenous Peoples to protect and manage   biodiversity hotspots and natural carbon sinks. - 10 December: Food, Agriculture, and Water - Climate change is creating severe   pressure and risks for the food, agricultural and water systems that ensure   human wellbeing. At the same time, these systems are also key contributors to   climate change: one third of all human-made GHG emissions derive from   agri-food systems, and 70% of fresh water consumed worldwide is used for   agricultural production. This day will focus on how to fix this, from scaling   up regenerative agriculture and water-food systems that support habitat   restoration and conservation and increase food security, to implementing   stronger, fairer integrated governance between states and corporations,   farmers and producers. - 11-12 December: Final Negotiations - On the final two days of COP28, there   will be no thematic days to avoid extensive programming when the negotiation   text is often being closed.</p><p>For more information on the thematic program, please visit COP28.com here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/thematic-program\">https://www.cop28.com/en/thematic-program</url>) .</p><p>Notes to Editors COP28 UAE:</p><p>- COP28 UAE will take place at Expo City Dubai from November 30-December 12, 2023.

The retail giant, along with the Walmart Foundation, also committed to help protect, manage or restore at least 50 million acres of land and one million square miles of ocean by 2030.  With the move, the company said it aims to become regenerative, and want to take an important role in transforming the world's supply chains to be regenerative.  Under its plan, Walmart would harvest enough wind, solar and other renewable energy sources to power its facilities with 100% renewable energy by 2035. Further, it will electrify and zero out emissions from all of its vehicles, including long-haul trucks, by 2040.  In addition, Walmart plans to transition to low-impact refrigerants for cooling and electrified equipment for heating in its stores, clubs, and data and distribution centers by 2040.  The company and its Foundation would continue to support efforts to preserve at least one acre of natural habitat for every acre of land developed by the company in the U.S.  Further, regenerative agriculture practices, sustainable fisheries management and forest protection and restoration will be adopted.  As of now, the company powers around 29 percent of its operations with renewable energy and diverts around 80 percent of its waste from landfills and incineration globally.

We live in a world where billionaires can take day trips into the stratosphere, crypto assets are challenging established financial norms and climate change is changing the very substance of our physical environment. New risks are arising while the global community deals with known challenges such as the pandemic, war in Ukraine, economic turbulence and failing trust in established social institutions. Swiss Re's SONAR report, now celebrating its 10th anniversary, scans the horizon for emerging risks for the insurance industry.  Patrick Raaflaub, Group Chief Risk Officer at Swiss Re, says: \"A global pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, surging inflation and an unstoppable climate crisis ? these are just some of the many risks that SONAR has examined over the past decade that have ultimately materialised. However, researching new risks is not about forecasting. It is about raising awareness of risks that may impact society and preparing ourselves accordingly.\" Crypto assets and quantum computing create new risks within the global financial system In the current highly technology-dependent financial system, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether have established themselves as potential challengers to conventional currencies. Alongside these new forms of currency, further crypto assets have emerged. Tokens, for example, allow people to buy digital representations of real assets such as art works or real estate. They can be traded and grant their owner access to assets, products or services. Nowadays, an art lover can buy a fraction of a Picasso. The fluid ownership, taxation, regulatory issues and other risks related to the new asset classes present insurers with fresh challenges. For instance, are certain crypto assets implicitly covered by existing property or cyber policies?  The security of the new digital financial economy is also facing new risks. With quantum computing, for example, a new generation of computers is on the verge of completing tasks far beyond the reach of current machines. These hyper-smart technologies offer significant benefits: sophisticated weather modelling, advanced medical research capabilities and\u00a0financial analysis. With increasing maturity, they can also become a threat to existing IT-security protocols, potentially hacking standard encryption keys used in online communications and data transfer. A new generation of emerging risks arising from climate change Swiss Re identified the threat of climate change as far back as 1979. More than 40 years later, the consequences of climate risk are very much present in our everyday lives. Beyond what we already see, climate change creates a new generation of emerging risks. This year's SONAR report explores how the thawing of permafrost, which covers a quarter of the northern hemisphere, could not only damage infrastructure and accelerate climate hazards but also release disease-carrying pathogens that have been frozen for decades. Agriculture is an activity that is especially susceptible to climate change ? yet it is also an area that is struggling to reduce its contribution to global warming. Emissions from global food\u00a0production account for about 31% of total man-made carbon emissions. The challenge for agriculture is to improve productivity and feed more people while cutting emissions at the same time. Insurers can play a vital role in faster adoption and scaling up of sustainable farming practices by offering suitable coverage solutions and facilitating climate-smart and regenerative agriculture. 10th anniversary: the benefits of preparationThere was a time when today's big challenges such as climate change, pandemics, geopolitical conflict and inflation were themselves emerging risks.

This year's SONAR report explores how the thawing of permafrost, which covers a quarter of the northern hemisphere, could not only damage infrastructure and accelerate climate hazards but also release disease-carrying pathogens that have been frozen for decades. Agriculture is an activity that is especially susceptible to climate change - yet it is also an area that is struggling to reduce its contribution to global warming. Emissions from global food production account for about 31% of total man-made carbon emissions. The challenge for agriculture is to improve productivity and feed more people while cutting emissions at the same time. Insurers can play a vital role in faster adoption and scaling up of sustainable farming practices by offering suitable coverage solutions and facilitating climate-smart and regenerative agriculture. 10th anniversary: the benefits of preparation There was a time when today's big challenges such as climate change, pandemics, geopolitical conflict and inflation were themselves emerging risks. SONAR's 10th anniversary edition is a poignant reminder of the long-term potential of emerging risks and how the insurance industry helps to build societal resilience. The 10th Anniversary SONAR can be found on Swiss Re's website.

In addition, the Board adopted the budget for the coming\u00a0financial year and the three-year plan and took note of the report on security, health and safety. In addition, the Supervisory Board set the target values for the annual performance-related remuneration\u00a0of the Executive Board for the following financial year and discussed in principle the options for revising\u00a0the\u00a0Executive Board remuneration system. Other topics included an update on the revision of the qualification matrix and the assessment of the independence of shareholder representatives in accordance with the German Corporate Governance Code and the\u00a0UK\u00a0Code. Presiding Committee The Presiding Committee is responsible for Executive Board matters (including succession planning, appointments, terms of employment contracts, remuneration, proposals on the remuneration system), which in this function corresponds to a remuneration committee in accordance of\u00a0UK\u00a0principles. In addition, the Presiding Committee prepares the meetings of the Supervisory Board. In the reporting period, six meetings were held. Of these, five were held as presence meetings, while one were held as video conferences. The Presiding Committee, which is made up of equal numbers of members, consists of: Dr Dieter Zetsche (Chairman)  Peter Bremme  Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges  Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst  Frank Jakobi  Anette Strempel 1. At its meeting on\u00a04\u00a0October\u00a02022, the Presiding Committee dealt with possible changes to the composition\u00a0of the Executive Board and the definition of performance criteria for the individual performance of Executive Board members, the performance of the Executive Board as a whole and the achievement of stakeholder goals and their relative weighting for the following financial year. The Executive Committee also dealt with the revised competency profile for the Board and the qualification matrix as well as with the drafts of the Report of the Supervisory Board and the Corporate Governance statements for the annual report\u00a02022. 2. On\u00a012\u00a0December\u00a02022, the target achievement for the variable remuneration components of the Executive Board in the\u00a02022\u00a0financial year was the subject of discussion, subject to the validity of the remuneration restrictions. In addition, the exercise of\u00a0LTIP\u00a0adjustment mechanisms was discussed. In the context of Supervisory Board matters, the annual planning of the Supervisory Board and its committees for the\u00a02023\u00a0and\u00a02024\u00a0financial years as well as the competence profile and the qualification matrix were among the items on the agenda. 3.

On\u00a05\u00a0September\u00a02023, the Presiding Committee discussed the determination of the target values for\u00a0annual performance-related remuneration for the following financial year. Furthermore, the general further development of the remuneration system was discussed. In addition, the update on the revision of the qualification matrix and the assessment of the independence of the shareholder representatives on the board according to the German Corporate Governance Code and the\u00a0UK\u00a0Code were discussed. Audit Committee The Audit Committee met for eight ordinary meetings in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. Of these, six were held as Presence meetings, while two were held as video conferences. Please refer to the detailed report of the Audit Committee on page\u00a019\u00a0for information on the composition, tasks, deliberations and resolutions of the Audit Committee. Nomination Committee The nomination committee, composed exclusively of shareholder representatives, nominates suitable shareholder candidates to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the general meeting or for appointment by the district court. The members of the Nomination Committee, which met one time in an attendance meeting, were: Dr Dieter Zetsche (Chairman)  Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges  Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst In its meeting on\u00a013\u00a0December\u00a02022, the Nomination Committee dealt with the resolution recommendation for the nomination of Mr Baier, Ms Murano and Dr Zetsche (shareholder representatives) for election at the following Annual General Meeting. Corporate Governance The\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0share has its initial listing on the London Stock Exchange in the United Kingdom. In this context,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s constitution as a stock corporation under German law naturally requires the Supervisory Board to\u00a0deal regularly and in great detail with the recommendations of both German and British corporate governance. Apart from mandatory compliance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Co-Determination Act (MitbestG), the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0had declared in the framework of the merger that it would comply with both the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and ? to a practicable extent ? the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC). For the\u00a0GCGC, which is based on the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in its basic conception, we were able to submit the Declaration of Conformity\u00a02023\u00a0with the Executive Board in accordance with section\u00a0161\u00a0AktG.\u00a0The\u00a0GCGC\u00a0will be fully complied with again from August\u00a02023. For further details, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report. The deviations from the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0are largely due to the conceptual difference between the monistic management system of a public listed company in the\u00a0UK\u00a0(so-called one-tier board) and the\u00a0dualistic management system consisting of Executive Board and Supervisory Board in a public limited company (so-called two-tier board) under German law. In conducting the audit of the financial statements, the auditor did not identify any facts that would indicate that the declaration on the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board was incorrect. Further information on corporate governance, the Declaration of Conformity\u00a02023\u00a0pursuant to section\u00a0161\u00a0of\u00a0the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the declaration on the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0can be found in the Corporate\u00a0Governance Report jointly prepared by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report (page\u00a011) and on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s website. Conflicts of interest that have arisen The Supervisory Board has continuously monitored the existence of conflicts of interest in the current financial year and determined that no conflict of interest arose in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. Audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group The Supervisory Board examined whether the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the other financial reporting complied with the applicable requirements. The annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with the rules of the German\u00a0Commercial Code (HGB), the combined management report of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and the consolidated\u00a0financial statements for the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting\u00a0Standards (IFRS) were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Hanover, and issued with an unqualified audit opinion in each case. The aforementioned documents, the Executive Board?s proposal for\u00a0the appropriation of the balance sheet profit and the auditor?s reports were submitted to all members of the\u00a0Supervisory Board in good time. We discussed them in detail at the Audit Committee meeting on\u00a04\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0and at our balance sheet meeting on\u00a05\u00a0December\u00a02023, at which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail. At these meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the auditor reported on the results of their audits, the focus of which had previously been determined with the Audit Committee for the reporting year. Neither the auditor nor the Audit Committee identified any weaknesses in the early risk detection and internal control system. Following our own review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, we had no cause for objections and therefore concurred with the Executive Board?s assessment of the situation of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we approve the financial statements for financial year\u00a02023; the annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0are thus adopted. Composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board The composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0is shown in the overviews on pages\u00a0115\u00a0for the Supervisory Board and on page\u00a0117\u00a0for the Executive Board. Supervisory Board In the following, I will give you an overview of the personnel changes on the Supervisory Board. At the proposal of the Supervisory Board, Dr Zetsche was re-elected by the\u00a0AGM\u00a02023. In addition, the\u00a0AGM\u00a02023\u00a0confirmed Ms Murano and Mr Baier as members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board. Both members had initially been appointed by court order on\u00a031\u00a0May\u00a02022. Presiding Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Presiding Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Audit Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Audit Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Dr Zetsche and Mr Baier were also re-elected to the Audit Committee following their election by the Annual General Meeting. Nomination Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Nomination Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Executive Board Frank Rosenberger, Chief\u00a0IT\u00a0Officer and Future Markets, has decided to leave the Group with effect as of the expiry of\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022. Mr Rosenberger had been with\u00a0TUI\u00a0since\u00a02015\u00a0and had been responsible for\u00a0Future Markets and the Group?s digitalisation on the company?s Executive Board since\u00a02017. Under his responsibility, a global system for\u00a0TUI\u00a0tour operators was launched and the digitalisation of the company was significantly advanced. The reduction in the number of Executive Board members also required a reorganisation of responsibilities in the management body. The\u00a0CIO\u00a0with his central\u00a0IT\u00a0functions of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is located in the direct area\u00a0of responsibility of\u00a0CEO\u00a0Sebastian Ebel. The other\u00a0IT\u00a0units are interlinked with the operational areas to enable a fast and efficient implementation of the digitalisation strategy. Peter Krueger is fully responsible for the Holiday Experiences area at Executive Board level. Thanks to The Supervisory Board would like to thank the employees of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group for their great commitment in\u00a0the past financial year. Thanks to your commitment,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has managed to regain its strength after the pandemic\u00a0? in your respective areas of responsibility, you have all contributed to enabling\u00a0TUI\u00a0customers to enjoy the best time of the year. Hanover,\u00a05\u00a0December\u00a02023 For the Supervisory Board Dr Dieter Zetsche Chairman of the Supervisory Board Report of the Audit Committee Dear Shareholders, As the Audit Committee, we have the task of supporting the Supervisory Board in the performance of its supervisory function. In doing so, we deal with the audit of the accounting, the monitoring of the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system as well as the audit of the financial statements and compliance. The accounting process includes, in particular, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report including\u00a0CSR\u00a0reporting, financial information during the year and the individual financial statements according to the German Commercial Code (HGB). In the completed financial year, we dealt in particular with issues relating to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0accounting and financial reporting, as required by law, the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC) and the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board. In\u00a0addition, the Board Office also dealt for the Audit Committee with the implementation of the Financial Reporting Council?s (FRC) ?Audit Committees and the External Audit Minimum Standard? and determined that the requirements are already being met. Furthermore, the Audit Committee is responsible for the selection of the external auditor, whereby it also reviews the qualification as well as the independence of the auditor. The selected auditor is then proposed by the supervisory board to the general meeting for appointment. After the appointment by the general meeting, the Supervisory Board formally commissions the external auditor to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. The auditor is also commissioned to review the half-yearly financial report as well as any additional interim financial information that meets the requirements for the half-yearly financial report. The Audit Committee has agreed with the auditor that the auditor shall inform the committee without delay of all findings and events of significance for the committee?s tasks that come to the auditor?s attention during the performance of the audit. Furthermore, the Audit Committee\u00a0has agreed with the auditor that the auditor will inform the committee and make a note in the audit report\u00a0if, during the performance of the audit, the auditor discovers facts that show a misstatement in the declaration on the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Audit Committee regularly assesses the quality of the audit. The Audit Committee, which has equal representation, currently consists of the following eight members of the Supervisory Board:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry

Of these, six were held as presence meetings, while four were held as video conferences. Furthermore, the established transaction committee of the Supervisory Board met one time, and four additional resolutions were passed by circular resolution. The following main points were the subject of the individual meetings: 1. In its meeting on\u00a05\u00a0October\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board first dealt with the preliminary report on the past financial year. In addition, the Supervisory Board was informed about the current booking situation, the liquidity situation and the refinancing options of the Group. The agenda also included an update on the sanctioning of a major shareholder and the revised competence profile of the Supervisory Board, including a qualification matrix. The Supervisory Board also informed itself about the law on the introduction of virtual general meetings and decided to hold the next ordinary general meeting in virtual format. Furthermore, the members of the Supervisory Board received an update on the definition of the performance criteria for the individual performance of the Executive Board members, the performance of the Executive Board as a whole and the achievement of stakeholder targets. Finally, the Board dealt with general succession planning and discussed possible changes to the Executive Board. 2. In a circular resolution on\u00a018\u00a0October\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board approved, in implementation of the changes discussed at the meeting on\u00a05\u00a0October, the termination by mutual consent of the appointment of Mr Frank Rosenberger as a member of the Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the amendment of the business allocation plan. 3. The extraordinary meeting on\u00a023\u00a0November\u00a02022\u00a0dealt with an update on the Group?s refinancing strategy.\u00a0The prerequisites for the refinancing options and, among other things, their implications for the company?s rating were examined. In addition, the members of the Supervisory Board also had the potential consequences and effects of the possible refinancing for the company and the shareholders and their legal assessment explained to them. 4. The meeting on\u00a013\u00a0December\u00a02022\u00a0initially included a discussion of the draft repayment agreement with the\u00a0WSF\u00a0and the associated key conditions, requirements and implications. The agenda also included the financial statements of the Group and\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, each of which had been issued with an unqualified audit certificate by the auditors, and the combined management report for the Group. The Executive Board\u00a0and the auditors were also present.

Presiding Committee The Presiding Committee is responsible for Executive Board matters (including succession planning, appointments, terms of employment contracts, remuneration, proposals on the remuneration system), which in this function corresponds to a remuneration committee in accordance of\u00a0UK\u00a0principles. In addition, the Presiding Committee prepares the meetings of the Supervisory Board. In the reporting period, six meetings were held. Of these, five were held as presence meetings, while one were held as video conferences.

Audit Committee The Audit Committee met for eight ordinary meetings in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. Of these, six were held as Presence meetings, while two were held as video conferences. Please refer to the detailed report of the Audit Committee on page\u00a019\u00a0for information on the composition, tasks, deliberations and resolutions of the Audit Committee. Nomination Committee The nomination committee, composed exclusively of shareholder representatives, nominates suitable shareholder candidates to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the general meeting or for appointment by the district court. The members of the Nomination Committee, which met one time in an attendance meeting, were: Dr Dieter Zetsche (Chairman)  Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges  Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst In its meeting on\u00a013\u00a0December\u00a02022, the Nomination Committee dealt with the resolution recommendation for the nomination of Mr Baier, Ms Murano and Dr Zetsche (shareholder representatives) for election at the following Annual General Meeting. Corporate Governance The\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0share has its initial listing on the London Stock Exchange in the United Kingdom. In this context,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s constitution as a stock corporation under German law naturally requires the Supervisory Board to\u00a0deal regularly and in great detail with the recommendations of both German and British corporate governance. Apart from mandatory compliance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Co-Determination Act (MitbestG), the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0had declared in the framework of the merger that it would comply with both the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and ? to a practicable extent ? the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC). For the\u00a0GCGC, which is based on the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in its basic conception, we were able to submit the Declaration of Conformity\u00a02023\u00a0with the Executive Board in accordance with section\u00a0161\u00a0AktG.\u00a0The\u00a0GCGC\u00a0will be fully complied with again from August\u00a02023. For further details, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report. The deviations from the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0are largely due to the conceptual difference between the monistic management system of a public listed company in the\u00a0UK\u00a0(so-called one-tier board) and the\u00a0dualistic management system consisting of Executive Board and Supervisory Board in a public limited company (so-called two-tier board) under German law. In conducting the audit of the financial statements, the auditor did not identify any facts that would indicate that the declaration on the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board was incorrect. Further information on corporate governance, the Declaration of Conformity\u00a02023\u00a0pursuant to section\u00a0161\u00a0of\u00a0the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the declaration on the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0can be found in the Corporate\u00a0Governance Report jointly prepared by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report (page\u00a011) and on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s website. Conflicts of interest that have arisen The Supervisory Board has continuously monitored the existence of conflicts of interest in the current financial year and determined that no conflict of interest arose in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. Audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group The Supervisory Board examined whether the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the other financial reporting complied with the applicable requirements. The annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with the rules of the German\u00a0Commercial Code (HGB), the combined management report of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and the consolidated\u00a0financial statements for the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting\u00a0Standards (IFRS) were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Hanover, and issued with an unqualified audit opinion in each case. The aforementioned documents, the Executive Board?s proposal for\u00a0the appropriation of the balance sheet profit and the auditor?s reports were submitted to all members of the\u00a0Supervisory Board in good time. We discussed them in detail at the Audit Committee meeting on\u00a04\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0and at our balance sheet meeting on\u00a05\u00a0December\u00a02023, at which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail. At these meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the auditor reported on the results of their audits, the focus of which had previously been determined with the Audit Committee for the reporting year. Neither the auditor nor the Audit Committee identified any weaknesses in the early risk detection and internal control system. Following our own review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, we had no cause for objections and therefore concurred with the Executive Board?s assessment of the situation of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we approve the financial statements for financial year\u00a02023; the annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0are thus adopted. Composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board The composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0is shown in the overviews on pages\u00a0115\u00a0for the Supervisory Board and on page\u00a0117\u00a0for the Executive Board. Supervisory Board In the following, I will give you an overview of the personnel changes on the Supervisory Board. At the proposal of the Supervisory Board, Dr Zetsche was re-elected by the\u00a0AGM\u00a02023. In addition, the\u00a0AGM\u00a02023\u00a0confirmed Ms Murano and Mr Baier as members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board. Both members had initially been appointed by court order on\u00a031\u00a0May\u00a02022. Presiding Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Presiding Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Audit Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Audit Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Dr Zetsche and Mr Baier were also re-elected to the Audit Committee following their election by the Annual General Meeting. Nomination Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Nomination Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Executive Board Frank Rosenberger, Chief\u00a0IT\u00a0Officer and Future Markets, has decided to leave the Group with effect as of the expiry of\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022. Mr Rosenberger had been with\u00a0TUI\u00a0since\u00a02015\u00a0and had been responsible for\u00a0Future Markets and the Group?s digitalisation on the company?s Executive Board since\u00a02017. Under his responsibility, a global system for\u00a0TUI\u00a0tour operators was launched and the digitalisation of the company was significantly advanced. The reduction in the number of Executive Board members also required a reorganisation of responsibilities in the management body. The\u00a0CIO\u00a0with his central\u00a0IT\u00a0functions of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is located in the direct area\u00a0of responsibility of\u00a0CEO\u00a0Sebastian Ebel. The other\u00a0IT\u00a0units are interlinked with the operational areas to enable a fast and efficient implementation of the digitalisation strategy. Peter Krueger is fully responsible for the Holiday Experiences area at Executive Board level. Thanks to The Supervisory Board would like to thank the employees of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group for their great commitment in\u00a0the past financial year. Thanks to your commitment,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has managed to regain its strength after the pandemic\u00a0? in your respective areas of responsibility, you have all contributed to enabling\u00a0TUI\u00a0customers to enjoy the best time of the year. Hanover,\u00a05\u00a0December\u00a02023 For the Supervisory Board Dr Dieter Zetsche Chairman of the Supervisory Board Report of the Audit Committee Dear Shareholders, As the Audit Committee, we have the task of supporting the Supervisory Board in the performance of its supervisory function. In doing so, we deal with the audit of the accounting, the monitoring of the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system as well as the audit of the financial statements and compliance. The accounting process includes, in particular, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report including\u00a0CSR\u00a0reporting, financial information during the year and the individual financial statements according to the German Commercial Code (HGB). In the completed financial year, we dealt in particular with issues relating to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0accounting and financial reporting, as required by law, the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC) and the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board. In\u00a0addition, the Board Office also dealt for the Audit Committee with the implementation of the Financial Reporting Council?s (FRC) ?Audit Committees and the External Audit Minimum Standard? and determined that the requirements are already being met. Furthermore, the Audit Committee is responsible for the selection of the external auditor, whereby it also reviews the qualification as well as the independence of the auditor. The selected auditor is then proposed by the supervisory board to the general meeting for appointment. After the appointment by the general meeting, the Supervisory Board formally commissions the external auditor to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. The auditor is also commissioned to review the half-yearly financial report as well as any additional interim financial information that meets the requirements for the half-yearly financial report. The Audit Committee has agreed with the auditor that the auditor shall inform the committee without delay of all findings and events of significance for the committee?s tasks that come to the auditor?s attention during the performance of the audit. Furthermore, the Audit Committee\u00a0has agreed with the auditor that the auditor will inform the committee and make a note in the audit report\u00a0if, during the performance of the audit, the auditor discovers facts that show a misstatement in the declaration on the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Audit Committee regularly assesses the quality of the audit. The Audit Committee, which has equal representation, currently consists of the following eight members of the Supervisory Board:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry

Presiding Committee The Presiding Committee is responsible for Executive Board matters (including succession planning, appointments, terms of employment contracts, remuneration, proposals on the remuneration system), which in this function corresponds to a remuneration committee in accordance of\u00a0UK\u00a0principles. In addition, the Presiding Committee prepares the meetings of the Supervisory Board. In the reporting period, six meetings were held.

Audit Committee The Audit Committee met for eight ordinary meetings in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. Of these, six were held as Presence meetings, while two were held as video conferences. Please refer to the detailed report of the Audit Committee on page\u00a019\u00a0for information on the composition, tasks, deliberations and resolutions of the Audit Committee. Nomination Committee The nomination committee, composed exclusively of shareholder representatives, nominates suitable shareholder candidates to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the general meeting or for appointment by the district court. The members of the Nomination Committee, which met one time in an attendance meeting, were: Dr Dieter Zetsche (Chairman)  Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges  Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst In its meeting on\u00a013\u00a0December\u00a02022, the Nomination Committee dealt with the resolution recommendation for the nomination of Mr Baier, Ms Murano and Dr Zetsche (shareholder representatives) for election at the following Annual General Meeting. Corporate Governance The\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0share has its initial listing on the London Stock Exchange in the United Kingdom. In this context,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s constitution as a stock corporation under German law naturally requires the Supervisory Board to\u00a0deal regularly and in great detail with the recommendations of both German and British corporate governance. Apart from mandatory compliance with the provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG), the Co-Determination Act (MitbestG), the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0had declared in the framework of the merger that it would comply with both the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and ? to a practicable extent ? the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC). For the\u00a0GCGC, which is based on the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in its basic conception, we were able to submit the Declaration of Conformity\u00a02023\u00a0with the Executive Board in accordance with section\u00a0161\u00a0AktG.\u00a0The\u00a0GCGC\u00a0will be fully complied with again from August\u00a02023. For further details, please refer to the Corporate Governance Report. The deviations from the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0are largely due to the conceptual difference between the monistic management system of a public listed company in the\u00a0UK\u00a0(so-called one-tier board) and the\u00a0dualistic management system consisting of Executive Board and Supervisory Board in a public limited company (so-called two-tier board) under German law. In conducting the audit of the financial statements, the auditor did not identify any facts that would indicate that the declaration on the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board was incorrect. Further information on corporate governance, the Declaration of Conformity\u00a02023\u00a0pursuant to section\u00a0161\u00a0of\u00a0the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the declaration on the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0can be found in the Corporate\u00a0Governance Report jointly prepared by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board in this Annual Report (page\u00a011) and on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s website. Conflicts of interest that have arisen The Supervisory Board has continuously monitored the existence of conflicts of interest in the current financial year and determined that no conflict of interest arose in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. Audit of the annual financial statements and consolidated financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group The Supervisory Board examined whether the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements as well as the other financial reporting complied with the applicable requirements. The annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0prepared by the Executive Board in accordance with the rules of the German\u00a0Commercial Code (HGB), the combined management report of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and the consolidated\u00a0financial statements for the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0prepared on the basis of the International Financial Reporting\u00a0Standards (IFRS) were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Hanover, and issued with an unqualified audit opinion in each case. The aforementioned documents, the Executive Board?s proposal for\u00a0the appropriation of the balance sheet profit and the auditor?s reports were submitted to all members of the\u00a0Supervisory Board in good time. We discussed them in detail at the Audit Committee meeting on\u00a04\u00a0December\u00a02023\u00a0and at our balance sheet meeting on\u00a05\u00a0December\u00a02023, at which the Executive Board explained the financial statements in detail. At these meetings, the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the auditor reported on the results of their audits, the focus of which had previously been determined with the Audit Committee for the reporting year. Neither the auditor nor the Audit Committee identified any weaknesses in the early risk detection and internal control system. Following our own review of the annual financial statements, the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report, we had no cause for objections and therefore concurred with the Executive Board?s assessment of the situation of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, we approve the financial statements for financial year\u00a02023; the annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0are thus adopted. Composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board The composition of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0is shown in the overviews on pages\u00a0115\u00a0for the Supervisory Board and on page\u00a0117\u00a0for the Executive Board. Supervisory Board In the following, I will give you an overview of the personnel changes on the Supervisory Board. At the proposal of the Supervisory Board, Dr Zetsche was re-elected by the\u00a0AGM\u00a02023. In addition, the\u00a0AGM\u00a02023\u00a0confirmed Ms Murano and Mr Baier as members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board. Both members had initially been appointed by court order on\u00a031\u00a0May\u00a02022. Presiding Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Presiding Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Audit Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Audit Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Dr Zetsche and Mr Baier were also re-elected to the Audit Committee following their election by the Annual General Meeting. Nomination Committee In financial year\u00a02023, there were no changes in the composition of the Nomination Committee of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Executive Board Frank Rosenberger, Chief\u00a0IT\u00a0Officer and Future Markets, has decided to leave the Group with effect as of the expiry of\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022. Mr Rosenberger had been with\u00a0TUI\u00a0since\u00a02015\u00a0and had been responsible for\u00a0Future Markets and the Group?s digitalisation on the company?s Executive Board since\u00a02017. Under his responsibility, a global system for\u00a0TUI\u00a0tour operators was launched and the digitalisation of the company was significantly advanced. The reduction in the number of Executive Board members also required a reorganisation of responsibilities in the management body. The\u00a0CIO\u00a0with his central\u00a0IT\u00a0functions of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is located in the direct area\u00a0of responsibility of\u00a0CEO\u00a0Sebastian Ebel. The other\u00a0IT\u00a0units are interlinked with the operational areas to enable a fast and efficient implementation of the digitalisation strategy. Peter Krueger is fully responsible for the Holiday Experiences area at Executive Board level. Thanks to The Supervisory Board would like to thank the employees of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group for their great commitment in\u00a0the past financial year. Thanks to your commitment,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has managed to regain its strength after the pandemic\u00a0? in your respective areas of responsibility, you have all contributed to enabling\u00a0TUI\u00a0customers to enjoy the best time of the year. Hanover,\u00a05\u00a0December\u00a02023 For the Supervisory Board Dr Dieter Zetsche Chairman of the Supervisory Board Report of the Audit Committee Dear Shareholders, As the Audit Committee, we have the task of supporting the Supervisory Board in the performance of its supervisory function. In doing so, we deal with the audit of the accounting, the monitoring of the accounting process, the effectiveness of the internal control system, the risk management system and the internal audit system as well as the audit of the financial statements and compliance. The accounting process includes, in particular, the consolidated financial statements and the group management report including\u00a0CSR\u00a0reporting, financial information during the year and the individual financial statements according to the German Commercial Code (HGB). In the completed financial year, we dealt in particular with issues relating to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0accounting and financial reporting, as required by law, the German Corporate Governance Code (GCGC) and the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC) and the rules of procedure of the Supervisory Board. In\u00a0addition, the Board Office also dealt for the Audit Committee with the implementation of the Financial Reporting Council?s (FRC) ?Audit Committees and the External Audit Minimum Standard? and determined that the requirements are already being met. Furthermore, the Audit Committee is responsible for the selection of the external auditor, whereby it also reviews the qualification as well as the independence of the auditor. The selected auditor is then proposed by the supervisory board to the general meeting for appointment. After the appointment by the general meeting, the Supervisory Board formally commissions the external auditor to audit the annual financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. The auditor is also commissioned to review the half-yearly financial report as well as any additional interim financial information that meets the requirements for the half-yearly financial report. The Audit Committee has agreed with the auditor that the auditor shall inform the committee without delay of all findings and events of significance for the committee?s tasks that come to the auditor?s attention during the performance of the audit. Furthermore, the Audit Committee\u00a0has agreed with the auditor that the auditor will inform the committee and make a note in the audit report\u00a0if, during the performance of the audit, the auditor discovers facts that show a misstatement in the declaration on the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. In addition, the Audit Committee regularly assesses the quality of the audit. The Audit Committee, which has equal representation, currently consists of the following eight members of the Supervisory Board:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"408\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst (Chairman)     Christian Baier     Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges     Stefan Heinemann</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Frank Jakobi     Mark Muratovic     Stefan Weinhofer     Dr Dieter Zetsche</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Through the appointment of financial experts, the Audit Committee has expertise in the areas of accounting and auditing. The expertise in the field of accounting consists of special knowledge and experience in the application of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems. The expertise in the\u00a0field of auditing consists of special knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements.\u00a0Accounting and auditing also include sustainability reporting and its audit. The Chairman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst, is an expert in both areas. In addition, Mr Christian Baier and Dr Jutta\u00a0D\u00f6nges fulfil the requirements of a financial expert within the meaning of the\u00a0GCGC. The relevant members of the Audit Committee are also named in the Corporate Governance Report starting on page\u00a0119, where more detailed information on their expertise in the aforementioned areas is also provided. In summary, it should be noted here that the members of the Audit Committee all have competences relevant to the sector in which the company operates. With regard to the Chairman of the Audit Committee, Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst, the Supervisory Board is of the opinion that he is independent of the Company and the Executive Board (for the independence of the other members of the Audit Committee, see page\u00a0121). The Audit Committee regularly meets six times a year. The meeting dates and agendas are based in particular on the reporting cycle of the Group and the agendas of the Supervisory Board. In addition, there may be other topic-related meetings. These topic-related meetings generally also include a meeting in which the Executive Board explains to the Audit Committee the main contents of the Pre-Close Trading Update, which is usually published shortly before the annual closing date. In addition to the members of the Audit Committee, the meetings were also attended by the Chairman of the Executive Board and the Chief Financial Officer, as well as the heads of Group Financial Accounting &amp; Reporting, Group Audit, Group Legal, Compliance &amp; Board Office, Group Treasury, Group Controlling, Group Corporate Finance &amp; Group Investor Relations. The auditors were invited to attend the meetings to discuss relevant issues. Other members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s senior management as well as\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group executives with operational responsibility or external consultants were invited as required. In addition to the meetings of the Audit Committee, the Chairman of the Audit Committee also held individual\u00a0discussions with the Executive Board, division heads or the responsible partners of the auditor if this\u00a0appeared necessary to go into more detail on individual topics and issues. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported on the main results of these discussions at the following meeting of the Audit Committee. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reports on the work and proposals of the Audit Committee as well as on the content of individual discussions in the respective subsequent Supervisory Board meeting. The members attended the meetings of the Audit Committee as shown in the table on page\u00a014. The format of the respective meeting is also shown there, as these meetings are held both in person and as a video conference. Informative value of financial reporting and monitoring of the accounting process The preparation of the annual financial statements and annual report of a German public limited company is the sole responsibility of the Executive Board. According to \u00a7\u00a0243\u00a0(2)\u00a0HGB, the annual financial statements must be clear and concise and provide a realistic overview of the company?s economic situation. This is in line with the requirements of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, according to which the annual financial statements and annual report must be accurate, balanced and understandable. Against this background, the Executive Board is convinced ? although the assessment was not delegated to the Audit Committee ? that the submitted annual report meets the requirements of both legal systems. In order to also satisfy ourselves of the informative value of the annual financial statements and the interim\u00a0reporting, we were informed in detail by the Executive Board about the business development and the financial situation of the Group in the four Audit Committee meetings, which took place immediately before the publication of the respective financial statements. The corresponding reports were discussed. If the auditor had conducted an audit or review, the auditors reported on the results of the audit at these meetings in detail on important aspects of the financial statements and on the results of the audit or the auditor?s review. According to the\u00a0DCGK\u00a0discussions should take place in the absence of the Executive Board on a regular basis. In the past financial year, the Audit Committee was also regularly given this opportunity. This applies in particular to the audit of the financial statements. In the past financial year, the Audit Committee also discussed with the auditor the assessment of the audit risk, the audit strategy and audit planning as well as the audit results. In addition, the Chairman of the Audit Committee regularly discussed the progress of the audit with the auditor and reported to the Audit Committee on each occasion. In order to monitor accounting, we dealt intensively with individual aspects. As in previous years,\u00a0TUI?s economic development was a central topic in our meetings. In particular, we received detailed reports from\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board on the measures taken to refinance the company. In addition, we considered the accounting treatment of significant balance sheet items, in particular goodwill, specific provisions as well as the development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s equity. In consultation with the auditor, we assured ourselves that the assumptions and estimates underlying the accounting were appropriate. Furthermore, material aspects arising from the operational business were acknowledged by the Audit Committee. In the reporting period, we dealt in particular with the following individual aspects: Even before the outbreak of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board initiated optimisation processes with regard to the structure of working capital and the associated cash flows. These measures also included the further development of a central finance area. Structured working capital management was also extended to the subsidiaries. We were regularly informed about these projects in our meetings. Also after the outbreak of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, these processes were accompanied by strict cost control. As in previous years, we received detailed reports on the corresponding measures. In addition, the consistency of the reconciliation to the key figure ?underlying\u00a0EBIT? and the significant items\u00a0(adjustments) eliminated here were discussed for each quarterly report and for the annual financial statements. In this context, the going concern report prepared by the company was also discussed to verify the relevant\u00a0going concern statements in the half-year report and the annual financial statements. The viability statement to be issued in the annual financial statements under the regulations of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0was also the subject of discussion. The report of the Chairman of the Audit Committee on the monitoring of transactions with related parties within the business year was also discussed. Since none of the transactions ? neither on an individual nor on a cumulative basis ? exceeded the defined threshold value in the reporting year, a control of the monitored individual matters was carried out. Since the introduction of mandatory reporting on corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the management report, the Supervisory Board has been responsible for reviewing the content of these disclosures. The\u00a0Supervisory Board decided to seek support of the auditor, Deloitte, in reviewing the disclosures. Accordingly, we have been informed of the results of the auditor?s review and are of the opinion that the information published in the\u00a0CSR\u00a0Report is appropriate and adequate. Our assessment of all aspects of accounting and financial reporting discussed is consistent with the assessment of the Executive Board and the auditor. On\u00a021\u00a0November\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0received a letter from the\u00a0UK\u00a0regulator (FRC) with respect to the inclusion of\u00a0TUI\u00a0in\u00a0the selection for their thematic review on earnings per share (IAS\u00a033). The letter raised no questions requiring\u00a0a response or further correspondence with the\u00a0FRC. The schedule to the letter set out a number of observations on the reporting for earnings per share in\u00a0TUI?s Annual Report for the year ended\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02021.\u00a0The observations and the recommendations made in the\u00a0FRC?s publication on their thematic review of earnings per share (IAS\u00a033) have been taken into account in the preparation of the\u00a02023\u00a0Annual Report. The\u00a0FRC?s review is based on the published Annual Report and Accounts and does not benefit from detailed\u00a0knowledge of the business or an understanding of the underlying transactions. lt provides no assurance that the Annual Report and Accounts is correct in all material respects. The\u00a0FRC?s role is not to verify the\u00a0information provided, but to consider compliance with reporting requirements. The\u00a0FRC\u00a0accepts no liability for reliance on the\u00a0FRC?s review by the Company or any third party, including but not limited to investors and shareholders. On\u00a022\u00a0August\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0received a letter from the German regulator (BaFin) ordering a random audit of the annual report as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02022. The scope of the audit comprises the reporting on the macroeconomic environment, the consideration of climate-related risks, the maintenance provisions in connection with aircraft lease agreements and specific notes to the financial statements. BaFin?s catalogues of questions received on\u00a030\u00a0August and\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023\u00a0were answered by\u00a0TUI\u00a0in due time respectively. Effectiveness of the control and risk management system The Audit Committee is guided in its legal obligation to deal with the effectiveness of the internal control and\u00a0risk management system by the conviction that a stable and effective internal control system is indispensable to ensure economic success in the long term. To fulfil its monitoring task, the Audit Committee is regularly informed about the maturity of the implemented controls and also about the further development of the internal control system. The Group has continuously developed its internal control system based on the\u00a0COSO\u00a0concept. The routine review of key financial controls is carried out by local management and monitored by the Executive Board. In the largest source markets, the\u00a0UK\u00a0and Germany, other internal controls are also reviewed. The compliance function in the Group is further divided into the areas of finance, legal and\u00a0IT. This division\u00a0plays an essential role in the identification of further control needs and the permanent improvement of existing controls. In addition, the auditor also reports on any weaknesses in the Group?s accounting-related control system that it identifies, and management follows up on their timely elimination. The Audit Committee receives regular reports on the effectiveness of the risk management system, as shown in the risk report starting on page\u00a035. The Risk Oversight Committee that has been set up is of crucial importance within the group. We are convinced that an adequate risk management system is in place. The internal audit department ensures the independent monitoring of the implemented processes and\u00a0systems as well as the significant projects and reports directly to the Audit Committee at each regular meeting. During the reporting period, the Audit Committee was not informed of any audit findings that indicated\u00a0material weaknesses in the internal control system or the risk management system. In addition, regular discussions take place between the Chairman of the Audit Committee and the Director of Internal Audit for closer coordination. The annual audit planning is carried out in an agile manner. The Audit Committee has received detailed reports on the methodology and has taken note of and approved it, together with the audits for the coming financial year that have already been determined in this context. The Audit Committee believes that the regular coordination ensures the effectiveness of the internal audit. In the course of our meetings, we were again informed in this business year about the implementation and\u00a0guarantee of the regulations of the European Data Protection Regulation (EU\u00a0GDPR) in the individual business areas. Based on this report, we are convinced that the projects continuously initiated and measures taken throughout the Group for this purpose are designed to fulfil the requirements of the\u00a0EU\u00a0GDPR. Whistleblowing systems for employees in the event of compliance violations A standardised whistleblowing system has been set up in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group through which employees can draw attention to possible breaches of compliance guidelines. As part of the reporting on the legal compliance system, we were presented with the key findings from the whistleblower system in the past financial year. Review of the independence and objectivity of the auditor For financial year\u00a02023, the Audit Committee recommended to the Supervisory Board that Deloitte GmbH\u00a0Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (Deloitte) be proposed to the Annual General Meeting as auditors. Following the appointment of Deloitte as auditors by the Annual General Meeting in February\u00a02023, the Supervisory Board commissioned Deloitte to audit the\u00a02023\u00a0financial statements. The Audit Committee had Deloitte explain to it in advance the audit plan for the annual financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. This plan includes the main focal points of the audit and the group of companies to be audited from the Group?s perspective. The Audit Committee is convinced that this plan ensures that\u00a0the audit adequately takes into account the identifiable risks. It also considers the independence and objectivity of the auditor to be given and has also established with the quality of the audit within the framework of a structured survey. Based on regular reporting by the auditor, we have satisfied ourselves of the effectiveness of the external audit and have decided to recommend to the Supervisory Board that Deloitte be proposed to the Annual General Meeting as auditor again for financial year\u00a02024. Deloitte was selected by us as auditor in a public tender process in financial year\u00a02016\u00a0and has been appointed as auditor without interruption since the first election by the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02017. In order to ensure the independence of the auditor, all engagements for the provision of non-audit services by the auditor must be submitted to the Audit Committee for approval before the engagement is awarded. The Audit Committee makes use of the possibility to delegate the approval to the company depending on the size of the order. The chairperson of the Audit Committee is only involved in the decision if a fixed cost limit is exceeded. If the auditor provided services to the group outside of the audit, the nature and amount\u00a0of these services were explained to the Audit Committee. This procedure is in line with the company?s existing policy on the approval of non-audit services, which takes into account the requirements of the regulations of the Audit Reform Act (AReG) on prohibited non-audit services and on limitations on the amount of non-audit services. Worldwide, the non-audit services amounted to ?\u00a02.1\u00a0m. The audit fee received by the auditor, excluding voluntary audits, amounted to ?\u00a08.6\u00a0m. The corresponding non-audit services accounted for approximately\u00a024\u00a0% of Deloitte?s audit fees. I would like to thank the members of the Audit Committee, the auditors, the Executive Board and all employees involved for their trusting and committed cooperation in the past financial year. Hanover,\u00a04\u00a0December\u00a02023 Prof. Dr Edgar ErnstChairman of the Audit Committee TUI Group Strategy Tourism is a growth sector driven by strong fundamentals The travel and tourism market is a significant contributor to the global economy1, growing above global\u00a0GDP\u00a0levels pre-pandemic2. Demand for tourism is driven by strong fundamental trends\u00a0? people living longer, healthier lives; the growth of middle classes across the globe, which increases disposable income; and the desire for experiences, of which travel plays a significant part. This demand has proved highly resilient ? after the disruption of\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0and resulting travel restrictions, international arrivals are expected to return\u00a0almost to pre-pandemic levels in\u00a020233. At\u00a0TUI, we experienced a strong uplift in bookings for our destinations on the easing of government travel restrictions during the pandemic, and in Summer\u00a02023, Markets &amp; Airlines customer numbers rebounded almost completely to Summer\u00a02019\u00a0levels, coupled with a strong\u00a08\u00a0% increase in average selling price versus prior season, and\u00a026\u00a0% increase versus Summer\u00a02019. Therefore, we expect leisure tourism to continue to be an attractive growth market over the long-term. The industry still faces some key challenges. Cost inflation (driven by higher energy costs and labour supply shortages), higher interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations all impact supplier cost bases, as well as putting a squeeze on household income and hence consumer sentiment. In turn, this reinforces customer needs for brands which they can depend on, and which deliver choice and flexibility in configuring the right product for them.\u00a0TUI?s focus on delivering quality to our customers while increasing choice and flexibility, both in terms of our product offer, and by increasing the flexibility of flight and hotel sourcing, mean that we can deliver growth by offering value and choice, without additional risk capacity. Climate change is a pressing global challenge. There is an urgency to act and for everyone to play a role in\u00a0the transition to a low carbon economy.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has committed to Science Based Targets, in order to significantly reduce carbon emissions in our airline, hotels and cruise business by\u00a02030, with a further commitment to reach net-zero by\u00a02050\u00a0at the latest. In addition, our Sustainability Agenda sets out our wider commitments to sustainability, in terms of People, Planet and Progress. Also see page 26 ? 27 and the Non-financial Group Declaration from page 81 onwards. 1\u00a0Based on\u00a0WTTC\u00a0Economic Impact Research 2023\u00a0? Travel &amp; Tourism sector contributed 10.3 % to global\u00a0GDP\u00a0in 2019; this decreased to 5.3 % in 2020, 6.1 % in 2021 and 7.6 % in 2022, due to government restrictions on mobility. However, Travel &amp; Tourism\u00a0GDP\u00a0is expected to reach 95 % of 2019 levels in 2023. 2\u00a0Based on\u00a0UNWTO\u00a0international travel arrivals\u00a0CAGR\u00a0versus global\u00a0GDP\u00a0CAGR\u00a0for 2015 to 2019 3\u00a0UNWTO\u00a0World Tourism Barometer September\u00a02023 TUI?s business model ? foundation for success TUI\u00a0is a leisure experiences group covering the entire holiday journey, serving millions of customers, operating\u00a0126\u00a0aircraft,\u00a0424\u00a0hotels (including our concept hotels) and\u00a016\u00a0cruise ships4, as well as a sizeable experiences, transfers and tours business. The group is structured into two divisions ? Holiday Experiences and Markets &amp; Airlines. Holiday Experiences delivers differentiated content in hotels, cruises, experiences, transfers and tours: Our hotel portfolio consists of own and differentiated leisure brands such as Robinson,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Magic Life,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Blue and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Suneo, complemented by\u00a0JV\u00a0hotel brands such as Riu, Atlantica, Blue Diamond and Grupotel. The portfolio is well-diversified in terms of product offer, destination mix and ownership models, and benefits from multi-channel and multi-source market distribution via Markets &amp; Airlines, direct to customer, and via third parties such as Online Travel Agents (OTAs) and tour operators mainly outside our own source markets.  Our three cruise brands (Mein Schiff, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, Marella) cover the cruises sector from premium all-inclusive to luxury to expeditions, with leading positions in the German-speaking and\u00a0UK\u00a0markets5, benefitting from multi-channel distribution via Markets &amp; Airlines, direct to customer and via third parties.  TUI\u00a0Musement is one of the largest6\u00a0digital providers in the online intermediary market for tours and activities, including experiences (excursions, activities and tickets) and tous (multi-day tours), connecting our own and third party product portfolio in destinations with Markets &amp; Airlines customers, direct to customer and via third parties; as well as providing transfers and customer support in the destination. 4\u00a0As at 30 September 2023, including concept hotels in third party properties 5\u00a0As measured by capacities 6\u00a0As measured by market share Markets &amp; Airlines distributes and fulfills holidays to a large customer base in more than a dozen source markets.\u00a0TUI\u00a0is (according to consumer surveys for unaided brand awareness and consideration) a leading tourism brand7. We differentiate ourselves from the competition (such as tour operators,\u00a0OTAs, hotels and airlines) based on our products and services. By covering the whole customer journey,\u00a0TUI\u00a0holds multiple digital and physical touchpoints with its customers, and therefore delivers a strong blend of digital and human interaction. This enables\u00a0TUI\u00a0to follow a customer centric approach, aiming to create long-term relationships with its customers. As a vertically integrated group, it is also important to leverage cross-sell and upsell potential across all divisions, and the power of our brand in order to reduce cost of sales. Our Central Customer Ecosystem creates the basis of this, covering all aspects of marketing, sales and service. TUI?s strategy for profitable growth As demand recovers post-pandemic\u00a0TUI\u00a0is committed to delivering profitable growth. We have already laid the foundations for this, and delivery is underway. Our strategy is defined across both of our business divisions, embedded onto one central customer ecosystem, underpinned by our Sustainability Agenda and by our people. The framework for implementation can be visualized with our ?strategy diamond?, based on five key elements ? Holiday Experiences, Markets &amp; Airlines, Central Customer Ecosystem, Sustainability and People. 7\u00a0As measured by brand consideration in\u00a0TUI\u00a0brand performance tracking, completed by Metrixlab HOLIDAY EXPERIENCES Our Holiday Experiences strategy focusses on asset-right, profitable growth in differentiated content and expanding the customer base with multi-channel distribution, in particular outside Markets &amp; Airlines. In Hotels &amp; Resorts, product growth is delivered by expanding our portfolio in new and existing destinations. In financial year\u00a02023\u00a0we added\u00a041\u00a0new hotels to our pipeline. Growth in hotels is based on an asset-right and scaleable approach ? through our joint ventures, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Global Hotel Fund, launched by\u00a0TUI\u00a0and partners, and management and franchise contracts. We have continued to develop and enhance our own global distribution platform, with a focus on global distribution alongside our existing source markets; and we are also expanding our appeal across customer segments, with launch of new brands. Product growth in Cruises is driven by investment into new-build ships by our\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises\u00a0JV, with three new ships being delivered over the next three years. In addition, we are continuing Marella?s fleet upgrade, by replacing older ships with newer, larger ones, including the launch of Voyager in June\u00a02023\u00a0(previously Mein Schiff Herz). Customer growth will be driven by a broader marketing positioning for both\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises and Marella. In\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement, we have realigned our strategy to digitalise all three business sectors ? experiences (excursions, activities and tickets), transfers and tours (multi-day tours), with a strong focus on delivering profitable growth from the marketing of our own products across all channels, and investing in particular in\u00a0more of our own products. In this way, we simultaneously differentiate and position ourselves in the attractive producer margin area. The digitization of the Experiences segment has already been completed (with the acquisition in\u00a02018\u00a0and subsequent integration of the Musement platform), and we are now focusing on the Tours and Transfers segments. This will help us generate further customer growth. MARKETS &amp; AIRLINES Our Markets &amp; Airlines strategy focusses on strengthening and leveraging our capabilities (including brand and distribution, differentiated and exclusive product, quality and service) and market positions, with growth delivered from new products and new customers, based on scaleable common platforms. Product growth is based on an expanded offer of accommodation only, flight only, car rentals, ancillaries and tours, as well as increasing the volume and proportion of dynamic packaging and supply, to deliver choice, flexibility and hence growth, without increasing risk capacity. Customer growth is driven by this increase in choice and flexibility, as we enlarge our appeal across more customer segments, supported by our brand and marketing strategy, and initiatives such as the relaunch of First Choice in the\u00a0UK\u00a0which targets new, especially younger, customers. To increase efficiency and scaleability, we grow based on common platforms and central production. This year, we rolled-out our group-wide platforms for accommodation only, flight only and dynamic packaging to more markets, as well as continuing to develop and enhance the capabilities of these platforms. In\u00a0TUI\u00a0Airline, we operate a strong leisure network, with a high degree of integration with our Markets, on a modern and fuel efficient fleet. We leverage these strengths and continue to deliver transformation through increased flexibility and cost efficiency. CENTRAL CUSTOMER ECOSYSTEM As well as growing customer volumes, our marketing and distribution strategy focuses on maximizing customer value, leveraging the synergies between both of our business divisions, and lowering our cost of distribution. As the basis for this, we will continue to strengthen and leverage the\u00a0TUI\u00a0brand in existing and untapped customer segments and broaden our brand image for our growth products (such as cities, tours, accommodation only and experiences). We continue to enhance our app with a focus on native bookflows, targeting futher growth in the proportion of digital sales made in-app. Our customer relation management strategy is focused on growing the marketing base through improved permission capture, extension of automated marketing to all products and channels, and growing revenue by improved cross-channel marketing.\u00a0We also continue to streamline the digital customer experience via the operation of a single customer account and implementing a common payment process. All of this facilitates a full product suite offering and cross-selling, and increases the number of holiday and experience touchpoints we have with the customer, whilst at the same time reducing our cost of sales. Sustainability agenda ?People, Planet, Progress? As an industry leading Group, we want to set the standard for sustainability in the market. We believe that sustainable transformation should not be viewed solely as a cost factor, but that sustainability pays off ? for society, for the environment, and for economic development. Our strategy is therefore underpinned by clear science-based goals and targets on sustainability.\u00a0TUI?s Sustainability Agenda consists of three building blocks\u00a0? People, Planet and Progress. For details please refer to page\u00a082. PEOPLE We will ensure that local people and communities benefit from tourism and the local supply chain.  We will empower a generation of sustainability changemakers.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Care Foundation will drive positive social and environmental impacts in tourism communities around the world. PLANET In\u00a02023, our emission reduction targets were recognised by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).\u00a0TUI\u00a0commits to implementing these targets in line with the latest climate science findings.  We will achieve net-zero emissions across our operations and supply chain by\u00a02050\u00a0at the latest. We will change the way we use natural resources and become a circular business. PROGRESS Together with our partners, we will co-create the next-generation sustainable business model for the tourism industry through our Destination Co-Lab Rhodes.  We will enable our customers to make sustainable holiday choices in every stage of the customer journey. We already operate one of Europe?s most carbon-efficient airlines and we aim to continuously improve our environmental performance. We will build on the progress we have already made and reduce emissions further through our commitment to science-based targets and our emission reduction roadmap. In\u00a02023, relative carbon emissions of our airlines decreased by\u00a03.9\u00a0%. This improvement was primarily driven by higher load factors versus\u00a02022, as well as our re-fleeting programme, with older aircraft being replaced by new, more carbon-efficient aircraft. In\u00a02023, we still operated\u00a019\u00a0Boeing\u00a0787\u00a0aircraft. In the period under review, our Boeing\u00a0737\u00a0Max fleet grew from\u00a035\u00a0to\u00a037\u00a0aircraft. Further information is provided on pages 85 to 90 People strategy ? digital, engaging, inclusive Our employees make a key contribution to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s success. Our goal is to secure that success in the long term. In the period under review, we focussed on the continuation of our strategic initiatives defined in the framework of our People Strategy. The vision of our People Strategy is to be digital, engaging and inclusive. In order to implement our strategy, six relevant areas of action have been defined: 1. Simplification, harmonisation and focus 2. Digital transformation 3. Supporting growth 4. Positive employee experience 5. Diversity, equity and inclusion 6. Facilitating top performance We are thus seeking to create a framework that empowers our employees to deliver the best performance and succeed as a team. Further information is provided on pages 91 to 98. TUI\u00a0is set for profitable growth Having driven the recovery post-pandemic, delivered our Global Realignment Programme and defined our strategy,\u00a0TUI\u00a0is well positioned and committed to capturing market growth. The execution of our strategy is well underway. As a result,\u00a0TUI\u00a0will continue to grow its differentiated Holiday Experience and Markets &amp; Airlines product offerings, grow the volume and value of its customer ecosystem, increase flexibility for our customers and operations, and maximise efficiencies and synergies within the business. Corporate Profile Group Structure TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0parent company TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s parent company headquartered in Hanover. It holds direct or, via its affiliates, indirect interests in the principal Group companies conducting the Group?s operating business in individual countries. Overall,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s group of consolidated companies comprised\u00a0266\u00a0direct and indirect subsidiaries at the balance sheet date. A further\u00a020\u00a0affiliated companies and\u00a027\u00a0joint ventures were included in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements on the basis of at equity measurement. For details on principles and methods underlying the consolidated financial statements and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group shareholders, see page 190 and 281. Organisation and management TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is a stock corporation under German law, whose basic principle is two-tiered management by two boards, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. The Executive and Supervisory Boards cooperate\u00a0closely in governing and monitoring the Company. The Executive Board is responsible for the overall management of the Company. The appointment and removal of Board members are based on Sections\u00a084\u00a0et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act in combination with Section\u00a031\u00a0of the German Co-Determination Act. Amendments to the Articles of Association are effected on the basis of the provisions of Sections\u00a0179\u00a0et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act in combination with Section\u00a024\u00a0of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Articles of Association if applicable.

With its six ?Mein\u00a0Schiff? vessels,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises is top-ranked in the German-speaking market for cruises. The Insight Guides (formerly Berlitz Cruise Guide), an international reference for cruise ship ratings, ranked all six ships operated by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises into high positions in the four-stars category. The Mein Schiff Herz was transferred to the Marella Cruises fleet in Q3\u00a02023. The commissioning of three newly built ships is planned for the coming years, which will bring the fleet to a total of nine ships. After the pandemic years,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises is thus continuing its growth as planned. The traditional Hapag-Lloyd Cruises brand, which is also part of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises, is a leading provider of luxury and expedition cruises in German-speaking markets. At the reporting date, the fleet comprised two luxury liners and three expedition cruise ships. They are the only ships worldwide to have each been awarded a five-star rating by Insight Guides. This makes Hapag-Lloyd Cruises the winner of the title of best fleet worldwide. With a fleet of five ships, Marella Cruises offers voyages in different segments, including family and city cruises, in the British market. The former Mein Schiff Herz joined the fleet as Marella Voyager in June\u00a02023. TUI Musement The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segment delivers local services at our holiday destinations around the world. To do this\u00a0TUI\u00a0is present in numerous holiday destinations with its own staff.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement?s business model for the distribution of experiences (excursions, activities), tickets and tours (multi-day tours) is based on an online platform open to customers and suppliers. In addition, transfers are provided in the destinations. TUI\u00a0Musement serves three customer groups: TUI\u00a0customers: Providing services to our guests in the destination via service and operation teams and tour guides as well as via the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Digital Assistant App and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Experience Center.  Strategic B2B customers: Digital and on-site services for partners from various sectors of the travel industry, such as airlines, cruise lines, ground transport,\u00a0OTAs and tour operators.  B2C Open Market clients: Global distribution of tours, activities and experiences for travellers. Markets &amp; Airlines With our three regions ? Northern, Central and Western ? we have well-positioned sales and marketing structures offering our customers attractive holiday experiences. Our sales activities are based on online and offline channels. The travel agencies include Group-owned agencies as well as joint ventures and agencies operated by third parties. In order to offer our customers a wide choice of hotels, our source market organisations have access to a large portfolio of\u00a0TUI\u00a0hotels. They also have access to third-party hotel bed capacity, some of which has been contractually committed. Our own flying capacity continues to play a key role in our business model. Thanks to a combination of Group-owned and third-party capacity, we offer tailored travel programmes for each individual source market region and can respond flexibly to changes in customer preferences. Balanced management of flight and hotel capacity enables us to develop destinations and optimise the margins of both service providers. Northern Region The Northern Region segment comprises tour operator activities and airlines in the\u00a0UK, Ireland and the\u00a0Nordics. Our strategic venture Sunwing Travel Inc., Canada, sold its tour operation business, which was previously included in this segment, in May\u00a02023. Central Region The Central Region segment comprises the tour operators and airlines in Germany and the tour operator activities in Austria, Poland, and Switzerland. Western Region The Western Region segment comprises the tour operators and airlines in Belgium and the Netherlands and the tour operator activities in France. All other segments ?All other segments? includes amongst others the corporate centre functions of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the interim holdings, the Group?s real estate companies and the Group?s key tourism functions. The future markets business, which has also been shown in All other segment so far, was resegmented to Hotels &amp; Resorts,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement and Central Region in financial year\u00a02023. Research and development As a tourism service provider, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group does not engage in research and development activities comparable with manufacturing companies. This sub-report is therefore omitted. Value-oriented Group Management Management system and key performance indicators A standardised management system has been created to implement value-driven management across the Group as a whole and in its individual business segments. The value-oriented management system is an integral part of consistent Group-wide controlling and planning processes. Our key financial performance indicators for tracking our earnings position are revenue and underlying\u00a0EBIT. Accordingly, underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0represents the segment indicator as defined by\u00a0IFRS\u00a08. We define the\u00a0EBIT\u00a0in underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0as earnings before interest, taxes and expenses for the measurement of the Group?s interest hedges.\u00a0EBIT\u00a0by definition includes impairment of goodwill. Underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0has been adjusted for income and expense items which, due to their level and frequency, impact or distort the assessment of operating profitability in the segments and the Group. These one-off items include gains on disposal of investments, major gains and losses from the disposal of assets, and major restructuring and integration expenses. The indicator is additionally adjusted for all effects from purchase price allocations, ancillary acquisition costs and conditional purchase price payments. The reconciliation to underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0also adjusts for goodwill impairments. To track the Group?s financial position in financial year\u00a02023, we identified net capital expenditure and financial investments as well as\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s net financial position as key performance indicators. In addition, we monitor the Group?s leverage ratio as a further indicator of financial stability. Key management variables used for regular value analysis are Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) and Economic Value Added.\u00a0ROIC\u00a0is compared with the weighted average cost of capital before tax (WACC). We regard specific carbon emissions (in g\u00a0CO2\u00a0/ pkm) from our aircraft fleet as a key non-financial performance indicator. To track business performance in our segments in the course of the year, we also monitor other non-financial\u00a0performance indicators, such as the customer numbers in tour operation, capacity or passenger days, occupancy and average prices in Hotels &amp; Resorts and Cruises. Information on operating performance indicators is provided in the sections on\u00a0Segmental performance (page 67), the\u00a0Non-financial Group declaration (page 81) and in the Report on Expected Developments (page 55). Cost of capital The cost of capital is calculated as the weighted average cost of equity and debt (WACC). While the cost of equity reflects the return expected by investors from\u00a0TUI\u00a0shares, the cost of debt is based on the average borrowing costs for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. The cost of capital always shows pre-tax costs, i. e. costs before corporate and investor taxes. The expected return determined in this way corresponds to the same tax level as the underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0included in\u00a0ROIC. For financial year\u00a02023, we apply a cost of capital of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group of\u00a011.76\u00a0% (previous year:\u00a012.63\u00a0%). ROIC\u00a0and Economic Value Added ROIC\u00a0is calculated as the ratio of underlying earnings before interest and taxes (underlying\u00a0EBIT) to average invested interest-bearing capital (invested capital). Given its definition, this performance indicator is not influenced by any tax or financial factors and has been adjusted for one-off effects. From a Group perspective, invested capital is derived from liabilities, comprising\u00a0equity (including non-controlling interests) and the balance of interest-bearing liabilities and interest-bearing\u00a0assets with an adjustment for the seasonality of the Group?s net financial position. The cumulative amortisations\u00a0of purchase price allocations are then added to the invested capital. Apart from\u00a0ROIC\u00a0as a relative performance indicator, Economic Value Added is used as an absolute value-oriented performance indicator. Economic Value Added is calculated as the product of\u00a0ROIC\u00a0less associated pre-tax capital costs (WACC) multiplied by interest-bearing invested capital. In the year under review,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0ROIC\u00a0amounted to\u00a019.10\u00a0% (previous year:\u00a07.49\u00a0%). Taking into account the Group?s weighted average cost of capital of\u00a011.76\u00a0%, this resulted in an Economic Value Addded of ?\u00a0375.6\u00a0m (previous year: negative Economic Value Addded of ? ?\u00a0280.7\u00a0m).</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\"

Group earnings before interest (including the result of the measurement of the Group?s interest hedges) and taxes on a constant currency basis developed as follows in the financial year under review:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"584\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Reconciliation\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">999.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">FX\u00a0effects from translation to budget rates</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a08.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBIT\u00a0at budget rates</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">991.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">JEV-relevant cash flow before dividend The second Group key figure taken into account in the\u00a0JEV\u00a0in accordance with the remuneration system is the cash flow figure ?cash flow before dividends?, which is included in the calculation with a weighting of\u00a025\u00a0%. For these purposes, cash flow before dividends is generally calculated using a simplified approach based on the management cash flow statement. The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0EBIT\u00a0is also generally adjusted for currency effects for this purpose. This basic rule was deviated from for the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. The deviations are explained below: When adopting the resolution on the target setting for the\u00a0JEV\u00a0in September\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0took into account the particular effects on the originally planned cash flow component resulting from the changes in accounting regulations that have occurred since the remuneration system was established. In September\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board decided to use total cash flow as the second Group key performance indicator for determining the target achievement of the\u00a0JEV. The total cash flow corresponds to the cash flow after dividends (?\u00a0571.0\u00a0m) plus the cash inflow from capital increases through the issue of new shares (?\u00a01,760.9\u00a0m) less payments for financing / leasing (?\u00a02,021.4\u00a0m). For the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year, it amounts to ?\u00a0310.5\u00a0m. The cash flow after dividends in turn results from the cash flow before dividends (?\u00a0708.1\u00a0m) less a coupon on a silent partnership (?\u00a016.8\u00a0m) and dividends from subsidiaries to non-controlling interests (?\u00a0120.3\u00a0m). When adopting the resolution on target achievement, the Supervisory Board also exercised its right to adjust the conditions of the\u00a0JEV\u00a0at its reasonable discretion in the event of extraordinary events or developments in order to take account of rare special situations that were not adequately covered by the defined targets. The cash inflow from capital increases through the issue of new shares (?\u00a01,760.9\u00a0m) was therefore deducted from the above-mentioned total cash flow (?\u00a0310.5\u00a0m) and the following items were increased: Payments for the revolving credit line (?\u00a0561.2\u00a0m), payments for the repayment of hybrid capital (?\u00a0682.4\u00a0m)\u00a0and payments for the repayment of promissory note and\u00a0WSF\u00a0loans (?\u00a0241.7\u00a0m). Taking into account payments for other items, the total cash flow excluding one-off financing effects totalled ?\u00a033.5\u00a0m. The following items\u00a0were added back in order to reconcile to the cash flow relevant to\u00a0JEV: Dividend from Riu\u00a0II\u00a0to Riu for the\u00a0establishment of a new subsidiary (?\u00a075.0\u00a0m), payments for the investment in a new subsidiary (?\u00a073.5\u00a0m), payments already received in the previous year from the Riu earn-out (?\u00a017.1\u00a0m) and other payments (?\u00a07.4\u00a0m). This results in a\u00a0JEV-relevant cash flow of ?\u00a0206.5\u00a0m. As a result of the adjustments to take account of the special situations, the cash flow relevant to\u00a0JEV\u00a0fell by around ?\u00a0100\u00a0m to ?\u00a0206.5\u00a0m, which also led to a lower target achievement for\u00a0JEV. Pro-forma underlying earnings per share The measurement of the long-term incentive plan (LTIP) for the Executive Board is exclusively based on the average development of pro forma underlying earnings per share from continuing operations (LTIP-relevant\u00a0EPS). The table below shows\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s pro forma underlying earnings per share. The normalised Group tax rate for the year under review is\u00a018\u00a0%, the prior year rate was reduced to\u00a00\u00a0% against the background of the considerable decline in earnings caused by\u00a0COVID-19.

Risk Report Successful management of existing and emerging risks is critical to the long-term success of our business and to the achievement of our strategic objectives. In order to seize market opportunities and leverage the potential for success, risk must be accepted to a reasonable degree. Risk management is therefore an integral component of the Group?s Corporate Governance. At\u00a0TUI, managing risk has always been a vital part of how we conduct our business. At\u00a0TUI\u00a0we incorporate all\u00a0elements of a fully developed risk management system. It is not limited to identifying only those developments\u00a0that could jeopardise the companies continued existence, it also includes the active management of all other material risks. Risk management is limited to risks only, short-term chances or opportunities are managed in the controlling process, whereas Group Strategy continuously identifies and monitors long-term chances. Legal risks are reported in a separate legal risk report. In financial year\u00a02023, the Group has conducted a Climate Scenario Analysis following the recommendations of the Task Force for Climate Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) initiative. Certain risks and opportunities resulting from projected climatical changes have been identified and assessed. Given the importance of climate change,\u00a0TUI\u00a0is using its established Risk Management Process to facilitate the management of these risks. Given the variety of potential impacts on our business and to report on these elements centrally, we\u00a0have decided to set up a new principal risk ?Climate change impacting our business model? (see principal risk\u00a010\u00a0on page\u00a048) These topics have been discussed intensively in two of our Group Risk Oversight Committee\u00a0meetings and results have been presented to both, the Group Executive Committee and the Audit Committee. Risk Governance Audit Committee ? Oversee &amp; Review The Audit Committee, as a subcommittee of the Supervisory Board, is overseeing the appopriateness and effectiveness of the risk management system. The Head of the Group Risk team reports minimum once a year on the system itself, on topics which have been discussed in the Group Risk Oversight Committee, the principal risks and their changes. The Committee considers the adequacy and the effectiveness of the risk management system and reviews and acknowledges the risk appetite on a principal risk level as formulated by the Executive Board. Executive Board ? Direct &amp; Assure With oversight by the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board determines the strategic direction of the Group and agrees the nature and extent of the risks it is willing to take to achieve its strategic objectives. Ultimate accountability for the Group?s risk management rests with the Executive Board and therefore it has established and maintains a risk management system to identify, assess, manage and monitor risks which could threaten the existence of the company or have a significant impact on the achievement of its strategic objectives: these are referred to as the principal risks of the Group. This risk management system includes an internally-published risk management policy which helps to reinforce the tone set from the top on risk, by instilling an appropriate risk culture in the organisation whereby employees are expected to be risk aware, control minded and to ?do the right thing?. The policy provides a formal structure for risk management to embed it in the fabric of the business. Each principal risk has assigned to it a member of the Executive Board as overall risk sponsor to ensure that there is clarity of responsibility and to ensure that each of the principal risks are understood fully and managed effectively. The Executive Board reports to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on the adherence to both the German legal and the\u00a0UK\u00a0listing requirements, the overall risk position of the Group, on the individual principal risks and their management, and on the performance and effectiveness of the risk management system as a whole. Group Risk Oversight Committee ? Review &amp; Communicate On behalf of the Executive Board, the Group Risk Oversight Committee (the\u00a0GROC), ensures that business risks are identified, assessed, managed and monitored across the businesses and functions of the Group. As a rule meeting on a quarterly basis, the\u00a0GROC?s responsibilities include considering the principal risks to the Group?s strategy and the risk appetite for each of those risks, assessing the operational effectiveness of the mitigation in place to manage those risks and any action plans to further mitigate them, as well as reviewing the bottom-up risk reporting from the businesses themselves to assess whether there are any heightened areas of concern. Chaired by the Chief Financial Officer, senior operational and finance management as well as those Central Functions which are fulfilling the role as a second line are represented on the committee. Leaders of Central Functions as well as senior executives from the Group?s major businesses are invited on a rotational basis to present on their risk and control framework. This allows members of the\u00a0GROC\u00a0to ask questions on the processes in place, the risks present in each business or function, as well as any new or evolving risks which may be on their horizon. It also provides opportunity to seek confirmation that an appropriate risk culture continues to be in place in each of the major businesses and that there are no gaps between risk management at business level and at function level. The\u00a0GROC\u00a0reports biannually to the Executive Board to ensure that it is kept abreast of changes in the risk\u00a0landscape and developments in the management of principal risks, and to facilitate regular quality discussions on risk management at the Executive Board meetings. Group Risk team ? support &amp; report The Executive Board has also established a Group Risk team to ensure that an adequate risk management system is set up and functions effectively and that the risk management policy is implemented appropriately across the Group. The team facilitates the risk management process by providing guidance, support and challenge to management whilst acting as the central point for coordinating, monitoring and reporting on\u00a0risk\u00a0across the Group. It also supports the\u00a0GROC\u00a0in fulfilling its duties and the reporting to both the Executive and Supervisory Boards. Additionally, Group Risk is responsible for the operation of the risk and control software that underpins the Group?s risk reporting and risk management process. Sector Risk &amp; Control ? COORDINATE, support &amp; report in Sector Sector risk and control teams work as the connecting element between businesses and the Group. They facilitate the risk management process in their respective areas by providing guidance support and reporting. They challenge management in identifying and assessing risks, hence ensuring proper sector governance. Businesses &amp; functions ? Identify, assess &amp; manage Every business and function in the Group is required to adopt the Group Risk Management policy. In order to do this, each either has their own risk committee or includes risk as a regular agenda item at their Board meetings to ensure that it receives the appropriate senior management attention within their business. In addition, the businesses each appoint a Risk Champion, who promotes the implementation of the risk management policy within their business and ensures its effective application. The Risk Champions are in close contact with the Group Risk team and are critical both in ensuring that the risk management system functions effectively, and in implementing a culture of continuous awareness and improvement in risk management and reporting. Risk Reporting The Group Risk team applies a consistent risk reporting methodology across the Group. This is underpinned by risk and control software which reinforces clarity of language, visibility of risks, mitigation and actions and accountability of ownership. Although the process of risk identification, assessment and response is continuous and embedded within the day-to-day operations of the businesses and functions, it is consolidated, reported and reviewed at varying levels throughout the Group on at least a quarterly basis. Risk Identification: Management closest to the risks identify those that are relevant to the pursuit of the strategy within their business area. A risk owner is assigned to each risk, who has the accountability and authority for ensuring that the risk is appropriately managed. Risk Assessment:\u00a0The methodology used is to initially assess the gross (or inherent) risk. This is essentially the downside, being the product of the impact together with the likelihood of the risk materialising if there is\u00a0no mitigation in place to manage or monitor the risk. In line with the Group budgeting horizon, risk assessment\u00a0is made for a timeframe of one year with longer horizons where necessary, e. g. in case of longer term projects.\u00a0The key benefit of assessing the gross risk is that it highlights the potential risk exposure if mitigation were\u00a0to fail completely or not be in place at all. Both impact and likelihood are scored using the criteria shown below.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"14\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_11\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col11\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col12\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col13\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col14\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Impact Assessment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">minor</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">moderate</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">SIGNIFICANT</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">major</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">SERIOUS</entry><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Impact on</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Impact on</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Impact on</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Impact on</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Impact on</entry><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financials (Sales and / or Costs)    Reputation    Technology reliability    Compliance    Health &amp; Safety standards    Programme Delivery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Financials (Sales and / or Costs)    Reputation    Technology reliability    Compliance    Health &amp; Safety standards    Programme Delivery</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Financials (Sales and / or Costs)    Reputation    Technology reliability    Compliance    Health &amp; Safety standards    Programme Delivery</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Financials (Sales and / or Costs)    Reputation    Technology reliability    Compliance    Health &amp; Safety standards    Programme Delivery</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Financials (Sales and / or Costs)    Reputation    Technology reliability    Compliance    Health &amp; Safety standards    Programme Delivery</entry><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Likelihood Assessment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">rare    &amp;lt; 10 %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">unlikely    10 ?

Consideration of these then enables the current (or residual) risk score to be assessed, which is essentially the reasonably foreseeable scenario. This measures the impact and likelihood of the risk with the mitigation in place and effective. The key benefit of assessing the current risk score is that it provides an understanding of the current level of risk faced today and the reliance on the mitigation in place. Risk Response: If management is comfortable that the current risk position is within the Group?s appetite, the risk is accepted and no further action is required to further reduce it. The mitigation continues to be operated and management monitors the risk, the mitigation and the risk landscape to ensure that it remains at an acceptable level. If management assesses that the current risk score is too high, an action plan will be drawn up with the objective of introducing new or stronger mitigation that will further reduce the impact and / or likelihood of the risk to an acceptable level. This is known as the target risk score and is the parameter by which management can ensure the risk is being managed in line with their overall risk appetite. The risk owner will normally be the individual tasked with ensuring that this action plan is implemented within an agreed timetable. Each business and function will continue to review their risk register on an ongoing basis through the mechanism appropriate for their business e. g. local Risk Committee. This bottom-up risk reporting is considered by the\u00a0GROC\u00a0alongside the Group?s principal risks. New risks are added to the Group?s risk register if deemed to be of a significant nature so that the ongoing status and the progression of key action plans can be managed in line with the Group?s targets and expectations. Ad hoc risk reporting Whilst there is a formal process in place for reporting on risks on a quarterly basis, the process of risk identification, assessment and response is continuous and therefore if required, risks can be reported to the\u00a0Executive Board outside of the quarterly process, should events dictate that this is necessary and appropriate. Ideally such ad hoc reporting is performed by the business or function which is closest to the risk, but it can be performed by the Group Risk team if necessary. Principal Risks To keep a manageable overview of the risks reported in the process, and to understand the changes in our\u00a0risk landscape, we map individual risk into a cluster of similar risks, which we report as principal risks. Principal risks are subject to the risk appetite assessment and are reported separately in this risk report. Oversight over of the Risk Management System Based on the work of the\u00a0GROC\u00a0and the Group Risk team, the Executive Board regularly reports to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board on the performance of the risk management system. Additionally, the Audit Committee receives assurance from Group Audit over a selection of principal risks, processes and business transformation initiatives most critical to the Group?s continued success. In accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0(4)\u00a0HGB\u00a0(German Commercial Code), the external auditor of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has audited the early detection system for risks, being a part of the Risk Management System. The early detection system is required by Section\u00a091\u00a0(2) AktG (German Stock Corporation Act) and the auditor has to conclude, if the system can fulfill its duties. Risk appetite The Executive Board and Audit Committee, in conjunction with the Group Risk Oversight Committee has reviewed the Group?s risk appetite. The results of the review indicate the board?s risk appetite across three risk types: Operational risks ? In the second summer season after pandemic restrictions, significant efforts have and are still undertaken internally and externally to stabilize the tourism value chain significantly at all levels and our offers have been close to normalised levels. We have therefore lowered our risk appetite from a medium-high level in the financial year\u00a02022\u00a0to a medium-low level with regards to all operational risks. However, tourism business has always been vulnerable to unforeseen external events and our business is prepared to manage such adverse events and our risk appetite is adapted to this: Since we cannot foresee the type or location of external events and their magnitude of impact to our business, we can ? in case events occur ? offer a variety of alternative products for rebooking. Further, we manage the situation on the ground for our colleagues and our customers already en route using our highly professional crisis management. In the financial year\u00a02023, wildfires on Southern Europe and an extensive heatwave in the Mediterranean has caused crisis management procedures. Compliance risks ?\u00a0a continued low risk tolerance with regard to compliance-related risks, including compliance\u00a0with regulatory requirements, the security of information in any form and the prevention of harm to customers, employees and all other stakeholders. Financial risks ? a continued ?elevated-low? risk tolerance with regard to financial risks due to volatile prices of important tourism expenses. With a fundamentally unchanged hedging policy, the hedging ratios for all input costs in foreign currency and fuel risks continue to be below the target values. We assume that the hedging ratios will approach the historical ratios again in the medium term. Our principal risks are aligned to these risk types. Adapting the risk appetite to the principal risks The principal risks to the Group are either considered to be ?Above? or ?Within? risk appetite. Risks above the appetite are those that either require further mitigation in order to reduce them to an acceptable position or are heightened by external events beyond our control. We have action plans in place to increase or strengthen mitigation around each of these risks and reduce the current risk score to the target level indicated in the heat map diagram. Risks within the appetite are those that considered to be at an acceptable level. For these, we have controls, processes and procedures in place as a matter of course that serve to mitigate each risk to either minimize the likelihood of the event occurring and / or minimise the impact if it does occur. These risks remain on our risk radar where we regularly monitor the risk, the mitigation and the risk landscape to ensure that the risk score stays stable and within our risk appetite in each case. In the heat map diagram, the assessment criteria used are shown on page 38. If the risk details in the subsequent tables do not suggest otherwise, the risks shown below relate to all\u00a0segments of the Group. The risks listed are the principal risks to which we are exposed but are not exhaustive and will evolve over time due to the dynamic nature of our business. Principal risks above risk appetite Nature of Risk 1. Lack of integration and flexibility within operations and IT systems The Group?s strategy is focused on driving profitable topline growth, based on growth in market share, customer growth, product growth, sustainability and winning team. A clearly defined and comprehensive set of strategic initiatives are in place to deliver this, covering five areas: Markets &amp; Airlines, Holiday Experiences, Central Customer Ecosystem, People and Sustainability. The Group?s strategy ensures that we are more vertically integrated, which reduces the impact of disruption by pure digital players. The overall strategy is to drive profitable topline growth whilst reducing our cost base. This involves the integration of our businesses and the development of core platform capabilities and technical infrastructure providing flexibility of\u00a0IT\u00a0services. Our focus is on enhancing our operations and customer experience by providing engaging, intuitive and seamless customer service through the delivery of these projects. The Group believes that this strategy positions well\u00a0TUI\u00a0for growth, and will further strengthen\u00a0TUI\u00a0versus the competition. However, the Group recognizes that there is a risk of ineffective strategic execution, arising from various factors including: Failure to notice and respond to structural shifts in market trends  Failure to prioritise strategic initiatives with the greatest impact for\u00a0TUI  Lack of resource to deliver strategic initiatives  Inadequate execution of strategic initiatives The lack of integration and flexibility within our systems and operations, particularly in the Markets &amp; Airline businesses can impact our competitiveness and our ability to provide a superior customer experience as well as to deliver on quality and operational efficiency. Mitigating Factors Evaluation of the current and future leisure experiences market landscape, based on analysis of consumer needs, development of supply, emerging trends, innovation, considerations of sustainability and resource availability  Regular updates on and discussion of strategic topics and initiatives at the\u00a0GEC, Executive Board and Supervisory Board  Allocation of resource to strategic initiatives, including product owners, project teams and budget  Approval of business cases relating to strategic initiatives by the appropriate body (in accordance with the Group?s Investment Approvals Policy)  Strategic initiatives and\u00a0KPIs incorporated into Budget and 3YP\u00a0process  Strong project management structures exist for all of the major restructuring, acquisition and disposal programs, which are underway to ensure that they are managed effectively.

Centralised management structures to oversee the Markets &amp; Airline businesses. Nature of Risk 2. Reduction in customer demand Spending on travel and tourism is discretionary and price sensitive as well as competitive. The economic\u00a0outlook remains uncertain. Furthermore, in recent years there has been an emergence of successful substitute business models such as web-based travel and hotel portals which allow end users to combine the individual elements of a holiday trip on their own and book them separately. There is the risk that these external factors within our industry will impact on the spending power as well as the desire to travel of our customers. This could impact our short-term growth rates and lead to margin erosion. The price increases observed in the year under review had no relevant impact on customer demand. Adverse climate conditions (heat-waves, droughts, heavy rain) bear the risk that customer demand for popular holiday destinations, where\u00a0TUI\u00a0is active, decline. This could impact our mid-term growth and the valuation of our hotel assets in these countries. Mitigating Factors Our market position as a globally operating tourism group, our brand and our integrated business model enables us to respond robustly to competitive threats.  The Group is characterised by the continuous development of new holiday experiences, developing new concepts and services which match the needs and preferences of our customers. Our strong and lasting relationships with our key hotel partners further reinforces our ability to develop new concepts exclusive to the Group.  The traditional package tour is becoming more diverse by combining low-cost flights with currently available hotels, even at short notice. This also creates new offers, such as city breaks. In the industry we call this process dynamic packaging. In addition, we also offer individual travel products separately, i. e. accommodation, flights, rental cars, insurance and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement products which are services ranging from excursions at the holiday destination to visits to museums in the city.  Experience shows that many consumers give high priority to their travel spending.  Leveraging our scale to keep costs down and prices competitive.  The multitude of source markets, which react to external shocks to varying degrees, can lead to a balancing effect.  Promoting the benefits of travelling with a globally operating tour operator to increase customer confidence and peace of mind.  With our asset right strategy in our hotels business, we aim a mix of owned, leased or other partnership arrangements to manage the investment into the holiday destinations. This secures capacity and thus limiting the financial investment. Nature of Risk 3. Insufficient cash flow Tourism is an inherently seasonal business with the majority of profits earned in the European summer months. Cash flows are similarly seasonal with the cash high occurring in the summer as advance payments and final balances are received from customers, with the cash low occurring in the winter as liabilities have to be settled with many suppliers after the end of the summer season. There is the risk that if we do not adequately manage cash balances through the winter low period this could impact on the Group?s liquidity and ability to settle liabilities as they fall due whilst ensuring that financial covenants are maintained. Mitigating Factors The Executive Board has continued to place significant focus on the review of the Group?s cash flow position during and after the\u00a0COVID-19 crisis period.  The strong demand for holidays has brought operations back to pre-pandemic levels in\u00a0FY23 and thus contributed towards improving the cash position.  With the positive cash flow in 2023 and, the financing measures implemented in the year under review (capital increase in April\u00a02023 and\u00a0RCF\u00a0prolongation in May\u00a02023 net of government handbacks), the Executive Board believes that, despite the existing risks, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group currently has and will continue to have sufficient funds resulting both from the borrowing and from operating cash flows to meet its payment obligations and to continue as a going concern.  Our focus on holiday experiences is helping to reduce the seasonality risk, as hotels, cruises and destination experiences have a more evenly distributed profit and cash profile across the year.  As our business is spread across a number of markets, there are some counter-cyclical features e. g. winter is a more important season for the Nordic and Canadian markets. Some brands, such as the\u00a0UK\u00a0ski brand Crystal Ski, have a different seasonality profile which helps to counter-balance the overall profile.  The business regularly produces both short term and long term cash forecasts during the year ? on a daily basis when needed ?, which the Treasury department use to manage cash resources effectively. We continue to maintain high-quality relationships with the Group?s key financiers.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s\u00a0RCF\u00a0and KfW credit line are subject to compliance with certain financial target values (covenants) for debt\u00a0coverage and interest coverage, the review of which is carried out based on the last four reported quarters\u00a0at the end of the financial year or the half-year of a financial year. As of 30\u00a0September\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0successfully complied with the financial covenants. Please refer to the Viability Statement on page 52 for further details on the measures taken this year. Nature of Risk 4. Volatility of input costs A significant proportion of operating expenses are in non-local currency and / or relate to aircraft and cruise fuel which therefore exposes the business to fluctuations in both exchange rates and fuel prices. There is the risk that if we do not manage the volatility of exchange rates, fuel prices and other input costs adequately, then this could result in increased costs and lead to margin erosion, impacting on our ability to achieve profit targets. Although we are still not back to prepandemic levels of hedging lines, we have significantly improved our positions against future volatilities for the upcoming winter and summer seasons. Furthermore, changes in macroeconomic conditions, such as those that were experienced as a result of the pandemic and other geopolitical events, like the war on Ukraine, can have an impact on fuel rates and exchange rates which, particularly for the \u00a3 / ? rate has a direct impact on the translation of non-euro market results into euros, the reporting currency of our Group. The increase in inflationary pressures has led to central banks increasing interest rates. Initially, the aggressive raising of\u00a0US\u00a0interest rates by the\u00a0US\u00a0Federal Reserve vs. a slower pace of monetary tightening by other central banks, most notably the\u00a0ECB, increased interest rate differentials and caused the\u00a0US\u00a0dollar to strengthen against other currencies such as the Euro and British Pound. Central banks are now expected to be nearing the peak of their interest rate hiking cycle, as inflation has generally been falling, but at a slower pace than many had anticipated. Whilst the\u00a0US\u00a0Federal Reserve was (and still is) expected to be amongst the first to cut rates, the resilience of the\u00a0US\u00a0economy means that\u00a0US\u00a0rates are expected to remain higher for longer. It is also the case that interest rates are likely to stay higher for longer in the Euro Zone and the\u00a0UK, but after a period of\u00a0US\u00a0dollar weakening against both\u00a0Euro and the British Pound, the resilience of the\u00a0US\u00a0economy has not yet seen the pivot to a weaker\u00a0US\u00a0dollar\u00a0to the extent that many market commentators have been predicting. Where the Group has unhedged exposures, any strengthening of the\u00a0US\u00a0dollar will have an adverse impact on input costs denominated in\u00a0US\u00a0dollars.\u00a0Conversely any weakening of the\u00a0US\u00a0dollar will have a beneficial impact on input costs denominated in\u00a0US\u00a0dollars. Mitigating Factors An established Hedging Committee that monitors the Group?s hedging position.  Ensuring that the appropriate derivative financial instruments are used to provide hedging cover for the underlying transactions involving fuel and foreign currency.  Maintaining an appropriate hedging policy to ensure that hedging cover is taken out ahead of the markets? customer booking profiles. This provides a degree of certainty over input costs when planning pricing and capacity, whilst also allowing some flexibility in prices so as to be able to respond to competitive pressures if necessary.  Tracking the foreign exchange and fuel markets to ensure the most up-to-date market intelligence and the ongoing appropriateness of our hedging policies.  Expressing our key profit growth target in constant currency terms so that short term performance can be assessed without the distortion caused by exchange rate fluctuations. Further information on currency and fuel hedges can be found in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements in the Financial instruments section. Nature of Risk 5. Access to EU airspace Our main concern is whether or not all of our airlines will continue to have access to\u00a0EU\u00a0airspace as now. If\u00a0we were unable to continue to fly intra-EU\u00a0routes, such as from Germany to Spain, this would have a significant operational and financial impact on the Group. Other areas impacted by Brexit include the status of our\u00a0UK\u00a0employees working in the\u00a0EU\u00a0and vice versa and potential customer visa requirements for holidays from the\u00a0UK\u00a0to the\u00a0EU. Mitigating Factors Dedicated workstreams to coordinate suitable mitigation strategies where the\u00a0UK\u00a0exit from the European Union has impacted on our operations, particularly the airlines.  Regular engagement and lobbying towards relevant\u00a0UK\u00a0and\u00a0EU\u00a0decision makers to stress the continued importance of a liberalised and less regulated aviation market across Europe to allow access to investment capital and to protect consumer choice in both regions. Nature of Risk 6. Disruption to IT systems (Cyber Attacks) Our responsibility is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data we process for our customers, employees, and businesses. This is an evolving risk due to increasing digitalisation, our supply chain, emerging technologies such as generative\u00a0AI, growing global cyber-crime activity, Russia-Ukraine conflict and more regulation (e. g.\u00a0EU\u00a0GDPR). Our consolidation under the\u00a0TUI\u00a0brand and increasing dependence on digital sales and customer care increases our exposure and the potential worst-case impact of a successful cyber-attack. If we do not ensure we have the appropriate level of security controls in place across the Group, this could have a significant negative impact on our key stakeholders, associated reputational damage and potential for financial implications. Mitigating Factors Continued commitment from the Executive Board in support of key initiatives to ensure existing and future\u00a0IT\u00a0systems are secure by design, protected against denial of service attacks that could impact\u00a0system availability, exposure to vulnerability is managed and user access is monitored. We consider security\u00a0first in everything we do.  TUI?s Information Security Management System ensures a coordinated, standards based, proactive approach to the identification and management of information security risk across the Group.  We keep people safe in the digital world. Our colleagues are made aware of information security risks through appropriate training and awareness campaigns.\u00a0TUI\u00a0are investing in modern authentication and protecting the digital identities of our customers and colleagues.  Security is integrated into our software development and release processes.  Our security risk assessment methodology, controls, policy, and guidelines have been updated to include provisions for the assessment and secure use of Generative\u00a0AI.  We continue to increase the maturity and coverage of our Security Operations Centre and platform to anticipate, detect and respond to cyber-attacks and information security incidents.  Continuous improvement through lessons learned from real or simulated cyber incidents. Nature of Risk 7. Lack of sustainability improvements For the Group, economic, environmental and social sustainability is a fundamental management principle and a cornerstone of our strategy for continually enhancing the value of our Company. This is the way we create the conditions for long-term economic success and assume responsibility for sustainable transformation in the tourism sector. Our focus is to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and promote responsible social policies and outcomes both directly through our own business and indirectly via our influence over our supply chain partners, thereby driving the sustainable transformation of the tourism industry. There is a risk that we are not successful in driving social and environmental improvements across our operations, that our suppliers do not uphold our corporate and social responsibility standards and we fail to influence destinations to manage tourism more sustainably. If we do not maximise our positive impact on destinations and minimise the negative impact to the extent that our stakeholders expect, this could result in a decline in stakeholder confidence, reputational damage and reduction in demand for our products and services. Mitigating Factors The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Sustainability Agenda purpose is to set and drive industry standards, ambitious goals and develop transformation roadmaps for all parts of the business.  This means to actively engage colleagues, partners and customers, bringing sustainability to life in a tangible and emotional way.  The Group Sustainability department sets clear goals, priorities, and the framework to deliver the Sustainability Agenda.  Operating one of the most carbon efficient airlines in Europe with continued investment in new, more efficient aircraft and cruise ships.  Our ambition is to achieve net-zero emissions across our operations and supply chain by 2050 at the latest.  Science-based targets have been set for our airline, hotel and cruise operations by 2030, validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi).  Development and implementation of emission reduction roadmaps for airlines, cruises and hotels to significantly reduce emissions.  Adhering to increasingly supply chain focused regulations (e. g. German Supply Chain Act,\u00a0EU\u00a0Supply chain due diligence regulation 2025) rolling out new processes and structure with a strong focus on procurement.  Implemented an environmental management system with all\u00a0TUI\u00a0airlines having achieved\u00a0ISO\u00a014001 certification.  Driving up social and environmental standards through accommodation suppliers achieving certifications recognised by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) and applying the\u00a0GSTC\u00a0Criteria to\u00a0TUI\u00a0experiences.  Enabling customers to make more sustainable holiday choices by launching our Green &amp; Fair label. Nature of Risk 8. Reliance on key suppliers Providers of holiday and travel services are exposed to the inherent risk of failure in their key suppliers,\u00a0particularly for hotels, aircraft and cruise ships. This is heightened by the industry convention of paying hoteliers in advance (?prepayments?) to secure a level of room allocation for the season as well as in areas where a single supplier is used to provide a product or service. There is the risk that we are unable to continue with our core operations in the event of a major service failure from our key suppliers. Mitigating Factors Using reputable and financially stable suppliers, particularly in areas where a single supplier is used to provide a service.  Regular monitoring of supplier performance against agreed terms and conditions  Strong working relationships with all key suppliers  Owned and joint venture partner hotels form a substantial part of our program which reduces our inherent risk in this area.  A robust prepayment authorisation process is established and embedded to both limit the level of prepayments made and ensure that they are only paid to trusted, credit-worthy counterparties.  Prepayments are monitored on a timely and sufficiently granular basis to manage our financial exposure to justifiable levels.  Developing adequate controls around key suppliers operative ability. In service meetings, for example, we discuss current challenges with suppliers even more closely, so that we are also in a position to react operationally ourselves. Nature of Risk 9. Disruption within our destinations Providers of package holiday and leisure experiences are exposed to the inherent risk of external events in operational areas. This can include natural disasters such as wild fires in Greece or hurricanes in the Caribbean, outbreaks of disease, such as the\u00a0COVID-19 pandemic, political instability or wars close to our destinations, such as in the Middle East, with an impact on our destinations in Egypt or Turkey, as well as terrorist events such as the tragic incident in Tunisia in 2015. There is the risk that if such an event occurs, impacting one or more of our destinations that we could potentially suffer operational disruption and increased costs. We may be required to repatriate our customers and / or need to provide additional support and / or the event could lead to a significant decline in demand to the affected destinations over an extended period. Mitigating Factors Within our Group Security, Health and Safety (SHS) centre of excellence we have a centralised Crisis Management Planning and Coordination function, providing centralised frameworks, personnel reporting structures, incident management systems and crisis communications plans for use in the local delivery of any response.  Our well-established crisis management procedures and emergency response and business continuity plans are activated when an event of this nature occurs and focus on the welfare of our customers.  Due to our presence in key holiday destinations, in the event of a local event occurring, we can offer alternative options to our customers and remix our destination portfolio away from the affected area in future seasons if necessary. Nature of Risk 10. Climate change impacting our business model Climate change is a complex issue and there is significant uncertainty surrounding the climate system, as well as how the world will respond to mitigate the effects of climate change. However, physicals effects are already being felt today and are predicted to worsen, and we?re seeing increasing climate action. Increased costs due to the introduction of new, or extension of existing, carbon pricing mechanisms (including pass-through of higher costs by suppliers), and new energy and emissions regulations Increasing regulations and restrictions targeting the airline and cruise industry, leading to reduced revenue and / or stranded assets Costly or unavailable future fuels and technologies resulting in higher costs, or preventing further decarbonisation and compliance with regulations TUI\u00a0is committed to decarbonising its business, and has set ambitious near-term science-based emissions reduction targets with the\u00a0SBTi.  To achieve these,\u00a0TUI\u00a0airlines procures state-of-the-art aircraft, implements operational efficiencies (including route optimisation), and will increase the use of\u00a0SAF.\u00a0TUI\u00a0already has cooperation agreements in place to promote the production and supply of\u00a0SAF.  TUI\u00a0Cruises invests in energy efficiency at ship operations, fuel-saving route optimisation, shore power in\u00a0ports and alternative fuels, such as sustainable biofuels, bio-LNG\u00a0and green methanol. The three newbuilds\u00a0coming into the fleet by 2026 will not use heavy fuel oil. Mein Schiff\u00a07 will enter service in 2024 and will\u00a0run on lower-emission marine diesel and be equipped with catalytic converters and a shore power connection. In addition, the ship will also be able to run on green methanol in the future. In 2024 and 2026, two ships will follow, which will be operated with\u00a0LNG.\u00a0LNG\u00a0serves as a bridge technology until bio-LNG\u00a0is available, which will be produced either from biogenic sources or synthetically from renewable energy.  TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts is focused on renewable energy and resource-saving operational practices to reduce hotel emissions as far as possible. Decline of travellers due to shifts in consumer preferences and behaviour, and increasing negative public sentiment towards travel, resulting in loss of revenue Decline of overall customer demand as the price for our products will increase to reflect higher capital expenditures and operational expenses to offer carbon low products Difficulties in obtaining access to financing and increasing cost of capital due to the inability to reduce emissions in line with market expectations Managing both market and reputational risks depends on the successful implementation of our emissions reduction initiatives. Accordingly, we have roadmaps in place to deliver on our science-based targets.  Whilst the cost for flights is very likely to increase, all markets participants have to roll-over this ?green inflation?. With our state-of-the-art efficienct fleet, it is likely that our cost increase is competitive. Further, the share of extra cost from low-carbon flying is lower in a package and hence we believe that we can effectively transfer cost additions.  TUI\u00a0has set science-based emissions reduction targets for 2030 and a net zero target for 2050.\u00a0TUI\u00a0continues to notice a wide range of financiers due to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s financial performance and is continuing to develop relationships with new sources of finance and monitor development of the market.\u00a0TUI\u00a0is in a continuing education process with lessors and the financial community to maintain confidence in the strategy. Physical damage to assets and business disruption due to extreme weather-related events This risk is managed at the asset-level.  We manage the overarching risk through insurance and a large and regional spread hotels &amp; resorts portfolio, providing diversifiying the risk of asset impairment.  We hold relatively short-duration lease contracts, enabling flexibility in case of changes in insurability. Extreme weather events disrupting transport hubs, resulting in delays and cancellations, and increased costs The risk of airport disruption was found to be low in the physical risk analysis. Nonetheless,\u00a0TUI\u00a0works closely with airports in case of disruption and will continue to evaluate the risk profile of its material airports.  Whilst docking is already considered a resilient activity, the risk is further mitigated by the flexibility to adjust cruise itineraries. Physical damage to assets and business disruption due to longer-term shifts in climate patterns Whilst the scenario analysis indicate higher probability of extreme wheather events, non of the locations where our hotels &amp; resorts are located is vulnerable to a rising sea level during the time frame of our climate scenario analysis.  This risk is managed with insurance and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts? renewable energy strategy. Changing weather patterns decreasing suitability for tourism and / or making source markets more attractive, impacting tourism demand Climate-related factors are considered in the expansion of\u00a0TUI?s Hotels &amp; Resorts business segment. Principal Risks within appetite Nature of Risk A. Security Health &amp; Safety failure The safety and security of customers and colleagues is of paramount importance to any holiday and travel service provider. There is the risk of accidents, incidents or events occurring causing illness, injury or death to customers or colleagues whilst on a\u00a0TUI\u00a0holiday or whilst using a\u00a0TUI\u00a0operated / provided activity or service. In addition to the harm caused the affected individual(s), this could result in disruption to operational activities,\u00a0reputational damage to the business and / or financial liabilities through loss of earnings, lack of demand and / or legal claims being brought by the affected parties. Mitigating Factors The established Group Security, Health &amp; Safety (Group\u00a0SHS) centre of excellence oversees safety and security risk management activities, delivering alignment and consistency across the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group.  Group\u00a0SHS\u00a0operational responsibilities include\u00a0TUI\u00a0Tour Operations,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement (including Intercruises). Operational safety and security risk management activities for Airline and Cruise operations are managed from within the respective business units.  Data-led, risk-based Safety and Security Risk Management systems are in place and are subject to continuous review / improvement.  Safety and Security Risk Management clauses are included in supplier contracts.  Appropriate insurance policies are in place to mitigate any financial losses. Nature of Risk B. Breach of regulatory requirements Most providers of holiday and travel services operate across a number of economies and jurisdictions, which therefore exposes them to a range of regulatory laws which must be complied with. As we are operating from multiple source markets and providing holidays in more than many destinations, we are exposed to a range of laws and regulations with which we must comply or else risk incurring fines or other sanctions from regulatory bodies. Mitigating Factors Communication and strong tone from the top concerning compliance with laws and regulations.  Risk based compliance management systems managing the most relevant legal areas for the Group.  Regular reporting of Integrity and Compliance Director in different bodies (Group Executive Committee, Audit Committee, Group Works Council) in order to guarantee appropriate monitoring, supervision and implementation of action plans and to strengthen the Integrity &amp; Compliance culture across the Group.  Embedded legal expertise in all major businesses responsible for maintaining high quality relationships with the relevant regulators and authorities.  Ongoing implementation and review of Compliance Management System conducted by the Group Integrity &amp; Compliance department to monitor compliance with regulations and provide expert advice to local teams on specific compliance areas. Nature of Risk C. Management of joint venture partnerships It is common for tourism groups to use partnerships in some of their operations in order to reduce the risk of new ventures, to gain access to their expertise of the local market and, in case of consolidation at equity, to strengthen the balance sheet position in line with our less capital intensive ?asset-right? strategy (e. g. the transaction completed with Riu). There are threee significant partnerships within the Group: Pep Toni Hotels S. A.,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises GmbH and Midnight International Holdings Limited. For details on our strategy refer to page 24. There is the risk that if we do not maintain good relations with our key partners that the ventures? objectives may not remain consistent with that of the Group which could lead to operational difficulties and jeopardize the achievement of financial targets. Mitigating Factors Good working relationships exist with all of our main partners and they are fully aligned with and committed to the growth strategy of the Group. Nature of Risk D. Inability to attract and retain talent Our success depends on the ability to attract, retain, and develop our talent to ensure that we equip our employees to deliver our strategy as well as to also become our future leaders. There is a risk that we are unable to attract and retain key talent, build future leadership capability and maintain the commitment and trust of our employees. Challenges in managing and maintaining our talent pipeline in order to deliver against our strategy, drive competitiveness and maximize on our operating performance, may impact on our ability to future proof the Group and the associated potential for negative impact on shareholder confidence. The risk has stabilised and reduced to prepandemic levels but we continue to monitor closely to ensure that we retain our key talent through development initiatives, whilst launching a new tool to measure our Employee Experience and supports all of the activities around our new Employee Value Proposition. Mitigating Factors Support retention by refreshing our Performance Management processes, aligning our development opportunities to the business needs and communicating all internal vacancies to our employees.  Promoting a working from anywhere culture, allows us to attract and retain a wider pool of talent that does not require to be located close to our base offices.  Build and develop internal talent pools of our high potential employees ensuring that they are diverse and inclusive.  A strategically aligned leadership programme for high performing management at all levels and the creation of strong management development programme for all people managers Viability Statement In accordance with Rule\u00a031\u00a0of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code, the Executive Board assesses the Company?s future prospects for a period exceeding the twelve months required by the going concern premise. The Executive Board reviews the business development annually and on a rolling basis based on a three-year\u00a0strategic plan. The current three-year plan was adopted in October\u00a02023\u00a0and covers the period until\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02026. A three-year horizon is considered appropriate for a fast moving competitive environment such as tourism. The global travel restrictions to contain\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0have had a continuous negative impact on the Group?s earnings and liquidity development since the end of March\u00a02020. Following the successive lifting of the measures to restrict contact and travel in most countries, business has been mainly resumed in all segments in the course of the first half year of the\u00a02022\u00a0calendar year. To cover the resulting liquidity needs, the Group has carried out various financing measures in the financial years\u00a02020\u00a0to\u00a02022, which, in addition to three capital increases, the use of the banking and capital markets and cash inflows from the sale of assets, also include financing measures from the Federal Republic of Germany in the form of a KfW credit line initially totalling ?\u00a02.85\u00a0bn, an option bond from the German Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) totalling ?\u00a0150\u00a0m and two silent participations from the\u00a0WSF\u00a0initially totalling ?\u00a01.091\u00a0bn. In financial year\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0reduced KfW?s credit line to ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn in various steps. In addition,\u00a0913\u00a0of the\u00a01,500\u00a0bonds with warrants issued to\u00a0WSF\u00a0were redeemed and the Silent Participation\u00a0II\u00a0of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0of\u00a0?\u00a0671.0\u00a0m was repaid in full ahead of schedule. The financing measures are described in detail in the annual reports for the past three financial years. On\u00a013\u00a0December\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has concluded a new agreement with the\u00a0WSF\u00a0on the repayment of stabilization measures (?Repayment Agreement?). This agreement regulates the intended complete termination of the stabilization measures granted by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0by means of a right of the Company (i) to repayment of the contribution made by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0as a silent partner in January\u00a02021\u00a0in the nominal amount of then ?\u00a0420\u00a0m (?Silent Participation I?) and (ii) to repurchase the warrant-linked bond\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a02026\u00a0(?Warrant Bond?) issued by the Company to\u00a0WSF\u00a0in the remaining amount of ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m as well as the\u00a058,674,899\u00a0option rights (?Warrants?) originally attached to the warrant bond. In addition, the Repayment Agreement regulates the implementation of capital measures for the purpose of refinancing the aforementioned measures. In February\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0implemented the ten-for-one reverse stock split previously resolved by the\u00a02023\u00a0AGM\u00a0in accordance with the provisions of the Economic Stabilisation Acceleration Act. As a result, the\u00a0Company?s share capital declined from ?\u00a01.785\u00a0bn to around ?\u00a0179\u00a0m. The corresponding reduction amount of around ?\u00a01.606\u00a0bn was transferred to the company?s capital reserves. In accordance with the repayment agreement with the\u00a0WSF, the Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0resolved a capital increase with subscription rights of ?\u00a01.8\u00a0bn with the approval of the Supervisory Board on\u00a024\u00a0March\u00a02023. For the fully subscribed capital increase,\u00a0328,910,448\u00a0new shares were offered at a subscription ratio of\u00a08:3\u00a0and a subscription price of ?\u00a05.55. The subscription period for the new shares ended on\u00a017\u00a0April\u00a02023. Following receipt of the proceeds from the capital increase on\u00a024\u00a0April\u00a02023, Silent Participation I and the around\u00a056.8\u00a0m warrants held by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0as well as the outstanding\u00a0587\u00a0of the\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a02026\u00a0bonds with warrants were fully redeemed on\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023. For Silent Participation I and the\u00a02023\u00a0coupon payable on it, a redemption price of ?\u00a0651.6\u00a0m was paid. ?\u00a030.8\u00a0m were used for the repurchase of the warrants and further ?\u00a061.9\u00a0m for the early redemption of the\u00a0587\u00a0bonds with a nominal value of ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m, including accrued interest of ?\u00a03.2\u00a0m. At the same time, the early repayment penalty for Silent Participation\u00a0II\u00a0of ?\u00a05.7\u00a0m, agreed with the\u00a0WSF\u00a0in April\u00a02022, became due.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has thus terminated and repaid all stabilisation measures of the\u00a0WSF. Moreover,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0reduced the volume of the KfW credit facility from ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn to ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn following completion of the capital increase. The capital increase completed in April\u00a02023\u00a0and the subsequent substantial reduction in government financing will enable a significant improvement in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s credit ratios and reduce current interest costs, allowing\u00a0TUI\u00a0to focus on growth and further market recovery. In May\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0extended the maturity of the existing credit lines of ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn by a further two years. The syndicated credit line with the\u00a019\u00a0banks (?\u00a01.64\u00a0bn), including the credit line with KfW (?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn), together referred to as the ?RCF?, will now mature in July\u00a02026. The\u00a0RCF\u00a0of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is subject to compliance with certain financial targets (covenants) for debt coverage and interest coverage, the review of which is carried out on the basis of the last four reported quarters at the end of the financial year or the half-year of a financial year. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s revolving credit facilities totalled ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn, they comprised the following ?\u00a01.64\u00a0bn credit line from\u00a019\u00a0private banks (incl. ?\u00a0190\u00a0m guarantee line)  ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn KfW credit line. The KfW credit line, which was reduced to ?\u00a01.05\u00a0billion after the successful capital increase, is not expected to be drawn on and serves only as a buffer. The aim is to return this credit line quickly. The support and stabilisation package as well as the further financing measures are described in detail in the chapter ?Going concern reporting according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code? in the notes. See chapter Going Concern Reporting in accordance with the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code, page 188. In the view of the Executive Board, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group currently has and will continue to have sufficient funds,\u00a0resulting both from borrowings and from operating cash flows, to meet its payment obligations and to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future. Therefore, as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, the Board does not identify any material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern. The Board does not foresee risks that may jeopardise the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern and does not believe that compliance with the financial covenants is at risk as at\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02024\u00a0and\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02024. Taking into account the current situation of the Group and the main risks, the Executive Board has a reasonable expectation that the Group will be able to continue operations and meet the obligations arising within the three-year period under review. Key features of the internal control and risk management system in relation to the (Group) accounting process (sections 289 (4) and 315 (4) of the German Commercial Code) 1. Conceptual framework and governance The internationally recognised framework created by\u00a0COSO\u00a0(Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission) forms the conceptual basis for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s accounting-related internal control system. On the basis of section\u00a0107\u00a0(3) of the German Stock Corporation Act, the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0reviews the auditing of the annual financial statements, monitoring the accounting process and the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems. The reliability of financial reporting and the monitoring of the financial accounting process as well as the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems are described in the Audit Committee Report. This also takes account of the effectiveness of the accounting-related internal control and risk management system. Audit Committee Report, see page 19. The Group?s auditors gain insight into\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s established control environment and control measures. The accounting-related audits by the auditor are complemented by an assessment of selected controls. The audit of the consolidated financial statements by the Group auditor and the audit of the individual financial statements of Group companies included in the consolidated financial statements, in particular, constitute a key non-process-related monitoring measure in relation to Group accounting. In Group accounting, the risk management system, implemented as a component of the internal control system in the form of an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) System, also addresses the risk of misstatements in Group bookkeeping and external reporting. A more detailed explanation of the risk management system is provided in the section on Risk Governance in the Risk Report. 2. Use of IT systems Bookkeeping transactions are captured in the individual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and of the subsidiaries of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0through local accounting systems, above all supplied by\u00a0SAP. When preparing\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated\u00a0financial statements, the subsidiaries complement their individual financial statements by setting up standardised reporting packages in the Oracle Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) reporting system.\u00a0HFM\u00a0is used as the uniform reporting and consolidation system throughout the Group and hence no additional interfaces are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements. All consolidation processes used to prepare the consolidated financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, e. g. capital consolidation, the consolidation of assets and liabilities and the elimination of expenses and income and at\u00a0equity measurement, are generated and fully documented in\u00a0HFM. Virtually all elements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures in the Notes, are developed from and validated by the\u00a0HFM\u00a0consolidation system.\u00a0HFM\u00a0also provides various modules for evaluation purposes in order to present complementary information to explain\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements. The\u00a0HFM\u00a0reporting and consolidation system has an in-built workflow process whereby, when the reporting companies capture their data packages within the system, they are then locked out from making any further changes to that data. This ensures data integrity within the system. This workflow process has been checked and validated by the\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0Group Audit department on several occasions since the system was introduced. At their own discretion,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Group auditors select certain individual financial statements from the financial statements entered in the\u00a0HFM\u00a0reporting and consolidation system by the Group companies, which are then reviewed for the purposes of auditing the consolidated financial statements. 3. Specific risks related to (Group) Accounting Specific risks related to (Group) accounting may arise, for example, from unusual or complex business transactions, in particular at critical times towards the end of the financial year. Business transactions not routinely processed also entail special risks. The discretion necessarily granted to employees for the recognition and measurement of assets and liabilities may result in further (Group) accounting-related risks. The outsourcing and transfer of accounting-specific tasks to service companies may also give rise to specific risks. 4. Key regulation and control activities to ensure proper and reliable (Group) Accounting The internal control measures aimed at securing proper and reliable (Group) accounting ensure that business transactions are fully recorded in a timely manner in accordance with legal requirements and the Articles of Association. This also ensures that assets and liabilities are properly recognised, measured and presented in the financial statements and the consolidated financial statements. The control operations also ensure that bookkeeping records provide reliable and comprehensive information. Controls implemented to secure proper and reliable accounting include, for instance, analysis of facts and developments on the basis of specific indicators. Separation of administrative, execution, settlement and authorisation functions and the implementation of these functions by different persons reduces the potential\u00a0for fraudulent operations. Organisational measures also aim to capture any corporate or Groupwide restructuring or changes in sector business operations rapidly and appropriately in (Group) accounting. They also ensure, for instance, that bookkeeping transactions are correctly recognised in the period in which they occur in the event of changes in the\u00a0IT\u00a0systems used by the accounting departments of Group companies. The internal control system likewise ensures that changes in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s economic or legal environment are mapped and that new or amended accounting standards are correctly applied. To safeguard financial processes, there is a Group-wide framework under which all major companies included in the consolidated financial statements as fully consolidated companies are required to report the nature of their controls and their implementation for financial reporting, fraud prevention and detection and effectiveness of working capital management in relation to defined risks from financial processes to the Group Risk &amp; Controls function with system support and to assess their effectiveness on a quarterly basis. The Group Risk &amp; Controls function reviews these reports on a sample basis and provides advice on how to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Where financial processes are carried out in the Group?s own Shared Service Center, this function provides support for the further development of the process and control framework. Based on the feedback received, Internal Audit selects companies for an in-depth review of the control measures in accordance with its own risk assessment. The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s accounting policies together with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in compliance with\u00a0EU\u00a0legislation, govern the uniform accounting and measurement principles for the German and foreign companies included in\u00a0TUI?s consolidated financial statements. They include general accounting principles and methods, policies concerning the statement of financial position, income statement, notes, management report and cash flow statement. The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s accounting policies also govern specific formal requirements for the consolidated financial statements. Besides defining the group of consolidated companies, they include detailed guidance on the reporting of financial information by those companies via the group reporting system\u00a0HFM\u00a0on a monthly, quarterly and year end basis.\u00a0TUI?s accounting policies also include, for instance, specific instructions on the initiating, reconciling, accounting for and settlement of transactions between group companies or determination of the fair value of certain assets, especially goodwill. At Group level, specific controls to ensure proper and reliable (Group) accounting include the analysis and, where necessary, correction of the individual financial statements submitted by the Group companies, taking account of the reports prepared by the auditors and meetings to discuss the financial statements which involve both the auditors and local management. Any further content that requires adjusting can be isolated and processed downstream. The control mechanisms already established in the\u00a0HFM\u00a0consolidation system minimise the risk of processing erroneous financial statements. Certain parameters are determined at Group level and have to be applied by Group\u00a0companies. This includes parameters applicable to the measurement of pension provisions or other provisions and the interest rates to be applied when cash flow models are used to calculate the fair value of certain assets. The central implementation of impairment tests for goodwill recognised in the financial statements secures the application of uniform and standardized evaluation criteria. 5. Disclaimer With the organisational, control and monitoring structures established by the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, the internal control\u00a0and risk management system enables company-specific facts to be captured, processed and recognised in full and properly presented in the Group?s accounts. However, it lies in the very nature of the matter that discretionary decision-making, faulty checks, criminal\u00a0acts and other circumstances, in particular, cannot be ruled out and will restrict the efficiency and reliability\u00a0of the internal control and risk management systems, so that even Group-wide application of the systems cannot guarantee with absolute certainty the accurate, complete and timely recording of facts in the Group?s accounts. Any statements made relate exclusively to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and to subsidiaries according to\u00a0IFRS\u00a010\u00a0included in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements.Overall Assessment by the Executive Boardand Report on expected Developments Actual business performance 2023 compared with our guidance Overall, the operating and financial indicators showed a positive year-on-year development, as expected in our guidance. In the period under review, revenue by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group rose from ?\u00a016.5\u00a0bn to ?\u00a020.7\u00a0bn. The year-on-year growth of\u00a025.8\u00a0% at constant currency thus matched the strong increase assumed in our guidance. Likewise,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0rose by ?\u00a0568.5\u00a0m to an operating profit of ?\u00a0977.2\u00a0m in financial year\u00a02023. This means that we achieved the expected considerable improvement in underlying\u00a0EBIT. The net income of ?\u00a022.1\u00a0m adjusted in the income statement in the period under review were outside the\u00a0corridor we had expected, which included net costs of ?\u00a060\u00a0m to ?\u00a080\u00a0m. This is due in particular to the unplanned gain on disposal of ?\u00a091\u00a0m from the sale of the tour operator business by the equity method accounted company Sunwing Travel Group Inc., Ontario in the Northern Region segment. Due to the significant recovery in underlying\u00a0EBIT,\u00a0ROIC\u00a0and\u00a0EVA\u00a0also improved considerably in financial year\u00a02023, as expected. In the period under review,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0ROIC\u00a0stood at\u00a019.10\u00a0% (previous year\u00a07.49\u00a0%). Taking account of the Group?s weighted cost of capital of\u00a011.76\u00a0% (previous year\u00a012.63\u00a0%), this resulted in positive Economic Value Added of ?\u00a0375.6\u00a0m (previous year negative Economic Value Added of ?\u00a0280.7\u00a0m). In the period under review, the cash outflows from net capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment and financial investments of ?\u00a0493.7\u00a0m (previous year net outflow of ?\u00a0315.9\u00a0m) were withinh the expected range of ?\u00a0450\u00a0m to ?\u00a0500\u00a0m. Our forecast had expected an almost stable development of the Group?s net debt, excluding the capital increase carried out in financial year\u00a02023. Against the backdrop of the net cash inflows from the capital increase implemented in April\u00a02023\u00a0and the redemption payments made to the Economic Stabilisation Fund, we had adjusted our guidance for the Group?s net debt to around ?\u00a02.4\u00a0bn as at the end of financial year\u00a02023\u00a0in our Half-Year Financial Report. At ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn, the Group?s net debt reported as at the end of financial year\u00a02023\u00a0was significantly below the net debt of ?\u00a03.4\u00a0bn carried at the previous year?s reporting date and slightly below\u00a0our updated guidance. The considerable decline reflected in particular the cash inflow from operating activities of ?\u00a01,637.3\u00a0m and the cash inflow from the capital increase effected in the period under review of ?\u00a01,760.9\u00a0m, less the payment of ?\u00a0682.4\u00a0m made to redeem Silent Participation\u00a0II\u00a0to the Economic Stabilisation Fund. The improvement compared to the adjusted forecast was due in particular to higher cash and cash equivalents and positive effects from the translation of liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at the balance sheet date. For financial year\u00a02023, we had expected a slight reduction in specific\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions as against financial year\u00a02022. In the period under review, relative\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions of our airlines declined by\u00a03.9\u00a0% from\u00a06.36\u00a0to\u00a06.11\u00a0kg /\u00a0100\u00a0pkm. The improvement was primarily driven by higher load factors as against\u00a02022\u00a0and our fleet renewal programme, under which older aircraft are replaced with new, more carbon-efficient aircraft.

Several forces are holding back the recovery. Some reflect the long-term consequences of the pandemic, Russia?s war in Ukraine, and cyclical factors including the effects of monetary policy tightening necessary to reduce inflation. A central\u00a0driver of the recent fall in headline inflation is declining international commodity prices (IMF, World Economic Outlook, October\u00a02023). Following a strong rebound in calendar year\u00a02022, international tourism could climb close to pre-pandemic\u00a0levels in\u00a02023, driven by strong pent-up demand and the lifting of travel restrictions. Experts expect international arrivals in Europe to come close to their pre-pandemic levels after reaching\u00a080\u00a0% in the previous\u00a0year. Complete recovery of tourism remains subject to certain risks affecting global travel flows, like a potential\u00a0economic slowdown in some regions, the loss of purchasing power amid high inflation and rapid interest hikes (UNWTO, World Tourism Barometer, September\u00a02023). Effects on TUI Group As a global tourism provider,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group depends on the political and legal framework and on consumer demand in the major source markets in which we operate with our hotel, cruise and tour operator brands. Our budget is based on\u00a0IMF?s assumptions about the future development of the global economy and takes its guidance from\u00a0UNWTO?s long-term forecast. Expected development of Group earnings TUI Group The translation of the income statements of foreign subsidiaries in our consolidated financial statements is based on average monthly exchange rates.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group generates a considerable proportion of consolidated revenue and substantial earnings and cash flow contributions in non-euro currencies, in particular the pound sterling, the\u00a0US\u00a0dollar and the Swedish krona. Taking account of the seasonality in tourism, the value of these\u00a0currencies against the euro in the course of the year therefore exerts a major impact on the financial indicators displayed in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements. Our key financial performance indicators for our earnings position in financial year\u00a02024\u00a0are revenue and underlying\u00a0EBIT. Definition of underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0in Value-oriented Group management on page 31. Key performance indicators used for regular value analysis are Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) and Economic Value Added.\u00a0ROIC\u00a0for a given segment is compared with the segment-specific cost of capital. For the financial year\u00a02024\u00a0it is expected that customer volumes will reach\u00a02019\u00a0levels. In the course of the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0TUI\u00a0improved its financial position due to the recovery of its business, the capital increase and the prolongation of the credit facilities. Accordingly\u00a0TUI\u00a0has now far more options to hedge against changes in fuel prices or exchange rates. The further digitalisation of our business and the expansion of existing and new business areas are expected to take effect. Below we describe the key assumptions underlying the medium-term business planning in the segments. In its business plan, Hotels &amp; Resorts expects to deliver further earnings growth due to capacity expansion, demand growth and increases in average selling prices. For the Cruises segment further recovery of results in the financial year\u00a02024\u00a0is expected as the winter season\u00a0of the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0was still affected by the comparative late recovery of demand in\u00a02022. Furthermore, results will increase in financial year\u00a02024\u00a0due to the expansion of the fleets of Marella and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises. In\u00a0Summer\u00a02023\u00a0Marella took over one cruise ship from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises. This ship will be operated all-season\u00a0beginning with the financial year\u00a02024.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises will launch a new ship in Summer\u00a02024. However, the\u00a0results will be negatively impacted by new imposed regulatory measures with the aim to reduce climate-damaging\u00a0emissions. For example the\u00a0EU\u00a0emission trading system will be introduced stepwise in the cruise sector beginning with\u00a02024. The future development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement depends in part on the development of customer numbers in Markets &amp; Airlines.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement will also generate growth through the sale of tours, activities and tickets due to the expansion of its own / direct distribution via the internet and the app. In Markets &amp; Airlines, beginning with the financial year\u00a02024\u00a0it is expected that customer numbers will reach\u00a02019\u00a0levels. Wider use of online distribution, the provision of dynamic production capacities for flights and\u00a0accommodation and the investments in digitalisation are expected to further improve the results. In addition,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has now by far more options to hedge against changes in fuel prices and in exchange rates in comparison to financial year\u00a02023. Otherwise will the emission trading system of the\u00a0EU\u00a0and Great Britain lead to higher expenses. Below, we present\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s expected development in financial year\u00a02024\u00a0based on the constant currency rates for financial year\u00a02023.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_13\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"368\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Expected development of Group turnover and underlying\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2024*</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20,666</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">At least\u00a010\u00a0% growth</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">977</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">At least\u00a025\u00a0% growth</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjustments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">approx. ?\u00a025\u00a0?\u00a035\u00a0m costs</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">* Variance year-on-year assuming constant foreign exchange rates are applied to the result in the current and prior period and within the framework of the macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties currently known, especially around the Middle East.

Underlying EBIT TUI\u00a0Group?s underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0amounted to ?\u00a0977.2\u00a0m. For financial year\u00a02024, we expect\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0to improve by at least\u00a025\u00a0% year-on-year. Adjustments For financial year\u00a02024, we expect a net negative effect from adjustments in a range of ?\u00a025\u00a0m to ?\u00a035\u00a0m. For details on objectives and strategies, see page 24 onwards; for details on risks, see Risk Report from page 35 onwards. ROIC and Economic Value Added Due to the expected improvement in our operating result,\u00a0ROIC\u00a0and Economic Value Added are also expected to improve strongly year-on-year, depending on how capital costs for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group develop. Expected development of financial position To forecast the Group?s financial position in financial year\u00a02024, we have defined the Group?s net capital expenditure and investments and its net financial position as key performance indicators.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_14\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"392\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Expected development of Group financial position</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2024</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net capex and investments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">493.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">around ?\u00a0475\u00a0?\u00a0525\u00a0m*</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,106.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">slight decrease</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">* Excluding capital increase Peptoni S.

Net financial position For financial year\u00a02024, we expect the Group?s net debt to decrease slightly. Sustainable development Climate protection and emissions We have identified specific carbon emissions (in g\u00a0CO2\u00a0/ pkm) from our aircraft fleet as the key non-financial performance indicator. For financial year\u00a02024, we expect specific\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions to slightly fall in comparison with financial year\u00a02023. Overall Executive Board assessment of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s current situation and expected development At the date of preparation of the Management Report (4\u00a0December\u00a02023), the Executive Board assumes that costumer volumes in\u00a02024\u00a0will reach\u00a02019\u00a0levels. Furthermore, in the course of the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0TUI\u00a0improved its financial position due to the recovery of its business, the capital increase and the prolongation of the\u00a0RCF. Accordingly\u00a0TUI\u00a0has now far more options to hedge against changes in fuel prices or exchange rates. The further digitalisation of our business and the expansion of existing and new business areas are expected to take effect. For financial year\u00a02024, we therefore expect\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0to improve by at least\u00a025\u00a0% year-on-year on a constant currency basis. Outlook for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG The future business performance of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is essentially subject to the same factors as those impacting\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. Due to the business ties between\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and its Group companies, the outlook, opportunities and risks presented for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group are largely mirrored by expectations for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. The comments made for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group therefore also apply to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Opportunity Report TUI\u00a0Group?s opportunity management follows the Group strategy. Responsibility for systematically identifying and taking up opportunities rests with the operational management of the Hotels &amp; Resorts, Cruises and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segments as well as our source markets. Market scenarios and critical success factors for the\u00a0individual sectors are analysed and assessed in the framework of the Group-wide planning and control process.\u00a0The core task of the Group?s Executive Board is to secure profitable growth for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group again by optimising the shareholding portfolio and developing the Group structure over the long term. Opportunities and risks arising from macro trends In particular, a decline in fuel costs as well as a lower general price increase would have a positive impact on the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and its segments in financial year\u00a02024. Corporate strategy opportunities Opportunities arise from accelerating the Group?s transformation into a digital platform business. We will\u00a0expand hotel-only and flight-only products and broaden our dynamic packaging opportunities. We will prioritise the planned transformation of our digital platform in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segment. Operational opportunities We intend to operate as an asset-light organisation and see opportunities in the implementation of our asset-right strategy in our Hotels &amp; Resorts and Cruises businesses. We are reviewing unprofitable activities and will divest them as appropriate. climate-related opportunities As short to medium term opportunities, we identified more efficient aircraft and cruise ships as well as a shift to renewable energy sources at hotels &amp; resorts as a way to reduce operating costs in connection with\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions. We further see an opportunity to offer lower-emission air travel, cruise travel and hotel stays as a way to improve our competitive position. Providing alternative modes of transport including a move to high-speed rail is also seen as an opportunity for our business. We are examining how we can utilise these opportunities. The summer season\u00a02023\u00a0in Turkey and Greece for selected destinations has been expanded which has been\u00a0well received by our customers. In the long term, we expect to see this more frequently and in more\u00a0destinations following a shift in consumer preferences from peak seasons where heat waves may be imminent to shoulder seasons where the wheather is still very favourable for travel. In addition, our business model is flexible to offer new destinations based on changing weather conditions, e. g. more travel to destinations\u00a0around the Baltic Sea. We continue to monitor these trends and embed them into our strategic and operational planning.

Widespread fears of recession among the world?s leading economies in the wake of monetary policy tightening largely look to be fading.\u00a0Overall, the global recovery from the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic has remained slow and uneven, with major regional\u00a0divergences, due to Russia?s invasion of Ukraine and the associated distortions in the energy and food markets. Economic activity in emerging markets and developing economies, in particular, has fallen substantially short of its pre-pandemic path (IMF, World Economic Outlook, October\u00a02023). Key exchange rates and commodity prices TUI\u00a0Group companies operate on a worldwide scale. This presents financial risks for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group arising from changes in exchange rates and commodity prices. The essential financial transaction risks from operations\u00a0concern euros and\u00a0US\u00a0dollars. They mainly result from foreign exchange items in the individual Group companies, for instance jet fuel and bunker oil or ship handling, or from sourcing transactions by hotels. The\u00a0parity of sterling against the euro affects the translation of results generated in the\u00a0UK\u00a0market in\u00a0TUI?s consolidated financial statements. Changes in commodity prices above all affect\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group when procuring fuels such as aircraft fuel and bunker oil. In Tourism, risks relating to changes in exchange rates and price risks from fuel sourcing are partly hedged by derivatives. Information on hedging strategies and risk management as well as financial transactions and the scope of such transactions at the balance sheet date is provided in the sections Financial position and Risk report in the Management Report and the section Financial instruments in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. Financial position from page 74, Risk report from page 35, and Financial instruments in the Notes from page 249. \u00a0 The exchange rate charts are presented on the basis of the indirect quotation format customary in the foreign exchange market. If the exchange rate falls, the foreign currency is appreciating against the euro. By contrast, if the exchange rate rises, the foreign currency is depreciating against the euro. Industry overview As a global leisure experiences provider, the development of the international tourism market has an impact on all business areas of the Group. The key indicators used to measure the size of the tourism sector include the number of international tourist\u00a0arrivals. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), the number of international\u00a0tourist arrivals grew by an average of\u00a05\u00a0% year-on-year from\u00a02009\u00a0to\u00a02019\u00a0(UNWTO, World Tourism Barometer,\u00a0January\u00a02020). This growth was driven by a number of factors: the relatively stable global economy, a growing middle class in the emerging economies, technological progress, and an easing of visa requirements. With the outbreak and the global spread of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic in the first quarter of calendar year\u00a02020, almost all activities in the sector came to a standstill, and as a result, international tourist arrivals declined significantly. However, as travel restrictions eased and mobility was restored, tourism demand has rebounded. From January to July\u00a02023, international tourist arrivals reached\u00a084\u00a0% of\u00a02019\u00a0levels globally, and\u00a091\u00a0% in Europe, with the expectation that volumes will return closer to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year (UNWTO, World Tourism Barometer, September\u00a02023). In Summer\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has seen volumes in its Markets &amp; Airlines business return almost fully back to\u00a02019\u00a0levels.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_16\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"368\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Change of international tourist arrivals versus 2019 in %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Var. %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023*versus\u00a02019</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022versus\u00a02019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">World</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a016</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a034</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Europe</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a09</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a020</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Asia and the Pacific</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a039</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a072</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Americas</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a013</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a029</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Africa</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a08</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a033</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Middle East</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a020</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a05</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Source:\u00a0UNWTO\u00a0Tourism Dashboard and World Tourism Barometer, September\u00a02023 * Period January till July Travel intermediary market A travel intermediary operates between a provider of tourism services, such as an airline or a hotel, and final customers, typically delivering distribution, packaging and / or related services. Their advantage compared with direct suppliers is generally related to their distribution and (in the case of tour operators) fulfilment\u00a0and service capabilities. Travel intermediaries include tour operators, travel agents, and online travel agencies\u00a0(OTAs). These business models vary substantially. All may offer their customers a component product (e. g.\u00a0flight, accommodation) or a package product (comprising e. g. flight, hotel and transfers), usually through a combination of offline (i. e. travel agencies) and online channels (i.e. web and app). Booking preference has shifted to online over time, a trend which was further accelerated during the pandemic. In order to secure flight and hotel capacity in advance, a tour operator may enter into a wholesale contract with the supplier, often involving some form of commitment to a certain amount of capacity at a specified\u00a0price. Where the tour operator commits to capacity, they take on the risk of filling it; in return, they can expect the supplier to offer them a favourable rate and the opportunity to secure accommodation on an exclusive basis, as well as the ability to yield the capacity. Alternatively, tour operators can dynamically access flight and hotel supply, either direct with the supplier, or via a bedbank, or via a global distribution system. This does not involve taking risk, and provides additional choice and flexibility for the customer (for example, relating to choice of departure airport, time of flights and duration of holiday).\u00a0OTAs, by contrast, typically do not commit to taking capacity, nor are they as deeply involved in the fulfilment and service of the holiday. Their offering to suppliers is a digital distribution platform with broad customer reach, generally without any exclusivity of offer. Airline market The airline industry was hit particularly hard by the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0crisis, as airlines around the world had to ground their aircraft and cancel flights due to global travel bans. In addition the European industry faced significant disruption in\u00a02022, in particular due to shortage of staff in critical areas of operations (e. g. ground handling and airports), driven by delayed ramping up of staff after\u00a0COVID\u00a019\u00a0ramping down and due to shortages in the labour market. Despite this, air passenger traffic rebounded significantly in\u00a02022, and has continued its recovery in\u00a02023, with global revenue expected to reach\u00a090\u00a0% of\u00a02019\u00a0(IATA, Global Outlook for Air Transport, June\u00a02023). The airline industry, like many others, has been impacted by higher inflation, in particular in relation to jet fuel prices, driven up by energy shortages and the war in Ukraine, as well as rising interest rates and labour shortages. As a result of this, plus demand returning back to\u00a02019\u00a0levels, average airfares have increased (IATA, Global Outlook for Air Transport, June\u00a02023). Climate change is a further challenge facing the industry. The industry is committed to achieve net zero emissions by\u00a02050, meaning the current reliance on carbon offsetting will need to end. It is expected that\u00a0Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) will become the most important means for the industry to achieve its\u00a0reduction targets, however, predicted demand is far in excess of current production (Skift State of Travel\u00a02023, July\u00a02023). Hotel market The\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic had significant impacts on the hotel sector as travel and hotel restrictions imposed by governments in many countries resulted in the temporary closing of hotels and a significant decline in the\u00a0number of bed nights. The recovery of the hotel market was initiated with the resumption of domestic travel.\u00a0Following the lifting of governmental restrictions, international travel contributed to an increase in bed\u00a0nights. The hotel market comprises business and leisure hotels. Leisure hotels feature a number of characteristics\u00a0distinguishing them from business hotels, including longer average lengths of stay and differences in location,\u00a0room features and service offerings. From a demand perspective, the leisure hotel market in Europe comprises\u00a0several smaller sub-markets catering to customers? individual needs and preferences. The sub-markets comprise premium, comfort and budget hotels as well as family / apartment hotels and club or resort hotels.\u00a0Hotel companies may offer a variety of hotels for different market segments, often defined by price segment, star rating, exclusivity or available facilities. In Europe, in particular, there are many small, often family-run hotels, which are less upscale and have fewer financial resources. Most family-owned hotels are not branded. Given the large number of ownership and operating models for leisure hotels and the fragmented competitive landscape which, at least in Europe, is not dominated by large hotel chains, the competitive environment differs greatly between locations. Despite this strong fragmentation, a structural change can be observed in the European hotel industry, as in nearly all regions in the world. The share held by hotel chains is increasing, as well as the focus on direct distribution and customer loyalty. Sustainability and emissions reduction is strongly in focus for the hotels sector, with many major brands committing to emissions reduction targets and other goals including to energy efficiency, water conservation\u00a0and waste reduction. Inflation is another key issue for the industry, driven by rising energy costs, higher interest rates, and labour shortages. Although hotel revenue (based on the major global brands) has been increasing, driven by the post-pandemic recovery and strong pricing, hotels may need to increase their efficiency in order to remain competitive (Skift State of Travel\u00a02023, July\u00a02023). Cruise market From the end of July\u00a02022, nearly the entire global ocean-going cruise fleet was back in operation after the pandemic-induced suspension of operation. Sector forecasts regarding the pandemic impact and recovery\u00a0project passenger volume to exceed the levels recorded in baseline year\u00a02019\u00a0by the end of\u00a02023\u00a0and recover in excess of\u00a027\u00a0% above\u00a02019\u00a0levels by the end of\u00a02026\u00a0(CLIA, State of the Cruise Industry\u00a02023). In calendar year\u00a02022, the largest source markets were North America, Western Europe, Asia and Australia /New Zealand / Pacific. Based on passenger volume, the most popular destinations within that period were\u00a0the Caribbean, Central and Western Mediterranean, Northern Europe, North America and Eastern Mediterranean (CLIA, State of the Cruise Industry\u00a02023). Similar to the airline and hotel sectors, emissions reduction and the path to net zero is strongly in focus for the cruise industry. In addition, new regulations are being introduced, with additional International Maritime Organisation (IMO) rules on carbon intensity and rating system having entered into force at the start of\u00a02023, and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) being phased in from\u00a02024. Experiences and attractions market The market for experiences and attractions is a sizeable and rapidly growing tourism segment (based on\u00a0TUI\u00a0estimates). The market is diverse, complex and highly fragmented on the supplier side, and is predominantly operated offline. Intermediation and in-destination presence therefore play a key role. However, due to growing consolidation and digitalisation, the market is undergoing change. Online bookings have increased,\u00a0and many operators took the chance during the pandemic to invest in websites, digital marketing and software. In addition, the growth of\u00a0OTAs impacts how customers find and book experiences, and has prompted operators to improve their technology and digital marketing (Phocuswire news, October\u00a02022). Our brand Our brand is symbolised by our smiling red logo and stands for our aim to create the moments that make customers lives richer. Our new vision ?Excellence in Leisure Experiences? is about making our ambition clear to the marketplace. We strive to do this at every point in the customer journey both in the physical and digital worlds. Our new brand world crystalises this with a clear brand purpose, identity and promise. Pre-pandemic, we successfully migrated our local brands to a single global\u00a0TUI\u00a0brand. This established\u00a0TUI\u00a0as one of the best-known travel and leisure brands in our core markets in Europe (as measured by brand awareness and consideration in\u00a0TUI\u00a0brand performance tracking, conducted by Metrixlab). As we exited the pandemic, we sought to build on this success and support our growth ambitions, by broadening the\u00a0TUI\u00a0brand appeal into new customer segments and products. Our Live Happy campaign, which launched at the end of\u00a02021, has performed well across all markets and segments (based on quantitative testing comparing our campaign to external benchmarks). Having built emotional resonance with the brand through initial campaigns, we have deployed further advertising to drive\u00a0reappraisal and sales for our new and exclusive products e. g. Cities and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Blue Hotels. Our modular approach to advertising flexes by channel and segment, across markets and products, through the whole marketing funnel. To attract future segments, we increasingly look to diversify our media channel mix to reflect media viewing trends (such as video on demand and social media). Despite tough competition, we remain in the top spot for brand awareness and consideration, and continue to build and increase resonance based on brand identification and Net Promoter Score (TUI\u00a0Brand Pulse Tracking, July\u00a02023). We have also extended our brand beyond advertising\u00a0? to all of the touchpoints we have with our customers, as well as to our people, directing them towards the same overarching goal of creating a sustainable and consistent customer journey. To do so, we use our customer centricity programme ?Makers of Happy?, our values ?Trusted?, ?Unique? and ?Inspiring? and our new employer brand ?Let?s\u00a0TUI\u00a0It!?. All of this is intended to put\u00a0TUI\u00a0in a strong position. Group Earnings Comments on the consolidated income statement In the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0TUI\u00a0left behind the impacts of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic. In the Holiday Experience division the complete product portfolio could be offered.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s business volume was significantly higher than in financial year\u00a02022, which was still impacted by travel restrictions to contain\u00a0COVID-19, in particular in the first half. In aviation business disruptions did not occur unlike in the financial year\u00a02022. The number of guests reached near pre crisis levels, revenues exceeded pre crisis levels. In contrast the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0was still affected by the general increase in prices, especially for fuel, and by changes in exchange\u00a0rates.\u00a0TUI\u00a0was insufficiently hedged against these changes due to limited access to relevant hedging instruments. However, overall all the segments increased their results in comparison to the financial year\u00a02022.

On a constant currency basis, revenue increased by\u00a025.8\u00a0%. Revenue is presented alongside the cost of sales in the income statement, which increased by\u00a022.0\u00a0% in the period under review. Gross profit The difference between revenue and the cost of sales increased as a result of the normalisation of the business by ?\u00a0681.3\u00a0m year-on-year to a gross profit of ?\u00a01,613.0\u00a0m. Administrative expenses Administrative expenses increased by ?\u00a0269.3\u00a0m year-on-year to ?\u00a01,015.6\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0746.3\u00a0m). Administrative expenses increased due to the termination of state aid programmes as well as increased exchange rates. Other income and other expenses In financial year\u00a02023\u00a0other income mainly reflects gains from the disposal of aircraft assets and income from emission certificates. In the previous year, other income included the gain on disposal of Nordhotel S. A. in October\u00a02022\u00a0and also subsequent income relating to the disposal of Riu Hotels S. A. in financial year\u00a02021. In financial year\u00a02023, other expenses result from portion of the goodwill allocated to the segment Northern Region was disposed with the transfer of the operational business of Sunwing. This portion was\u00a0determined as the relative value of the operations of Sunwing disposed of in relation to the retained segment\u00a0Northern\u00a0Region. In the previous year, other expenses included in particular losses from the disposal of aircraft assets. Financial result The financial result in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year amounted to ? ?\u00a0445.9\u00a0m after ? ?\u00a0473.7\u00a0m in the previous year.\u00a0The increase in financial income mainly resulted from higher interest income of ?\u00a076.9\u00a0m, up\u00a0192.4\u00a0% (previous year ?\u00a026.3\u00a0m). The increase in financial expenses was mainly due to\u00a06.7\u00a0% higher interest expenses of\u00a0?\u00a0525.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0492.1\u00a0m), in particular driven by liabilities to banks and lease liabilities, the unwinding of discount on provisions and the measurement of hedges. On the other hand, lower expenses were incurred for other interest and similar expenses, largely due to lower interest expenses. Share of result of joint ventures and associates The share of result from joint ventures and associates of ?\u00a0407.2\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0100.7\u00a0m) comprises the proportionate net profit for the year of these companies. The increase by ?\u00a0306.4\u00a0m was in particular driven by the normalisation of the business. In addition, Sunwing realised a gain of ?\u00a0110.3\u00a0m from the sale of its operating activities, which increased the share of result of joint ventures and associates. Earnings before income taxes In the period under review, earnings before income taxes totalled ?\u00a0551.2\u00a0m, an improvement of ?\u00a0697.1\u00a0m year-on-year. In the previous year, a loss of ? ?\u00a0145.9\u00a0m was recorded. Group profit / loss The Group profit for financial year\u00a02023\u00a0totalled ?\u00a0455.7\u00a0m, an increase of ?\u00a0668.3\u00a0m year-on-year (previous year loss of ? ?\u00a0212.6\u00a0m). Share in Group loss attributable to TUI\u00a0AG shareholders The share in Group loss attributable to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shareholders amounted to ?\u00a0305.8\u00a0m in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year ? ?\u00a0277.3\u00a0m). Non-controlling interests In the completed financial year, non-controlling interests in the Group result totalled ?\u00a0149.9\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a064.6\u00a0m. They mainly related to\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group. Earnings per share The interest in the Group result attributable to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shareholders resulted in basic earnings per share of\u00a0?\u00a00.80\u00a0(previous year ? ?\u00a01.02) in financial year\u00a02023. Earnings per share for all periods presented were adjusted for the effect of the capital reduction carried out in February\u00a02023\u00a0at a ratio of\u00a010:1\u00a0and the effect of the bonus component of subscription rights issued as part of the capital increase in March\u00a02023. Alternative Performance indicators The Group?s main financial\u00a0KPI\u00a0is underlying\u00a0EBIT. We define the\u00a0EBIT\u00a0in underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0as earnings before interest, income taxes and income and expenses for the measurement of the Group?s interest hedges.\u00a0EBIT\u00a0by definition includes goodwill impairments. Underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0is adjusted by income and expense items impacting or distorting the assessment of the operating profitability of the segments and the Group due to their level and frequency. These items include gains on disposal from investments, major gains and losses from the sale of assets and major restructuring and integration expenses. In addition, adjustments are carried for all effects from purchase price allocations, ancillary acquisition costs and conditional purchase price payments. Adjustments made in the reconciliation to underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0include goodwill impairments.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_19\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"448\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Reconciliation to underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?

Results were driven by an improved operational performance supported in particular by higher occupancies and improved\u00a0rates. Popular destinations proved to be Turkey, the Balearics and Greece as well as our year-round destinations in the Caribbean, the Canaries and Cape Verde. The number of available bed nights on offer rose by\u00a02.0\u00a0% year-on-year as we continued to expand our capacity in this segment. The average occupancy rate increased across all our brands by a total of\u00a06\u00a0%pts to\u00a082\u00a0% (previous year:\u00a076\u00a0%). Average daily rate per bed increased by\u00a012.6\u00a0% to ?\u00a087\u00a0(previous year: ?\u00a077) and were well ahead of the pre-pandemic levels, with Riu continuing to drive the strong performance. On a brand by brand basis, Riu occupancy increased by\u00a08\u00a0% pts to\u00a090\u00a0% versus previous year (previous year:\u00a082\u00a0%) and average daily rate improved\u00a013.5\u00a0% to ?\u00a078\u00a0(previous year: ?\u00a069), with the Group once again delivering\u00a0an improved operational performance in particular in the Caribbean market. Robinson achieved an improved result across its portfolio of mainly four- and five star club hotels, supported by higher occupancy up\u00a05\u00a0% pts to\u00a071\u00a0% versus previous year (previous year:\u00a066\u00a0%) and average daily rate up\u00a02.1\u00a0% to ?\u00a0106\u00a0(previous year: ?\u00a0103). Blue Diamond occupancy increased by\u00a05\u00a0% pts to\u00a083\u00a0% versus previous year (previous year:\u00a079\u00a0%) and average\u00a0daily rates were\u00a010.9\u00a0% higher at ?\u00a0152\u00a0(previous year: ?\u00a0137), benefitting from higher demand to our Caribbean and Mexican properties. Our other hotels which include popular brands such as\u00a0TUI\u00a0Blue,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Magic Life and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Suneo, profited from higher rates and occupancies. In Hotels &amp; Resorts, product growth is being delivered by expanding our portfolio in new and existing destinations. In\u00a0FY23\u00a0we added\u00a041\u00a0new hotels to our pipeline. This growth is being achieved in accordance with our asset-right and scalable approach through our joint ventures. During the year we announced plans to further expand the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Blue portfolio, our brand focused on experience orientated lifestyle travellers. The\u00a0expansion is driven by international partnerships in which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Blue hotels are operated either under management contracts or by franchises. In addition, we also announced the creation of a new off-balance sheet joint\u00a0venture with Riu. This targets realising unique opportunities to invest into growth, whilst limiting the financial impact on\u00a0TUI?s leverage and net investments. The global Hansainvest hotel fund, initiated by\u00a0TUI, is successfully executing its first two hotel investments on Zanzibar and on Cape Verde. Here,\u00a0TUI\u00a0is providing hotel management and investment advisory services to support our asset-light growth development.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_27\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Var. %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">656.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">331.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a097.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">236.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n. a.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0(at constant currency)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">235.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n. a.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Available passenger cruise days2\u00a0(in ?000)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mein Schiff</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6,121</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5,637</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a08.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hapag-Lloyd Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">589</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">531</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a011.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Marella Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,789</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,073</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a034.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Occupancy3\u00a0(in %, variance in % points)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mein Schiff</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">95</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">69</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a026</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hapag-Lloyd Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">72</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">58</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a014</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Marella Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">96</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">70</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a026</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Average daily rate (in ?)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mein Schiff4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">171</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">178</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a04.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hapag-Lloyd Cruises4</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">735</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">653</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a012.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Marella Cruises5\u00a0(in \u00a3)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">181</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">164</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a010.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1\u00a0No revenue is carried for Mein Schiff and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises as the joint venture\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises is consolidated at equity. 2\u00a0Number of operating days multiplied per berths available on the operated ships.

The segment operated a full fleet of\u00a016\u00a0ships for the vast majority of the financial year against a more limited programme in the previous financial year, when full operations were only resumed in April\u00a02022\u00a0following the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0restrictions during the winter months. In Spring\u00a02023\u00a0Mein Schiff Herz transferred from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises to Marella and after a period of refurbishment, the newly named Marella Voyager returned to service at the beginning of June for the summer season. The segment continued its recovery throughout the year. As a result, underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0of ?\u00a0236.0\u00a0m was up\u00a0?\u00a0235.3\u00a0m (previous year: ?\u00a00.8\u00a0m). All of our three Cruise brands contributed to the positive\u00a0EBIT\u00a0development boosted by increased volumes as well as higher occupancies. Occupancy rates continued to rise throughout the year ranging between\u00a072\u00a0% and\u00a096\u00a0% across our Cruises brands (previous year: between\u00a058\u00a0% and\u00a070\u00a0%), with rates for many itineraries achieving the peaks last seen in\u00a02019. Mein Schiff operated their full fleet of six ships during the summer season against seven ships during the winter season, following the transfer of Mein Schiff Herz to Marella Cruises in spring\u00a02023. In the prior year the brand had only been able to operate its full fleet of seven ships from April\u00a02022\u00a0following the lifting of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0restrictions. The brand offered itineraries to the Canaries, the Caribbean, Central America, Asia and the Orient during the winter with an offering to the Mediterranean, Northern Europe and the Baltic Sea during the summer. With the return to normal operations, available passenger cruise days of\u00a06,121\u00a0k\u00a0were up\u00a08.6\u00a0% (previous year:\u00a05,637\u00a0k). Occupancy of\u00a095\u00a0%, was\u00a026\u00a0%pts higher versus previous year (previous year:\u00a069\u00a0%) underlining the higher demand for our German language premium all-inclusive product. Mein Schiff average daily rate of\u00a0171? was ?\u00a04.0\u00a0% versus previous year (previous year: ?\u00a0178) but was virtually in line with pre-pandemic levels (FY\u00a02019: ?\u00a0174). Despite higher rates during the summer year-on-year, the\u00a0overall lower rates against previous year were driven by the sale of a higher mix of premium cabins in the\u00a0prior\u00a0winter half-year when occupancies and capacity were significantly lower due to a more restricted programme. Hapag-Lloyd Cruises, our luxury and expeditions brand, provided itineraries to Europe, Asia, the Americas\u00a0and around the world with a full fleet of five ships able to operate again within a restriction-free environment. As a result, average passenger cruise days rose\u00a011.0\u00a0% to\u00a0589\u00a0k (previous year:\u00a0531\u00a0k). Average daily rate of ?\u00a0735\u00a0increased by\u00a012.6\u00a0% versus previous year (previous year: ?\u00a0653) and was well above pre-pandemic levels of ?\u00a0641. Occupancy of\u00a072\u00a0% rose by\u00a014\u00a0%-pts versus previous year (previous year:\u00a058\u00a0%) underlining the higher demand for these cruises. Marella Cruises, our\u00a0UK\u00a0cruise brand, offered itineraries to the Mediterranean, the Canaries, Caribbean and\u00a0North America during the year. The business was able to operate a full fleet with Marella Voyager complimenting\u00a0the fleet of now five vessels during the summer season. Available passenger cruise days increased by\u00a034.5\u00a0% to\u00a02,789\u00a0k (previous year:\u00a02,073\u00a0k) as a consequence and were also supported by a return to a full winter offering after the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0restrictions in the previous year. The average daily rate was \u00a3\u00a0181, up\u00a010.6\u00a0% year-on-year (previous year: \u00a3\u00a0164) driven by itineraries to the Mediterranean and the expansion of the fleet. Occupancy also improved significantly to\u00a096\u00a0%, up\u00a026\u00a0% pts versus previous year (previous year:\u00a070\u00a0%).</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_28\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"408\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TUI\u00a0Musement</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022adjusted</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Var. %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total revenue*</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,160.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">866.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a034.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">770.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">578.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a033.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">36.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">23.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a051.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0(at constant currency)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">44.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">23.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a086.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">* Total revenue includes intragroup revenue.

The winter half-year results in particular were impacted by inflationary pressures especially on energy, exchange rate volatility and the negative impact of valuation effects from ineffective hedge positions. The summer half-year benefitted from the non-repeat of the significant operational flight disruption costs experienced especially in\u00a0UK\u00a0in the previous year, following the unparalleled industry ramp-up after the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic. Results were impacted by ?\u00a025\u00a0m during the peak summer season due to the wildfires on Rhodes. Against this background, underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0for the\u00a0segment of ?\u00a0240.6\u00a0m, was up ?\u00a0299.1\u00a0m on previous year (previous year: ? ?\u00a058.6\u00a0m loss), supported by higher demand for our product offering at significantly higher prices. A total of\u00a019,010\u00a0k customers departed for their holidays during the financial year, up\u00a013.3\u00a0% year-on-year (previous year:\u00a016,780\u00a0k) with demand higher across all our source markets. Bookings taken for both the summer season and especially the winter season were well ahead of previous year. Traditional short- and medium-haul destinations such as the Canaries and Egypt were again popular amongst customers during the winter season, whilst mainland Spain, Greece, Turkey, the Balearics and the Canaries\u00a0were well sought after in the summer season. Also, destinations such as Mexico and the Dominican Republic\u00a0proved to be in good demand throughout the financial year. A key focus in the transformation of the segment is the strengthening and leveraging of our capabilities and market positions with growth delivered from new products and new customers, based on scalable common platforms. During the year we rolled-out our group-wide platforms for accommodation-only, flight-only and dynamic packaging to more markets and we are continuing to develop and enhance the capabilities of these platforms.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_30\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"448\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Northern Region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Var. %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7,722.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,320.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a022.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">71.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a0101.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n. a.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0(at constant currency)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">52.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a0101.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n. a.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Direct distribution mix1\u00a0(in %, variance in % points)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">94</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">94</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Online mix2\u00a0(in %, variance in % points)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">69</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">71</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a02</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Customers (in ?000)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7,360</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,475</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a013.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1\u00a0Share of sales via own channels (retail and online) 2\u00a0Share of online sales Northern Region comprises the source markets\u00a0UK\u00a0and Nordics with our strategic tour operator venture in Canada being sold in April\u00a02023.

Financial management covers all Group companies in which\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0directly or indirectly holds an interest of\u00a0more than\u00a050\u00a0%. It is based on policies covering all cash flow-oriented aspects of the Group?s business activities. In implementing a cross-border organisation approach,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has outsourced some of its treasury activities to First Choice Holidays Finance Ltd, a British Group company. However, the treasury activities are carried out on a coordinated and centralised basis. Goals TUI?s financial management goals include ensuring sufficient liquidity for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and its subsidiaries and limiting financial risks from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates as well as default risks associated with treasury activities. Liquidity safeguards The Group?s liquidity safeguards consist of two components: In the course of the annual Group planning process,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group draws up a multi-annual financial budget, from which long-term financing and refinancing requirements are derived. This information and financial market observation to identify refinancing opportunities create a basis for decision-making for concluding appropriate financing instruments for long-term corporate funding at an early stage.  TUI\u00a0uses syndicated credit facilities and bilateral bank lines as well as its liquid funds to secure sufficient short-term cash reserves. Through intra-Group cash pooling, excess cash of individual Group companies is used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies. A weekly rolling liquidity planning system is the basis for arrangements with banks. Limiting financial risks The Group companies operate on a worldwide scale.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is therefore exposed to financial risks from changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. The key operating financial transaction risks relate to the euro,\u00a0US\u00a0dollar, pound sterling and Swedish krona and to changing fuel prices. They mainly result from cost items in foreign currencies held by individual Group companies, e. g. hotel procurement, aircraft fuel and bunker oil invoices or ship handling costs. The Group has entered into derivative hedges in various foreign currencies in order to limit its exposure to\u00a0risks from changes in exchange rates. Changes in commodity prices affect\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, in particular, in procuring fuels such as aircraft fuel and bunker oil. Some of these price risks related to fuel procurement are hedged\u00a0by derivative instruments. Where price increases can be passed on to customers due to contractual agreements, this is also reflected in our hedging behaviour. Hedging cover is taken out ahead of the markets? customer booking profiles. This provides a degree of certainty over input costs when planning pricing and capacity. In order to control risks related to changes in interest rates arising on funding in international money and capital markets and investments of liquid funds, derivative interest hedges are used on a case-by-case basis as part of the Group?s interest management system. In order to limit default risks from settlement payments for derivatives as well as money market investments with banks,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and First Choice Holidays Finance Ltd have defined credit rating criteria for the selection of their counterparties. Trading and transaction limits are allocated to these counterparties on the basis of the credit ratings issued by the major rating agencies. The credit ratings and the corresponding limits are regularly reviewed. In the event of changes in the fair value of derivatives or rating changes, new business with these counterparties may temporarily be suspended until the limits can be applied appropriately again. The use of derivative hedges is based on underlying transactions; the derivatives are not used for speculation purposes. More detailed information on hedging strategies and risk management as well as financial transactions and\u00a0the scope of such transactions at the balance sheet date is provided in the Risk Report and the section Financial instruments in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements.

It accounted for\u00a045.0\u00a0% (previous year\u00a042.7\u00a0%) of the balance sheet total. The equity ratio was\u00a012.1\u00a0% (previous year\u00a04.2\u00a0%). Equity and non-current financial liabilities accounted for\u00a019.5\u00a0% (previous year\u00a015.6\u00a0%) of the balance sheet total. Equity In the completed financial year, after three shares had been redeemed in order to achieve a rounded figure for the capital stock, the existing capital stock of the Company amounting to ?\u00a01,785,205,850.00, divided into\u00a01,785,205,850\u00a0registered no-par value shares, each representing a pro rata amount of the capital stock of ?\u00a01.00, was reduced by ?\u00a01,606,685,265.00\u00a0to ?\u00a0178,520,585.00\u00a0in accordance with the provisions on capital reduction pursuant to sections\u00a0222\u00a0et seq of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in conjunction with\u00a0section\u00a07\u00a0(6) of the German Securities Trading Act (WStBG) for the purpose of transferring part of the capital stock to the Company?s capital reserve. The reduction was effected by a ten-for-one reverse stock split, so that ten no-par value registered shares were consolidated into one no-par value registered share. The capital reduction was related to a recapitalisation of the Company in line with section\u00a022\u00a0WStBG. The reduction amount of ?\u00a01,606,685,265.00\u00a0was transferred to the Company?s non-distributable capital reserve in accordance with section\u00a07\u00a0(6) sentence\u00a05\u00a0WStBG. Following the capital reduction, the Company?s capital stock of ?\u00a0178,520,585.00, divided into\u00a0178,520,585\u00a0no-par value registered shares, was increased to ?\u00a0507,431,033.00\u00a0by issuing\u00a0328,910,448\u00a0new no-par value registered shares with a pro rata amount of capital stock of ?\u00a01.00\u00a0per no-par value share, divided into\u00a0507,431,033\u00a0no-par value registered shares. This increase in capital stock of ?\u00a0328.9\u00a0m was carried out entirely from authorised capital using the authorisations granted by the Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0to issue new registered shares against cash contributions worth a maximum of ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0million (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I) and to issue new shares against cash or non-cash contributions in the amount of ?\u00a0626.9\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0II). Silent ESF participations The remaining Silent Participation I of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m taken out by the\u00a0ESFin financial year\u00a02021, convertible into\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shares at a conversion price of ?\u00a01.00\u00a0per share, was repaid in full in April\u00a02023\u00a0following a capital\u00a0increase without the\u00a0ESF\u00a0having exercised its conversion option. Provisions Provisions mainly comprise provisions for pension obligations, tax provisions and provisions for typical operating risks classified as current or non-current, depending on expected occurrence. At the balance sheet date, they accounted for a total of ?\u00a01,852.4\u00a0m, down by ?\u00a045.0\u00a0m year-on-year.

See Other notes from page 275. ESF warrant bond In April\u00a02023, the remaining ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m of the warrant bond issued to the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) in\u00a0October\u00a02020\u00a0was repurchased together with the outstanding\u00a058.7\u00a0m warrants following a capital increase without the\u00a0ESF\u00a0having exercised its warrant rights. Syndicated credit facilities of TUI\u00a0AG On the basis of a contractual agreement and due to proceeds from a capital increase,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s syndicated credit facilities originally totalling around ?\u00a03.7\u00a0bn were reduced to around ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn by cancelling an amount of ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn of the undrawn KfW tranche previously amounting to ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn. In May\u00a02023, ahead of the maturity date, an agreement was concluded with the lenders under\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s syndicated credit facilities totalling around ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn, including a cash tranche by KfW of ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn and a bank guarantee tranche of ?\u00a0190.0\u00a0m, to extend the maturity of these facilities to July\u00a02026. The interest rate for cash drawdowns is variable and depends on the short-term interest rate level (EURIBOR\u00a0or\u00a0SONIA) and\u00a0TUI?s credit rating plus a margin. At the balance sheet date, no cash drawdowns had been made on the syndicated credit facilities. 2018 Schuldschein In July\u00a02023, the Schuldschein of ?\u00a0425\u00a0m issued in\u00a02018\u00a0was reduced to ?\u00a0242\u00a0m by redeeming two tranches worth ?\u00a0183\u00a0m. Bank credits and lease liabilities Liabilities to banks mainly relate to the Schuldschein worth of ?\u00a0242\u00a0m of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and liabilities from the\u00a0financing of aircraft and hotel facilities. Lease liabilities essentially relate to aircraft funding and hotel leases. For more detailed information, in particular on the remaining terms, please refer to the section Financial and lease liabilities in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements. See section Financial and lease liabilities, page 244. Other liabilities The combined figure for other liabilities mainly includes trade payables and customer deposits. At ?\u00a08,136.0\u00a0m, it was ?\u00a0682.6\u00a0m up year-on-year. Key credit facilities Syndicated credit facilities of TUI\u00a0AGTUI\u00a0AG?s syndicated credit facility of around ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn included a tranche of ?\u00a0190\u00a0m for bank guarantees. At the balance sheet date, no cash drawdowns had been made from this credit facility. An amount of ?\u00a0109.2\u00a0m was drawn under this credit facility by utilising bank guarantees. Bilateral guarantee facilities of TUI\u00a0AG with banks In October\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0concluded a guarantee facility of ?\u00a0345.6\u00a0m with a bank in order to meet a regulatory obligation. At the balance sheet date, this guarantee facility was fully utilsed. In October\u00a02023, this guarantee facility was replaced by a new guarantee facility and utilsed in exchange for a new guarantee worth ?\u00a0386.0\u00a0m. In addition,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0concluded further bilateral guarantee facilities with banks with a total amount of ?\u00a019.8\u00a0m\u00a0for the provision of bank guarantees in the framework of ordinary business activities. Some of the guarantees\u00a0have a term of several years. The guarantees granted give rise to a commission in the form of a fixed percentage of the maximum guaranteed amount. At the balance sheet date, an amount of ?\u00a04.9\u00a0m of these facilities had been utilised. Obligations from financing agreements TUI\u00a0AG?s Schuldschein worth nominal ?\u00a0242\u00a0m, the convertible bond worth nominal ?\u00a0589.6\u00a0m and the credit and\u00a0guarantee facilities for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0contain a number of obligations. Under its syndicated credit facility worth ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has a duty to comply with certain financial covenants (as defined in the contract). These require (a) compliance with an\u00a0EBITDAR-to-net interest expense ratio measuring\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s relative charge from the interest result and its lease and rental expenses; and (b) compliance with a net debt-to-EBITDA\u00a0ratio, calculating\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s relative charge from financial liabilities. The\u00a0EBITDAR-to-net interest expense ratio must have a coverage multiple of at least\u00a02.5; net debt must not exceed\u00a03.0\u00a0times\u00a0EBITDA. The financial covenants are determined every six months, but the banks initially agreed to apply less tight financial covenants up until and including\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02023. In addition,\u00a0TUI?s scope for pledging or selling assets, acquiring other companies or shareholdings, or effecting mergers has been restricted. TUI\u00a0AG?s Schuldschein worth nominal ?\u00a0242\u00a0m, the convertible bond worth nominal ?\u00a0589.6\u00a0m and the credit and guarantee facilities for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0also contain additional clauses typical of financing instruments of this type. Non-compliance with these obligations provide the lenders the right to terminate the facilities and terminate the financing arrangements for immediate repayment.

Following upgrades of their ratings to B- (Standard &amp; Poor?s) and B3\u00a0(Moody?s) in financial year\u00a02022, the two rating agencies upgraded their ratings to ?B (positive outlook)? (Standard &amp; Poor?s) and ?B2\u00a0(positive outlook)? (Moody?s) in April and May\u00a02023\u00a0due to a significant improvement in the business environment, the stronger balance sheet structure and the improved liquidity situation. Financial stability targets TUI\u00a0is aiming for an improved credit rating to finance the further development of the company. With the temporary grounding of the Boeing\u00a0737\u00a0MAX\u00a0aircraft type and subsequently due to the effects of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, the rating was downgraded from\u00a0BB\u00a0and Ba territory to\u00a0CCC+ and Caa1\u00a0in\u00a02020. In the\u00a02022\u00a0financial year,\u00a0TUI\u00a0was upgraded to B territory again by both rating agencies. The improvements in key operating figures associated with the easing of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, the structural improvement in key debt figures, in particular as a result of the capital increase in April\u00a02023, and the early extension of the syndicated credit facilities led to an improvement in the rating to B (Standard &amp; Poor?s) and B2\u00a0(Moody?s) in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year, each with a positive outlook. We are aiming to further improve our ratings in order\u00a0to minimise our borrowing costs and stabilise our access to the debt capital markets. We achieved our financial stability target of a gross leverage ratio of below\u00a03.0x in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year with a ratio of\u00a02.6x. From financial year\u00a02024\u00a0onwards, we define the net-leverage ratio along the following basic lines:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_43\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"504\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Leverage Ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,297.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,051.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">plus Lease liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,918.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,207.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">less Cash and cash equivalents</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,060.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,736.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">less Other current financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">85.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,106.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,436.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBITDA\u00a0(underlying)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,775.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,224.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Leverage Ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Due to lower net debt and the improvement in our\u00a0EBITDA\u00a0(underlying) , our net-leverage ratio improved to\u00a01.2x in the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year:\u00a02.8x). We are aiming for a net-leverage ratio of strongly less than\u00a01.0x in the medium term. See section Capital management, page 272. Interest and financing environment In financial year\u00a02023, short-term interest rates for the key currencies have steadily risen, from low single digit percentage rates at the start of the period rising to medium single digit percentage rates towards the end of the period, as central banks raised rates to tackle rising inflation. Inflation has now started to ease in the key currency areas. Interest rates are expected to be at, or close to, their peak, and no further significant\u00a0interest rate increases by central banks are expected in the upcoming months. With the increase in short-term interest rates, both the income from money market investments and the reference interest rates for floating-rate debt have risen accordingly. In the financial year under review, quoted credit margins (based on\u00a0CDS\u00a0levels) for corporates on sub-investment grades fell again, but remain at a level above the long-term average. Credit margins for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0declined again in the course of the financial year under review but are still elevated. Due to the persistently difficult market environment in\u00a02023, refinancing was not possible at acceptable terms and conditions. Liquidity analysis At the balance sheet date,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, the parent company of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, held cash and cash equivalents worth ?\u00a00.3\u00a0m. Restrictions on the transfer of liquid funds At the balance sheet date, there were restrictions worth around ?\u00a00.8\u00a0bn (previous year ?\u00a00.5\u00a0bn) on the\u00a0transfer of liquid funds within the Group that might significantly impact the Group?s liquidity, such as restrictions on capital movements and restrictions due to credit agreements concluded. Change of control Significant agreements taking effect in the event of a change of control due to a takeover bid are outlined in the chapter on Information required under takeover law.

In the financial year under review,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s gross capital expenditure on property, plant and equipment amounted to ?\u00a0577.9\u00a0m, up\u00a018.9\u00a0% year-on-year. This year-on-year increase was driven by the normalisation\u00a0and expansion of our business activities after the pandemic subsided, which led to higher capital expenditure,\u00a0in particular in Hotels &amp; Resorts and\u00a0IT. The significant increase in capex in the Cruises segment was attributable\u00a0to the refurbishment of the Mein Schiff Herz before the vessel was commissioned for the\u00a0UK\u00a0market by Marella Cruises. Net property, plant and equipment and investments amounted to ?\u00a0493.7\u00a0m in the period under review, an increase of\u00a056.3\u00a0% year-on-year. Investments include a contribution to the share\u00a0capital of Pep Toni S.

We firmly believe that sustainable development is critical to long-term economic success. In the sections below,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0presents a Non-Financial Group Declaration for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group that combines aspects and reporting on the following key issues: environmental matters, employee matters, social matters, respecting human rights, and information on integrity and compliance. Pursuant to section\u00a0315b para.\u00a01\u00a0sentence\u00a03\u00a0of the German Commercial Code (HGB), we also refer, in a number of respects, to non-financial disclosures found in other parts of the Group Management Report. In addition to the Group?s fully consolidated subsidiaries, this non-financial statement also includes companies recognised at equity, in particular in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts sector and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises. A materiality assessment performed in the financial year under review generated insights into the risks and opportunities relating to sustainability. The\u00a0ESG-related positions and views derived from a survey among internal experts were consolidated into a list of key topics. The findings did not give rise to any substantial changes in our reporting approach for the Non-Financial Group Declaration. We identified the following aspects scoring highest in the Environment, Social and Governance categories: Environment: emissions, creation of sustainable holiday products, energy sources and efficiency, sustainable procurement, destination development, waste and circularity  Social: human rights, diversity, equality and inclusion, talent acquisition, fair pay, occupational health and safety, positive employee experience  Governance: supply chain management, fair business relationships and integrity, corporate citizenship, crisis management, business continuity Nevertheless, in developing our\u00a0TUI\u00a0Sustainability Agenda, we also include topics with lower materiality scores, so as, for instance, to reflect the future relevance of specific topics such as biodiversity management. We describe our risk management system and the principal risks associated with our business activities, our business relationships and services as well as the principal sustainability risks in our Risk Report from page\u00a035. Following a climate risk analysis carried out across the Group, our risk reporting was expanded to include more detailed information on the impact of climate change on\u00a0TUI. Applied standards and sustainability indices Our reporting reflects the principles of the\u00a0UN\u00a0Global Compact, which\u00a0TUI\u00a0signed up to in\u00a02014. Our sustainability activities are also aligned with the\u00a0UN\u00a0Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0participated in the\u00a0CDP\u00a0Climate Change Programme and in the S&amp;P Dow Jones Sustainability Index Assessment and engaged in dialogue with other\u00a0ESG\u00a0researchers. For the first time,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s rating was upgraded to ?Prime Investment? by\u00a0ISS\u00a0ESG. Specific CO2 emissions of our airlines as a key non-financial performance indicator We regard specific\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions (in g\u00a0CO2\u00a0/ rpk) of our aircraft fleet as a key non-financial performance indicator. See page 86. Disclosures pursuant to EU Taxonomy Regulation (2020 / 852) This Group Declaration includes disclosures on whether and to what extent\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s operations include economic activities to be classified as Taxonomy-eligible or Taxonomie-aligned under the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852). Limited Assurance Engagement Attestation The present Non-Financial Group Declaration was not included in the audit of the annual financial statements. It was subject to a limited assurance engagement in accordance with\u00a0ISAE\u00a03000\u00a0(revised). See page 295. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) As a company listed in the Premium Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange, we are required pursuant to Listing Rule\u00a0LR\u00a09.8.6\u00a0to make disclosures in relation to the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board?s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The section from page 134 summarises the extent to which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group complies with the\u00a0TCFD?s recommendations. These disclosures are not part of this Non-Financial Group Declaration. Governance and sustainability management For\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, sustainability is a fundamental management principle and a cornerstone of our strategy for\u00a0continually enhancing the value of our Company. Global responsibility for economic, environmental and social sustainability is at the core of our corporate culture. Disclosures on the business model TUI\u00a0Group is an integrated tourism group operating globally.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s business model is outlined in detail from pages 24 and 28 onwards in this Annual Report in accordance with section 315c para. 1 in conjunction with section 289c para. 1\u00a0HGB. TUI\u00a0Group has a governance structure in place that ensures that sustainability issues, along with climate-related\u00a0risks and opportunities, are assessed and actioned at all levels. The Group Executive Committee (GEC) manages\u00a0TUI?s business strategically, it sets the Group?s strategic direction and long-term objectives for sustainable development and signed off the Group?s Sustainability Agenda, published in February\u00a02023. It defines the global framework for\u00a0TUI?s sustainability activities. A team of experienced sustainability professionals are working in close collaboration with management to ensure that\u00a0TUI?s business and sustainability activities areas are closely aligned. The Group Sustainability Director heads up the Group Sustainability team, and reports to the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO) who sits on the\u00a0GEC. The role of our sustainability team is to drive implementation of the Sustainability Agenda across\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and along its supply chain. The\u00a0GEC\u00a0is regularly updated on our performance in delivering the Sustainability Agenda and tackling other key sustainability issues. Regular meetings are also held with the Risk Oversight Committee (ROC) to review sustainability risks. TUI\u00a0Sustainability Agenda TUI\u00a0Group?s Sustainability Agenda, developed in the past few reporting periods by\u00a0TUI?s international sustainability team, was published in February\u00a02023. New priorities and strategic directions for\u00a0TUI?s global\u00a0sustainability activities were drawn up in consultation with internal and external stakeholders, taking account\u00a0of current challenges, global scenarios and mechanisms such as the\u00a0EU\u00a0Green Deal. We engaged in direct dialogue with our stakeholders and participated in industry initiatives to discuss expectations as well as existing and future challenges in relation to sustainability issues, and these have\u00a0been incorporated into our sustainability activities. The Supervisory Board, Executive Board, Group Executive Board\u00a0and employee representatives were regularly involved in the development of the Agenda by means of individual and group presentations. We also discussed specific topics with associations and interested stakeholders. We have continued to foster this dialogue since publishing our Agenda in order to ensure that we focus on the most important issues and adopt relevant future topics at an early stage. Our Sustainability Agenda builds on tourism as a force for good. Together with our partners we continue to promote the positive effects of tourism on local communities, reduce our ecological footprint and create more sustainable holiday products for our guests. Our mission ?We are mindful of the importance of travel and tourism for many countries in the world and for the people living there. We partner with these countries and other stakeholders to actively shape a more sustainable future for tourism.? TUI?s ambition is to actively shape a more sustainable future for tourism in all three dimensions of sustainability ? social, environmental and economic. We use our scale and influence for the sustainable transformation of the tourism industry. We understand sustainable transformation as an opportunity. Our Agenda is founded on three priorities: We aim to empower people in the destinations and\u00a0TUI\u00a0employees\u00a0to drive the sustainable transformation actively (People). We aim to reduce\u00a0TUI?s ecological footprint (Planet).\u00a0We aim to partner with others to launch initiatives for the sustainable transformation of our sector (Progress). Our three P?s ? People, Planet and Progress ? are supported by\u00a015\u00a0focus areas with key goals, objectives and\u00a0initiatives. Our Sustainability Agenda seeks to address the major challenges we will face in the coming decades,\u00a0in particular climate change. For more details on the three P?s, please refer to the table below. Our targets include achieving net-zero emissions across our own operations and in the supply chain by\u00a02050\u00a0at the latest, setting near-term science-based targets for emission reduction, becoming a circular business and enabling around\u00a020\u00a0million customers a year to make sustainable holiday choices (from\u00a02030). Our Sustainability Agenda supports the United Nations? Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)\u00a017\u00a0global goals to fight inequality, end poverty and protect our planet by\u00a02030\u00a0? and defines appropriate measures to contribute to their achievement. The tourism value chain is closely linked with many different sectors. This enables us to influence progress on many\u00a0SDGs, with a particular focus on\u00a013\u00a0of these goals. People ? Empowering to drive development In many parts of the world, tourism is one of the key driving forces for development and prosperity. It creates employment, provides education and drives social and environmental standards. We aim to ensure that local people and communities benefit from tourism and local supply chains. Our employees are empowered to\u00a0play a crucial role in this because we offer the skills and knowledge they need for a sustainable transformation of the tourism industry. Contribution to the SDGs TUI Sustainability Academy and training programmes We seek to provide our colleagues with the knowledge and skills required to become sustainability changemakers. One of our tools is the digital\u00a0TUI\u00a0Sustainability Academy learning platform. It offers insights into a wide range of sustainability topics, from energy and fuels to social impacts and the circular economy. The launch of\u00a0TUI?s Sustainability Agenda includes training sessions designed to familiarise our employees with the core content of the strategy so that they can apply it more easily to their respective areas of work. Some elements of the training courses are adapted to a specific business area and market, enhancing the relevance and integration. By\u00a02025\u00a0we hope to deliver our employees\u00a025,000\u00a0hours of training a year on sustainability issues. We intend to start our reporting in\u00a0FY24. German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act Protecting human rights and environmental standards across supply chains is the focus of the new German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act (GSCA), which entered into force on\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02023. For\u00a0TUI, it applies to our own business,\u00a0TUI\u00a0suppliers and the wider supply chain, both in Germany and worldwide. An internal\u00a0GSCA\u00a0Steering Group has been established to manage the introduction and integration of the Act within the Company. In the financial year under review, the focus was on the development and implementation of risk analyses, training programmes, preventative and corrective measures and the adjustment and updating of\u00a0policies and reporting processes. These activities build on the work already delivered by\u00a0TUI\u00a0to protect human rights and the environment and support preparations for the\u00a0EU\u00a0Due Diligence Directive.

We have a number of policies and initiatives in place to monitor, identify, mitigate and prevent human rights impacts in line with the\u00a0UN\u00a0Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, and will take remedial action where necessary. TUI\u00a0signed up to the\u00a0UN\u00a0Global Compact in\u00a02014.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has thus committed to aligning its activities\u00a0to principles in the fields of human rights, labour standards, environmental protection and anti-corruption.  TUI\u00a0signed the\u00a0UN\u00a0World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO)?s Global Code of Ethics in\u00a02012.  Our Global Employment Statement focusses on fair and respectful dealings with employees at all levels and compliance with applicable law and industry standards.  Our Employee Code of Conduct, the Integrity Passport, commits us to respect and observe human rights. Colleagues are encouraged to report any wrongdoing via the Speak Up Line.  Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards we expect from our suppliers, covering human rights and labour laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, environmental impacts and support for local communities.  We expect our hotel partners to implement sustainability certifications recognised by the Global Sustainable\u00a0Tourism Council (GSTC)*\u00a0comprising standards for human rights, child protection and social welfare. We also apply the\u00a0GSTC\u00a0Criteria to our experiences programme. In\u00a0FY22\u00a0we started certifications of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Collection portfolio and extended this process in\u00a0FY23\u00a0to further excursion programmes we offer.  Our in-house child protection policies include information for our colleagues on ?voluntourism?.  Our Human Rights Policy Statement, published on\u00a0TUI?s website, sets out our activities and measures implemented in our business operations and our supply chain to prevent human rights violations.  We continue to provide e-learning modules on human rights and child protection, which we regularly update\u00a0to reflect changes in framework parameters. Airline crews in the\u00a0UK, Nordics and Germany receive Vulnerable\u00a0Children and Human Trafficking training programmes as part of their induction so that they can spot human trafficking and take action. All staff working for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement have to complete the Human Rights and Child Protection modules every two years. A global training programme for\u00a0TUI\u00a0employees was being rolled out in the period under review. *\u00a0TUI\u00a0requirement for hotel partners with more than 80 rooms and\u00a0TUI\u00a0occupancy rate &amp;gt; 10 %. Supporting the TUI Care Foundation One of our initiatives aimed at making a difference in the destinations is the foundation set up by our Group,\u00a0which draws on tourism as a force for good to improve the lives of young people, preserve the natural environment and support local communities in their development. With over\u00a040\u00a0projects in\u00a025\u00a0countries, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Care Foundation focuses on the special needs of individual destinations, supported by\u00a0TUI?s customers. The foundation carries out projects in the fields of education,\u00a0community empowerment, natural landscapes and marine conservation. Examples include projects for marine conservation in Bali, vocational training at the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Academy for disadvantaged young people in Cape\u00a0Verde, campaigning against plastic waste in Cyprus and Zanzibar, and support for local communities in transitioning to sustainable, regenerative agriculture. In June\u00a02023, the government of Cape Verde,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Care Foundation signed a Memorandum\u00a0of Understanding entitled ?Tourism for Development? as a basis for cooperation between the parties in promoting the sustainable development of tourism in the Cape Verde islands. The focus is on strengthening local supply chains, expanding educational programmes about the environment and sustainable tourism, and promoting renewable energies.

Reduce our footprint Contribution to the SDGs We are working to reduce the ecological footprint of travel and increase environmental performance in our industry. We aim to achieve net-zero emissions in our operations and along our supply chain by\u00a02050\u00a0and considerably reduce our environmental impact in the fields of water, energy and waste. We are also reporting the first strategic and operational steps taken in this context. In order to protect our planet, we are planning to change how we use natural resources and to become a circular business. Voluntary climate commitments Climate change is a pressing global challenge. For\u00a030\u00a0years, we have been committed to reducing our environmental impacts. We are linking these activities closely to science-based findings. We have therefore joined the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), committing to implement emission\u00a0reductions on the basis of the latest findings in climate science. The\u00a0SBTi is a global initiative enabling businesses to set ambitious emission reduction targets in line with the Paris Agreement goals to fight the\u00a0effects of global climate change. The\u00a0SBTi is a joint initiative of the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP), the United\u00a0Nations? Global Compact, the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). In accordance with the\u00a0SBTi methods, emissions from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s airline, cruises and hotels account for\u00a099\u00a0%\u00a0of our emissions. Roadmaps for a significant reduction in emissions have been drawn up for each of our\u00a0three business areas. The emission reduction targets for our own aircraft, cruise ships and hotels to be achieved by\u00a02030\u00a0were submitted to the\u00a0SBTi for final review and were officially recognised and validated by the\u00a0SBTi. Intensity and absolute targets have been submitted: Reduction of\u00a0CO2e-Emissions per Revenue Passenger Kilometer from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Airline ?\u00a024\u00a0% by\u00a020301  Reduction of absolute\u00a0CO2e-Emissions from\u00a0TUI?s cruise business ?\u00a027.5\u00a0% by\u00a020301  Reduction of absolute\u00a0CO2e-Emissions from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels&amp;Resorts (owned) ?\u00a046.2\u00a0% by\u00a020302 1\u00a0Base year 2019. Target level: well below 2\u00b0C.\u00a0CO2e =\u00a0CO2\u00a0equivalents. In addition to carbon dioxide (CO2), these take into account the\u00a0other five climate-impacting greenhouse gases according to the Kyoto Protocol: Methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s commitments to achieve science-based targets also include well-to-wake emissions for our aviation and cruise activities (emissions from aviation and marine fuels, Scope 1 and Scope\u00a03, Category 3). 2\u00a0Base year 2019. target level: 1.5\u00b0C. For our hotels, the\u00a0SBTi commitment includes emissions from all energy sources plus gases from refrigerants (Scope 1 and 2). Airline, cruise and hotel\u00a0GHG\u00a0emissions figures published in the\u00a0FY23\u00a0Non-Financial Group Declaration do\u00a0not match the scope, boundaries or reporting methodology of our science-based targets. Therefore inferences of progress towards achieving\u00a0SBTs based on figures in this or previous Non-Financial Group Declarations should not be made. Activities at our business locations We are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our administrative buildings. The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Campus in Hanover will be supplied with electricity generated by a photovoltaic system. The array und construction in\u00a0FY23, which will occupy\u00a07,350\u00a0m2\u00a0and have a maximum output of\u00a01.6\u00a0megawatts , is a significant step towards reducing emissions on site. In addition,\u00a040\u00a0e-charging stations were under construction in the financial year under review in order to promote sustainable mobility. Our current footprint In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s total absolute emissions were largely stable year-on-year at an increase of\u00a01\u00a0%. In aviation, emission reductions were due to the sale of the stake in Sunwing in March\u00a02023. We did not adjust the\u00a0FY22\u00a0data. In Cruises, the increase was driven by the continued recovery of business after the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic and the inclusion of our river cruises segment in reporting. Scope\u00a03\u00a0emissions reflect the expansion of the reporting framework, in particular due to the inclusion of\u00a0WTT\u00a0(well-to-tank) emissions from marine cruise fuel and jet fuel.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_49\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"400\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Carbon dioxide emissions (CO2)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">tons</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Var. %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Airlines</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4,218,553</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4,331,628</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a02.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">899,790</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">762,942</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a017.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hotels</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">805,541</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">767,049\u00a01</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a05.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Major premises / shops</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">14,890</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">14,251</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a04.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ground transport</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">14,413</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">13,144</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a09.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Scope\u00a03\u00a0(indirect emissions from\u00a0TUI?s value chain)3</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,239,493</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,232,804\u00a02</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a00.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7,192,680</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7,121,818</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a01.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1\u00a0Previous year adjusted due to inclusion of refrigerant gases 2\u00a0Previous year adjusted due to extended reporting scope 3\u00a0With reference to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group currently includes Scope 3 emissions from the production of office paper and printed brochures, well-to-tank emissions from fuel consumption of aircraft, ships, hotels and ground transport, the distribution of electricity (hotels), waste and water treatment (hotels), employee business travel with third-party airlines and rail, and employee commuting.

Our airline emissions reduction targets by\u00a02030\u00a0have been validated by the\u00a0SBTi. Our emission reduction roadmap for our aircraft fleet comprises the following measures: additional capex on modern carbon-efficient aircraft, efficiency enhancement through operational measures and investments in sustainable aircraft fuels (SAF). In order to reduce emissions,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has invested in state-of-the-art aircraft such as Boeing\u00a0787s and Boeing\u00a0737\u00a0Max aircraft. On average, these planes are\u00a020\u00a0% (787) and\u00a016\u00a0% (737\u00a0MAX) more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replace in\u00a0TUI?s fleet. Moreover,\u00a0TUI\u00a0fly Belgium added Embraer E195-E2\u00a0aircraft, highly efficient planes in the category of up to\u00a0150\u00a0seats, to its fleet. The aircraft will operate on short- and medium-haul routes and reduce the carbon footprint by up to one third. Environmental management systems and operational measures play a key role in implementing sustainability and further enhancing\u00a0TUI?s climate efficiency. In financial year\u00a02023, all\u00a0TUI\u00a0airlines were certified under the internationally recognised\u00a0ISO\u00a014001:2015\u00a0standard. All\u00a0ISO\u00a014001\u00a0management systems used by individual\u00a0TUI\u00a0airlines were transferred to one single management system in the period under review. The following examples illustrate the operational measures implemented to enhance efficiency: Flight operations, for instance single engine taxiing in and out, wind uplinks and optimised climb speeds and profiles  Weight reduction, for instance carbon brakes and fly away kit (spare parts and tools)  Fight planning optimisation, for instance alternate distance and minimum fuel programme  Fuel management system to improve fuel analysis, identification of further savings potential and tracking of savings Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) play a crucial role in reducing aviation emissions and are hence a key part of our emission reduction roadmap to further improve airline carbon efficiency by\u00a02030.\u00a0TUI\u00a0cooperates with a number of partners to secure supplies of\u00a0SAF. Examples include the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Spanish energy company\u00a0CEPSA. The partnership with\u00a0CEPSA\u00a0will focus on\u00a0SAF\u00a0fuels generated from raw materials such as used cooking oils, non-food animal waste and biodegradable waste from various industries. This will make it possible to reduce aircraft emissions by up to\u00a080\u00a0% compared to conventional jet fuel. An additional Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Shell. In\u00a02023, relative carbon emissions across our airlines decreased by\u00a03.9\u00a0%. This improvement was largely due to higher load factors versus\u00a02022\u00a0and our ongoing re-fleeting programme to replace older aircraft by new, more carbon-efficient aircraft.

Emission reduction roadmaps were drawn up for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises and Marella Cruises as part of our submission of\u00a02030\u00a0targets for validation by the\u00a0SBTi. Key levers include investments in fleet modernisation and efficiency enhancement with a focus on shore power, route optimisation, energy efficiency enhancement and switching to alternative fuels. TUI\u00a0Cruises with its Mein Schiff and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises brands continues to operate a modern and technologically advanced fleet. The newbuilds in the fleet are equipped with state-of-the-art technologies to\u00a0minimise fuel consumption. A smart energy management system, efficient air conditioning, innovative lighting controls and the use of exhaust heat from the engines contribute to a significant reduction in the carbon footprint compared with vessels not equipped with those technologies. In the period under review, essential steps were taken to reduce emissions generated by the Mein Schiff and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises fleet. The Company will successively install the equipment required for shore power connection on all ships of the Mein Schiff fleet. In the period under review, Mein Schiff\u00a01\u00a0was retrofitted\u00a0during her scheduled dock period. Mein Schiff\u00a02\u00a0and Mein Schiff\u00a05\u00a0will follow in November\u00a02023\u00a0and in January\u00a02024. In summer\u00a02023, both fleets successfully used shore power, e. g. in Kiel and Hamburg. During their scheduled dock periods, both ships, Mein Schiff\u00a01\u00a0(in\u00a0FY\u00a02023) and Mein Schiff\u00a06\u00a0(in\u00a0FY\u00a02022), obtained a new silicone coating to reduce resistance in the water so as to save fuel during the voyage. In the period under review, the Company also successfully completed the first tests on the use of sustainable biofuels, with both Hanseatic Inspiration and Mein Schiff\u00a04\u00a0successfully operating on biofuel blends on some voyages. The second-generation biofuel, which was bunkered for the first time, is purely plant-based and mainly consists of cooking oil residues. This fuel is virtually free from sulphur oxides and in its pure form offers a\u00a0CO2\u00a0reduction of up to\u00a090\u00a0% compared to fossil fuels. Thanks to new exhaust gas treatment systems operated on all new vessels, the newbuilds in the Mein Schiff\u00a0fleet also significantly reduce their sulphur and nitrogen emissions. Use of these advanced emission purification\u00a0systems goes beyond regulatory requirements. They are, for instance, not only used in the designated emission control areas in the North and Baltic Seas, the English Channel and North America, but also in other regions sailed by Mein Schiff such as the Mediterranean, the Orient, the Caribbean and Central America. The Mein Schiff fleet is also setting another milestone for sustainable growth. Mein Schiff\u00a07\u00a0is currently under construction in the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland. The focus is on compliance with high maritime environmental standards by optimising the design in terms of energy efficiency and the use of modern technologies to improve sustainability. The ship will feature equipment enabling her to run on green methanol in future. She is scheduled for commissioning in\u00a02024. The expedition ships in the Hapag-Lloyd Cruises fleet exclusively use low-sulphur marine gas oil with a sulphur content of\u00a00.1\u00a0%. This reduces sulphur emissions from these vessels by up to\u00a080\u00a0% and particulate and soot emissions by up to\u00a030\u00a0% versus the use of heavy fuel oil. All Hapag-Lloyd Cruises ships have tributyltin-free underwater coatings, on-board seawater desalination systems to make drinking water and biological sewage treatment systems for wastewater. Waste is separated on board prior to disposal on land by specialised companies in accordance with international regulations (MARPOL). In financial year\u00a02023, relative\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions in the Cruises segment declined by around\u00a024\u00a0%. This was due to a significant increase in load factors, as the previous year?s figures were more strongly impacted by the\u00a0effects of the pandemic. The amount of waste per cruise passenger night decreased by around\u00a023\u00a0% to\u00a08\u00a0litres,\u00a0with freshwater consumption up by around\u00a024\u00a0% to\u00a046\u00a0litres. Our reporting covers all ships operating under the Mein\u00a0Schiff, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises.

Each hotel plays an important role in managing the impacts on the local community, the economy and the environment. Emission reductions remain our key priority, and we have prepared comprehensive\u00a0roadmaps and defined targets for\u00a02030\u00a0for our Hotels &amp; Resorts segment. These targets have been validated by the\u00a0SBTi. Our hotel portfolio is still growing and many of our hotels use green technology in order to improve their\u00a0sustainability performance. The generation of renewable energies from solar and wind power is a key element of the emission reduction roadmaps for our hotels, alongside efficiency measures delivered through hotel refurbishment and standard-setting for new buildings. Sustainable construction is an important tool for saving energy and cutting carbon emissions from hotels. In the financial year under review, the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment published Green Building Guidelines for the first time. They provide specific recommendations to our own hotels and to our hotel partners for their construction and refurbishment projects. The Guidelines cover the key factors for reducing the ecological footprint of construction and refurbishment projects and paring back water and energy consumption. They also cover aspects such as monitoring systems, sustainability certifications and stakeholder communication. The Guidelines were reviewed by external experts from the Fraunhofer\u00a0IAO\u00a0Institute. For more information on the topic, please refer to:\u00a0TUI\u00a0Green Building Guidelines (online version): <url normalizedValue=\"https://mediacenter.tui-info.com/onlinekataloge/index.php?catalog=tui_greenbuildingguideline_gj2023_f#page_1\">https://mediacenter.tui-info.com/onlinekataloge/index.php?catalog=tui_greenbuildingguideline_gj2023_f#page_1</url> Our\u00a0TUI\u00a0Global Hotel Awards\u00a02023\u00a0placed a particular emphasis on sustainability. The award included categories\u00a0reflecting\u00a0TUI?s Sustainability Agenda. The winners in these categories are selected by an external committee based on pre-defined criteria. In\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0also granted an award for sustainability innovation. Atlantica\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts was recognised for introducing new, sustainable technologies. Examples of this commitment can be found on the Greek island of Rhodes, where the hotel company has invested in the latest solar panel technology, e-mobility for electric cars and a water desalination plant. We continued to drive forward the use of photovoltaic systems in our hotels to promote sustainable power\u00a0generation. In cooperation with our joint venture partners\u00a0RIU, Grupotel and Atlantica,\u00a019\u00a0PV\u00a0systems with\u00a0an output of almost\u00a03,500\u00a0kWp were installed in Greece, Spain and the Cape Verde Islands in financial year\u00a02023. Our hotels made further inroads towards a better ecological footprint in terms of emissions, water consumption and waste production. This is the result of continual measures to improve our environmental performance alongside higher customer numbers and occupancy levels as the pandemic subsided.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_54\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"472\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hotels\u00a0?

The concept of a circular economy\u00a0is about how we generate, use and recycle products and services. The goal is to keep resources and materials in the loop for as long as possible and prevent waste from arising in the first place. TUI\u00a0has entered into Circular Economy Commitments focused on changing the way we operate and use resources. These commitments involve all areas of our business model.\u00a0TUI\u00a0cooperates with suppliers in order to capture relevant information about their sustainability performance so as to track and measure progress. As part of our efforts to become a circular business, we joined the Sustainable Transformation\u00a0Group on Circular Economy, coordinated by the Antwerp Management School and part of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation community. In the reporting period, for example,\u00a0TUI?s cruise companies supported the circular economy and the careful and sustainable use of resources. Examples include the refurbishment of the bar on board Mein Schiff\u00a06, where the focus was on sustainable design. The tables are made of\u00a0100\u00a0% recycled plastic or of the natural material cork, and the carpeting is certified according to the Cradle-to-Cradle standard. Furniture no longer used is donated to local aid organisations. Circular processes were also taken into account for the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Campus project, the redesigned corporate headquarters in Hanover: sustainable carpet tiles will reduce future material consumption, and much of the\u00a0furniture has been kept to avoid purchasing new items. Energy efficiency was an important factor in purchasing new electrical equipment. At\u00a0TUI, we have worked hard for many years to reduce plastic items in our business operations and identify alternatives.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is part of the Global Tourism Plastic Initiative and has signed up to the relevant\u00a0commitments. The implementation of the initiative is headed by the\u00a0UN\u00a0World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO)\u00a0and the United Nations? Environmental Programme (UNEP) in cooperation with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation and is supported by an advisory council of which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is a member. As part of these efforts, we are committed to replacing all problematic and unnecessary plastic packaging by\u00a02025\u00a0wherever possible. Protecting biodiversity We support the Nature Positive Vision for Travel and Tourism approach adopted by the World Travel &amp; Tourism Council (WTTC), promoting nature conservation in order to halt and reverse biodiversity loss by\u00a02030. We\u00a0invest in the protection and restoration of nature in the destinations. Apart from our existing focus on animal welfare in our supply chain, we intend to place further emphasis on biodiversity. To that end, we prepared a first action plan in the period under review. TUI\u00a0audits its suppliers in accordance with animal welfare guidelines. We continue to carry out our checks, which comply with the latest version of the\u00a0ABTA\u00a0(Global Animal Welfare Guidance for Animals in Tourism) guidelines. Wherever possible, we work with suppliers to implement improvements. A number of tenders have, however, been removed from our programme as they did not meet the required standards. Progress ? Accelerate the transformation Contribution to the SDGs By leveraging our scale, we aim to increase the positive social and environmental impact of the holiday experiences we offer. We strive to be sustainability leaders in everything we do. Together with our partners we will help shape the next-generation sustainable business model for the tourism industry. In this way, we can enable our customers to make sustainable holiday choices at every stage of the customer journey. Our goal for\u00a02030\u00a0is to have\u00a020\u00a0million customers per year choosing a Green &amp; Fair hotel or excursion that meets the strict criteria of the Global Sustainable Tourism Council. Destination Co-Lab TUI\u00a0Group, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Care Foundation and the government of the Southern Aegean region have launched a project called Destination Co-Lab Rhodes. Together with our partners are building the next-generation sustainable business model for the tourism industry in Rhodes. The project has three strategic pillars: ?Regenerate the natural environment?, ?Strengthen social development and cultural heritage? and ?Foster inclusive economic development in the tourism business model?. The goal\u00a0of the Co-Lab is to collaborate with the local tourism industry and international partners in developing specific solutions and implementing them in Rhodes. Examples include the provision of\u00a030\u00a0e-bikes and\u00a020\u00a0cargo bikes for short journeys by staff while looking after our customers. This cut the number of cars used from over\u00a0100\u00a0to\u00a060. Sustainable rail travel Following the positive experience gained in the Netherlands,\u00a0TUI\u00a0increasingly offers rail travel to provide sustainable overnight trips to the holiday destinations. As a first step, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0City Express was launched for\u00a0city connections to Prague in July\u00a02023, while the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Ski Express will connect the Netherlands and Germany with the skiing regions in Austria from December\u00a02023. Promoting certification TUI\u00a0promotes social and environmental standards through certification. We expect our hotels and hotel partners to obtain sustainability certification from independent organisations.1\u00a0This process involved a third-party assessment to certify that the hotel complies with the criteria of the Global Sustainable Tourism\u00a0Council (GSTC) and hence engages in good social and environmental practice. The\u00a0GSTC\u00a0criteria are the established global standard for sustainable tourism and cover four main aspects: effective sustainability planning,\u00a0maximising social and economic benefits for local communities, valuing cultural heritage, and reducing negative impacts on the environment. In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a010.5\u00a0m customers stayed in a contracted hotel2\u00a0certified to a\u00a0GSTC-recognised standard, compared with\u00a07.9\u00a0m in\u00a02022. The number of certified contracted hotels3\u00a0rose by ca.\u00a032\u00a0% year-on-year to\u00a01,481. This increase was attributable to the fact that many of our key hotel partners have obtained sustainability certificates to honour their long-standing commitment. Sustainability also plays a key role in our holiday experiences. To assess sustainability, we were one of the first tourism companies to start applying the\u00a0GSTC\u00a0criteria to individual tours and activities within the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Collection experiences in financial year\u00a02022. In financial year\u00a02022,\u00a0180\u00a0TUI\u00a0Collection experiences were certified according to these criteria. In financial year\u00a02023, the process was extended to other excursion\u00a0categories such as National Geographic or Shorex. By the end of the financial year, a total of\u00a01420\u00a0experiences had been certified in accordance with the\u00a0GSTC\u00a0criteria. We offer these tours under the ?Green &amp; Fair? label. 1\u00a0TUI\u00a0requirement for hotel partners with hotels offering more than 80 rooms and a\u00a0TUI\u00a0occupancy rate above 10 %. 2\u00a0Number of hotels includes\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts and hotels\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has a contract with and that are certified to a Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) recognised standard.

Involving partners We created\u00a0TUIPartners.com to support our many partners (hotels; tour, activity and transport providers) in their transformation towards more sustainable tourism. It offers them information and guidance on current issues such as sustainability, health and workplace safety. The sustainability section of the platform serves\u00a0in particular to share knowledge, experience and information on various matters, including successful sustainability certification. Green IT Award In\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0launched new awards to recognise the sustainability commitment of its more than\u00a02,000\u00a0IT\u00a0partners and suppliers. Three award winners convinced the jury with innovative approaches to carbon and energy savings and the promotion of global sustainability goals through technological solutions. Technology is an integral part of\u00a0TUI?s Sustainability Agenda. More sustainable customer decisions Our goal is to enable customers to make more sustainable holiday choices. In addition to anchoring sustainability in our brand essence and providing a marketing toolkit on sustainability for our companies, we have created a label to identify more sustainable products. The Green &amp; Fair label provides guidance on the booking website to make it easier for our customers to select and book holidays certified to\u00a0GSTC\u00a0criteria. Our people Contribution to the SDGs Our employees make a key contribution to\u00a0TUI?s success. We aim to secure this success in the long run. In the financial year under review, we focused on continuing our strategic initiatives as defined in our People Strategy. People Strategy The world of work is continuing to undergo structural change. We offer hybrid working models in order to\u00a0give our employees and future talents greater flexibility about where and when they work. One example\u00a0of our flexible, hybrid working models is the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Campus, which opened in the financial year. Around\u00a02,800\u00a0employees from eight\u00a0TUI\u00a0companies have been working under one roof at the Hanover site since the Campus was inaugurated. The offices have been redesigned and co-working spaces have been created. Moreover, employees increasingly attach importance to diversity, a sense of belonging and greater wellbeing.\u00a0TUI\u00a0responds to these expectations in order to acquire and retain talent in a highly competitive labour market and provide a positive employee experience. Against this backdrop, we have developed our People Strategy. Our vision is to be Digital, Engaging and Inclusive. Digital:\u00a0We use digital tools to ease the workload for our employees, promote innovation and enhance efficiency. Engaging: We invest in the development of employees and empower our executives. Inclusive: We acknowledge difference and bring global and local teams together. In order to implement our strategy, we have adopted a mission defining our relevant areas of action. Our goal is\u00a0to create a framework that empowers our employees to deliver their best performance and succeed as one team. Simplification, harmonisation, focus Our\u00a0HR\u00a0activities must be aligned to the principles of simplification, harmonisation and focus. Processes are being harmonised, standardised and transparently communicated across the globe so as to create synergies and avoid duplication. We have also realigned our internal\u00a0HR\u00a0structure to match that principle. In addition to the existing\u00a0HR\u00a0Business Partner and\u00a0HR\u00a0Services structures, local teams were pooled in four global Centres of Expertise (CoEs)\u00a0in the reporting period, established for the fields of Reward,\u00a0HR\u00a0Systems &amp; People Analytics, Talent Acquisition and Talent Management &amp; People Development. The goal of combining expertise in the cross-national CoEs is to define and implement global processes and establish a uniform and standardised\u00a0IT\u00a0landscape. Digital transformation Our People Strategy centres on the harmonisation and digitalisation of our\u00a0HR\u00a0systems. We are continually expanding our digital\u00a0HR\u00a0solutions to facilitate data-based decision-making. In the period under review, the implementation of our single\u00a0HR\u00a0IT\u00a0platform\u00a0TUI\u00a0People progressed further.\u00a0This far, the platform has been used to operate Recruiting, Learning, Talent Management, Reward and master data administration. In the second quarter of the reporting period, the\u00a0HR\u00a0core system was rolled out to the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segment. For Germany, the launch is scheduled for the beginning of the new financial year. We also continued to introduce new functions in\u00a0TUI\u00a0People and to expand our desktop assistant, which offers our employees real-time step-by-step instructions for handling system functions. Moreover, we rolled out the\u00a0TUI\u00a0eSafe to several companies in Germany during financial year\u00a02023. This is an electronic safe for employees to which we send documents such as payroll slips, wage tax statements, etc. in digital form. The current utilisation rate of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0eSafe is around\u00a091\u00a0%. Its successive global roll-out is scheduled for the next few financial years. So that we can measure our performance, we present relevant\u00a0HR\u00a0metrics in dashboards and make them available to the operational units. Areas monitored by us include the global use of\u00a0TUI\u00a0WORKWIDE. Enable growth In order to retain our employees and recruit new people in a challenging labour market, we have initiated a range of measures to secure internal and external talent succession. Our strategic focus includes succession planning and targeted career development. To ensure\u00a0TUI?s ability to\u00a0act at any time and secure the availability of human resources for business-relevant functions and key positions, succession planning and potential analysis are carried out on a regular basis. They extend to all members of\u00a0TUI?s Executive Board, all top management functions, executives and business-critical roles. Succession planning takes account of short-, medium- and long-term changes and plays an essential role in the success of the Company. In addition, succession planning reports are submitted to the Executive Board at regular intervals. In the completed financial year, we successfully introduced the first Group-wide Employer Value Proposition (EVP). The\u00a0EVP\u00a0describes\u00a0TUI?s identity as an employer and sums up its key strengths and\u00a0USPs. It offers us a research-based framework to retain and win our current employees and future talents and has a positive impact on perceptions of\u00a0TUI\u00a0in the labour market. This is achieved via the employer branding measures based on our\u00a0EVP, which puts people first. Our\u00a0EVP\u00a0?Let?s\u00a0TUI\u00a0it? was initially introduced in-house to inform\u00a0our employees about the relevance of the topic, promote employee retention and encourage people to\u00a0recommend\u00a0TUI\u00a0as an employer. Subsequently, a number of initiatives were launched drawing on photographs\u00a0and video clips taken by employees to provide authentic insights into working at\u00a0TUI. We initiated an Employer Brand Ambassador programme, which forms the framework for all measures with which employees support\u00a0TUI?s employer branding. More than\u00a0200\u00a0employees have volunteered to take part. The campaign has created a high level of awareness in online channels. In the first few weeks after the launch, we reached out to an estimated\u00a02.39\u00a0m people on LinkedIn. Our Employer Branding campaign has been nominated for various international awards and has already received a number of prizes in various countries. As in the prior year, our career sites recorded nearly\u00a01.5\u00a0m visits in the period under review. The number of job applications declined slightly from\u00a0295,000\u00a0to around\u00a0293,000. Positive employee experience We want to create an environment where people like to work. With the launch of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Way of Working, we created the key conditions to achieve that goal. The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Way of Working is our joint vision for the future of work at\u00a0TUI\u00a0and how to organise it globally and adjust it to local needs. We are seeking to create a culture of trust, offering flexibility for our employees. The core statement of that vision is: work is what we live and do, not where we go. TUI\u00a0WORKWIDE\u00a0is an innovative programme enabling people to work from abroad for up to\u00a030\u00a0days per year. In the financial year under review, around\u00a01,260\u00a0employees participated in\u00a0TUI\u00a0WORKWIDE\u00a0with an average stay of\u00a08\u00a0days. We continued updating the new Employee Listening strategy. Our goal is to listen to our employees regularly, measuring their commitment and growing it in a sustained manner. The new\u00a0TUIgether+ survey methods will\u00a0facilitate a holistic approach to measuring and enhancing the employee experience. We focus on three different\u00a0survey types, each tailored to the specific needs of different groups of participants. Apart from global surveys relating to engagement and other strategic topics, we also measure key moments in each employee?s life cycle and use business insight surveys to obtain their feedback on certain topics such as transformation.\u00a0Based on the survey results, executives receive feedback on a regular basis to help them plan measures at\u00a0all levels. At the end of August\u00a02023, we rolled out our new\u00a0TUIgether+ survey, again giving our employees the opportunity to provide feedback to their employer. The goal of the employee survey is to capture the sentiment within\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and transform the survey results into measures. The survey was open until the end of the period under review. It will be evaluated from the beginning of the new financial year. Diversity, equity &amp; inclusion Our goal is to support and promote the wellbeing of our employees. We want them to feel accepted and appreciated. This includes welcoming and leveraging diversity. In the period under review, we developed our vision ?Come as you are!?, defined the focus areas ?People &amp; Culture?, ?Leadership? and ?Community? and agreed on specific measures to take. People &amp; Culture: Our goal is to recruit and promote the best talents worldwide in order to have a diverse workforce. Leadership:\u00a0We create a work environment with trustworthy executives, where our employees are appreciated\u00a0and empowered to deliver their top performance. Community: We enter into global and external partnerships enabling us to be perceived as a diverse and inclusive brand, promoting diversity and inclusion beyond\u00a0TUI. We have forged additional external partnerships, like the one with Code Girls First. This collaboration aims to enhance the appeal of data science for female and diverse professionals. We also promote the diversity\u00a0of internal networks with different interests, such as\u00a0LGBTQI+ and Religion, within the framework of Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion. Diversity-related content has been shared on\u00a0TUI?s Intranet, in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Learning Lounge and in our leadership\u00a0programmes. Throughout the year, we also took part in various key events and special dates such as International Women?s Day and Pride Month. In aviation our vision ?Come as you are!? was the springboard for a new Uniform Policy, allowing our employees more flexibility in their choice of look and clothing. With\u00a0TUI?s Global Employment Statement and as a signatory to the\u00a0UN\u00a0Global Compact, we have made clear commitments: We do not accept any discrimination based on nationality or ethnicity, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, religion, world view, disability, age or social origin. Decisions about hiring, salary, benefits, training opportunities, work assignments, advancement, discipline and termination must be based solely on objective grounds. In financial year\u00a02023\u00a0we monitored a number of diversity-related indicators. The proportion of women in the overall headcount matched the prior year?s level at around\u00a056\u00a0%. The proportion of women in managerial functions increased year-on-year by four percentage points. The proportion of women on the Senior Leadership Team remained constant.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_56\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Proportion of women in managerial positions</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">in %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Target\u00a02023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TUI\u00a0AG</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Supervisory Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">45</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">45</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1\u00a0woman</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1\u00a0woman</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">at least1\u00a0woman</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">First management level below Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">14</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">21</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">25</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Second management level below Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">24</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TUI\u00a0Deutschland</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Supervisory Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">42</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">33</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">25</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">First management level below Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">39</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">35</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Second management level below Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">41</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">43</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">40</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TUI\u00a0fly</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Supervisory Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">42</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">25</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">20</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">First management level below Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Second management level below Executive Board</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">38</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">41</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">40</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For Germany (TUI\u00a0AG,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Deutschland,\u00a0TUI\u00a0fly), targets covering the period to\u00a02023\u00a0had been fixed in financial\u00a0year\u00a02020\u00a0under a voluntary commitment adopted in accordance with the statutory provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG).\u00a0TUI\u00a0Deutschland GmbH achieved all its targets for\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0met three of the four targets it had set itself and managed to increase the proportion of women in the second tier of management by six percentage points.\u00a0TUI\u00a0fly did not achieve all of the targets set. The new targets\u00a02026\u00a0will be set by the relevant committees in autumn\u00a02023. See declaration in the Corporate Governance Report on page 130. Enable best performance In order to be successful together at\u00a0TUI, we are seeking to empower our employees to deliver their top performance. We are supporting our executives and promoting dialogue between managers and employees. In the financial year under review, we revised our feedback and target agreement process Great Place to Grow, placing the focus on continuous development targets and extended feedback. Four target categories were defined: Transformation; Growth, Profitability &amp; Cash Generation; Employee &amp; Customer Engagement;\u00a0ESG\u00a0/ Sustainability. Great Place to Grow ensures regular dialogue between executives and employees to discuss development targets and performance. Depending on their development targets, our employees can choose from a broad range of development and learning formats. Overall, the active users of our learning platform\u00a0TUI\u00a0People completed, similar to prior year, an average of more than two hours of training per month in financial year\u00a02023. We also offered a range of programmes in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Learning Lounge, such as the Sustainability Academy. Our program for:ward focuses on further training in the\u00a0IT\u00a0sector and was continued in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0with a third cohort. A total of\u00a023\u00a0employees participated in this cohort. Our executives have access to various development programmes. How2\u00a0is our global four-month programme conveying key leadership fundamentals to new executives starting their leadership role. In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a0373\u00a0employees from across\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group completed the programme. The number of participants last year was\u00a0194. We also resumed our leadership programmes Horizons and Perspectives after they had been suspended due to the pandemic. A total of\u00a046\u00a0executives were selected to take part ?\u00a020\u00a0participants for the Horizons programme and\u00a026\u00a0for Perspectives. The focus was on leadership skills for global teams as well as strategy communication and implementation. Our International Graduate Programme was reactivated after the end of the pandemic in financial year\u00a02023. The two-year programme familiarises participants with commercial and head office functions within\u00a0TUI. Outlook Our People Strategy is our targeted, strategic approach to promoting strong leadership and supporting the development of our employees. We consistently pursue the strategy of a Group-wide core\u00a0HR\u00a0system. To facilitate data-based decision-making, we are continually expanding and harmonising our digital systems. A\u00a0key focus is on Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) and the launch and implementation of a global\u00a0DEI\u00a0strategy, covering many different aspects of diversity. Employee representatives TUI\u00a0Group historically features a strong co-determination landscape. It embraces the Supervisory Board at corporate level, the Group Works Council at Group level and many local works councils at company level. In the period under review, many topics were jointly updated, continued or initiated in constructive talks. The\u00a0focus was on the revision of the feedback and target agreement process Great Place to Grow, the introduction of\u00a0TUIgether+ and our digitalisation projects, including the implementation of our single core\u00a0HR\u00a0system in\u00a0TUI\u00a0People. At the European level, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Europe Forum as an information and consultation body represents the interests of employees working in companies outside Germany and thus plays an important role as a facilitator and integrator in the European framework. With the joint revision of the basic agreement about the composition, tasks and rights of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Europe Forum,\u00a0TUI?s Executive Board has endorsed the effective involvement of European employees to ensure that harmonisation and transformation programmes within the Group are effected on the basis of socially acceptable solutions. Employee health TUI\u00a0promotes the physical and mental health of all employees. The Group-wide body of health officers regularly deals with best practices, ongoing projects and the plans presented to it for health-promoting activities. Against the backdrop of global challenges, especially in relation to mental health, an even stronger focus will be placed in future on aligning activities to common targets and establishing stringent processes. In the course of the year, health-promoting activities and presentations were offered across the Group. While some of the offerings, such as the company sports programmes in Germany, were resumed post-COVID-19, digital alternatives continue to complement the range of activities on offer. Employee indicators As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, staff numbers had increased by\u00a07.1\u00a0% to\u00a065,413. The expansion of business operations following the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic resulted in a significant increase in overall staff numbers.

The year-on-year increase in wages and salaries and social security contributions in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0mainly results from the\u00a011.4\u00a0% growth in average staff numbers. For further details, please refer to page 212. The pay package offered by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group consists of various components, reflecting the framework conditions in different countries and companies and the appropriateness of compensation and customary market rates.\u00a0Depending on the function concerned, a fixed salary may go hand in hand with variable components,\u00a0honouring individual performance and promoting the sustainable participation of employees in the Company?s\u00a0long-term targets. In addition, the Senior Leadership Team can participate in a long-term share-based compensation programme based on the allocation of virtual shares. Many\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group companies offer their employees pension schemes in the form of direct benefits or through\u00a0an occupational providence fund, or else by paying in additional employer contributions to pension insurance,\u00a0in some cases beyond the statutory minimum required. In Germany, collective contracts have been concluded with an insurance undertaking in order to meet the legal entitlement to deferred compensation. Customer experience, security &amp; safety and crisis management* We place our guests and their individual wishes and needs at the center of our organisation in order to offer them differentiated and consistent experiences. In this way, we aim to increase customer loyalty and tap into new customer segments, as satisfied guests are a decisive factor for the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s long-term growth. Our goal is to continuously adapt the customer experience to individual needs and to further personalise it. The more flexible and personalised design of our products and services is supported by the expansion of our product portfolio and our digital platform. * As part of social matters Our integrated business model allows us to accompany our guests through the entire travel experience from booking, arrival, hotel stay and cruise to local activities and excursions ? digitally and personally. The digital travel experience is complemented by the personal support of our employees, which our guests experience in our travel agencies, aircraft and hotels, on our ships and in the destination. The travel experience is about relaxing and winding down, or discovering and exploring something new. However, the travel experience can also entail a wide range of risks. As far as possible, our activities aim to minimise these risks for customers and employees. The business takes a risk based approach to prevent intentional risks to the well-being of our customers, such as crime or terror (Security) and offer all customers a travel experience within the most security and safety, even in relation to unintentional risks (Health &amp; Safety), for all services booked in the framework of their trips (e. g. flight, transfer to the hotel, hotel stay and excursions).\u00a0TUI\u00a0continually monitors and analyses safety-critical developments in destinations and discusses response measures with the markets and other involved business areas. Safety Throughout this financial year, Group Safety &amp; Risk have continued to oversee and deliver our safety management programme, supporting the Group?s businesses with a resumption to normal operations after the\u00a0COVID\u00a019-pandemic and the delivery of strategic growth plans. The Safety &amp; Risk team?s focus is on the principal safety risks associated with accommodation, transfers, excursions, activities and tours supporting our tour operators in the source markets,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts. In addition to the continuous monitoring approach of key risk areas taken in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts,\u00a0TUI\u00a0have conducted multiple safety assessments across our third-party providers using a multi-layered assessment approach. The continued development of our data-led, risk-based approach to Safety Risk Management with third party hoteliers is increasing our operational efficiency and enabling an improved approach to safety risk management. This approach includes the use of data sharing portals, in partnership with several technical safety specialist providers conducting safety monitoring / management programs with hoteliers globally. Group Safety &amp; Risk continues to support the strategic direction of the business and ensuring that\u00a0TUI\u00a0remains a brand that can be trusted. Security Following the review of security activities in\u00a02022, recruitment of a new Head of Global Security lead and Intelligence lead was completed in February\u00a02023. Since March\u00a02023\u00a0the function has worked to complete a discovery phase, reviewing the whole security operation. This culminated with the creation of a new six pillar strategy that not only is completely in accord with\u00a0TUI\u00a0Safety, but also reflects\u00a0TUI\u00a0today and its risk based approach to\u00a0SHS\u00a0services and engagement. This new strategy will be delivered in two stages over three years, the first\u00a018\u00a0months will be the creation of, or amendment to manuals, policies and guidelines related to our security specialisms. All infrastructure will\u00a0be made available to all via\u00a0TUI\u00a0partners and we will seek\u00a0ISO9001\u00a0accreditation to officially cement our expertise. Strategic delivery is via a cyclical security system and this approach has been presented to various elements of the business during operational activities and presentations. Crisis management and business continuity TUI\u00a0operates Group wide crisis and business continuity protocols and governance modules. Regular update calls between Group function and business areas take place on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the\u00a0area, and are established to share strategic and operational topics including best practice. Data is aggregated and analysed, the frame works ascertain when guests and / or employees are affected and what support or actions at what moment is need. Experienced crisis managers work within a team to cover areas such as customer, commercial, communications and insurance management. These experts across the Group facilitate a fast, flexible response to levels of crisis. Appropriate reporting and coordination within\u00a0TUI\u00a0ensures that management is updated on all key incidents and developments and can immediately take decisions if necessary. The Group wide crisis management system software for monitoring, escalation and managing of day-to-day incidents gives the ability to work individually within our businesses or together as a group when needed. Anti-corruption and anti-bribery Details of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s anti-corruption and anti-bribery measures are presented in the Corporate Governance section on Integrity &amp; Compliance from page 154 in this Report. Disclosures under the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020 / 852 Pursuant to Article\u00a08\u00a0of the Regulation (EU)\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a0852\u00a0of\u00a018\u00a0June\u00a02020\u00a0on the Establishment of a Framework\u00a0to Facilitate Sustainable Investment,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is publishing its report in accordance with the Taxonomy Regulation. Compared with\u00a02022, an extended reporting obligation applies for financial year\u00a02023. Undertakings have to\u00a0disclose information on the proportion of turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure as defined in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Regulation that is associated with economic activities described in\u00a0EU\u00a0Regulations and Delegated Acts and hence taxonomy-eligible. In addition, undertakings have to disclose information on the degree to which these\u00a0KPIs qualify as environmentally sustainable or taxonomy-aligned under Articles\u00a03\u00a0and\u00a09\u00a0of the Taxonomy Regulation. Environmental sustainability is analysed on the basis of technical screening criteria for the following six environmental objectives: Climate change mitigation,  Climate change adaptation,  The sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources,  The transition to a circular economy,  Pollution prevention and control,  The protection and restoration of biodiversity and ecosystems. An economic activity qualifies as environmentally sustainable or taxonomy-aligned if it demonstrably makes a substantial contribution to one of the six environmental objectives while doing no significant harm to any of the remaining environmental objectives. The economic activity also has to meet minimum standards on human rights as well as social and labour standards, anti-corruption, fair competition and taxation. The regulations on the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy are still under development.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has a financial year which ends at\u00a030\u00a0September. Accordingly, for financial year\u00a02023, economic activities defined by regulations only related to\u00a0the environmental objectives of climate change mitigation and climate change adaptation. As of\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02024,\u00a0additional economic activities will also be defined for other environmental objectives. Furthermore, technical screening criteria for economic activities already defined will be adjusted. These regulations did not apply in financial year\u00a02023. Due to the larger number of defined economic activities, generally taxonomy-eligible revenue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure are expected to increase from financial year\u00a02024. Moreover, some of the terms and definitions used in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy regulations are still unclear in terms of their meaning and interpretation. To clarify these terms, the\u00a0EU\u00a0regularly publishes statements (FAQs).\u00a0Due to this unclarity and the changes in regulations,\u00a0TUI\u00a0faces the risk of facing a different future interpretation of these indicators and having to change its reporting accordingly. In its reporting as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0reflects the status of the\u00a0FAQs as at\u00a020\u00a0October\u00a02023. Determination of generally taxonomy-eligible economic activities As a first step,\u00a0TUI\u00a0analysed its economic activities, taking into account both activities generating external\u00a0turnover and activities serving the Company?s own needs.\u00a0TUI?s main activities, flight operation and the delivery of accommodation services in hotels, are not currently listed in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy. Therefore, only a small portion of the indicators mentioned above related to taxonomy-eligible activities in the period under review.\u00a0TUI\u00a0does not report any economic activities serving the environmental objective of climate change adaptation. The second step was to determine indicators relating to these economic activities. Where an indicator relates to several activities at once, it was broken down based on appropriated indicator, usually based on the direct\u00a0costs incurred for the activity in question. The reported numbers only include the turnover, capital expenditure and operating expenditure of companies fully included in the consolidated financial statements. Checking technical screening criteria Compliance with the relevant technical screening criteria is determined on the basis of queries to the respective Group companies or by means of a screening based on higher-level processes and within the framework of national or\u00a0EU\u00a0regulations. Where it was not possible to check compliance with technical screening criteria for lack of data or evidence and the economic activity concerned is not material for\u00a0TUI, no screening was carried out and the economic activity was classified as non-compliant with the taxonomy according to the Comission Notice C /\u00a02023\u00a0/\u00a0305\u00a0dated\u00a020\u00a0October\u00a02023\u00a0No.\u00a013. The results are described in the following sections on revenue, capital expenditure and operating expenditure. Checking minimum protection criteria TUI\u00a0ensures compliance with the minimum protection criteria through Group-wide policies, training programmes, codes of conduct and risk management systems, which also cover our suppliers and the impact of the services we provide. With regard to compliance with human rights, we refer to the Non-Financial Group Declaration. Regarding anti-corruption and fair competition, we refer to the Corporate Governance Report.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has also implemented a tax strategy aiming to ensure taxation in line with our business, preventing\u00a0aggressive or artificial tax planning, ensuring cooperation with local tax authorities and centrally managing\u00a0and reviewing tax risks. In this context, please refer to the publication of our tax strategy at Our Tax Strategy and Governance (tuigroup.com). At the reporting date, no relevant litigation was pending in this context. Revenue Total revenue is the revenue determined in accordance with international accounting standards and carried as revenue in the Notes. In the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segment, customer transport in the destination, e. g. in the framework of excursions or transfers from the airport to the hotel, was allocated to economic activity\u00a06.3\u00a0?Urban and suburban transport, road passenger transport?. The revenue numbers were taken from our internal reporting system. Where this revenue also related to other economic activities, e. g. in the case of excursions\u00a0involving not only transport but also guided tours, it was allocated on the basis of direct costs of the respective economic activity. Revenue from coach transport services provided by third parties is only recognised if this revenue meets the definitions of international accounting standards and if\u00a0TUI\u00a0controls the underlying processes. The revenue generated in the Cruises segment is allocated to economic activity\u00a06.11\u00a0?Sea and coastal\u00a0passenger water transport?. Revenue in the Northern Region segment includes revenue from economic activity\u00a06.7\u00a0?Inland passenger water transport?. The revenue is regularly generated from sales of package tours consisting, for example, of a flight, transport to the destination and overnight accommodation on a ship. For the purposes of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy, these revenues are broken down in line with the direct costs of the respective economic activity so as to determine the revenue attributable to passenger transport by ship. As\u00a0TUI?s key economic activities currently do not fall under the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy, taxonomy-eligible revenue only accounts for\u00a03.0\u00a0% (previous year\u00a02.0\u00a0%) of total revenue. In addition, technical screening criteria relate\u00a0partially to regulations exclusively applicable in the\u00a0EU\u00a0or to ship newbuilds so that taxonomy-aligned revenues could not be identified. Capital expenditure Capital expenditure summarises the additions to the relevant assets mentioned in the Notes in the sections ?Goodwill?, ?Other intangible assets?, ?Property, plant and equipment? and ?Rights of use?. In financial year\u00a02023, there were no additions from mergers. Total capital expenditure of ?\u00a0974.8\u00a0m is broken down as follows for financial year\u00a02023: Other intangible assets ?\u00a0180.9\u00a0m Property, plant and equipment ?\u00a0483.3\u00a0m Right of use assets ?\u00a0310.6\u00a0m As a rule, capital expenditure is allocated to individual economic activities on the basis of our internal project controlling. Alongside the economic activities already mentioned in the Revenue section, capital expenditure are particularly attributable to economic activities in connection with the construction and renovation of buildings in the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment, as well as the installation of renewable energy technologies. Overall, taxonomy-eligible capital expenditure accounts for\u00a044.7\u00a0% (previous year\u00a031.0\u00a0%) of total capital expenditure. The increase year on year is mainly related to the addition of one cruise ship. Due to the lack of well-founded threshold values for hotels and administrative buildings and unclear transferability of technical screening criteria based on\u00a0EU\u00a0regulations to non-EU\u00a0countries, taxonomy-aligned capital expenditure accounts for a very low proportion at under\u00a01\u00a0%. Operating expenditure TUI?s operating expenditure includes building renovation measures, short-term lease, maintenance and repair, and any other direct expenditures relating to the day-to-day servicing of assets of property, plant and\u00a0equipment, other intangible assets and right of use assets. Where necessary, operating expenditure is allocated to an economic activity on a cost basis. The review of the taxonomy eligibility and alignment of operating expenditure follows the review of the respective property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets or right-of-use assets to which they can be allocated. Taxonomy-eligible operating expenditure thus accounts for\u00a025.1\u00a0% (previous year\u00a025.0\u00a0%) of total operating expenditure.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_59\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Income statement of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Var. %</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">158.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">89.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a076.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other operating income</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">411.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">491.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a016.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cost of materials</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">14.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">16.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a011.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Personnel costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">53.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">57.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a07.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Depreciation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a012.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other operating expenses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">228.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">332.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a031.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net income from investments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a013.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a0205.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a093.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Write-downs of investments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">444.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">380.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a017.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net interest</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a0327.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a0121.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a0170.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Income taxes (expense (+), income (?))</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a03.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">n. a.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss after taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a0515.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a0529.1</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a02.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a05.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net result for the year</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a0517.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a0530.9</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a02.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">The earnings position of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, the Group?s parent company, is primarily determined by the appropriation\u00a0of profits from its Group companies, either directly associated with\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0via profit and loss transfer agreements or distributing their profits to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0based on relevant resolutions, and by the measurement of financial investments and the funding of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. Revenue and other operating income The increase in revenue in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0resulted mainly from a higher income from licence fees with\u00a0subsidiaries. Other operating income in the period under review was characterised in particular by the reversal\u00a0of impairments on receivables and income from intra-Group cost transfers. This income was offset by expenses for intercompany charging of service costs to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, carried in Other operating expenses. The year-on-year decline in Other operating expenses was partly driven by lower income from the reversal of provisions and significantly lower income from write-ups on investments and lower income from exchange gains. On the other hand, expenses were incurred for exchange losses, carried in Other operating expenses. Expenses The year-on-year decrease in personnel costs resulted essentially from lower pension expenses due to lower\u00a0transfers to pension provisions. An opposite effect was driven by lower expenses for the formation of personnel provisions for Executive Board members. Other operating expenses comprised in particular expenses for exchange losses, the cost of financial and monetary transactions, fees, charges, capital procurements costs, services, transfers to impairments, other\u00a0administrative costs as well as expenses for intra-Group cost transfers. While there was a decline in expenses\u00a0for exchange losses and a considerable fall in impairments on receivables, expenses for intra-Group cost\u00a0transfers rose. Overall, this resulted in a substantial decline in Other operating expenses. Net income from investments The year-on-year increase in net income from investments was driven by a decline in expenses for loss\u00a0transfers and a significant increase in income from profit transfers. The positive development was also attributable to an increase in dividend income from investments. The loss transfers were mainly related to Leibniz-Service GmbH. The income from profit transfers generated in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0resulted primarily from companies allocated to Central Operations. Write-downs of investments In the period under review, write-downs of investments were mainly related to Tour Operator subsidiaries. In\u00a0particular due to the inclusion of climate-related costs in the valuation, write-downs were significantly higher than in\u00a02022. Interest result In financial year\u00a02023, the movement in the interest result mainly reflected expenses incurred in connection with the redemption of Silent Participation I and the repayment of the remaining warrant bond issued to the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF). Taxes Income taxes and expenses for other taxes mainly resulted from the regular reassessment of tax provisions. Expenses for income taxes also rose due to expenses for withholding taxes on dividend payments from subsidiaries. Income taxes did not include any deferred taxes.

Revenue and other operating income The increase in revenue in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0resulted mainly from a higher income from licence fees with\u00a0subsidiaries. Other operating income in the period under review was characterised in particular by the reversal\u00a0of impairments on receivables and income from intra-Group cost transfers. This income was offset by expenses for intercompany charging of service costs to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, carried in Other operating expenses. The year-on-year decline in Other operating expenses was partly driven by lower income from the reversal of provisions and significantly lower income from write-ups on investments and lower income from exchange gains. On the other hand, expenses were incurred for exchange losses, carried in Other operating expenses. Expenses The year-on-year decrease in personnel costs resulted essentially from lower pension expenses due to lower\u00a0transfers to pension provisions. An opposite effect was driven by lower expenses for the formation of personnel provisions for Executive Board members. Other operating expenses comprised in particular expenses for exchange losses, the cost of financial and monetary transactions, fees, charges, capital procurements costs, services, transfers to impairments, other\u00a0administrative costs as well as expenses for intra-Group cost transfers. While there was a decline in expenses\u00a0for exchange losses and a considerable fall in impairments on receivables, expenses for intra-Group cost\u00a0transfers rose. Overall, this resulted in a substantial decline in Other operating expenses. Net income from investments The year-on-year increase in net income from investments was driven by a decline in expenses for loss\u00a0transfers and a significant increase in income from profit transfers. The positive development was also attributable to an increase in dividend income from investments. The loss transfers were mainly related to Leibniz-Service GmbH. The income from profit transfers generated in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0resulted primarily from companies allocated to Central Operations.

The movement in financial assets was affected by the capital increases carried out in subsidiaries and, in particular, by unscheduled\u00a0write-downs, which more than offset the capital increases effected in the period under review. The write-downs mainly related to shares in Group companies in tour operation. Due to the issuance of new non-current loans and write-ups of shares in Group companies and participations, in particular in Hotels &amp; Resorts, fixed assets rose slightly overall year-on-year in the completed financial year. Current assets The moderate rise in current assets of\u00a02.1\u00a0% to ?\u00a02,301.5\u00a0m was driven by an increase in receivables, which\u00a0more than offset the decrease in cash and cash equivalents. The increase in receivables was primarily attributable to the development of claims and obligations from profit and loss transfer agreements as well as the short- and medium-term financing of Group companies. The rise in receivables and corresponding fall in cash and cash equivalents was also driven by a further cash deposit for the regulatory hedging of customer deposits for package tours. TUI\u00a0AG?s capital structure Equity TUI\u00a0AG?s equity increase by\u00a031.0\u00a0% to ?\u00a05,298.6\u00a0m. This was primarily driven by the capital increase carried out in April of the financial year under review. The loss for the year totalled ? ?\u00a0517.6\u00a0m. Including a loss carried forward of ? ?\u00a0831.5\u00a0m, net loss totalled ? ?\u00a01,349.1\u00a0m. The equity ratio rose to\u00a052.2\u00a0% in the financial year under review (previous year\u00a040.4\u00a0%). Provisions Provisions decreased by ?\u00a015.4\u00a0m to ?\u00a0307.9\u00a0m. They consisted of pension provisions worth ?\u00a0160.8\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0164.0\u00a0m), tax provisions worth ?\u00a025.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a030.1\u00a0m), and other provisions worth ?\u00a0122.0\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0129.2\u00a0m). In financial year\u00a02023, the decline in pension provisions was primarily attributable to a change in parameters. Other provisions declined, in particular due to the reversal of provisions for investment hedges. Moreover, use was made of the provision formed in connection with the early redemption of Silent Participation\u00a0II. An opposite effect was driven by the slight increase in personnel provision. Liabilities As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s liabilities totalled ?\u00a04,537.9\u00a0m, a decline of ?\u00a01,116.6\u00a0m or\u00a019.7\u00a0%. In order to strengthen its balance sheet ratios and fund the state aid granted,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0carried out a capital increase of around ?\u00a01.8\u00a0bn in April\u00a02023. As a result,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0was able to refinance the repayment of a Silent Participation obtained from the\u00a0ESF\u00a0with a nominal amount of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m and implement the early repayment of a warrant bond with a nominal amount of ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m plus the warrants worth\u00a058.7\u00a0m for the purchase of shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0that were acquired and subsequently cancelled. Furthermore, bank liabilities under the syndicated credit facility were significantly reduced. In addition, an amount of ?\u00a01,050.0\u00a0m of the undrawn KfW tranche of ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn granted by the German government was cancelled, reducing the tranche to ?\u00a01,050.0\u00a0m. The credit line of the syndicated credit facility from the two tranches available for cash drawdowns thus amounted to ?\u00a02,504.4\u00a0m. As before, the amount of the tranche available for the use of bank guarantees totalled ?\u00a0190.0\u00a0m in the period under review. In May\u00a02023, an agreement was reached with the banks to extend the term of the syndicated credit facility from July\u00a02024\u00a0to July\u00a02026. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, there had been no cash drawdown under the syndicated credit facility (previous year: ?\u00a0562.0\u00a0m). Drawdowns from this credit facility by means of bank guarantees amounted to ?\u00a0109.2\u00a0m as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. The considerable decrease in liabilities to banks and other liabilities was partly offset by the increase in\u00a0liabilities to Group companies. Due to the increase in operating activities, Tour Operator companies, in particular, transferred monies to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. The net financial position (cash and cash equivalents minus liabilities to banks, bonds and Schuldschein) totalled ? ?\u00a0517.3\u00a0m in the completed financial year (previous year: ? ?\u00a01,170.9\u00a0m). Capital authorisation resolutions Information on new and existing capital authorisation resolutions, adopted by the Annual General Meetings, is provided in the next chapter on Information required under takeover law. Information required under Takeover Law Pursuant to sections 289a and 315a of the German Commercial Code (HGB) and explanatory report Subscribed capital The subscribed capital of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0consists of no-par value shares, each representing an equal share of the capital stock. As a proportion of the capital stock, the value of each share is around ?\u00a01.00. The subscribed capital of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, registered in the commercial registers of the district courts of Berlin-Charlottenburg and Hanover, consisted of\u00a0507,431,033\u00a0shares at the end of financial year\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year\u00a01,785,205,853\u00a0shares) and correspondingly totalled ?\u00a0507,431,033.00. Each share confers one vote at the Annual General Meeting. Restrictions on voting rights or share transfers The Executive Board assumes that it is currently impossible to transfer the shares it considers attributable to Alexey Mordashov or to exercise the voting rights from these shares. Equity interests exceeding 10% of the voting shares The Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has been notified of the following direct or indirect equity interests amounting to\u00a010\u00a0% or more of the voting rights: * As a result of the capital increase in spring 2023, in which Alexey A. Mordashov (Moscow, Russian Federation) has not been allowed to participate due to his sanction since 28\u00a0February\u00a02022, his shareholding has decreased significantly. According to the voting rights notifications of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) dated 16\u00a0May\u00a02023, 10.87 % shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0have been indirectly attributable to Alexey A. Mordashov since 19\u00a0April\u00a02023. At the end of financial year\u00a02023, around\u00a089\u00a0% of\u00a0TUI\u00a0shares were in free float. Around\u00a033\u00a0% of all\u00a0TUI\u00a0shares were held by private shareholders, around\u00a055\u00a0% by institutional investors and financial institutes, and around\u00a012\u00a0% by strategic investors. The current shareholder structure and voting rights notifications according to section 33 of the Securities Trading Act (WpHG) are available online at:<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/share/shareholder-structure\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/share/shareholder-structure</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/news\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/news</url> Shares with special rights conferring powers of control No shares with special rights conferring powers of control have been issued. System of voting right control of any employee share scheme where control rights are not exercised directly by the employees Where\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0grants shares to employees under its employee share programme, the shares are directly\u00a0transferred to the employees (sometimes with a lock-up period). Beneficiaries are free to exercise the control rights to which employee shares entitle them directly, in just the same way as other shareholders, in line with statutory requirements and the Articles of Association. Appointment and removal of Executive Board members and amendments to the Articles of Association The appointment and removal of Executive Board members is based on Sections\u00a084\u00a0et seq. of the German\u00a0Stock Corporation Act in combination with Section\u00a031\u00a0of the German Co-Determination Act. Amendments\u00a0to\u00a0the Articles of Association are based on the provisions of Sections\u00a0179\u00a0et seq. of the German Stock Corporation Act in combination with Section\u00a024\u00a0of the Articles of Association of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Powers of the Executive Board to issue shares The Annual General Meeting on\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a02016\u00a0adopted a resolution to create conditional capital of ?\u00a0150.0\u00a0m for the issue of bonds. The authorisation to issue bonds with conversion options or warrants as well as profit-sharing rights and income bonds (with or without fixed terms) of up to a nominal amount of ?\u00a02.0\u00a0bn expired on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02021. With the issuance of a bond with warrants worth ?\u00a0150\u00a0m to the German\u00a0Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) in October\u00a02020, this authorisation was fully used. The bonds and warrants outstanding were repaid in full on\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023\u00a0without the\u00a0ESF\u00a0having exercised its option rights. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a013\u00a0February\u00a02018\u00a0adopted a resolution to create authorised capital for the\u00a0issue of employee shares worth ?\u00a030.0\u00a0m. The Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0was empowered to use this authorised\u00a0capital by\u00a012\u00a0February\u00a02023\u00a0in one or several transactions by issuing employee shares against cash contributions. In the completed financial year, no new employee shares were issued. The Extraordinary General Meeting on\u00a05\u00a0January\u00a02021\u00a0resolved to create conditional capital of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m in order to grant the\u00a0ESF\u00a0the right to convert\u00a0ESF?s asset contribution in the form of a silent participation of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m (?Silent Participation I?) at any time (in a single or several transactions) in full or in part into up to\u00a0420\u00a0m new registered no-par value shares, each representing a proportionate share in the capital stock of ?\u00a01.00\u00a0per no-par value share. The new shares will be issued at the minimum issue price of ?\u00a01.00. Silent Participation I was repaid in full on\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023\u00a0without the\u00a0ESF\u00a0having exercised its conversion right. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a025\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0resolved to create conditional capital for the issuance of bonds totalling ?\u00a0109.9\u00a0m. The authorisation to issue bonds with conversion options or warrants as well as\u00a0profit-sharing rights and income bonds (with or without fixed terms) is limited to a nominal amount of\u00a0?\u00a02.0\u00a0bn and expires on\u00a024\u00a0March\u00a02026. This authorisation was nearly fully used with the issuance of a convertible bond worth ?\u00a0589.6\u00a0m in April and July\u00a02021. As at the balance sheet date, no shares had yet been issued to service the convertible bond. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0resolved to create an authorisation to use new registered\u00a0shares against cash contribution for up to a maximum of ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I). This authorisation will expire on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02027. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0also resolved to create authorised capital for the issuance of new shares against cash or non-cash contribution of ?\u00a0626.9\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0II). The issuance\u00a0of new shares against non-cash contribution is limited to ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m. This authorisation will expire on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02027. In the completed financial year, the capital stock was increased by ?\u00a0328.9\u00a0m, utilising a part of the two\u00a0last-mentioned authorisations. Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I worth Proceeds of ?\u00a0140.4\u00a0m were used from Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I, primarily to repay in full the state aid provided by the German government for\u00a0stabilisation measures, while Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0II\u00a0worth proceeds of ?\u00a0188.5\u00a0m were used from Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I to reduce the credit lines under the KfW facility. The further use of the not yet used authorized capital is subject to the binding declaration of commitment of the Executive Board from February\u00a02023. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0resolved to create two additional amounts of capital for the issue of bonds worth ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m and ?\u00a081.1\u00a0m. The authorisations to issue bonds with conversion options or war-rants as well as profit-sharing rights and income bonds (with or without fixed terms) are limited to a nominal amount of ?\u00a02.0\u00a0bn and will expire on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02027. See the section on Subscribed capital in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements on page 235 and the section on Subscribed capital in the annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(disclosure pursuant to Section 160 (1) no. 2 of the German Stock Corporation Act). Significant agreements taking effect in the event of a change of control of the Company following a takeover bid, and the resulting effects Some of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s outstanding financing instruments contain change of control clauses. A change of control occurs in particular if a third partly directly or indirectly acquires control over at least\u00a050\u00a0% or the majority of the voting shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. In the event of a change of control, the holders of the Schuldschein worth ?\u00a0242.0\u00a0m, and the convertible\u00a0bond worth ?\u00a0589.6\u00a0m must be offered a buyback. For the syndicated credit facilities worth ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn (including bank guarantees), of which\u00a00.0\u00a0m (via cash) and ?\u00a0109.2\u00a0m (via bank guarantees) had been used as at the balance sheet date, a right of termination by the lenders has been agreed in the event of a change of control. Beyond this, there are no agreements in guarantee, leasing, option or other financing contracts that might cause material early redemption obligations that would be of significant relevance for the Group?s liquidity. Apart from the above-mentioned financing instruments, a framework agreement between the Riu family and\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0includes a change of control clause effective in the event of a change of control. Accordingly, a change of control occurs if a shareholder group represents a predefined majority of\u00a0AGM\u00a0attendees or if one\u00a0third of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are attributable to a group of shareholders. In the event of a change of control, the Riu family is entitled to acquire at least\u00a020\u00a0% and at most all shares\u00a0held by\u00a0TUI\u00a0in\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0S. A. at the share value determined by an internationally recognised auditing company.\u00a0Since\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Annual General Meeting of\u00a025\u00a0March\u00a02021, the conditions had been met for Unifirm to represent\u00a0a majority of\u00a0AGM\u00a0attendees, so that the entitlement arose for the Riu family to acquire shares within certain time windows in\u00a02021,\u00a02022\u00a0and\u00a02023. The Riu family dispensed with exercising its acquisition right within all the time windows mentioned above. A similar agreement concerning a change of control at\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has been concluded with El Chiaty Group.\u00a0Here, too, a change of control occurs if a shareholder group represents a predefined majority of\u00a0AGM\u00a0attendees or if one third of the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board are attributable to a shareholder group. In that case, El Chiaty Group is entitled to acquire at least\u00a015\u00a0% and at most all shares held by\u00a0TUI\u00a0in each of the joint hotel companies in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates during three periods following the change of control at a share value determined by an internationally recognised auditing company. As the stake in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0held by Unifirm increased following the capital increase of\u00a02\u00a0November\u00a02021, here, too, a change of control was triggered due to a majority of\u00a0AGM\u00a0attendees. The final period for El Chiaty Group to exercise its acquisition right is from\u00a016\u00a0November to\u00a016\u00a0December\u00a02023. A change of control agreement has likewise been concluded for the joint venture\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises between Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. and\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0in the event of a change of control in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0whereby more than\u00a050\u00a0% of voting rights are acquired by an individual or group. The agreement in this case gives the partner the right to demand termination of the joint venture and to purchase the stake held by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0at a price which is lower than the selling price of their own stake under certain circumstances. Compensation agreements effective in the event of a takeover bid have not been concluded between the Company and its Executive Board members or employees. TUI Share1 TUI\u00a0share price significantly impacted by economic uncertainty, persistent energy crisis and inflation, and interest rate increases In financial year\u00a02023, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share showed at times significant share price volatility, primarily driven by uncertainty about the course of inflation, above all energy prices, and continued monetary tightening by the\u00a0central banks. Global growth concerns also remained at the forefront. The International Monetary Fund revised\u00a0its growth forecasts for gross domestic product downward for\u00a02023\u00a0and\u00a02024. Overall, the value of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share, with an entry price adjusted for share consolidation and the capital increase with subscription rights of ?\u00a07.172,3\u00a0declined by around\u00a027\u00a0%, closing at ?\u00a05.222,3\u00a0on\u00a030\u00a0September. At the beginning of the financial year, sentiment in the capital markets benefited from the persistent post-COVID\u00a0recovery in demand, despite economic uncertainties. In addition, in mid-December\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0concluded an agreement with the Economic Stabilisation Fund (?WSF?) on the repayment of corona state aids received during the pandemic, hence reducing debt and interest costs. In subsequent weeks,\u00a0TUI?s share price rose significantly to its annual high of ?\u00a012.57\u00a02,\u00a03\u00a0on\u00a018\u00a0January\u00a02023. In February,\u00a0TUI\u00a0carried out a\u00a0capital decrease by means of a ten-for-one reverse stock split, previously approved by the Annual General\u00a0Meeting and subsequently implemented in accordance with the repayment agreement as the final condition\u00a0for the capital increase scheduled for March. On\u00a018\u00a0April\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0completed the rights issue of approximately\u00a0?\u00a01.8\u00a0bn, and issued around\u00a0329\u00a0million new shares. The proceeds were used to repay\u00a0TUI?s remaining\u00a0WSF\u00a0state aid including interest and for another major reduction to its KfW credit line.\u00a0TUI\u00a0thus strengthened its\u00a0balance sheet, is benefiting from lower interest payments and has gained greater financial and entrepreneurial\u00a0flexibility for the implementation of its strategy. Furthermore,\u00a0TUI\u00a0successfully extended the existing syndicated credit lines totalling ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn in May. The syndicated credit facility from\u00a020\u00a0banks (?\u00a01.65\u00a0bn) and the credit line from KfW (?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn) will now mature in July\u00a02026. In future, the interest terms and conditions under that revolving credit facility will also be linked to achieving the Group?s emissions reduction targets confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative. The capital increase and the extension of the credit facilities were key measures to improve\u00a0TUI?s credit metrics, also reflected in improved credit ratings from S&amp;P (B3\u00a0to B2) and Moody?s (B- to B). This progress, and the\u00a0gratifying development of bookings in the summer months, supported by higher prices, facilitated the recovery\u00a0of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share up until mid-July. Despite the positive booking momentum, which continued into Winter\u00a02023\u00a0/\u00a024, the tense macro-economic environment led to uncertainty in the stock markets in the final months of the financial year. With several members of\u00a0OPEC+ (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) continuing to cut back production, oil\u00a0prices rose substantially, in particular towards the end of the financial year under review which put additional\u00a0pressure on the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share price. Driven by these economic uncertainties, higher interest rates, persistent inflation and its potential impact on booking behaviour in tourism, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share recorded its financial year low of ?\u00a05.01\u00a02,\u00a03\u00a0on\u00a026\u00a0September and closed at ?\u00a05.22\u00a02,\u00a03\u00a0on\u00a030\u00a0September. 1\u00a0The contents presented in this chapter are unaudited and voluntary. 2\u00a0Source: Reuters, Xetra closing prices 3\u00a0Historical prices adjusted for the effect of the capital reduction through share consolidation and capital increasewith subscription rights</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_64\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"408\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TUI\u00a0share data</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">30\u00a0September\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">WKN</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">TUAG50</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ISIN</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">DE000TUAG505</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stock exchange centres</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">London, Xetra, Hanover</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Reuters / Bloomberg</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">TU1n.DE/TU1.GR\u00a0(Xetra);\u00a0TUIT.L/TUI:LN\u00a0(London)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stock category</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Registered ordinary shares</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Capital stock?</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">507,431,033.00</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of shares</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">507,431,033</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Market capitalisationbn\u00a0?</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Market capitalisationbn\u00a0\u00a3</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_65\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"384\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Long-term development of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share (Xetra)1, 2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2019</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2020</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2022</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">2023</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">High</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">51.23</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">39.19</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">25.86</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">20.37</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">12.57</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Low</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24.35</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.94</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">9.29</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">7.17</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">5.01</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Year-end share price</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">32.99</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.02</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">18.52</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">7.17</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">5.22</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1\u00a0Source: Reuters, Xetra closing prices 2\u00a0Historical prices adjusted for the effect of the capital reduction through share consolidation and capital increase with subscription rights Quotations, indices, and trading The\u00a0TUI\u00a0share has its primary listing in the Premium segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and is included in\u00a0FTSE?s\u00a0UK\u00a0Index Series. It also has a secondary listing at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Hanover Stock Exchange and is admitted to the electronic trading system Xetra. As\u00a0TUI\u00a0shares are also admitted to trading in a regulated market in Germany apart from their listing at the London Stock Exchange,\u00a0TUI\u00a0falls within the scope of the German Securities Acquisition and Takeover Act and is monitored by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority in this respect. In financial year\u00a02023, the average daily trading volume at the London Stock Exchange was around\u00a0839\u00a0thousand shares, while about\u00a02.5\u00a0million shares were traded on Xetra per day. Across all trading platforms, the daily trading volume in the\u00a0UK\u00a0amounted to around\u00a01.8\u00a0million shares, with around\u00a06.2\u00a0million shares traded in the euro line. Both the sterling and the euro lines thus delivered strong liquidity for trading by institutional and retail investors. Analyst recommendations Analyses and recommendations by financial analysts serve as a decision-making basis for institutional and private investors. In the financial year under review, around\u00a020\u00a0analysts regularly published studies on\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. In September\u00a02023,\u00a032\u00a0% of analysts recommended to ?buy? the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share, with\u00a058\u00a0% recommending ?hold? and\u00a010\u00a0% of analysts recommending ?sell?. Shareholder structure * As a result of the capital increase in spring 2023, in which Alexey A. Mordashov (Moscow, Russian Federation) has not been allowed to participate due to his sanction\u00a0since 28\u00a0February\u00a02022, his shareholding has decreased significantly. According to the voting rights notifications of the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) dated 16\u00a0May\u00a02023, 10.87 % shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0have been indirectly attributable to Alexey A. Mordashov since 19\u00a0April\u00a02023. At the end of financial year\u00a02023, around\u00a089\u00a0% of\u00a0TUI\u00a0shares were in free float. Around\u00a033\u00a0% of all\u00a0TUI\u00a0shares were held by private shareholders, around\u00a055\u00a0% by institutional investors and financial institutes, and around\u00a012\u00a0% by strategic investors.

Investor Relations Open and continuous dialogue and transparent communication with our private shareholders, institutional investors, equity and credit analysts and lenders form the basis for our Investor Relations engagement.\u00a0Many discussions were held, centring on the Group strategy, business performance in the individual segments, the\u00a0strong operative Summer business post-COVID-19, the financing measures and the impact of inflation as well\u00a0as\u00a0the energy crisis. The goal of this dialogue is to ensure transparent communication so as to enable stakeholders\u00a0to make a realistic assessment of the future performance of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share. In financial year\u00a02023, dialogue with investors primarily focused on the following topics: Demand for travel, capacity development and booking numbers for the Summer and Winter seasons  Operational and financial implications of heat waves and wildfires in Europe and the impact of these events\u00a0on customers? booking behaviour  Impacts of cost inflation on prices and margins and on customers? booking behaviour  Repayment of the remaining\u00a0WSF\u00a0state aid: reduction in the KfW credit line as well as extension of the credit facilities  Strategic priorities: expansion of our\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segment for tours and activities, our dynamic packaging as well as hotel-only and flight-only offering, and further growth of our hotel portfolio and ship fleet through asset-right financing structures such as joint ventures  Meeting expectations for financial year\u00a02023\u00a0and future growth  New\u00a0TUI\u00a0Sustainability Agenda ?People, Planet, Progress? and the Group?s emissions reduction targets confirmed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) TUI?s management team sought dialogue with investors at physical and virtual roadshows and conferences in New York, London, Frankfurt, D\u00fcsseldorf, Munich, Warsaw, Zurich and Paris. The management also met investors from other financial hubs in Europe, North America, Asia, South Africa and Australia. TUI?s Investor Relations team also makes every effort to engage in direct contact with private investors, with\u00a0IR\u00a0staff presenting\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group at events held by shareholder associations and answering questions asked by\u00a0that target group.\u00a0TUI\u00a0also offers a broad range of information for analysts, investors and private shareholders\u00a0on its website.

Additionally, a monthly Investor Relations Report and event-driven assessments of brokers are forwarded to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. They contain updates on the share price development, analyses of the shareholder structure as well as purchases and sales of shares and feedback and assessments from investors. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Independence of Supervisory Board members (Provision 10) Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, the Board must identify in the annual report each non-executive director it considers to be ?independent? for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Based on the responsibilities assigned to the Supervisory Board by the German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Supervisory Board are considered to be non-executive directors for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, persons are ?independent? if they are independent in character and judgement and if there are no relationships or circumstances which\u00a0are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0does not, however, extend its independence disclosures to its\u00a010\u00a0employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. Due to the number of employees, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is subject to the German Co-Determination Act. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0consists of ten members who are elected by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (the ?Shareholder Representatives?) and ten members who represent the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(the ?Employee Representatives?). This differs from\u00a0UK\u00a0practice where only those board members\u00a0representing major shareholders are typically referred to as ?Shareholder Representatives? and are not considered as independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0because of their link to a significant shareholder. Assessment of the independence of the shareholder representatives The Supervisory Board has determined that seven of its nine shareholder representatives (the Chairman is not taken into account according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC) are independent for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. The shareholder representatives considered to be independent are: Ms Ingrid-Helen Arnold, Mr Christian Baier,\u00a0Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst, Ms Mar\u00eda Gara\u00f1a Corces, Ms Janina Kugel, Ms Coline McConville and Ms Helena Murano.\u00a0Additionally, the Chairman, Dr Dieter Zetsche, was independent on his re-election in\u00a02019\u00a0and is still considered independent (Dr Dieter Zetsche also was independent when he was elected to the Supervisory Board in February\u00a02018). In its assessment, the Supervisory Board considered in particular the aspects set out below: Prof. Dr Ernst has been a member of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0since\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a02011. According to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than nine years. According to the\u00a0GCGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence from the Executive Board and the Company if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years. In view of this, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have taken a close look at how they assess Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence. In particular in view of Prof. Dr Ernst?s professional career, the shareholder representatives have come to the conclusion that Prof. Dr Ernst ? also taking into account his membership on the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0of over twelve years ? provides as before the necessary critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company and therefore consider him to be independent. In addition, due to the personnel changes on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board, particularly on the position of the\u00a0CFO, in recent years, Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence from the Executive Board is strengthened. Prof. Dr Ernst also ensures continuity in the proper performance of the tasks of the Audit Committee, which has also seen personnel changes in recent years. Prof. Dr Ernst has continually exhibited his critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company in the past, especially in his position as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Against this background, the Annual General Meeting\u00a02021\u00a0has re-elected Prof. Dr\u00a0Ernst with a large majority. As of the balance sheet date, according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(and also the\u00a0GCGC), Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges is qualified as non-independent. However, Dr D\u00f6nges will be assessed as independent by the Supervisory Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023. On\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022, Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges ceased her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of\u00a0the Federal Republic of Germany (Finanzagentur GmbH der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). On\u00a04\u00a0January\u00a02021,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0entered into a Framework Agreement with the Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) represented by\u00a0Finance Agency GmbH regarding a silent participation of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0and further measures under the stabilisation package. Dr D\u00f6nges was nominated by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0for membership of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and elected to the Supervisory Board by the shareholders with effect from the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\u00a02021. On\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0repaid the\u00a0WSF\u00a0financial aid in full. In view of the above information, the Supervisory Board has come to the conclusion that the factors previously indicating the dependence of Dr\u00a0D\u00f6nges no longer apply. However, as the Supervisory Board has decided to apply a one-year cooling-off period according to recommendation C.7\u00a0(paragraph\u00a02, indent\u00a02) of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0in this case, Dr D\u00f6nges will only be assessed as independent from the Company and its Executive Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023, i. e.\u00a0after one year from the termination of her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Supervisory Board considers the shorter cooling-off period compared to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(1\u00a0year according to the\u00a0GCGC,\u00a03\u00a0years according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to be appropriate. At\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Mr Joan Tr\u00edan Riu (Riu Hotels S. A., approx.\u00a01.1\u00a0% of the voting rights as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023) is\u00a0linked to a major shareholder. In this context, he is considered a non-independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Assessment of the independence of employee representatives Seven of the ten employee representatives of the Supervisory Board are elected by the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group entitled to vote. Three employee representatives are nominated by a German trade union. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, directors who are or have been employees of the Group in the last five years or who participate in the Group?s pension arrangements would generally not be considered independent. In the\u00a0UK, directors with an employment relationship are normally current or former executives. By contrast, under German law, employee representatives of the Supervisory Board must be employees of the Group, and must be elected by the employees without any involvement of the Executive or Supervisory Boards. Furthermore, the employment contract of employee representatives may only be terminated in exceptional cases. The employee representatives may also participate in Group pension schemes as is normal for employees and in their capacity as employees. Trade union representatives are nominated and employed by the trade union but are still classified as employee representatives. They can only be removed from the Supervisory Board by their respective union and neither the Executive nor the Supervisory Board has any role in their appointment or removal. Half the Board should be independent Non-executive Directors (Provision 11) As mentioned above,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board consists of ten employee and ten shareholder representatives. As the employee representatives are not considered independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board comprises seven (excluding the Chairman of the Supervisory Board) independent shareholder representatives. Identification of Senior Independent Director (Provision 12) Under German law and the\u00a0GCGC, there is no concept of a ?Senior Independent Director?. Instead, shareholders may raise any issues at the\u00a0AGM. In this forum, the Executive Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board are available to address any issues and are legally obliged to provide adequate responses. Outside the\u00a0AGM, shareholders may approach the Executive Board, in particular the\u00a0CEO\u00a0or the\u00a0CFO, or, for\u00a0topics relating to Supervisory Board matters, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or his Deputy. Mr\u00a0Frank Jakobi, as employee representative, is Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act. Division of responsibilities ? Chairman &amp; Chief Executive (Provision 14) The separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (Dr Dieter Zetsche) and the\u00a0CEO\u00a0(Mr\u00a0Sebastian Ebel) is clearly defined under German law as part of the two-tier board structure. Therefore, no further division of their responsibilities as well as responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is required or even possible. In addition, the division of responsibilities within the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as its committees also results directly from legislation and the respective terms of reference. Therefore, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Advice and service of the Company Secretary (Provision 16) There is no specific role of Company Secretary in German companies. However, Executive and Supervisory Board members have access to the Board Office of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0if they need any advice on all governance matters\u00a0or other services. The Board Office acts as an interface in corporate matters for the Executive and Supervisory Board members and is responsible for ensuring that the requisite processes and procedures are in place governing all Executive and Supervisory Board meetings (i. e. preparation of agendas, minuting of meetings and ensuring compliance with German and\u00a0UK\u00a0law, as appropriate, and with recommendations for corporate governance). The Board Office also supports the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the\u00a0CEO, the\u00a0CFO\u00a0and the Chairmen of the Audit and the Strategy Committees. Executive and Supervisory Board members also have access to legal advice via the Group Director Legal, Compliance &amp; Board Office and via the Board Office. The Supervisory Board can also approach the Executive Board directly for specific advice on any matters. Accordingly, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Nomination Committee ? Composition and responsibilities (Provision 17) The role of the Nomination Committee in a typical\u00a0UK\u00a0company is fulfilled in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0by two Committees of the Supervisory Board: Under the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and its Committees (which are equivalent to the Terms of Reference of a British corporation) the Nomination Committee considers and proposes suitable candidates as shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the\u00a0AGM. The Presiding Committee determines the requirements and remuneration for any new appointments to the Executive Board and recommends suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board. On that basis, the Supervisory Board appoints Executive Board members. This approach is different from the\u00a0UK\u00a0where all director appointments are approved by shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. Succession planning for management levels below Executive Board is carried out by the Executive Board. However, as is common practice in Germany, at each\u00a0AGM\u00a0shareholders are asked to decide whether they approve the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board members during the past financial year. Since the\u00a0AGM\u00a02015, in the light of\u00a0UK\u00a0practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has changed its procedure to allow a separate vote on each individual Executive Board and Supervisory Board member, as it is customary in the\u00a0UK. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board considers that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to the extent practicable. In addition to Prof. Dr Ernst, the Nomination Committee also consists of Dr Zetsche as Committee Chairman and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is considered non-independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023. In this context, the majority of the members of the Nomination Committee are assessed by the Supervisory Board to be independent. Annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM (Provision 18) None of the Executive or Supervisory Board members is re-elected annually. However, as noted above, in light of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0and\u00a0UK\u00a0best practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0voluntarily puts individual resolutions approving the actions of each Executive and Supervisory Board member to the\u00a0AGM\u00a0resolving on the annual financial statements for the previous year.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. The end of appointment periods for Supervisory Board members are disclosed in the table from page\u00a0115. Current curricula vitae of all Executive and Supervisory Board members are published at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance</url>. Board performance evaluation (Principle L and Provision 21) The performance of each individual Executive Board member is evaluated annually by the Supervisory Board for the annual performance-based remuneration. In this context, the Supervisory Board also reviews\u00a0the individual member?s overall performance as part of the Executive Board. However, no external performance evaluation is done for the Executive Board. The efficiency of the Supervisory Board is reviewed regularly, but not annually. Each Supervisory Board member can give feedback to the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman or the Supervisory Board as a whole as and when appropriate or required. The last self-assessment was conducted internally at the end of September\u00a02020. For this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed to all members, in which they could give their assessment of the effectiveness of the\u00a0working methods of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Presiding Committee and the Supervisory Board have subsequently dealt with the results and derived measures from them. These primarily concerned\u00a0the work of the Supervisory Board, the organisation of the meetings and the main topics that the Supervisory Board dealt with in more detail. The next self-assessment is planned for the beginning of\u00a02024\u00a0and is accompanied externally by the consulting company\u00a0ECBE\u00a0(European Center for Board Effectiveness GmbH)\u00a0since September\u00a02023. The Company is not aware of any other relationships between\u00a0ECBE\u00a0and the Company or its directors. Nomination Committee ? Section in the Annual Report (Provision 23) For the activities of the Nomination Committee, see page\u00a016\u00a0which is part of the Supervisory Board Chairman?s letter to shareholders. The succession planning approach is outlined on page\u00a0131. The policy on diversity and inclusion can be found on page\u00a0132. For evaluation of the performance of the Board, see above. Composition of the Audit Committee (Provision 24) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code stipulates that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board should not be a member of the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee may only\u00a0consist of independent members. The Audit Committee consists of Dr Zetsche as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is not considered to be independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0therefore does not fully meet the requirements of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, but is of the opinion that the current composition of the Audit Committee ensures reliable work based on experience. Fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report &amp; Accounts (Provision 27) In a German stock corporation the Executive Board is responsible for drafting the Annual Report &amp; Accounts (ARA). According to section\u00a0243\u00a0(2) of the German Commercial Act (HGB) the\u00a0ARA\u00a0must be clearly arranged and should present a realistic picture of the Company?s economic situation. This is equivalent to the\u00a0UK\u00a0Code requirement for the\u00a0ARA\u00a0to be fair, balanced and understandable. Although this assessment has not been delegated to the Audit Committee, the Executive Board is convinced that this\u00a0ARA\u00a0satisfies both requirements. Established and operation of Remuneration Committee (Provision 32, 34 and 41) In the German governance structure there is no separate Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the Executive Board is under involvement of the employee representatives monitored and agreed by the Supervisory Board based on recommendations from the Presiding Committee, which is governed by the Supervisory Board Terms of Reference. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Supervisory Board Committees is governed by the Articles of Association as resolved on by the shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. See the Directors? Remuneration Report from page\u00a0157\u00a0for full details on Executive and Supervisory Board member\u00b4s remuneration. Policy for post-employment shareholding requirements (Provision 36) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code requires the company to implement a policy for post-employment shareholding requirements. According to the remuneration system approved by the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02021, no policy is provided for post-employment shareholding requirements. Notice periods for Executive Directors (Provision 39) In accordance with the customary practice in Germany members of the Executive Board are generally appointed for a term of three to five years. This is not yet fully in line with the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0recommendation that notice periods or contract terms should be set at one year or less. However, the contracts include maximum limits on the amounts payable on termination. See Remuneration Report from page 157. Further information on Corporate Governance Functioning of the Executive and Supervisory Boards TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is a company under German law. One of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law\u00a0is the dual management system involving two bodies, the Executive Board in charge of managing the company and the Supervisory Board in charge of monitoring the management of the company.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and in a spirit of trust, with strict separation between the two bodies in terms of their membership and competences. Both bodies are obliged to ensure the continued existence of the Company and sustainable creation of added value in harmony with the principles of the social market economy. TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board comprised five members as at the closing date\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company?s business operations in the interests of the Company. The Executive Board works on the basis of terms of reference issued by the Supervisory Board. The allocation of functions and responsibilities to individual Board members is presented in a separate section. For functions, see tables ?Supervisory Board and Executive Board? on page 115 et seq. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board had\u00a020\u00a0members at the balance sheet date, i. e.\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. As the oversight body, the Supervisory Board provided on-going advice and supervision for the Executive Board in managing the Company in financial year\u00a02023, as required by the law, the Articles of Association and its own Terms of Reference. The Supervisory Board is involved in strategic and planning decisions and all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company. When the Executive Board takes decisions on major transactions, such as the annual budget, major acquisitions or divestments, it is required by its terms of reference to seek the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work in the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings and represents the concerns of the body externally. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee have\u00a0adopted terms of reference for their own work. The Terms of Reference of the Supervisory Board are available on the company?s website. For further details, please refer to the Report of the Supervisory Board on page\u00a011. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has taken out a D&amp;O insurance policy for all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, providing for a deductible for Executive Board members in accordance with the statutory requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act. The deductible amounts to\u00a010\u00a0% of the loss up to the amount of one and a half times the fixed annual compensation. Competence Profile and the Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0falls within the scope of the German Industrial Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). The Supervisory\u00a0Board is therefore composed of an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee representatives.\u00a0Employee representatives within the meaning of the Act include a senior manager (section\u00a05\u00a0(3) of the\u00a0German Works Constitution Act) and three trade union representatives. In financial year\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board updated its competence profile for the composition of the entire body. The competence profile of the Supervisory Board is published at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf\">https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf</url>. Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board The following individualized qualification matrix is based on the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board. The competences shown are based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board members. Competence is deemed to exist if at least basic knowledge is available and thus the ability to understand the relevant facts well and to make informed decisions on the basis of existing qualifications, the knowledge and experience acquired in the context of the activity as a supervisory board member, or the further training measures regularly attended by all Supervisory Board members.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_68\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"320\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dialogue with shareholders</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Meeting</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Participants</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">December\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY22\u00a0Results Presentation, London</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow\u00a0UK, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">January\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Commerzbank &amp;\u00a0ODDO\u00a0BHF\u00a0German Investment Seminar, New York City</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">UniCredit / Kepler Cheuvreux\u00a022nd German Corporate Conference, Frankfurt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">February\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q1\u00a0Results Presentation, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Annual General Meeting, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">March\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Capital Raise Roadshow, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">May\u00a02023\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q2\u00a0/ H1\u00a0Results Presentation, London</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow\u00a0UK, London</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Frankfurt, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Zurich, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">June\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">dbAccess German Corporate Conference, Frankfurt</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Paris, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">August\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q3\u00a0/\u00a09M Results Presentation, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stifel\u00a07th Transportation, Business Services &amp; Leisure Conference, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">September\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Morgan Stanley\u00a0CFO\u00a0Fireside Chat, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Berenberg &amp; Goldman Sachs Twelfth German Corporate Conference, Munich</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bernstein?s\u00a020th Pan European Annual Strategic Decisions Conference, London</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Key: Sebastian Ebel (SE), Mathias Kiep (MK) The Supervisory Board receives feedback from the Chairman and Executive Board members following meetings with major shareholders or investors. Additionally, a monthly Investor Relations Report and event-driven assessments of brokers are forwarded to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. They contain updates on the share price development, analyses of the shareholder structure as well as purchases and sales of shares and feedback and assessments from investors. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Independence of Supervisory Board members (Provision 10) Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, the Board must identify in the annual report each non-executive director it considers to be ?independent? for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Based on the responsibilities assigned to the Supervisory Board by the German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Supervisory Board are considered to be non-executive directors for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, persons are ?independent? if they are independent in character and judgement and if there are no relationships or circumstances which\u00a0are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0does not, however, extend its independence disclosures to its\u00a010\u00a0employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. Due to the number of employees, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is subject to the German Co-Determination Act. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0consists of ten members who are elected by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (the ?Shareholder Representatives?) and ten members who represent the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(the ?Employee Representatives?). This differs from\u00a0UK\u00a0practice where only those board members\u00a0representing major shareholders are typically referred to as ?Shareholder Representatives? and are not considered as independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0because of their link to a significant shareholder. Assessment of the independence of the shareholder representatives The Supervisory Board has determined that seven of its nine shareholder representatives (the Chairman is not taken into account according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC) are independent for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. The shareholder representatives considered to be independent are: Ms Ingrid-Helen Arnold, Mr Christian Baier,\u00a0Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst, Ms Mar\u00eda Gara\u00f1a Corces, Ms Janina Kugel, Ms Coline McConville and Ms Helena Murano.\u00a0Additionally, the Chairman, Dr Dieter Zetsche, was independent on his re-election in\u00a02019\u00a0and is still considered independent (Dr Dieter Zetsche also was independent when he was elected to the Supervisory Board in February\u00a02018). In its assessment, the Supervisory Board considered in particular the aspects set out below: Prof. Dr Ernst has been a member of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0since\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a02011. According to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than nine years. According to the\u00a0GCGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence from the Executive Board and the Company if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years. In view of this, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have taken a close look at how they assess Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence. In particular in view of Prof. Dr Ernst?s professional career, the shareholder representatives have come to the conclusion that Prof. Dr Ernst ? also taking into account his membership on the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0of over twelve years ? provides as before the necessary critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company and therefore consider him to be independent. In addition, due to the personnel changes on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board, particularly on the position of the\u00a0CFO, in recent years, Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence from the Executive Board is strengthened. Prof. Dr Ernst also ensures continuity in the proper performance of the tasks of the Audit Committee, which has also seen personnel changes in recent years. Prof. Dr Ernst has continually exhibited his critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company in the past, especially in his position as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Against this background, the Annual General Meeting\u00a02021\u00a0has re-elected Prof. Dr\u00a0Ernst with a large majority. As of the balance sheet date, according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(and also the\u00a0GCGC), Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges is qualified as non-independent. However, Dr D\u00f6nges will be assessed as independent by the Supervisory Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023. On\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022, Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges ceased her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of\u00a0the Federal Republic of Germany (Finanzagentur GmbH der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). On\u00a04\u00a0January\u00a02021,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0entered into a Framework Agreement with the Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) represented by\u00a0Finance Agency GmbH regarding a silent participation of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0and further measures under the stabilisation package. Dr D\u00f6nges was nominated by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0for membership of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and elected to the Supervisory Board by the shareholders with effect from the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\u00a02021. On\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0repaid the\u00a0WSF\u00a0financial aid in full. In view of the above information, the Supervisory Board has come to the conclusion that the factors previously indicating the dependence of Dr\u00a0D\u00f6nges no longer apply. However, as the Supervisory Board has decided to apply a one-year cooling-off period according to recommendation C.7\u00a0(paragraph\u00a02, indent\u00a02) of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0in this case, Dr D\u00f6nges will only be assessed as independent from the Company and its Executive Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023, i. e.\u00a0after one year from the termination of her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Supervisory Board considers the shorter cooling-off period compared to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(1\u00a0year according to the\u00a0GCGC,\u00a03\u00a0years according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to be appropriate. At\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Mr Joan Tr\u00edan Riu (Riu Hotels S. A., approx.\u00a01.1\u00a0% of the voting rights as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023) is\u00a0linked to a major shareholder. In this context, he is considered a non-independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Assessment of the independence of employee representatives Seven of the ten employee representatives of the Supervisory Board are elected by the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group entitled to vote. Three employee representatives are nominated by a German trade union. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, directors who are or have been employees of the Group in the last five years or who participate in the Group?s pension arrangements would generally not be considered independent. In the\u00a0UK, directors with an employment relationship are normally current or former executives. By contrast, under German law, employee representatives of the Supervisory Board must be employees of the Group, and must be elected by the employees without any involvement of the Executive or Supervisory Boards. Furthermore, the employment contract of employee representatives may only be terminated in exceptional cases. The employee representatives may also participate in Group pension schemes as is normal for employees and in their capacity as employees. Trade union representatives are nominated and employed by the trade union but are still classified as employee representatives. They can only be removed from the Supervisory Board by their respective union and neither the Executive nor the Supervisory Board has any role in their appointment or removal. Half the Board should be independent Non-executive Directors (Provision 11) As mentioned above,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board consists of ten employee and ten shareholder representatives. As the employee representatives are not considered independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board comprises seven (excluding the Chairman of the Supervisory Board) independent shareholder representatives. Identification of Senior Independent Director (Provision 12) Under German law and the\u00a0GCGC, there is no concept of a ?Senior Independent Director?. Instead, shareholders may raise any issues at the\u00a0AGM. In this forum, the Executive Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board are available to address any issues and are legally obliged to provide adequate responses. Outside the\u00a0AGM, shareholders may approach the Executive Board, in particular the\u00a0CEO\u00a0or the\u00a0CFO, or, for\u00a0topics relating to Supervisory Board matters, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or his Deputy. Mr\u00a0Frank Jakobi, as employee representative, is Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act. Division of responsibilities ? Chairman &amp; Chief Executive (Provision 14) The separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (Dr Dieter Zetsche) and the\u00a0CEO\u00a0(Mr\u00a0Sebastian Ebel) is clearly defined under German law as part of the two-tier board structure. Therefore, no further division of their responsibilities as well as responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is required or even possible. In addition, the division of responsibilities within the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as its committees also results directly from legislation and the respective terms of reference. Therefore, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Advice and service of the Company Secretary (Provision 16) There is no specific role of Company Secretary in German companies. However, Executive and Supervisory Board members have access to the Board Office of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0if they need any advice on all governance matters\u00a0or other services. The Board Office acts as an interface in corporate matters for the Executive and Supervisory Board members and is responsible for ensuring that the requisite processes and procedures are in place governing all Executive and Supervisory Board meetings (i. e. preparation of agendas, minuting of meetings and ensuring compliance with German and\u00a0UK\u00a0law, as appropriate, and with recommendations for corporate governance). The Board Office also supports the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the\u00a0CEO, the\u00a0CFO\u00a0and the Chairmen of the Audit and the Strategy Committees. Executive and Supervisory Board members also have access to legal advice via the Group Director Legal, Compliance &amp; Board Office and via the Board Office. The Supervisory Board can also approach the Executive Board directly for specific advice on any matters. Accordingly, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Nomination Committee ? Composition and responsibilities (Provision 17) The role of the Nomination Committee in a typical\u00a0UK\u00a0company is fulfilled in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0by two Committees of the Supervisory Board: Under the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and its Committees (which are equivalent to the Terms of Reference of a British corporation) the Nomination Committee considers and proposes suitable candidates as shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the\u00a0AGM. The Presiding Committee determines the requirements and remuneration for any new appointments to the Executive Board and recommends suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board. On that basis, the Supervisory Board appoints Executive Board members. This approach is different from the\u00a0UK\u00a0where all director appointments are approved by shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. Succession planning for management levels below Executive Board is carried out by the Executive Board. However, as is common practice in Germany, at each\u00a0AGM\u00a0shareholders are asked to decide whether they approve the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board members during the past financial year. Since the\u00a0AGM\u00a02015, in the light of\u00a0UK\u00a0practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has changed its procedure to allow a separate vote on each individual Executive Board and Supervisory Board member, as it is customary in the\u00a0UK. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board considers that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to the extent practicable. In addition to Prof. Dr Ernst, the Nomination Committee also consists of Dr Zetsche as Committee Chairman and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is considered non-independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023. In this context, the majority of the members of the Nomination Committee are assessed by the Supervisory Board to be independent. Annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM (Provision 18) None of the Executive or Supervisory Board members is re-elected annually. However, as noted above, in light of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0and\u00a0UK\u00a0best practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0voluntarily puts individual resolutions approving the actions of each Executive and Supervisory Board member to the\u00a0AGM\u00a0resolving on the annual financial statements for the previous year.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. The end of appointment periods for Supervisory Board members are disclosed in the table from page\u00a0115. Current curricula vitae of all Executive and Supervisory Board members are published at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance</url>. Board performance evaluation (Principle L and Provision 21) The performance of each individual Executive Board member is evaluated annually by the Supervisory Board for the annual performance-based remuneration. In this context, the Supervisory Board also reviews\u00a0the individual member?s overall performance as part of the Executive Board. However, no external performance evaluation is done for the Executive Board. The efficiency of the Supervisory Board is reviewed regularly, but not annually. Each Supervisory Board member can give feedback to the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman or the Supervisory Board as a whole as and when appropriate or required. The last self-assessment was conducted internally at the end of September\u00a02020. For this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed to all members, in which they could give their assessment of the effectiveness of the\u00a0working methods of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Presiding Committee and the Supervisory Board have subsequently dealt with the results and derived measures from them. These primarily concerned\u00a0the work of the Supervisory Board, the organisation of the meetings and the main topics that the Supervisory Board dealt with in more detail. The next self-assessment is planned for the beginning of\u00a02024\u00a0and is accompanied externally by the consulting company\u00a0ECBE\u00a0(European Center for Board Effectiveness GmbH)\u00a0since September\u00a02023. The Company is not aware of any other relationships between\u00a0ECBE\u00a0and the Company or its directors. Nomination Committee ? Section in the Annual Report (Provision 23) For the activities of the Nomination Committee, see page\u00a016\u00a0which is part of the Supervisory Board Chairman?s letter to shareholders. The succession planning approach is outlined on page\u00a0131. The policy on diversity and inclusion can be found on page\u00a0132. For evaluation of the performance of the Board, see above. Composition of the Audit Committee (Provision 24) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code stipulates that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board should not be a member of the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee may only\u00a0consist of independent members. The Audit Committee consists of Dr Zetsche as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is not considered to be independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0therefore does not fully meet the requirements of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, but is of the opinion that the current composition of the Audit Committee ensures reliable work based on experience. Fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report &amp; Accounts (Provision 27) In a German stock corporation the Executive Board is responsible for drafting the Annual Report &amp; Accounts (ARA). According to section\u00a0243\u00a0(2) of the German Commercial Act (HGB) the\u00a0ARA\u00a0must be clearly arranged and should present a realistic picture of the Company?s economic situation. This is equivalent to the\u00a0UK\u00a0Code requirement for the\u00a0ARA\u00a0to be fair, balanced and understandable. Although this assessment has not been delegated to the Audit Committee, the Executive Board is convinced that this\u00a0ARA\u00a0satisfies both requirements. Established and operation of Remuneration Committee (Provision 32, 34 and 41) In the German governance structure there is no separate Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the Executive Board is under involvement of the employee representatives monitored and agreed by the Supervisory Board based on recommendations from the Presiding Committee, which is governed by the Supervisory Board Terms of Reference. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Supervisory Board Committees is governed by the Articles of Association as resolved on by the shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. See the Directors? Remuneration Report from page\u00a0157\u00a0for full details on Executive and Supervisory Board member\u00b4s remuneration. Policy for post-employment shareholding requirements (Provision 36) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code requires the company to implement a policy for post-employment shareholding requirements. According to the remuneration system approved by the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02021, no policy is provided for post-employment shareholding requirements. Notice periods for Executive Directors (Provision 39) In accordance with the customary practice in Germany members of the Executive Board are generally appointed for a term of three to five years. This is not yet fully in line with the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0recommendation that notice periods or contract terms should be set at one year or less. However, the contracts include maximum limits on the amounts payable on termination. See Remuneration Report from page 157. Further information on Corporate Governance Functioning of the Executive and Supervisory Boards TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is a company under German law. One of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law\u00a0is the dual management system involving two bodies, the Executive Board in charge of managing the company and the Supervisory Board in charge of monitoring the management of the company.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and in a spirit of trust, with strict separation between the two bodies in terms of their membership and competences. Both bodies are obliged to ensure the continued existence of the Company and sustainable creation of added value in harmony with the principles of the social market economy. TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board comprised five members as at the closing date\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company?s business operations in the interests of the Company. The Executive Board works on the basis of terms of reference issued by the Supervisory Board. The allocation of functions and responsibilities to individual Board members is presented in a separate section. For functions, see tables ?Supervisory Board and Executive Board? on page 115 et seq. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board had\u00a020\u00a0members at the balance sheet date, i. e.\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. As the oversight body, the Supervisory Board provided on-going advice and supervision for the Executive Board in managing the Company in financial year\u00a02023, as required by the law, the Articles of Association and its own Terms of Reference. The Supervisory Board is involved in strategic and planning decisions and all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company. When the Executive Board takes decisions on major transactions, such as the annual budget, major acquisitions or divestments, it is required by its terms of reference to seek the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work in the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings and represents the concerns of the body externally. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee have\u00a0adopted terms of reference for their own work. The Terms of Reference of the Supervisory Board are available on the company?s website. For further details, please refer to the Report of the Supervisory Board on page\u00a011. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has taken out a D&amp;O insurance policy for all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, providing for a deductible for Executive Board members in accordance with the statutory requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act. The deductible amounts to\u00a010\u00a0% of the loss up to the amount of one and a half times the fixed annual compensation. Competence Profile and the Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0falls within the scope of the German Industrial Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). The Supervisory\u00a0Board is therefore composed of an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee representatives.\u00a0Employee representatives within the meaning of the Act include a senior manager (section\u00a05\u00a0(3) of the\u00a0German Works Constitution Act) and three trade union representatives. In financial year\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board updated its competence profile for the composition of the entire body. The competence profile of the Supervisory Board is published at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf\">https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf</url>. Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board The following individualized qualification matrix is based on the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board. The competences shown are based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board members. Competence is deemed to exist if at least basic knowledge is available and thus the ability to understand the relevant facts well and to make informed decisions on the basis of existing qualifications, the knowledge and experience acquired in the context of the activity as a supervisory board member, or the further training measures regularly attended by all Supervisory Board members.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_69\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"320\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dialogue with shareholders</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Meeting</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Participants</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">December\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY22\u00a0Results Presentation, London</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow\u00a0UK, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">January\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Commerzbank &amp;\u00a0ODDO\u00a0BHF\u00a0German Investment Seminar, New York City</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">UniCredit / Kepler Cheuvreux\u00a022nd German Corporate Conference, Frankfurt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">February\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q1\u00a0Results Presentation, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Annual General Meeting, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">March\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Capital Raise Roadshow, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">May\u00a02023\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q2\u00a0/ H1\u00a0Results Presentation, London</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow\u00a0UK, London</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Frankfurt, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Zurich, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">June\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">dbAccess German Corporate Conference, Frankfurt</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Paris, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">August\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q3\u00a0/\u00a09M Results Presentation, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stifel\u00a07th Transportation, Business Services &amp; Leisure Conference, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">September\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Morgan Stanley\u00a0CFO\u00a0Fireside Chat, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Berenberg &amp; Goldman Sachs Twelfth German Corporate Conference, Munich</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bernstein?s\u00a020th Pan European Annual Strategic Decisions Conference, London</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Key: Sebastian Ebel (SE), Mathias Kiep (MK) The Supervisory Board receives feedback from the Chairman and Executive Board members following meetings with major shareholders or investors. Additionally, a monthly Investor Relations Report and event-driven assessments of brokers are forwarded to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. They contain updates on the share price development, analyses of the shareholder structure as well as purchases and sales of shares and feedback and assessments from investors. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Independence of Supervisory Board members (Provision 10) Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, the Board must identify in the annual report each non-executive director it considers to be ?independent? for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Based on the responsibilities assigned to the Supervisory Board by the German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Supervisory Board are considered to be non-executive directors for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, persons are ?independent? if they are independent in character and judgement and if there are no relationships or circumstances which\u00a0are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0does not, however, extend its independence disclosures to its\u00a010\u00a0employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. Due to the number of employees, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is subject to the German Co-Determination Act. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0consists of ten members who are elected by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (the ?Shareholder Representatives?) and ten members who represent the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(the ?Employee Representatives?). This differs from\u00a0UK\u00a0practice where only those board members\u00a0representing major shareholders are typically referred to as ?Shareholder Representatives? and are not considered as independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0because of their link to a significant shareholder. Assessment of the independence of the shareholder representatives The Supervisory Board has determined that seven of its nine shareholder representatives (the Chairman is not taken into account according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC) are independent for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. The shareholder representatives considered to be independent are: Ms Ingrid-Helen Arnold, Mr Christian Baier,\u00a0Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst, Ms Mar\u00eda Gara\u00f1a Corces, Ms Janina Kugel, Ms Coline McConville and Ms Helena Murano.\u00a0Additionally, the Chairman, Dr Dieter Zetsche, was independent on his re-election in\u00a02019\u00a0and is still considered independent (Dr Dieter Zetsche also was independent when he was elected to the Supervisory Board in February\u00a02018). In its assessment, the Supervisory Board considered in particular the aspects set out below: Prof. Dr Ernst has been a member of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0since\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a02011. According to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than nine years. According to the\u00a0GCGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence from the Executive Board and the Company if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years. In view of this, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have taken a close look at how they assess Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence. In particular in view of Prof. Dr Ernst?s professional career, the shareholder representatives have come to the conclusion that Prof. Dr Ernst ? also taking into account his membership on the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0of over twelve years ? provides as before the necessary critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company and therefore consider him to be independent. In addition, due to the personnel changes on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board, particularly on the position of the\u00a0CFO, in recent years, Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence from the Executive Board is strengthened. Prof. Dr Ernst also ensures continuity in the proper performance of the tasks of the Audit Committee, which has also seen personnel changes in recent years. Prof. Dr Ernst has continually exhibited his critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company in the past, especially in his position as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Against this background, the Annual General Meeting\u00a02021\u00a0has re-elected Prof. Dr\u00a0Ernst with a large majority. As of the balance sheet date, according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(and also the\u00a0GCGC), Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges is qualified as non-independent. However, Dr D\u00f6nges will be assessed as independent by the Supervisory Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023. On\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022, Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges ceased her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of\u00a0the Federal Republic of Germany (Finanzagentur GmbH der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). On\u00a04\u00a0January\u00a02021,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0entered into a Framework Agreement with the Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) represented by\u00a0Finance Agency GmbH regarding a silent participation of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0and further measures under the stabilisation package. Dr D\u00f6nges was nominated by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0for membership of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and elected to the Supervisory Board by the shareholders with effect from the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\u00a02021. On\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0repaid the\u00a0WSF\u00a0financial aid in full. In view of the above information, the Supervisory Board has come to the conclusion that the factors previously indicating the dependence of Dr\u00a0D\u00f6nges no longer apply. However, as the Supervisory Board has decided to apply a one-year cooling-off period according to recommendation C.7\u00a0(paragraph\u00a02, indent\u00a02) of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0in this case, Dr D\u00f6nges will only be assessed as independent from the Company and its Executive Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023, i. e.\u00a0after one year from the termination of her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Supervisory Board considers the shorter cooling-off period compared to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(1\u00a0year according to the\u00a0GCGC,\u00a03\u00a0years according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to be appropriate. At\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Mr Joan Tr\u00edan Riu (Riu Hotels S. A., approx.\u00a01.1\u00a0% of the voting rights as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023) is\u00a0linked to a major shareholder. In this context, he is considered a non-independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Assessment of the independence of employee representatives Seven of the ten employee representatives of the Supervisory Board are elected by the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group entitled to vote. Three employee representatives are nominated by a German trade union. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, directors who are or have been employees of the Group in the last five years or who participate in the Group?s pension arrangements would generally not be considered independent. In the\u00a0UK, directors with an employment relationship are normally current or former executives. By contrast, under German law, employee representatives of the Supervisory Board must be employees of the Group, and must be elected by the employees without any involvement of the Executive or Supervisory Boards. Furthermore, the employment contract of employee representatives may only be terminated in exceptional cases. The employee representatives may also participate in Group pension schemes as is normal for employees and in their capacity as employees. Trade union representatives are nominated and employed by the trade union but are still classified as employee representatives. They can only be removed from the Supervisory Board by their respective union and neither the Executive nor the Supervisory Board has any role in their appointment or removal. Half the Board should be independent Non-executive Directors (Provision 11) As mentioned above,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board consists of ten employee and ten shareholder representatives. As the employee representatives are not considered independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board comprises seven (excluding the Chairman of the Supervisory Board) independent shareholder representatives. Identification of Senior Independent Director (Provision 12) Under German law and the\u00a0GCGC, there is no concept of a ?Senior Independent Director?. Instead, shareholders may raise any issues at the\u00a0AGM. In this forum, the Executive Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board are available to address any issues and are legally obliged to provide adequate responses. Outside the\u00a0AGM, shareholders may approach the Executive Board, in particular the\u00a0CEO\u00a0or the\u00a0CFO, or, for\u00a0topics relating to Supervisory Board matters, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or his Deputy. Mr\u00a0Frank Jakobi, as employee representative, is Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act. Division of responsibilities ? Chairman &amp; Chief Executive (Provision 14) The separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (Dr Dieter Zetsche) and the\u00a0CEO\u00a0(Mr\u00a0Sebastian Ebel) is clearly defined under German law as part of the two-tier board structure. Therefore, no further division of their responsibilities as well as responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is required or even possible. In addition, the division of responsibilities within the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as its committees also results directly from legislation and the respective terms of reference. Therefore, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Advice and service of the Company Secretary (Provision 16) There is no specific role of Company Secretary in German companies. However, Executive and Supervisory Board members have access to the Board Office of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0if they need any advice on all governance matters\u00a0or other services. The Board Office acts as an interface in corporate matters for the Executive and Supervisory Board members and is responsible for ensuring that the requisite processes and procedures are in place governing all Executive and Supervisory Board meetings (i. e. preparation of agendas, minuting of meetings and ensuring compliance with German and\u00a0UK\u00a0law, as appropriate, and with recommendations for corporate governance). The Board Office also supports the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the\u00a0CEO, the\u00a0CFO\u00a0and the Chairmen of the Audit and the Strategy Committees. Executive and Supervisory Board members also have access to legal advice via the Group Director Legal, Compliance &amp; Board Office and via the Board Office. The Supervisory Board can also approach the Executive Board directly for specific advice on any matters. Accordingly, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Nomination Committee ? Composition and responsibilities (Provision 17) The role of the Nomination Committee in a typical\u00a0UK\u00a0company is fulfilled in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0by two Committees of the Supervisory Board: Under the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and its Committees (which are equivalent to the Terms of Reference of a British corporation) the Nomination Committee considers and proposes suitable candidates as shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the\u00a0AGM. The Presiding Committee determines the requirements and remuneration for any new appointments to the Executive Board and recommends suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board. On that basis, the Supervisory Board appoints Executive Board members. This approach is different from the\u00a0UK\u00a0where all director appointments are approved by shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. Succession planning for management levels below Executive Board is carried out by the Executive Board. However, as is common practice in Germany, at each\u00a0AGM\u00a0shareholders are asked to decide whether they approve the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board members during the past financial year. Since the\u00a0AGM\u00a02015, in the light of\u00a0UK\u00a0practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has changed its procedure to allow a separate vote on each individual Executive Board and Supervisory Board member, as it is customary in the\u00a0UK. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board considers that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to the extent practicable. In addition to Prof. Dr Ernst, the Nomination Committee also consists of Dr Zetsche as Committee Chairman and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is considered non-independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023. In this context, the majority of the members of the Nomination Committee are assessed by the Supervisory Board to be independent. Annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM (Provision 18) None of the Executive or Supervisory Board members is re-elected annually. However, as noted above, in light of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0and\u00a0UK\u00a0best practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0voluntarily puts individual resolutions approving the actions of each Executive and Supervisory Board member to the\u00a0AGM\u00a0resolving on the annual financial statements for the previous year.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. The end of appointment periods for Supervisory Board members are disclosed in the table from page\u00a0115. Current curricula vitae of all Executive and Supervisory Board members are published at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance</url>. Board performance evaluation (Principle L and Provision 21) The performance of each individual Executive Board member is evaluated annually by the Supervisory Board for the annual performance-based remuneration. In this context, the Supervisory Board also reviews\u00a0the individual member?s overall performance as part of the Executive Board. However, no external performance evaluation is done for the Executive Board. The efficiency of the Supervisory Board is reviewed regularly, but not annually. Each Supervisory Board member can give feedback to the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman or the Supervisory Board as a whole as and when appropriate or required. The last self-assessment was conducted internally at the end of September\u00a02020. For this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed to all members, in which they could give their assessment of the effectiveness of the\u00a0working methods of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Presiding Committee and the Supervisory Board have subsequently dealt with the results and derived measures from them. These primarily concerned\u00a0the work of the Supervisory Board, the organisation of the meetings and the main topics that the Supervisory Board dealt with in more detail. The next self-assessment is planned for the beginning of\u00a02024\u00a0and is accompanied externally by the consulting company\u00a0ECBE\u00a0(European Center for Board Effectiveness GmbH)\u00a0since September\u00a02023. The Company is not aware of any other relationships between\u00a0ECBE\u00a0and the Company or its directors. Nomination Committee ? Section in the Annual Report (Provision 23) For the activities of the Nomination Committee, see page\u00a016\u00a0which is part of the Supervisory Board Chairman?s letter to shareholders. The succession planning approach is outlined on page\u00a0131. The policy on diversity and inclusion can be found on page\u00a0132. For evaluation of the performance of the Board, see above. Composition of the Audit Committee (Provision 24) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code stipulates that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board should not be a member of the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee may only\u00a0consist of independent members. The Audit Committee consists of Dr Zetsche as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is not considered to be independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0therefore does not fully meet the requirements of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, but is of the opinion that the current composition of the Audit Committee ensures reliable work based on experience. Fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report &amp; Accounts (Provision 27) In a German stock corporation the Executive Board is responsible for drafting the Annual Report &amp; Accounts (ARA). According to section\u00a0243\u00a0(2) of the German Commercial Act (HGB) the\u00a0ARA\u00a0must be clearly arranged and should present a realistic picture of the Company?s economic situation. This is equivalent to the\u00a0UK\u00a0Code requirement for the\u00a0ARA\u00a0to be fair, balanced and understandable. Although this assessment has not been delegated to the Audit Committee, the Executive Board is convinced that this\u00a0ARA\u00a0satisfies both requirements. Established and operation of Remuneration Committee (Provision 32, 34 and 41) In the German governance structure there is no separate Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the Executive Board is under involvement of the employee representatives monitored and agreed by the Supervisory Board based on recommendations from the Presiding Committee, which is governed by the Supervisory Board Terms of Reference. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Supervisory Board Committees is governed by the Articles of Association as resolved on by the shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. See the Directors? Remuneration Report from page\u00a0157\u00a0for full details on Executive and Supervisory Board member\u00b4s remuneration. Policy for post-employment shareholding requirements (Provision 36) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code requires the company to implement a policy for post-employment shareholding requirements. According to the remuneration system approved by the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02021, no policy is provided for post-employment shareholding requirements. Notice periods for Executive Directors (Provision 39) In accordance with the customary practice in Germany members of the Executive Board are generally appointed for a term of three to five years. This is not yet fully in line with the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0recommendation that notice periods or contract terms should be set at one year or less. However, the contracts include maximum limits on the amounts payable on termination. See Remuneration Report from page 157. Further information on Corporate Governance Functioning of the Executive and Supervisory Boards TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is a company under German law. One of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law\u00a0is the dual management system involving two bodies, the Executive Board in charge of managing the company and the Supervisory Board in charge of monitoring the management of the company.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and in a spirit of trust, with strict separation between the two bodies in terms of their membership and competences. Both bodies are obliged to ensure the continued existence of the Company and sustainable creation of added value in harmony with the principles of the social market economy. TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board comprised five members as at the closing date\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company?s business operations in the interests of the Company. The Executive Board works on the basis of terms of reference issued by the Supervisory Board. The allocation of functions and responsibilities to individual Board members is presented in a separate section. For functions, see tables ?Supervisory Board and Executive Board? on page 115 et seq. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board had\u00a020\u00a0members at the balance sheet date, i. e.\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. As the oversight body, the Supervisory Board provided on-going advice and supervision for the Executive Board in managing the Company in financial year\u00a02023, as required by the law, the Articles of Association and its own Terms of Reference. The Supervisory Board is involved in strategic and planning decisions and all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company. When the Executive Board takes decisions on major transactions, such as the annual budget, major acquisitions or divestments, it is required by its terms of reference to seek the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work in the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings and represents the concerns of the body externally. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee have\u00a0adopted terms of reference for their own work. The Terms of Reference of the Supervisory Board are available on the company?s website. For further details, please refer to the Report of the Supervisory Board on page\u00a011. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has taken out a D&amp;O insurance policy for all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, providing for a deductible for Executive Board members in accordance with the statutory requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act. The deductible amounts to\u00a010\u00a0% of the loss up to the amount of one and a half times the fixed annual compensation. Competence Profile and the Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0falls within the scope of the German Industrial Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). The Supervisory\u00a0Board is therefore composed of an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee representatives.\u00a0Employee representatives within the meaning of the Act include a senior manager (section\u00a05\u00a0(3) of the\u00a0German Works Constitution Act) and three trade union representatives. In financial year\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board updated its competence profile for the composition of the entire body. The competence profile of the Supervisory Board is published at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf\">https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf</url>. Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board The following individualized qualification matrix is based on the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board. The competences shown are based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board members. Competence is deemed to exist if at least basic knowledge is available and thus the ability to understand the relevant facts well and to make informed decisions on the basis of existing qualifications, the knowledge and experience acquired in the context of the activity as a supervisory board member, or the further training measures regularly attended by all Supervisory Board members.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_70\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"320\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Dialogue with shareholders</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Meeting</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Participants</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">December\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY22\u00a0Results Presentation, London</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow\u00a0UK, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">January\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Commerzbank &amp;\u00a0ODDO\u00a0BHF\u00a0German Investment Seminar, New York City</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">UniCredit / Kepler Cheuvreux\u00a022nd German Corporate Conference, Frankfurt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">February\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q1\u00a0Results Presentation, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Annual General Meeting, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">March\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Capital Raise Roadshow, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">May\u00a02023\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q2\u00a0/ H1\u00a0Results Presentation, London</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow\u00a0UK, London</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Frankfurt, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Zurich, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">June\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">dbAccess German Corporate Conference, Frankfurt</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Roadshow Paris, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">August\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">FY23\u00a0Q3\u00a0/\u00a09M Results Presentation, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">SE,\u00a0MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Stifel\u00a07th Transportation, Business Services &amp; Leisure Conference, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">September\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Morgan Stanley\u00a0CFO\u00a0Fireside Chat, virtual</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MK</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Berenberg &amp; Goldman Sachs Twelfth German Corporate Conference, Munich</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">MK</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Bernstein?s\u00a020th Pan European Annual Strategic Decisions Conference, London</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">SE</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Key: Sebastian Ebel (SE), Mathias Kiep (MK) The Supervisory Board receives feedback from the Chairman and Executive Board members following meetings with major shareholders or investors. Additionally, a monthly Investor Relations Report and event-driven assessments of brokers are forwarded to the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board. They contain updates on the share price development, analyses of the shareholder structure as well as purchases and sales of shares and feedback and assessments from investors. The Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Independence of Supervisory Board members (Provision 10) Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, the Board must identify in the annual report each non-executive director it considers to be ?independent? for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Based on the responsibilities assigned to the Supervisory Board by the German Stock Corporation Act, the members of the Supervisory Board are considered to be non-executive directors for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, persons are ?independent? if they are independent in character and judgement and if there are no relationships or circumstances which\u00a0are likely to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0does not, however, extend its independence disclosures to its\u00a010\u00a0employee representatives on the Supervisory Board. Due to the number of employees, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is subject to the German Co-Determination Act. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0consists of ten members who are elected by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting (the ?Shareholder Representatives?) and ten members who represent the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(the ?Employee Representatives?). This differs from\u00a0UK\u00a0practice where only those board members\u00a0representing major shareholders are typically referred to as ?Shareholder Representatives? and are not considered as independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0because of their link to a significant shareholder. Assessment of the independence of the shareholder representatives The Supervisory Board has determined that seven of its nine shareholder representatives (the Chairman is not taken into account according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC) are independent for the purposes of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. The shareholder representatives considered to be independent are: Ms Ingrid-Helen Arnold, Mr Christian Baier,\u00a0Prof. Dr Edgar Ernst, Ms Mar\u00eda Gara\u00f1a Corces, Ms Janina Kugel, Ms Coline McConville and Ms Helena Murano.\u00a0Additionally, the Chairman, Dr Dieter Zetsche, was independent on his re-election in\u00a02019\u00a0and is still considered independent (Dr Dieter Zetsche also was independent when he was elected to the Supervisory Board in February\u00a02018). In its assessment, the Supervisory Board considered in particular the aspects set out below: Prof. Dr Ernst has been a member of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0since\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a02011. According to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than nine years. According to the\u00a0GCGC, it is an indication of a lack of independence from the Executive Board and the Company if a member has been on the Supervisory Board for more than twelve years. In view of this, the shareholder representatives on the Supervisory Board have taken a close look at how they assess Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence. In particular in view of Prof. Dr Ernst?s professional career, the shareholder representatives have come to the conclusion that Prof. Dr Ernst ? also taking into account his membership on the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0of over twelve years ? provides as before the necessary critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company and therefore consider him to be independent. In addition, due to the personnel changes on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board, particularly on the position of the\u00a0CFO, in recent years, Prof. Dr Ernst?s independence from the Executive Board is strengthened. Prof. Dr Ernst also ensures continuity in the proper performance of the tasks of the Audit Committee, which has also seen personnel changes in recent years. Prof. Dr Ernst has continually exhibited his critical distance from the Executive Board and the Company in the past, especially in his position as Chairman of the Audit Committee. Against this background, the Annual General Meeting\u00a02021\u00a0has re-elected Prof. Dr\u00a0Ernst with a large majority. As of the balance sheet date, according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(and also the\u00a0GCGC), Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges is qualified as non-independent. However, Dr D\u00f6nges will be assessed as independent by the Supervisory Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023. On\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022, Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges ceased her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of\u00a0the Federal Republic of Germany (Finanzagentur GmbH der Bundesrepublik Deutschland). On\u00a04\u00a0January\u00a02021,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0entered into a Framework Agreement with the Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) represented by\u00a0Finance Agency GmbH regarding a silent participation of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0and further measures under the stabilisation package. Dr D\u00f6nges was nominated by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0for membership of the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and elected to the Supervisory Board by the shareholders with effect from the Annual General Meeting (AGM)\u00a02021. On\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0repaid the\u00a0WSF\u00a0financial aid in full. In view of the above information, the Supervisory Board has come to the conclusion that the factors previously indicating the dependence of Dr\u00a0D\u00f6nges no longer apply. However, as the Supervisory Board has decided to apply a one-year cooling-off period according to recommendation C.7\u00a0(paragraph\u00a02, indent\u00a02) of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0in this case, Dr D\u00f6nges will only be assessed as independent from the Company and its Executive Board from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02023, i. e.\u00a0after one year from the termination of her position as Managing Director of the Finance Agency of the Federal Republic of Germany. The Supervisory Board considers the shorter cooling-off period compared to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0(1\u00a0year according to the\u00a0GCGC,\u00a03\u00a0years according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to be appropriate. At\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Mr Joan Tr\u00edan Riu (Riu Hotels S. A., approx.\u00a01.1\u00a0% of the voting rights as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023) is\u00a0linked to a major shareholder. In this context, he is considered a non-independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Assessment of the independence of employee representatives Seven of the ten employee representatives of the Supervisory Board are elected by the employees of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group entitled to vote. Three employee representatives are nominated by a German trade union. Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, directors who are or have been employees of the Group in the last five years or who participate in the Group?s pension arrangements would generally not be considered independent. In the\u00a0UK, directors with an employment relationship are normally current or former executives. By contrast, under German law, employee representatives of the Supervisory Board must be employees of the Group, and must be elected by the employees without any involvement of the Executive or Supervisory Boards. Furthermore, the employment contract of employee representatives may only be terminated in exceptional cases. The employee representatives may also participate in Group pension schemes as is normal for employees and in their capacity as employees. Trade union representatives are nominated and employed by the trade union but are still classified as employee representatives. They can only be removed from the Supervisory Board by their respective union and neither the Executive nor the Supervisory Board has any role in their appointment or removal. Half the Board should be independent Non-executive Directors (Provision 11) As mentioned above,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board consists of ten employee and ten shareholder representatives. As the employee representatives are not considered independent under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board comprises seven (excluding the Chairman of the Supervisory Board) independent shareholder representatives. Identification of Senior Independent Director (Provision 12) Under German law and the\u00a0GCGC, there is no concept of a ?Senior Independent Director?. Instead, shareholders may raise any issues at the\u00a0AGM. In this forum, the Executive Board and the Chairman of the Supervisory Board are available to address any issues and are legally obliged to provide adequate responses. Outside the\u00a0AGM, shareholders may approach the Executive Board, in particular the\u00a0CEO\u00a0or the\u00a0CFO, or, for\u00a0topics relating to Supervisory Board matters, the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or his Deputy. Mr\u00a0Frank Jakobi, as employee representative, is Deputy Chairman of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the German Co-Determination Act. Division of responsibilities ? Chairman &amp; Chief Executive (Provision 14) The separation of the roles of the Chairman of the Supervisory Board (Dr Dieter Zetsche) and the\u00a0CEO\u00a0(Mr\u00a0Sebastian Ebel) is clearly defined under German law as part of the two-tier board structure. Therefore, no further division of their responsibilities as well as responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board is required or even possible. In addition, the division of responsibilities within the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as its committees also results directly from legislation and the respective terms of reference. Therefore, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Advice and service of the Company Secretary (Provision 16) There is no specific role of Company Secretary in German companies. However, Executive and Supervisory Board members have access to the Board Office of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0if they need any advice on all governance matters\u00a0or other services. The Board Office acts as an interface in corporate matters for the Executive and Supervisory Board members and is responsible for ensuring that the requisite processes and procedures are in place governing all Executive and Supervisory Board meetings (i. e. preparation of agendas, minuting of meetings and ensuring compliance with German and\u00a0UK\u00a0law, as appropriate, and with recommendations for corporate governance). The Board Office also supports the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the\u00a0CEO, the\u00a0CFO\u00a0and the Chairmen of the Audit and the Strategy Committees. Executive and Supervisory Board members also have access to legal advice via the Group Director Legal, Compliance &amp; Board Office and via the Board Office. The Supervisory Board can also approach the Executive Board directly for specific advice on any matters. Accordingly, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board consider that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Nomination Committee ? Composition and responsibilities (Provision 17) The role of the Nomination Committee in a typical\u00a0UK\u00a0company is fulfilled in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0by two Committees of the Supervisory Board: Under the Terms of Reference for the Supervisory Board and its Committees (which are equivalent to the Terms of Reference of a British corporation) the Nomination Committee considers and proposes suitable candidates as shareholder representatives to the Supervisory Board for its election proposals to the\u00a0AGM. The Presiding Committee determines the requirements and remuneration for any new appointments to the Executive Board and recommends suitable candidates to the Supervisory Board. On that basis, the Supervisory Board appoints Executive Board members. This approach is different from the\u00a0UK\u00a0where all director appointments are approved by shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. Succession planning for management levels below Executive Board is carried out by the Executive Board. However, as is common practice in Germany, at each\u00a0AGM\u00a0shareholders are asked to decide whether they approve the actions of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board members during the past financial year. Since the\u00a0AGM\u00a02015, in the light of\u00a0UK\u00a0practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has changed its procedure to allow a separate vote on each individual Executive Board and Supervisory Board member, as it is customary in the\u00a0UK. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. Accordingly, the Supervisory Board considers that\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0lives up to the spirit and meaning of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0to the extent practicable. In addition to Prof. Dr Ernst, the Nomination Committee also consists of Dr Zetsche as Committee Chairman and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is considered non-independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023. In this context, the majority of the members of the Nomination Committee are assessed by the Supervisory Board to be independent. Annual re-election by shareholders at the AGM (Provision 18) None of the Executive or Supervisory Board members is re-elected annually. However, as noted above, in light of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0and\u00a0UK\u00a0best practice,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0voluntarily puts individual resolutions approving the actions of each Executive and Supervisory Board member to the\u00a0AGM\u00a0resolving on the annual financial statements for the previous year.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0intends to continue this practice. The end of appointment periods for Supervisory Board members are disclosed in the table from page\u00a0115. Current curricula vitae of all Executive and Supervisory Board members are published at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance</url>. Board performance evaluation (Principle L and Provision 21) The performance of each individual Executive Board member is evaluated annually by the Supervisory Board for the annual performance-based remuneration. In this context, the Supervisory Board also reviews\u00a0the individual member?s overall performance as part of the Executive Board. However, no external performance evaluation is done for the Executive Board. The efficiency of the Supervisory Board is reviewed regularly, but not annually. Each Supervisory Board member can give feedback to the Chairman, the Deputy Chairman or the Supervisory Board as a whole as and when appropriate or required. The last self-assessment was conducted internally at the end of September\u00a02020. For this purpose, a questionnaire was distributed to all members, in which they could give their assessment of the effectiveness of the\u00a0working methods of the Supervisory Board and its committees. The Presiding Committee and the Supervisory Board have subsequently dealt with the results and derived measures from them. These primarily concerned\u00a0the work of the Supervisory Board, the organisation of the meetings and the main topics that the Supervisory Board dealt with in more detail. The next self-assessment is planned for the beginning of\u00a02024\u00a0and is accompanied externally by the consulting company\u00a0ECBE\u00a0(European Center for Board Effectiveness GmbH)\u00a0since September\u00a02023. The Company is not aware of any other relationships between\u00a0ECBE\u00a0and the Company or its directors. Nomination Committee ? Section in the Annual Report (Provision 23) For the activities of the Nomination Committee, see page\u00a016\u00a0which is part of the Supervisory Board Chairman?s letter to shareholders. The succession planning approach is outlined on page\u00a0131. The policy on diversity and inclusion can be found on page\u00a0132. For evaluation of the performance of the Board, see above. Composition of the Audit Committee (Provision 24) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code stipulates that the Chairman of the Supervisory Board should not be a member of the Audit Committee and that the Audit Committee may only\u00a0consist of independent members. The Audit Committee consists of Dr Zetsche as Chairman of the Supervisory Board and Dr D\u00f6nges, who is not considered to be independent until\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0therefore does not fully meet the requirements of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC, but is of the opinion that the current composition of the Audit Committee ensures reliable work based on experience. Fair, balanced and understandable Annual Report &amp; Accounts (Provision 27) In a German stock corporation the Executive Board is responsible for drafting the Annual Report &amp; Accounts (ARA). According to section\u00a0243\u00a0(2) of the German Commercial Act (HGB) the\u00a0ARA\u00a0must be clearly arranged and should present a realistic picture of the Company?s economic situation. This is equivalent to the\u00a0UK\u00a0Code requirement for the\u00a0ARA\u00a0to be fair, balanced and understandable. Although this assessment has not been delegated to the Audit Committee, the Executive Board is convinced that this\u00a0ARA\u00a0satisfies both requirements. Established and operation of Remuneration Committee (Provision 32, 34 and 41) In the German governance structure there is no separate Remuneration Committee. The remuneration of the Executive Board is under involvement of the employee representatives monitored and agreed by the Supervisory Board based on recommendations from the Presiding Committee, which is governed by the Supervisory Board Terms of Reference. The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and the members of the Supervisory Board Committees is governed by the Articles of Association as resolved on by the shareholders at the\u00a0AGM. See the Directors? Remuneration Report from page\u00a0157\u00a0for full details on Executive and Supervisory Board member\u00b4s remuneration. Policy for post-employment shareholding requirements (Provision 36) Neither German law nor the German Corporate Governance Code requires the company to implement a policy for post-employment shareholding requirements. According to the remuneration system approved by the Annual General Meeting in\u00a02021, no policy is provided for post-employment shareholding requirements. Notice periods for Executive Directors (Provision 39) In accordance with the customary practice in Germany members of the Executive Board are generally appointed for a term of three to five years. This is not yet fully in line with the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0recommendation that notice periods or contract terms should be set at one year or less. However, the contracts include maximum limits on the amounts payable on termination. See Remuneration Report from page 157. Further information on Corporate Governance Functioning of the Executive and Supervisory Boards TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is a company under German law. One of the fundamental principles of German stock corporation law\u00a0is the dual management system involving two bodies, the Executive Board in charge of managing the company and the Supervisory Board in charge of monitoring the management of the company.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board and Supervisory Board cooperate closely and in a spirit of trust, with strict separation between the two bodies in terms of their membership and competences. Both bodies are obliged to ensure the continued existence of the Company and sustainable creation of added value in harmony with the principles of the social market economy. TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board comprised five members as at the closing date\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. The Executive Board is responsible for managing the Company?s business operations in the interests of the Company. The Executive Board works on the basis of terms of reference issued by the Supervisory Board. The allocation of functions and responsibilities to individual Board members is presented in a separate section. For functions, see tables ?Supervisory Board and Executive Board? on page 115 et seq. In accordance with the law and the Articles of Association, the Supervisory Board had\u00a020\u00a0members at the balance sheet date, i. e.\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. As the oversight body, the Supervisory Board provided on-going advice and supervision for the Executive Board in managing the Company in financial year\u00a02023, as required by the law, the Articles of Association and its own Terms of Reference. The Supervisory Board is involved in strategic and planning decisions and all decisions of fundamental importance to the Company. When the Executive Board takes decisions on major transactions, such as the annual budget, major acquisitions or divestments, it is required by its terms of reference to seek the approval of the Supervisory Board. The Chairman of the Supervisory Board coordinates the work in the Supervisory Board, chairs its meetings and represents the concerns of the body externally. The Supervisory Board and the Audit Committee have\u00a0adopted terms of reference for their own work. The Terms of Reference of the Supervisory Board are available on the company?s website. For further details, please refer to the Report of the Supervisory Board on page\u00a011. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has taken out a D&amp;O insurance policy for all members of the Executive Board and Supervisory Board, providing for a deductible for Executive Board members in accordance with the statutory requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act. The deductible amounts to\u00a010\u00a0% of the loss up to the amount of one and a half times the fixed annual compensation. Competence Profile and the Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0falls within the scope of the German Industrial Co-Determination Act (MitbestG). The Supervisory\u00a0Board is therefore composed of an equal number of shareholder representatives and employee representatives.\u00a0Employee representatives within the meaning of the Act include a senior manager (section\u00a05\u00a0(3) of the\u00a0German Works Constitution Act) and three trade union representatives. In financial year\u00a02022, the Supervisory Board updated its competence profile for the composition of the entire body. The competence profile of the Supervisory Board is published at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf\">https://www.tuigroup.com/damfiles/default/tuigroup-15/de/ueber-uns/management/Kompetenzprofil/Kompetenzprofil_V03-13-12-2022_EN-FINAL.pdf-473db0556f8dff912a59b1b37696a1df.pdf</url>. Qualification Matrix of the Supervisory Board The following individualized qualification matrix is based on the targets for the composition of the Supervisory Board. The competences shown are based on a self-assessment by the Supervisory Board members. Competence is deemed to exist if at least basic knowledge is available and thus the ability to understand the relevant facts well and to make informed decisions on the basis of existing qualifications, the knowledge and experience acquired in the context of the activity as a supervisory board member, or the further training measures regularly attended by all Supervisory Board members.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"11\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_71\"><colspec colname=\"col1\"

Mr Christian Baier\u00a0has expertise in the field of accounting and in the field of auditing due to his professional career and in particular due to his function as Chief Financial Officer of Metro\u00a0AG\u00a0(until July\u00a02023).

His expertise in the field of accounting also includes, in particular, knowledge and experience in the application\u00a0of accounting principles and internal control and risk management systems. His expertise in the field of auditing also includes, in particular, knowledge and experience in the auditing of financial statements. Since Metro\u00a0AG\u00a0has also been publishing a non-financial statement for several years, which is prepared taking into account the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards on sustainability reporting and the\u00a0UN\u00a0Global Compact, his expertise in the field of auditing also includes sustainability reporting and its audit. Dr Jutta D\u00f6nges has expertise in the field of accounting and in the field of auditing due to her professional career and in particular because of her function as\u00a0CFO\u00a0at Uniper\u00a0SE\u00a0as well as managing director of the Federal Republic of Germany ?

This includes sustainability reporting and its audit, whereby this is oriented, among other things, to the standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI). Training and professional development measures The members of the Supervisory Board take responsibility for undertaking any training or professional development measures necessary to fulfil their duties, for example on issues of corporate governance or changes in the legal framework and they receive support in this respect from the company. The company regularly informs its members about current changes in the legislation as well as about relevant topics relating to the company. New members of the Supervisory Board are given the opportunity to be introduced in detail to key issues of the Supervisory Board as part of the onboarding programme. In addition, they have meetings with members of the Executive Board in order to receive further information on their respective areas of responsibility. Conflicts of interest Executive and Supervisory Board members are bound to observe the\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s best interests. In addition, Executive Board members are subject to comprehensive non-compete clauses throughout the duration of\u00a0their appointment. In the completed financial year\u00a02023, there were no conflicts of interest requiring disclosure to the Chairman of the Supervisory Board or the Executive Board. None of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board members have a board role or a consultancy contract with one of\u00a0TUI?s competitors. As a precautionary measure, Mr Joan Tr\u00edan Riu abstained from the vote of the Supervisory Board in its meeting of\u00a04\u00a0July\u00a02023\u00a0on the resolution to establish a joint venture with the Riu Family. Moreover, no current member of the Executive Board has been appointed and no member of the Supervisory Board has been elected pursuant to any arrangement or understanding with major shareholders, customers, suppliers or others. There are no family relationships between any current members of the Executive Board or Supervisory Board. Specifications pursuant to sections 76 (3a) and (4), 96 (2), 111 (5) of the German Stock Corporation Act 45\u00a0% of the Supervisory Board members were women and\u00a055\u00a0% were men at the balance sheet date. The Supervisory Board was therefore compliant with section\u00a096\u00a0(2) sentence\u00a01\u00a0of the German Stock Corporation Act. Neither the shareholder nor the employee representatives of the Supervisory Board have objected with\u00a0regard to overall compliance in accordance with section\u00a096\u00a0(2) sentence\u00a02\u00a0of the German Stock Corporation\u00a0Act. In August\u00a02021, the Second Management Positions Act ? F\u00fcPoG\u00a0II\u00a0? came into force. According to this law, at least one woman and at least one man must be a member of the Executive Board of a listed company with\u00a0equal co-determination and with more than three members on the Executive Board. The company has already\u00a0complied with this requirement in the reporting period with the membership of Ms Sybille Reiss. The Executive Board resolved, in line with section\u00a076\u00a0(4) of the German Stock Corporation Act, that women should account for\u00a025\u00a0% of executives at the level immediately below the Executive Board and\u00a030\u00a0% at the second level below the Executive Board. The cut-off date for both was\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. For this reason,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has implemented various measures aimed at increasing the proportion of women on a long-term and sustainable basis over the past years. This includes, among other things, the promotion of women in talent programmes and specifically addressing them in the recruitment process. In addition, at least one female should be on the shortlist in the recruitment process for positions in the Senior Leadership Team. Despite all the measures taken, the suitability and qualification of candidates for filling vacant positions are still of primary importance. With a\u00a030\u00a0% proportion of women in the second management level, these measures are\u00a0already having an effect and have led to the target for\u00a0FY23\u00a0being met. The target of\u00a025\u00a0% in the first management level below the Executive Board was not achieved at\u00a014\u00a0%. As a new target for the period up to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02026, the Executive Board has decided that the proportion of women in the first management level below the Executive Board should now be\u00a030\u00a0% instead of the previous\u00a025\u00a0% and that the proportion of women in the second management level below the Executive Board should remain at\u00a030\u00a0%. Shareholders and Annual General Meeting TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shareholders exercise their co-determination and monitoring rights at the\u00a0AGM, which takes place at\u00a0least once a year. The\u00a0AGM\u00a0takes decisions on all statutory matters, and these are binding on all shareholders and the Company. For voting on resolutions, each share confers one vote. All shareholders registering in due time are entitled to participate in the\u00a0AGM. Shareholders who are not able to attend the\u00a0AGM\u00a0in person are entitled to have their voting rights exercised by a shareholder association, one of the representatives provided by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and acting on the shareholders? behalf in accordance with their instructions, or some other proxy of their own choosing. Shareholders also have the opportunity of authorising the representative provided by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0via the web or by postal vote in the run-up to the\u00a0AGM. Shareholders can, moreover, register for electronic dispatch of the\u00a0AGM\u00a0documents.

Statement pursuant to Provision 4 UK CGC At the\u00a0AGM\u00a0of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0on\u00a014\u00a0February\u00a02023, no resolution received\u00a020\u00a0% or more against votes. Risk management Good corporate governance entails the responsible handling of commercial risks. The Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and the management of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group have comprehensive general and company-specific reporting and monitoring systems available to identify, assess and manage these risks. These systems are continually developed, adjusted to match changes in overall conditions and reviewed by the auditors. The Executive Board regularly informs the Supervisory Board about existing risks and changes to these risks. The Audit Committee deals in particular with monitoring the accounting process, including reporting, the effectiveness of the internal control and risk management systems and the internal auditing system, compliance and audit of the annual financial statements. The chairman of the Audit Committee reports to the Supervisory Board on the work of the committee at the next Supervisory Board meeting at the latest. More detailed information about risk management in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is presented in the Risk Report. It also\u00a0contains the report on the accounting-related internal control and risk management system required in accordance with the German Commercial Code (sections\u00a0289\u00a0(5),\u00a0315\u00a0(2) no.\u00a05\u00a0HGB). Risk Report see page 35. Transparency TUI\u00a0provides immediate, regular and up-to-date information about the Group?s economic situation and new developments to capital market participants and the interested public. The Annual Report and the Interim Reports are published within the applicable timeframes. The Company publishes press releases and ad hoc announcements, if required, on topical events and any new developments. Moreover, the company website at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com\">www.tuigroup.com</url> provides comprehensive information on\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and the\u00a0TUI\u00a0share. The scheduled dates for the principal regular events and publications ? such as the\u00a0AGM, Annual Report and Interim Reports ? are set out in a financial calendar. The calendar is published well in advance and made permanently accessible to the public on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s website. Directors? dealings The Company was informed by Mr Andreas Barczewski, Mr David Burling, Mr Sebastian Ebel, Mr Wolfgang Flintermann, Mr Stefan Heinemann, Mr Frank Jakobi, Mr Mathias Kiep, Mr Peter Krueger, Ms Sybille Reiss, Ms Anette Strempel und Dr Dieter Zetsche of notifiable purchase and sale transactions of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shares or related financial instruments by directors (directors? dealings or managers? transactions) concerning financial\u00a0year\u00a02023. Details are provided on the Company?s website. It should be noted that there are different thresholds for reporting requirements in Germany and the\u00a0UK\u00a0of\u00a020,000\u00a0? (Germany) and\u00a05,000\u00a0? (UK). Purchase and sales transactions by members of the boards are governed by the Group Manual Share Dealings\u00a0by Restricted Persons, approved by the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board, alongside corresponding\u00a0statutory provisions. The Group Manual Share Dealings by Restricted Persons stipulates above all an obligation\u00a0to receive a clearance to deal for transactions with\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s financial instruments. Accounting and auditing TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0prepares its consolidated financial statements and consolidated interim financial statements in accordance with the provisions of the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as applicable in the European Union. The statutory annual financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, which form the basis for the dividend payment, are prepared in accordance with the German Commercial Code (HGB). The consolidated financial statements are prepared by the Executive Board, audited by the auditors and approved by the Supervisory Board. The interim report is discussed between the Audit Committee and the Executive Board prior to publication. The consolidated financial statements and the financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0were audited by Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft, Hanover, the auditors elected by the\u00a02023\u00a0Annual General Meeting. The audit was based on German auditing rules, taking account of the generally accepted auditing standards issued by the German Auditors? Institute as well as the International Standards on Auditing. It also covered the risk detection system. A review pursuant to Listing Rule\u00a09.8.10\u00a0R (1) and (2) was carried out. See audit opinion by the auditors on page 288. The condensed consolidated interim financial statement and management report as of\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02023\u00a0was reviewed by the auditors. In addition, a contractual agreement was concluded with the auditors to the effect that the auditors will immediately inform the Supervisory Board or the Audit Committee about all findings and issues of importance for its tasks which come to the knowledge of the auditors during the performance of the audit. Furthermore, it was agreed with the auditors that they inform the Supervisory Board or the\u00a0Audit Committee and note in the audit report if during the performance of the audit, any facts were identified that indicate an inaccuracy in the Declaration of Compliance regarding the recommendations of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0issued by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. There were no grounds to provide such information in the framework of the audit of financial year\u00a02023. Engagement with our stakeholders Under the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is required to provide information on how it complies with the requirements of section\u00a0172\u00a0of the Companies Act\u00a02006, including how it takes into account the interests of key stakeholders in discussions and decisions. The Company considers key stakeholders to be customers, employees, shareholders and other financial stakeholders, suppliers and Non-governmental organisations. Further details on how the company engages with particular stakeholders can be found on the following pages of this Annual Report: Customers ? see page\u00a098  Employees ? see page\u00a091  Shareholders and other financial stakeholders ? see pages\u00a0113\u00a0and\u00a0188  Suppliers ? see page\u00a084  Non-governmental organisations ? see page\u00a090 Diversity concepts for the composition of the Executive Board and Supervisory Boards Diversity concept for the composition of the Executive Board The diversity concept for the composition of the Executive Board takes into account the following diversity aspects: (a) Age: As a rule, the employment contracts of members of the Executive Board end once the standard retirement age for statutory retirement insurance has been reached (currently\u00a067). (b) Gender: The Executive Board should include one woman. (c) Educational / professional background: The necessity for a variety of educational and professional backgrounds already arises from the obligation to manage the company in accordance with the law, the company?s articles of association and its terms of reference. In addition, the Executive Board as a whole, through its individual members, should possess the following essential background qualities: management experience, some of which ideally has been acquired abroad, and intercultural competence\u00a0for successful management and motivation of global teams;  in-depth practical experience in stakeholder dialogue (i. e. with managers and employees, including their representative bodies, with shareholders and the public);  experience in\u00a0IT\u00a0management and an understanding of digitalisation of vertically integrated value chains;  profound experience in value-driven,\u00a0KPI-based strategy development and implementation and corporate governance;  profound knowledge of the intricacies and requirements of the capital market (shareholder management);  knowledge of accounting and financial management (controlling, financing);  in-depth understanding of and experience with change management. Goals of the diversity concept for the composition of the Executive Board The standard retirement age on the one hand enables incumbent members of the Executive Board to contribute their professional and life experience for the good of the company for as long a time as possible. On the other hand, adherence to the standard retirement age is intended to promote regular rejuvenation of the board. Inclusion of both genders in Executive Board work is on the one hand an expression of the conviction of the\u00a0Supervisory Board that mixed-gender teams lead to the same or better outcomes as teams with representation from only one gender. But it is also the logical continuation of the gender diversity measures implemented\u00a0by the Executive Board within the wider company, which aim to increase the proportion of women in leadership\u00a0roles. These measures are only to be applied and implemented in a credible manner if the Executive Board does not consist solely of male members (?proof of concept?). A variety of professional and educational backgrounds is necessary on the one hand to properly address the tasks and obligations of the law, the company?s articles of association and its terms of reference. In addition, it is the view of the Supervisory Board that they are a guarantee of ensuring diverse perspectives on the challenges and associated approaches to overcoming them that are faced in the day-to-day work of the\u00a0company. International management experience is of particular importance. Without such skill and experience with integrating, leading and motivating global teams, it is impossible to take into consideration the different cultural backgrounds of managerial staff and the workforce as a whole. Long-term succession planning for the Executive Board A key aspect of applying the diversity concept to the composition of the Executive Board is inclusion of the\u00a0Supervisory Board within the corporate organisation, as is prescribed by law, the company?s articles of association and its terms of reference. This ensures the Supervisory Board is familiar with the strategic, economic and actual situation of the company. In its role as supervisor of the management of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0makes\u00a0decisions on the allocation of business responsibilities within the Executive Board, appointments to the Executive Board and thus also workforce and succession planning within the Executive Board in line with\u00a0recommendation B.2\u00a0of the\u00a0GCGC. As part of that workforce and succession planning, the Presiding Committee or the Supervisory Board itself regularly meets with the Executive Board or its members to discuss\u00a0suitable\u00a0internal succession candidates for Executive Board positions (short-term, medium-term and long-term scenarios). The contract terms and renewal options for current Executive Board members are discussed, as well as possible successors. As part of these Supervisory Board and Committee meetings, or in preparation for them, members of the Supervisory Board have the opportunity to meet up with so-called high potentials within the Group in a professional and personal setting. The Presiding Committee and Supervisory Board make their own deliberations about these matters and also discuss them in the absence of the Executive Board. This includes evaluation and possible inclusion of external candidates for Executive Board positions in the selection process. In all of these deliberations, the above-mentioned diversity aspects of Executive Board appointments play a part in the decision-making of the Supervisory Board. Long-term succession planning is primarily oriented towards the corporate strategy and takes into account the diversity concept\u00a0defined by the Supervisory Board. The Supervisory Board also asks the Executive Board to report on current progress and implementation of family-friendly concepts and concrete measures for promotion of women (e. g. at least one woman on the final shortlist for any new or replacement appointments to roles within the senior leadership team). Results achieved in financial year 2023 With effect from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022, Mr Sebastian Ebel was appointed to succeed Mr Friedrich Joussen as Chairman of the Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. In this connection, Mr Mathias Kiep was appointed as a member\u00a0of the Executive Board as successor to Mr Ebel with effect from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022. Mr Kiep took over the Finance Ressort. In the opinion of the Supervisory Board, Mr Ebel and Mr Kiep contribute to the diversity of\u00a0the Executive Board through their professional careers, their wide-ranging international experience and respective professional backgrounds. Mr Frank Rosenberger, Executive Board Member for\u00a0IT\u00a0and Future Markets, has decided to leave the Group on\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022. Mr Rosenberger had been with\u00a0TUI\u00a0since\u00a02015\u00a0and had been responsible for Future\u00a0Markets and the Group?s digitalisation on the company?s Executive Board since\u00a02017. Under his responsibility, a global system for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Tour operators was launched and the digitalisation of the company was significantly advanced. The reduction in the number of Executive Board members also required a reorganisation of responsibilities in the management team. The\u00a0CIO\u00a0with his central\u00a0IT\u00a0functions of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has been located in the direct area of responsibility of\u00a0CEO\u00a0Sebastian Ebel. The other\u00a0IT\u00a0units are interlinked with the operational\u00a0areas to enable fast and efficient implementation of the digitalisation strategy. Peter Krueger is fully responsible for the Holiday Experiences segment at Executive Board level. The current composition of the Executive Board meets all the requirements of the diversity concept. The Executive Board members cover a comprehensive range of knowledge and experience as well as educational and professional backgrounds and have international experience. In addition, with Ms Sybille Reiss as a member of the Executive Board, the legal requirement that at least one woman should be a member of the Executive Board was met in the reporting period. Different age groups are represented on the Executive Board. More information on all members of the Executive Board can be found in the\u00a0CVs on the Company?s website and in the communication on the occasion of the appointment decisions of the Supervisory Board. Diversity concept for the composition of the Supervisory Board The Supervisory Board revised and updated objectives for its composition in addition to the competence profile in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year. In accordance with the applicable legal requirements, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shall be composed in such a way that its members as a whole have the knowledge and professional experience required to properly perform their duties. In this context, sufficient diversity shall be ensured. This includes in particular cultural and ethnic origin, gender, nationality and professional and life experience as well as age. A gender quota of\u00a030\u00a0% is to be guaranteed. The standard age limit for election to the Supervisory Board is\u00a068\u00a0years. Goals of the diversity concept for the composition of the Supervisory Board The goals set with regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board reflect the demands placed on the\u00a0advisory and supervisory body to perform its task in a globally operating company with a challenging competitive environment. For example, multicultural and international experience is just as important as knowledge of the value and success drivers of the sector. In all of this, the impact and cultural features of the so-called stakeholder approach of a social market economy must be taken into account, which is ensured by the codetermination of employee representatives on the Supervisory Board as well. For the shareholder\u00a0side on the Supervisory Board, the Nomination Committee also ensures that mandatory and voluntary targets are met with regard to the composition of the Supervisory Board. As part of the regularly conducted efficiency reviews, the Supervisory Board also undergoes a self-assessment, which includes aspects of its composition. Results achieved in financial year 2023 The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that it meets the composition targets and fills out the competence profile and the diversity concept. The status of implementation of the competence profile and composition targets has been published in the form of a qualification matrix. The competence profile of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board is published at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance/management\">www.tuigroup.com/en-en/investors/corporate-governance/management</url>. The qualification matrix can be found at page\u00a0126. The diversity of professional and educational backgrounds of the individual members of the board is also evident from the\u00a0CVs of Supervisory Board members published on the corporate website. Diversity in the Executive Board and Supervisory Board as well as in the Executive Management of TUI\u00a0AG Pursuant to\u00a0LR\u00a09.8.6\u00a0R (9) of the\u00a0FCA\u00a0Listing Rules, the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board confirm that, as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, the Company has partially met the targets set out in this provision by at least\u00a040\u00a0% of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board were women and at least one member of the Executive Board or the Supervisory Board was from an ethnic minority. The Company did not meet the target in relation to the requirement that at least one of the named executive positions (the Chairman of the Supervisory Board, the Chief Executive Officer, the Senior Independent Director or the Chief Financial Officer) should be held by a woman. The Company recognises the importance of diversity and its long-term goal is to further improve diversity on its boards. This is taken into account primarily in the context of succession planning for the boards. Since\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, there have been no changes in the Executive Board as well as the Supervisory Board that would affect the company?s ability to achieve the two objectives mentioned above. Data on gender and ethnicity was collected directly from board members. Members were asked to indicate their ethnicity using the categories in the table below. In accordance with\u00a0LR\u00a09.8.6\u00a0R (10) of the\u00a0FCA\u00a0Listing Rules, the following table contains data on the ethnic\u00a0origin and gender of the members of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board as well as the Executive Management of the Company as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_73\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gender and ethnic background of board members</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Number of board members</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Percentage of the board</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Number of senior positions on the board (CEO,\u00a0CFO,\u00a0SID\u00a0and Chair)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Number in executive management</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Percentage of executive management</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gender</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Men</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">60\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">7</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">100\u00a0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Women</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">40\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0\u00a0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Not specified / prefer not to say</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Ethnic Background</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">White British or other White(including minority-white groups)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">96\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">7</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">100\u00a0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mixed / Multiple Ethnic Groups</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Asian / Asian British</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Black / African / Caribbean / Black British</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other ethnic group, including Arab</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Not specified / prefer not to say</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description of the main features of the internal control and risk management system TUI\u00a0Group?s internal control system comprises all systematically designed rules within the Group that serve to methodically manage operational, financial and compliance-related risks. These rules may result from published statements or take the form of policies, work instructions, process descriptions or risk control matrices. A Group-wide framework is in place for the creation, approval, revision and communication of\u00a0these rules. With its Integrity Passport,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group commits to implementing its Group-wide Code of Conduct that sets minimum standards and provides guidance on how to deal with ethical and legal challenges in day-to-day work, and provides orientation for conflict situations. On that basis, the business units define an appropriate framework of processes and rules where necessary for the criticality of the process in question. These rules may vary from business unit to business unit as the process of processing the transactions involves different systems, workflows or volumes. For certain risks,\u00a0addressed through a uniform Group framework,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has established central functions, operating as a ?second\u00a0line? for their area, in order to create appropriate Group-wide standards and support or monitor implementation of these standards. A Group function has also been established for the area of sustainability. For years,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has collected\u00a0certain sustainability-related indicators for management and reporting purposes in the framework of separate sustainability reports or the non-financial statement. The methodologies used to gather this data have been published. These ensure uniform understanding and collection throughout the Group. In the period under review, a reporting software specifically designed for non-financial data points was implemented, further enhancing the maturity of the internal control system in this field. To ensure that our businesses are scalable, almost all business processes are supported by\u00a0IT\u00a0solutions. Where possible and appropriate, we use the controls integrated in these applications or services. This offers\u00a0greater security and efficiency in implementation compared with manual controls. The\u00a0IT\u00a0solutions themselves are protected by a Group-wide framework of general\u00a0IT\u00a0controls. The internal control system is completed by a set of manual process controls to prevent or detect errors. We have a clear approach for identifying and mitigating information security risks.\u00a0TUI\u00a0undergoes external auditing, has an\u00a0IT\u00a0security risk insurance policy in place and provides a training and compliance programme. Additionally, the Audit Committee is updated on\u00a0TUI?s risk position on a regular basis. In the case of business processes, the respective process owners are responsible for the effectiveness of the\u00a0controls put in place; in the case of Group-wide control frameworks, the respective second line is responsible. Depending on the risk assessment, they use a different degree of monitoring intensity. As an independent third line, Internal Audit reviews business processes, including\u00a0IT\u00a0solutions, according to\u00a0its own risk assessment and provides recommendations to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of processes and controls. The Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, in particular the Audit Committee, is involved in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s internal monitoring system with process-independent auditing activities. Our Risk Report presents the key elements of our risk management system. Details in our Risk Report, page 35. The internal control system and the risk management system are dynamic systems that are continuously adapted in response to changes in the business model, the nature and scope of business transactions or responsibilities. As a result, there is potential for improvement in terms of both the appropriateness (lack of suitable controls) and the effectiveness (inadequate execution) of controls, both from the reviews carried out by the second line, from internal audit engagements, and from the audit activities of the external auditor. In addition, potential for improvement may also arise from compliance incidents. In our overall assessment of these management systems, we find that none of the potential improvements identified in the period\u00a0under review speak against the appropriateness and effectiveness of the two management systems. However, there can be no absolute certainty, despite the internal control and risk management systems in\u00a0place, that the controls will detect every single process weakness or, in particular, that newly emerging\u00a0material risks will always be immediately identified and effectively addressed. Disclosure pursuant to\u00a0UK\u00a0Listing Rule\u00a0LR\u00a09.8.6Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time.\u00a0TUI\u00a0recognises the risk posed to its business by climate change from both physical changes in the climate and the transition to a low-carbon economy.\u00a0TUI\u00a0is committed to contributing to the transition and mitigating climate-related risks for its business. As a company listed in the Premium Segment of the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange,\u00a0TUI\u00a0is required pursuant to Listing Rule\u00a0LR\u00a09.8.6\u00a0to make disclosures in relation to the Recommendations of the Financial\u00a0Stability Board?s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The\u00a0TCFD\u00a0provides a framework to improve the disclosure of consistent, comparable, reliable and clear climate-related financial information so that investors can make better capital allocation decisions in support of the transition to a low-carbon economy. In financial year\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0aligned its climate-related disclosures with the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0Recommendations for the first time to communicate the potential effects of climate change on its business. The disclosure for financial\u00a0year\u00a02023\u00a0builds on our prior year disclosure and has been enhanced to better align with the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0Recommendations. We are committed to complying with the recommendations and recommended disclosures of the\u00a0TCFD, taking into account the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0All Sector Guidance, and we consider the disclosures set out on the following pages to be consistent with these guidelines. In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0conducted a climate scenario analysis to identify and analyse the potential impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on its business model, and assess the resilience of its strategy (TCFD\u00a0Recommendations: Strategy a., b. and c.).  In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0embedded the identification, assessment and management of material individual\u00a0climate-related risks into existing risk management processes (TCFD\u00a0Recommendations: Risk Management a., b. and c.).  In\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI?s near-term science-based emissions reduction targets were published following the successful external validation by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).

The tourism industry in which\u00a0TUI\u00a0operates faces significant impacts from climate change. As temperatures rise, the attractiveness of certain destinations will decline,\u00a0and the biodiversity loss will make certain destinations less attractive. The sector also faces impacts of a more general\u00a0nature: more cancellations from extreme weather-related events, increased risk of stranded assets, as well as changes in policy and customer preferences. Climate change also presents an opportunity for\u00a0TUI\u00a0? besides extending touristic\u00a0seasons in summer destinations also to innovate in new types of tourism, to diversify to new regions, and to engage customers and other stakeholders along the business transformation process.    As part of our strategic and financial planning process, we have analysed various industry and macro trends to model the expected development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0and the tourism industry as a whole. We clearly see sustainability as a major trend, largely driven by climate-related market and policy risks (e. g., changing customer behavior, emissions-based taxes and fees, and increasing regulations for aircraft and cruise ships). In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0?s\u00a02030\u00a0emission reduction targets have been approved by the\u00a0SBTi. Priorities and strategic directions from\u00a0TUI?s Sustainability Agenda ?People, Planet, Progress? take into account current challenges, global scenarios, and regulatory developments such as the\u00a0EU\u00a0Green Deal. These priorities were built into our midterm strategic and financial plan. To better identify and assess the impact of climate change on our financial performance and business model, we have conducted a qualitative and quantitative climate risk assessment for the first time in financial year\u00a02023.    Two scenarios were considered in the climate risk assessment:    A high emissions scenario to assess the impact of significant changes in the physical climate, which is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway\u00a08.5\u00a0(IPCC RCP8.5) and the\u00a0International Energy Agency (IEA) Stated Policies Scenario. This is aligned with global warming of approximately\u00a04.3\u00b0C\u00a0by the year\u00a02100.     A low emissions scenario to assess the impact of significant socioeconomic changes to achieve a low-carbon economy, which is based on IPCC RCP2.6\u00a0and the IEA Net Zero Scenario. This is aligned with global warming of approximately\u00a01.5\u00b0C by the year\u00a02100.    A number of assumptions underpin these scenarios regarding changes to the frequency and intensity of weather-related events, economic growth, technology development, and the development of energy and carbon prices.    The identified risks and opportunities across the different combinations of scenarios and time horizons were first assessed qualitatively to identify the most relevant climate-related risks and opportunities for\u00a0TUI. Based on the results of this qualitative analysis, a number of risks and opportunities were then subject to more detailed analysis to better understand the potential financial impacts.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_77\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">STRATEGY</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organisation has identified over the short, medium, and long term.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">The following climate-related risks and opportunities have been identified by\u00a0TUI\u00a0over the short, medium and long term, where short term is defined as the period up to\u00a02030\u00a0(aligned with\u00a0TUI?s science-based targets), medium term as the period up to\u00a02040, and long term as the period up to\u00a02050\u00a0(when\u00a0TUI\u00a0aims to achieve net-zero emissions across our operations and supply chain). Climate-related impacts are divided into two categories:    Transition: Socioeconomic changes related to the transition to a low-carbon economy including policy, legal, technology and market changes.     Physical: Physical changes in the climate including event-driven (acute) changes such as storms, fires and floods, and long term (chronic) changes such as increased temperature.    Given the nature of\u00a0TUI?s business model, most of the below listed risks and opportunities apply to\u00a0TUIs business segments and geographies. Modest variations in their significance for each segment are described below.    TUI\u00a0has undertaken a qualitative assessment of all below summarized climated related risks and opportunities. In additon,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has performed a high-level quantitative assessment for eight risks and opportunities. This assessment has shown the risks to be immaterial for financial planning, which was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis.

There is a risk for\u00a0TUI?s airline and cruise operations of stricter regulations and restrictions related to energy and emissions in the short to medium term. Already today, there are operating restrictions at certain airports based on sustainability criteria. and the ban of non-sustainable fuel types while sailing in certain maritime areas.</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">TUI is committed to decarbonising its business, and has set ambitious near-term science-based emissions reduction targets validated by the SBTi.     To achieve these, TUI airlines procures state-of-the-art aircraft, implements operational efficiencies (including route optimisation), and will increase the use of SAF. TUI already has cooperation agreements in place to promote the production and supply of SAF.     TUI\u00a0Cruises invests in energy efficiency at ship operations, fuel-saving route optimisation, shore power in ports and alternative fuels, such as sustainable biofuels, bio-LNG and green methanol. The three newbuilds coming into the fleet by\u00a02026\u00a0will not use heavy fuel oil. Mein Schiff\u00a07\u00a0will enter service in\u00a02024\u00a0and will run on lower-emission marine diesel and be equipped with catalytic converters and a shore power connection. In addition, the ship will also be able to run on green methanol in the future. In\u00a02024\u00a0and\u00a02026, two ships will follow, which will be operated with LNG. LNG serves as a bridge technology until bio-LNG\u00a0is available, which will be produced either from biogenic\u00a0sources or synthetically from renewable energy.     TUI Hotels &amp; Resorts is focused on renewable energy and resource-saving operational practices to reduce hotel emissions as far as possible.</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Technology</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Costly or unavailable future fuels and technologies resulting in higher costs, or preventing further decarbonisation and compliance with regulations.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Although it is expected that future fuels will continue to gain momentum and that production capacity will dramatically increase in the short to medium term, there is a risk that demand will outpace supply resulting in low availability and inflated prices.    In the medium term, there is a risk that low carbon technologies are not available to support\u00a0TUI?s path to net zero. Whilst there are trials e. g., in battery or fuel cell aircraft and ships, such technology might not be developed to a market stage.</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_79\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TCFD Risk Type</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Impact</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Management</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Market</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Decline of travellers due to shifts in consumer preferences and behaviour, and increasing negative public sentiment towards travel, resulting in lossof revenue.    Decline of overall customer demand as the price forour products will increase to reflect higher capital expenditures and operational expenses to offer carbon low products.    Difficulties in obtaining access to financing and increasing cost of capital due to the inability to reduce emissions in line with market expectations.</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Market trends show tourism growth outstripping global\u00a0GDP\u00a0growth as it has for the last two decades, and customers prioritising spend on leisure tourism over other large purchases such as cars and houses. Nevertheless, there is a risk in the medium to long term that\u00a0customers decide to travel less (or differently, for example\u00a0moving away from air travel) for environmental reasons.    TUI\u00a0as a market leader in Europe has significantly contributed to make leisure travel an affordable product for people with lower disposable income, e. g. families, retired persons, etc. Significant price increases for leisure product poses the risk that in the medium to long term such consumer group will not be able to afford our leisure travel products any more.    Increasingly policies and laws are being introduced that combat climate change, and institutional investors increasingly consider\u00a0ESG\u00a0to be part of their fiduciary duties. These investors might be more inclined to divest from\u00a0TUI\u00a0if the company does not take sufficient action on\u00a0ESG\u00a0issues in the medium and long term.</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">Managing both market and reputational risks depends on the successful implementation of our emissions reduction initiatives. Accordingly, we have roadmaps in place to deliver on our science-based targets.     Whilst the cost for flights is very likely to increase, all markets participants have to roll-over this ?green inflation?. With our state-of the art efficienct fleet, it is likely that our cost increase is competitive. Further, the share of extra cost from low-carbon flying is lower in a package and hence we believe that we can effectively transfer cost additions.     TUI\u00a0has set science-based emissions reduction targets for\u00a02030\u00a0and a net zero target for\u00a02050. TUI continues\u00a0to notice a wide range of financiers due to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s financial performance and is continuing to develop relationships with new sources of finance and monitor development of the market. TUI is in a continuing education process with lessors and the financial community to maintain confidence in the strategy.    \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_80\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TCFD Risk Type</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Impact</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">Management</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Reputation</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Failure to meet decarbonisation targets, negatively affecting\u00a0TUI?s reputation with stakeholders.</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">There may be a reputational risk due to increased negative public sentiment on climate change if\u00a0TUI\u00a0is unable to meet its decarbonisation targets.

We further see an opportunity to offer lower-emission air travel, cruise travel and hotel stays as a way to improve our competitive position. Providing alternative modes of transport including a move to high-speed rail is also seen as an opportunity for our business. We are investigating and promoting the management of all of these opportunities.    The summer season\u00a02023\u00a0in Turkey and Greece for selected destinations has been expanded which has been well received by our customers.In the long term, we expect to see this more frequently and in more destinations following a shift in consumer preferences from peak seasons where heat waves may be imminent to shoulder seasons where the wheather is still very favoiurable for travel. In addition, our business model is flexible to offer new destinations based on changing weather conditions, e. g. more travel to destinations around the Baltic Sea. We continue to monitor these trends and embed them into our strategic and operational planning.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">c) Describe the resilience of the organisation?s strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a\u00a02\u00b0C or lower scenario.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In financial year\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0conducted a qualitative and quantitative scenario analysis in order to understand the potential effects of climate change on its business and to test its strategy and financial planning to increase resilience. A number of assumptions underpin this assessment\u00a0regarding changes to the intensity and frequency of weather related events, technology development, development of energy and carbon prices and the development of knowledge on global warming.    Two scenarios were considered in the\u00a02023\u00a0climate risk assessment:    A high emissions scenario to assess the impact of significant changes in the physical climate, which is based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathway\u00a08.5\u00a0(IPCC RCP8.5) and the International Energy Agency (IEA) Stated Policies Scenario. This is aligned with global warming of approximately\u00a04.3\u00b0C by the year\u00a02100.     A low emissions scenario to assess the impact of significant socioeconomic changes to achieve a low-carbon economy, which is based on IPCC RCP2.6\u00a0and the IEA Net Zero Scenario. This is aligned with global warming of approximately\u00a01.5\u00b0C by the year\u00a02100.     Both emissions scenarios could have different consequences for the TUI Group. In a low emissions scenario, stricter emissions and fuel efficiency targets could increase operating costs, while assets based on unsustainable practices could lose value. On the other hand, TUI could benefit from a positive image, as environmentally conscious travellers prefer companies that are committed to sustainability. In a high emissions scenario, physical risks from extreme weather events and natural disasters could impact TUI?s tourism destinations. Rising operating costs due to stricter environmental regulations could impact profitability.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_83\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Strategy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Measures to strengthen and more closely align risk management and strategic planning were identified and discussed.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce emissions by\u00a02030. Our targets are:    Reduction of airline CO2e per revenue passenger kilometer by\u00a024\u00a0% by\u00a02030.     Reduction of absolute CO2e from our cruise operations by\u00a027.5\u00a0% by\u00a02030.     Reduction of absolute CO2e from TUI Hotels &amp; Resorts by\u00a046.2\u00a0% by\u00a02030.    Furthermore it is the commitment of\u00a0TUI\u00a0to achieve net-zero emissions by\u00a02050. The reduction of emissions will be accomplished with investments in new technologies and the use of fuel with less\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions.    The results of the scenario analysis confirm that the Group?s above described strategic initiatives and reduction pathway are suitable for minimising the respective risks and creating opportunities. We acknowledge that a number of assumptions descibed above had to be taken into account to derive the scenario analysis and the uncertainty of the impact and likelihood of certain effects increases mid- to long term.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has undertaken a qualitative assessment of all below summarized climated related risks and opportunities. In additon,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has performed a\u00a0high-level quantitative assessment for eight risks and opportunities. This assessment has shown the risks to be immaterial for financial planning, which was confirmed by a sensitivity analysis. One key assumption concerns the extent to which costs for low-emission fuels and emission certificates can be passed on to customers.

For further details on the risk management process please refer to page\u00a035\u00a0in the Risk Report.    Whilst the impact of some risks is medium to long term, the Group Risk Management time horizon is short to medium, covering the economic lifetime of an investment at a maximum. The climate change risk assessment has also highlighted risks and opportunities where the impact falls beyond the risk management time horizon. Nevertheless, all major climate-related risks and opportunities from this assessment will be covered by the Group?s Risk Management process and will be managed. Where the impact of risks or chances detected in the assessment is in far future, they will be continuously monitored. Moreover, we see additional value in early identification to ensure risks are managed effectively and opportunities are capitalised on.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_86\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">METRICS AND TARGETS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">a) Metrics used by\u00a0TUI\u00a0to assess climate related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Climate change is a pressing global challenge. There is an urgency to act and for everyone to play a role in the transition to a low carbon economy. As a global tourism group, our business model inherently leads to a significant emission of greenhouse gases. In alignment with our reduction strategy, low emissions are the cornerstone for our pathway. This is reflected in our currently used metrics to assess climate related risks and opportunities.\u00a0TUI\u00a0is continuously working on improving its metrics and targets to ensuring an effective steering of the most material climate related risks and opportunities. Following the larger scale use of\u00a0SAF, we will further develop our metrics to reflect the impact on\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions. Emissions from\u00a0TUI?s airline, cruises and hotel segments represent\u00a099\u00a0% of the Group?s emissions. Within our asset portfolio our airline emissions represent roughly\u00a075\u00a0% of the Group?s total carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We are working to reduce the environmental footprint of holidays and drive-up environmental standards in our industry. In order to measure and manage climate-related risks and in line with our strategic target to achieve net-zero emissions across our operations and supply chain by\u00a02050\u00a0at the latest, we monitor our absolute\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions, (specific) fuel consumption and specific carbon emissions.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has considered the cross-sector risks Following the larger scale use of\u00a0SAF, we will further develop our metrics to reflect the impact on\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions.\u00a0TUI\u00a0currently does not have an internal carbon pricing mechanism.

Our airline emissions reduction targets by\u00a02030\u00a0have been validated by the\u00a0SBTi. Our emission reduction roadmap for our aircraft fleet comprises the\u00a0following measures: additional capex on modern carbon-efficient aircraft, efficiency enhancement through operational measures and investments in sustainable aircraft fuels (SAF).    In order to reduce emissions,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has invested in state-of-the-art aircraft such as Boeing\u00a0787s and Boeing\u00a0737\u00a0Max aircraft. On average, these planes are\u00a020\u00a0% (787) and\u00a016\u00a0% (737\u00a0Max) more fuel-efficient than the aircraft they replace in\u00a0TUI?s fleet.    Moreover,\u00a0TUI\u00a0fly Belgium added Embraer E195-E2\u00a0aircraft, highly efficient planes in the category of up to\u00a0150\u00a0seats, to its fleet. The aircraft will operate on short- and medium-haul routes and reduce the carbon footprint by up to one third.    Environmental management systems and operational measures play a key role in implementing sustainability and further enhancing\u00a0TUI?s climate efficiency. In financial year\u00a02023, all\u00a0TUI\u00a0airlines were certified under the internationally recognised\u00a0ISO\u00a014001:2015\u00a0standard. All\u00a0ISO\u00a014001\u00a0management systems used by individual\u00a0TUI\u00a0airlines were transferred to one single management system in the period under review. The following examples illustrate the operational measures implemented to enhance efficiency:    Flight operations, for instance single engine taxiing in and out, wind uplinks and optimised climb speeds and profiles     Weight reduction, for instance carbon brakes and fly away kit (spare parts and tools)     Fight planning optimisation, for instance alternate distance and minimum fuel programme     Fuel management system to improve fuel analysis, identification of further savings potential and tracking of savings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_92\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"456\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">METRICS AND TARGETS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) play a crucial role in reducing aviation emissions and are hence a key part of our emission reduction roadmap to further improve airline carbon efficiency by\u00a02030.\u00a0TUI\u00a0cooperates with a number of partners to secure supplies of\u00a0SAF. Examples include the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Spanish energy company\u00a0CEPSA. The partnership with\u00a0CEPSA\u00a0will focus on\u00a0SAF\u00a0fuels generated from raw materials such as used cooking oils, non-food animal waste and biodegradable waste from various industries. This will make it possible to reduce aircraft emissions by up to\u00a080\u00a0% compared to conventional jet fuel. An additional Memorandum of Understanding was signed with Shell.    In\u00a02023, relative carbon emissions across our airlines decreased by\u00a03.9\u00a0%. This improvement was largely due to higher load factors versus\u00a02022\u00a0and our ongoing re-fleeting programme to replace older aircraft by new, more carbon-efficient aircraft.    Specific emissions are additionally shown in the form of\u00a0CO2\u00a0equivalents (CO2e).

Emission reduction roadmaps were drawn up for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises, Hapag-Lloyd Cruises and Marella Cruises as part of our submission of\u00a02030\u00a0targets for validation by the\u00a0SBTi. Key levers include investments in fleet modernisation and efficiency enhancement with a focus on shore power, route optimisation, energy efficiency enhancement and switching to alternative fuels.    TUI\u00a0Cruises with its Mein Schiff and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises brands continues to operate a modern and technologically advanced fleet. The newbuilds in the fleet are equipped with state-of-the-art technologies to minimise fuel consumption. A smart energy management system, efficient air conditioning, innovative lighting controls and the use of exhaust heat from the engines contribute to a significant reduction in the carbon footprint compared with vessels not equipped with those technologies.    In the period under review, essential steps were taken to reduce emissions generated by the Mein Schiff and Hapag-Lloyd Cruises fleet. The Company will successively install the equipment required for shore power connection on all ships of the Mein Schiff fleet. In the period under review, Mein Schiff\u00a01\u00a0was retrofitted during her scheduled dock period. Mein Schiff\u00a02\u00a0and Mein Schiff\u00a05\u00a0will follow in November\u00a02023\u00a0and in January\u00a02024.    In summer\u00a02023, both fleets successfully used shore power, e. g. in Kiel and Hamburg. During their scheduled dock periods, both ships, Mein Schiff\u00a01\u00a0and Mein Schiff\u00a06, also obtained a new silicone coating to reduce resistance in the water so as to save fuel during the voyage.    In the period under review, the Company also successfully completed the first tests on the use of sustainable biofuels, with both Hanseatic Inspiration and Mein Schiff\u00a04\u00a0successfully operating on biofuel blends on some voyages. The second-generation biofuel, which was bunkered for the first time, is purely plant-based and mainly consists of cooking oil residues. This fuel is virtually free from sulphur oxides and in its pure form offers a\u00a0CO2\u00a0reduction of up to\u00a090\u00a0% compared to fossil fuels.    Thanks to new exhaust gas treatment systems operated on all new vessels, the newbuilds in the Mein Schiff fleet also significantly reduce their sulphur and nitrogen emissions. Use of these advanced emission purification systems goes beyond regulatory requirements. They are, for instance, not only used in the designated emission control areas in the North and Baltic Seas, the English Channel and North America, but also in other regions sailed by Mein Schiff such as the Mediterranean, the Orient, the Caribbean and Central America.    The Mein Schiff fleet is also setting another milestone for sustainable growth. Mein Schiff\u00a07\u00a0is currently under construction in the Meyer Turku shipyard in Finland. The focus is on compliance with high maritime environmental standards by optimising the design in terms of energy efficiency and the use of modern technologies to improve sustainability. The ship will feature equipment enabling her to run on green methanol in future. She is scheduled for commissioning in\u00a02024.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_96\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"456\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">METRICS AND TARGETS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TCFD Recommendation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">TUI Approach</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">The expedition ships in the Hapag-Lloyd Cruises fleet exclusively use low-sulphur marine gas oil with a sulphur content of\u00a00.1\u00a0%. This reduces sulphur emissions from these vessels by up to\u00a080\u00a0% and particulate and soot emissions by up to\u00a030\u00a0% versus the use of heavy fuel oil. All Hapag-Lloyd Cruises ships have tributyltin-free underwater coatings, on-board seawater desalination systems to make drinking water and biological sewage treatment systems for wastewater. Waste is separated on board prior to disposal on land by specialised companies in accordance with international regulations (MARPOL).    In financial year\u00a02023, relative\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions in the Cruises segment declined by\u00a023.7\u00a0%. This was due to a significant increase in load factors, as the previous year?s figures were more strongly impacted by the effects of the pandemic. The amount of waste per cruise passenger night decreased by\u00a023\u00a0% to\u00a08\u00a0litres, with freshwater consumption up by\u00a024.2\u00a0% to\u00a046\u00a0litres.

Each hotel plays an important role in managing the impacts on the local community, the economy and the environment. Emission reductions remain our key priority, and we have prepared comprehensive roadmaps and defined targets for\u00a02030\u00a0for our Hotels &amp; Resorts segment. These targets have been validated by the\u00a0SBTi.    Our hotel portfolio is still growing and many of our hotels use green technology in order to improve their sustainability performance. The generation of renewable energies from solar and wind power is a key element of the emission reduction roadmaps for our hotels, alongside efficiency measures delivered through hotel refurbishment and standard-setting for new buildings.    Sustainable construction is an important tool for saving energy and cutting carbon emissions from hotels. In the financial year under review, the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment published Green Building Guidelines for the first time. They provide specific recommendations to our own hotels and to our hotel partners for their construction and refurbishment projects. The Guidelines cover the key factors for reducing the ecological\u00a0footprint of construction and refurbishment projects and paring back water and energy consumption. They also cover aspects such as\u00a0monitoring systems, sustainability certifications and stakeholder communication. The Guidelines were reviewed by external experts from the\u00a0Fraunhofer\u00a0IAO\u00a0Institute.

The award included categories reflecting\u00a0TUI?s Sustainability Agenda. The winners in these categories are selected by an external committee based on pre-defined criteria. In\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0also granted an award for sustainability innovation. Atlantica Hotels &amp; Resorts was recognised for introducing new, sustainable technologies. Examples of this commitment can be found on the Greek island of Rhodes, where the hotel company has invested in the latest solar panel technology, e-mobility for electric cars and a water desalination plant.    We continued to drive forward the use of photovoltaic systems in our hotels to promote sustainable power generation. In cooperation with our joint venture partners Riu, Grupotel and Atlantica,\u00a019\u00a0PV\u00a0systems with an output of almost\u00a03,500\u00a0kWp were installed in Greece, Spain and the Cape Verde Islands in financial year\u00a02023.    Our hotels made further inroads towards a better ecological footprint in terms of emissions, water consumption and waste production. Thisis the result of continual measures to improve our environmental performance alongside higher customer numbers and occupancy levels asthe pandemic subsided. The scope of the hotel\u00a0KPI-reporting is made up of\u00a0TUI?s Hotels &amp; Resorts portfolio. This includes owned, managed, leased and franchised properties.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_99\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hotels ?

The independent organisation has now checked and validated our reduction targets. It confirmed that they are in line with the latest climate science. Our intensity and absolute targets are:    Reduction of airline gCO2e per revenue passenger kilometer by\u00a024\u00a0% by\u00a02030\u00a01,\u00a03     Reduction of absolute tCO2e from our own cruise operations by\u00a027.5\u00a0% by\u00a02030\u00a01,\u00a03     Reduction of absolute tCO2e from TUI Hotels &amp; Resorts own operations by\u00a046.2\u00a0% by\u00a02030\u00a02,\u00a03    1\u00a0Baseline 2019. Level of ambition well below 2 \u00b0C.\u00a0CO2e =\u00a0CO2\u00a0equivalents. Apart from carbon dioxide (CO2\u00a0), emissions include the other five greenhouse gases impacting the climate as listed in the Kyoto Protocol: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydro-fluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs)and Sulphur hexafluoride (SF6).\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s science-based targets commitments include well-to-wake emissions for our airline and cruise operations (emissions from aviation and marine fuel, scope 1 and scope 3, category 3).    2\u00a0Baseline 2019. Level of ambition 1.5 \u00b0C. For our hotels, the commitment includes emissions from all energy sources plus refrigerant gases (scope 1 and 2).    3\u00a0Airline, cruise and hotel\u00a0GHG\u00a0emissions figures published in the\u00a0FY23 Non-Financial Declaration do not match the scope, boundaries or reporting methodology of our science-based targets. Therefore inferences of progress towards achieving\u00a0SBTs based on figures in this or previous Non-Financial Declarations should not be made.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Integrity &amp; Compliance Anti-corruption and bribery In implementing our business activities, and along our supply chain, compliance with many national and international laws and rules as well as internal policies is essential. However, our understanding of Compliance\u00a0goes beyond respecting laws and regulations, as we shift our Company?s culture away from a purely rule-based approach towards a living culture of integrity. Behaviour violating integrity principles may not only have legal consequences, but can also result in lasting damage to\u00a0TUI?s reputation.\u00a0TUI?s Compliance Management System aims to promote integrity and prevent potential misconduct, to make liability risks manageable for\u00a0TUI\u00a0and its employees and in this way to protect the Company?s reputation. It is a fundamental component in our commitment to corporate, environmental and social responsibility. In the completed financial year, Integrity &amp; Compliance focused on the core areas of, implementation of the new legal requirements set out in the German Act on Corporate Due Diligence Obligations in Supply Chains and the German Whistleblower Protection Act, training and risk analysis. In the financial year under review, mandatory online training courses were provided on the Integrity Passport\u00a0(for all employees) and Fair Competition (for all employees in Finance, Legal, Purchasing, Procurement, Corporate &amp; External Affairs and Aviation). For selected groups of employees, in-person training sessions\u00a0with an anti-trust law expert were carried out to facilitate more in-depth discussions of specific legal questions with employees. As sanctions have remained an important topic, an online training session on sanctions was rolled out by the end of the financial year. In order to comply with the obligations arising from the German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and Whistleblower Protection Act, the whistleblowing system was opened up to third parties to provide an additional\u00a0channel for raising concerns confidentially and anonymously. The rules of procedure are available on\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s website. In addition, the Integrity &amp; Compliance team, in collaboration with other relevant stakeholders, has drafted contractual clauses to reflect the obligations set out in the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act with regard to human rights and environmental matters, and, where appropriate, to pass on these obligations to business partners and suppliers. Furthermore, a pilot risk analysis was implemented for selected\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group companies in the completed financial year. The risk assessment was carried out by means of a revised survey and a newly developed weighted assessment matrix which automatically calculates the risk score for each region / segment. Compliance Management System TUI\u00a0Group?s Compliance Management System is based on a risk management approach. It is built around three pillars: prevent, detect and react, which, in turn, comprise a variety of measures and processes. The Integrity &amp; Compliance team is in charge of the core areas anti-corruption, fair competition and trade\u00a0sanctions. Our Compliance Management System defines pilot and standard operation and the documentation of roles, responsibilities and processes in these areas. The Compliance Management System applies to\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and all companies majority-owned, directly or\u00a0indirectly, by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, whether domestic or foreign, and to any other shareholdings where management control directly or indirectly lies with\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(?Managed Group Companies?). Implementation of the Compliance Management System is recommended for companies where management control does not lie with\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0(?Non-Managed Group Companies?). Integrity &amp; Compliance structure The Chief Compliance Officer is responsible for drawing up, maintaining and developing our Compliance Management System. He is supported by the Group Director Integrity &amp; Compliance and the centralised Integrity &amp; Compliance team, forming part of Legal. All Compliance Officers are in close contact with local management, who remain generally responsible for observing all the Compliance rules, and together they are responsible for implementing our Compliance requirements and Integrity values, above all: Raising awareness of Integrity &amp; Compliance and the associated core issues through communication campaigns  Performing risk analyses relating to the core Compliance issues and self-assessments or Pulse Checks  Implementing measures to ensure that we comply with our commitment to integrity in line with the Integrity Passport  Providing training on the Integrity Passport and Fair Competition  Advising employees, primarily with regard to trade sanctions, anti-corruption &amp; anti-bribery and fair competition  Securing the necessary exchange of information between local management and the Integrity &amp; Compliance team  Monitoring new national and international legislation  Providing regular reports to the Group Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee of the Supervisory Board Integrity &amp; Compliance culture The Integrity &amp; Compliance culture influences people?s behaviour and their views about complying with the applicable rules. It therefore forms the basis for an effective Compliance Management System. Our culture reflects our corporate values and the fundamental attitude and conduct of management all the way up to\u00a0the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, thus the ?tone from the top?. It is expressed, in particular, in our corporate value ?Trusted?, appealing to our employees? personal responsibility and their honesty and sincerity in handling guests, fellow employees and other stakeholders. Integrity Passport ? TUI?s Code of Conduct Our Integrity Passport is binding for all employees, from Executive Board members to trainees, and for all managed Group companies. The Integrity Passport serves as the guiding principle for our Executive Board, managements, executives and employees alike. It provides orientation in key areas of people?s day-to-day\u00a0work and in conflict situations: fair competition, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, appropriate gifts and hospitality, protection of our business secrets, data privacy, handling conflicts of interest, prevention of insider trading, maintaining proper accounts and financial records, anti-money laundering, trade restrictions, respectful dealings with each other, sustainability, and public communications about\u00a0TUI\u00a0and how to raise a concern. Suppliers? Code of Conduct The Integrity Passport is complemented by the Suppliers? Code of Conduct, which details\u00a0TUI?s ethical, social and legal expectations of its business partners. Moreover, all business partners are required by contract to\u00a0observe all national and international anti-corruption laws applicable to the supplier relationship. The\u00a0Suppliers? Code of Conduct has been revised to reflect the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act which has entered into force. Legal obligations resulting from the Act that must be observed in our own business operations\u00a0and in the supply chain have been incorporated or set out in more detail. This places our business relationships with our business partners on a solid basis. Management of Integrity &amp; Compliance policies The principles anchored in the Integrity Passport are communicated to and implemented in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group through our policies, statements and manuals. Our Group-wide policy management develops the standards for Group-wide policies and coordinates the involvement of relevant internal stakeholder groups, e. g. other departments and the works council. This approach is designed to provide employees with a set of policies\u00a0which are as comprehensible as possible.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s Compliance policies offer guidance on a range of issues, including how to react to gifts and hospitality and fair competition. In the financial year under review, the Group Policy on Trade Sanctions was updated and adjusted to existing processes within\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. Integrity &amp; Compliance ? Risk Analysis Integrity &amp; Compliance performed a pilot risk analysis for eight\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group companies across all regions and\u00a0segments. The responsible Compliance Officers selected the companies on a risk based approach. The criteria applied included the revenues, business activities, headcount, business location and headquarters of the\u00a0companies. The risk assessment was performed by means of a revised survey and a newly developed weighted\u00a0assessment matrix which automatically calculates the risk score for each region / segment. The survey comprises general and specific questions, e. g. on use of the SpeakUp Line and the Gifts &amp; Hospitality Register, the business environment and incident management. The individual companies cooperated closely\u00a0with local management in answering the questions and assessing the risks. Additional objective criteria included the corruption perception index, number of training programmes and number of reported and confirmed incidents. On that basis, risk scores were calculated for each individual company. The risks determined in this way proved moderate. Where necessary, risk mitigation measures were adopted.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is planning to roll out this risk analysis across the Group in order to further enhance the determination of risks and the identification of mitigation measures for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. Integrity &amp; Compliance training Training is a key element of\u00a0TUI?s Compliance Management System, with its focus on preventing misconduct,\u00a0and a crucial component of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s Integrity &amp; Compliance culture. It is carried out according to a graded concept: managers and staff at\u00a0TUI\u00a0have all benefited from face-to-face teaching and online programmes.\u00a0The online training programme on the Integrity Passport, which explains integrity and the underlying corporate values, is mandatory for all employees and executives. The online training on ?Fair Competition? was rolled out for risk groups within\u00a0TUI. To enable Legal and Procurement to deal with the topic in depth and engage in dialogue on specific legal questions, training programmes were offered and implemented by a lawyer\u00a0specialising in competition law and compliance. Other training schemes with their own specific focus addressed anti-corruption and the appropriate handling of gifts and hospitality to raise awareness of the risk-related challenges employees might face. As sanctions remain an important topic, an online training programme was rolled out by the end of the financial year. Whistleblower system: SpeakUp Line TUI\u00a0offers its employees a Group-wide whistleblower system to enable indications of infringements of laws or the policies anchored in\u00a0TUI?s Integrity Passport to be reported anonymously and without reprisals. This whistleblowing system is currently available to staff in\u00a053\u00a0countries. In accordance with the requirements of the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Whistleblowing Directive, it has been opened up for third parties outside\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. All reports are consistently followed up in the interests of all stakeholders and the Company. Our top priority is to ensure confidentiality and handle information discreetly. Any incident\u00a0resulting from the use of the whistleblower system is reviewed and followed up by the Integrity &amp; Compliance team, and is investigated and handled in conjunction with different departments, depending on the issue at stake. The opening of the whistleblowers system to third parties, has significantly increased the number of reports received. In the financial year under review, a total of\u00a0117\u00a0reports on compliance issues (in\u00a02022\u00a043\u00a0reports)\u00a0were received through the SpeakUp Line. Apart from the SpeakUp Line, employees also used the opportunity to report infringements through other channels e. g. directly to their line managers, the local Compliance\u00a0contact or the Compliance Mailbox, which is also available externally. A further\u00a029\u00a0reports (in\u00a02022\u00a026\u00a0reports)\u00a0were received through these channels. They were followed up whenever there were any indications suggesting potential infringements of internal policies or the law. Out of the\u00a0146\u00a0reports (in\u00a02022\u00a069\u00a0reports) submitted in total,\u00a078\u00a0cases (in\u00a02022\u00a030\u00a0cases) initially presented prima facie indications of a Compliance infringement, leading to further investigations, which in ten cases (in\u00a02022\u00a0eight cases) resulted in further measures. Regarding infringements of human rights or environmental requirements under the Supply Chain Due Diligence Act,\u00a031\u00a0reports have been received through the SpeakUp Line since\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02023. In\u00a018\u00a0cases, employees used the opportunity to report infringements directly to their line managers, the local Compliance contact\u00a0or the Compliance Mailbox. Out of the\u00a049\u00a0reports submitted in total,\u00a049\u00a0cases initially presented prima\u00a0facie indications of an infringement, leading to further investigations, which in four cases resulted in further\u00a0measures. Business partner screening (due diligence processes) There is a risk of active and passive corruption because we operate in countries with a high corruption index. Moreover, the risk of\u00a0TUI\u00a0business partners being subject to trade sanctions or similar listings cannot be ruled out. Business partners were checked against international sanctions, terrorist and wanted persons lists via the\u00a0Internet data base provider. In the event of a red flag, further measures were launched, in the severest cases terminating the business relationship. Data protection Data protection remains important for the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. We evaluate the compliance with data protection law permanently and report indicators to the Group Executive Committee. In addition, in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0we have reported\u00a015\u00a0data breaches in accordance with Art.\u00a033\u00a0GDPR. However, no fines are imposed so far. Remuneration Report The Remuneration Report mainly explains the remuneration of the members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board\u00a0and the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board in accordance with the Articles of Association.\u00a0The underlying remuneration systems are based in particular on the recommendations of the German\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (GCGC), the requirements of the German Stock Corporation Act (Aktiengesetz\u00a0?\u00a0AktG) and, where possible, the recommendations of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code (UK\u00a0CGC). In addition, the Remuneration Report includes the disclosures required by Section\u00a0162\u00a0of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) as amended by the Act implementing the Second Shareholders? Rights Directive (SRD\u00a0II). As a German stock corporation,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is also listed on the London Stock Exchange (LSE). Where mandatory rules on the governance structure and legal requirements of a German stock corporation are affected, these are presented accordingly in this report and, where appropriate, placed in the context of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC. Executive Board and Executive Board Remuneration CONFIRMATION OF THE REMUNERATION SYSTEM BY THE SHAREHOLDERS Following preparatory work in financial year\u00a02019, the Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0adopted a revised remuneration system for the members of the Executive Board in December\u00a02019\u00a0with retroactive effect from the beginning of financial year\u00a02020, i. e.\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02019. The revision of the remuneration system included different performance targets for the short-term variable remuneration (STI). Furthermore, the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance target was removed from the calculation of the long-term variable\u00a0remuneration (LTIP). In addition, the currentremuneration system now includes compliance malus and clawback rules, thus taking into account the requirements of\u00a0UK-based stakeholders and the recommendations of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0in particular. The remuneration system in its current form was approved by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on\u00a011\u00a0February\u00a02020, also with retrospective effect from the beginning of financial\u00a0year\u00a02020. In addition to the statutory requirements, the revision of the remuneration system took into account the recommendations of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0as amended on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02017\u00a0and the draft of the new version\u00a0of the\u00a0GCGC\u00a0as of\u00a016\u00a0December\u00a02019. In addition, the recommendations of the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0and a different market practice in the United Kingdom were also taken into account in the revision. Against the background of changes in market practice and further developments in the structure of Executive Board remuneration\u00a0since the last fundamental revision of the remuneration system, the remuneration system for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board was revised to include and take account of the aforementioned perspectives and approved by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s shareholders: The defined performance indicators are designed to take account of the interests\u00a0of all stakeholders and create value for our equity and debt providers. In designing the Executive Board\u00a0remuneration system, the Supervisory Board was supported by renowned, independent external remuneration consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft (PwC). According to the German Stock Corporation Act in the version of\u00a0SRD\u00a0II, the Supervisory Board must in future submit the remuneration system for approval whenever there is a significant change, but at least every four years. The Supervisory Board had to make such a submission for the first time at the first ordinary Annual General Meeting following\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02020.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s previous voluntary procedure in line with the\u00a0UK\u00a0CGC\u00a0already largely complied with these new requirements. In the context of the resolution adopted on\u00a025\u00a0March\u00a02021, the Annual General Meeting approved and thus adopted the remuneration system for the members of the Executive Board by\u00a095.8\u00a0%. Pursuant to the German Stock Corporation Act in the version of\u00a0SRD\u00a0II, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board must also prepare an annual Remuneration Report, which must comply with certain requirements (Section\u00a0162\u00a0AktG). The auditor has to check whether the Remuneration Report pursuant to Section\u00a0162\u00a0AktG contains all legally required information and, in addition, to issue an audit opinion. Pursuant to Section\u00a0120a (4) AktG, the audited Remuneration Report must be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for a decision on its approval. Under the applicable transitional law, the new provisions of the AktG on the Remuneration Report had to be applied for the first time for the first financial year beginning after\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02020. Accordingly, the Remuneration Report for financial\u00a0year\u00a02022\u00a0would in principle have had to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0for approval for the first time in\u00a02023. However, the Executive Board and Supervisory Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0have made use of\u00a0the option to voluntarily apply the new provisions of the German Stock Corporation Act on the Remuneration\u00a0Report earlier. This was also done to fulfil a contractual obligation\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has assumed vis-\u00e0-vis the Economic\u00a0Stabilisation Fund in September\u00a02020\u00a0in the framework of the granting of stabilisation measures in accordance\u00a0with the Economic Stabilisation Fund Act. The Remuneration Report prepared and audited within the meaning of Section\u00a0162\u00a0AktG for financial year ended\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02022\u00a0was approved by the shareholders of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0on\u00a014\u00a0February\u00a02023\u00a0with\u00a097.62\u00a0%. The decision of the Annual General Meeting on the approval of the Remuneration Report is of recommendatory nature. COMPOSITION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD In the financial year\u00a02023, the Executive Board consisted of the following members. Sebastian Ebel:\u00a0CEO  David Burling:\u00a0CEO\u00a0Markets &amp; Airlines  Mathias Kiep:\u00a0CFO  Peter Krueger:\u00a0CSO\u00a0&amp;\u00a0CEO\u00a0HEX  Sybille Reiss:\u00a0CPO\u00a0/ Labour Director  Frank Rosenberger:\u00a0CIO\u00a0(until the end of\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022) GENERAL PRINCIPLES Upon recommendation of the Presiding Committee, the Supervisory Board determines the remuneration of\u00a0the individual members of the Executive Board in accordance with Section\u00a087\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a01\u00a0AktG. In addition, the Supervisory Board regularly reviews the remuneration system for the Executive Board. In particular, the following principles are taken into account: Comprehensibility and transparency  Economic situation, success and sustainable development of the Company  Linking the shareholder interest in value enhancement and profit distribution with corresponding performance incentives for the members of the Executive Board  Competitiveness in the market for highly qualified managers  Appropriateness and orientation towards tasks, responsibility and success of each individual member of the Executive Board, also in a relevant environment of comparable international companies, taking into account the typical practice in other large German companies  Linking a significant part of the total remuneration to the achievement of demanding long-term performance targets  Appropriate relationship between the amount of the fixed remuneration and the performance-related remuneration  Adequacy in horizontal and vertical comparison The remuneration system and the service agreements of the members of the Executive Board stipulate in particular, how the target total remuneration is determined for the individual members of the Executive Board and what amount the total remuneration may not exceed (maximum remuneration),  the relative share of fixed remuneration on the one hand and short-term variable and long-term variable remuneration components on the other hand in the target total remuneration,  which financial and non-financial performance criteria are decisive for the granting of variable remuneration components,  what the relationship is between the achievement of the previously agreed performance criteria and the variable remuneration,  in which form and when the member of the Executive Board can dispose of the variable remuneration amounts. The remuneration system adopted by the Supervisory Board at the end of\u00a02019\u00a0and approved by the\u00a02020\u00a0and\u00a02021\u00a0Annual General Meetings also contains a compliance malus and clawback provision. Accordingly, in\u00a0the event of a serious breach by the beneficiary of the principles contained in the Company?s Code of\u00a0Conduct or of due diligence in the management of the Company during the assessment period of the corresponding variable remuneration components, the Company may reduce or cancel the payment amounts in full or demand their return in full or in part after payment. The Supervisory Board shall decide on this in each individual case at its due discretion and shall take into account in its decision in particular the severity of the violation as well as the amount of the financial or reputational damage caused thereby. In the financial year\u00a02023, the Supervisory Board did not make use of the option to withhold or reclaim variable remuneration components. I. REMUNERATION OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2023 In financial year\u00a02023, the remuneration of the Executive Board members consisted of: (1) a fixed remuneration, (2) a performance-related annual bonus as short-term incentive (STI), (3) virtual shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0under the long-term incentive plan (LTIP), (4) fringe benefits and (5) pension benefits.

Due to the appointment of Mr Ebel as Chairman of the Executive Board from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022, his commitment was amended in financial year\u00a02023. According to addendum no.\u00a07\u00a0paragraph\u00a03.e. dated\u00a029\u00a0July\u00a02022\u00a0to the service agreement between\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and Mr Ebel, the pension contribution will increase from ?\u00a0207,000\u00a0to ?\u00a0454,500. I.2 BENEFITS IN THE EVENT OF PREMATURE TERMINATION OF BOARD MEMBERSHIP The payments to be made to a member of the Executive Board in the event of premature termination of his employment contract without good cause are limited in principle in Mr Ebel?s service agreement to the value of two years? remuneration (severance payment cap). In the service agreements of Mr Burling, Mr Kiep, Mr Krueger, Ms Reiss and Mr Rosenberger, it is agreed that payments in the event of premature termination of their Executive Board activities without good cause may not exceed the value of one year?s remuneration (severance payment cap). For all members of the Executive Board, no more than the remaining term of the service agreement is compensated. For the calculation of the severance payment cap, the target direct remuneration (fixed\u00a0remuneration, target amount of the\u00a0STI\u00a0and target amount of the\u00a0LTIP) of the past financial year and,\u00a0if\u00a0applicable, also the expected target direct remuneration for the current financial year are taken into account. If the service agreement is terminated for cause, the members of the Executive Board do not receive any benefits. If the appointment of a member of the Executive Board is revoked, the respective service agreement shall also end. If the revocation is not based on a reason which at the same time constitutes an important reason for termination of the service agreement without notice, the service agreement shall end upon expiry of a period of expiry. This expiry period is generally twelve months. In the event of premature termination of the service contract, the\u00a0STI\u00a0and the payments from the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0are regulated as follows: STI:  If the service agreement is terminated by the Company before the end of the one-year performance period for good cause for which the member of the Executive Board is responsible, or if the member of\u00a0the Executive Board resigns without good cause, the entitlement to an annual bonus for the performance period in question shall lapse without replacement or compensation.   In all other cases of early termination of the service agreement before the end of the one-year performance period, the\u00a0STI\u00a0shall be paid pro rata temporis.  LTIP:  Claims under the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0shall lapse without replacement or compensation for all tranches not yet disbursed if the service agreement is terminated by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0before the end of the performance period for cause for which the Executive Board member is responsible or by the Executive Board member without cause.   If the service agreement ends before the end of the performance period for other reasons, the entitlements under the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0for tranches not yet paid out are retained. The tranche for the current financial year is reduced pro rata temporis. The amount to be paid out is determined in the same way as in the case of a continuation of the service agreement. In connection with the stabilisation measures and associated remuneration restrictions, it was agreed with\u00a0Mr Joussen and Mr Burling that they could unilaterally resign from their positions as members of the Executive Board from\u00a01\u00a0June\u00a02022\u00a0with a notice period of three months to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02022, whereby\u00a0JEV\u00a0and\u00a0LTIP\u00a0would be paid out in accordance with the contract and would not lapse. On\u00a024\u00a0June\u00a02022, Mr Joussen\u00a0exercised his right of resignation from his office as member of the Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0ahead of schedule as per\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02022. During the agreed expiry period of\u00a024\u00a0months,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has agreed to process the service agreement in accordance with the service agreement until the termination date. Mr Burling did not exercise his right of resignation. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shall be entitled to release the members of the Executive Board in connection with a termination of the service agreement, in particular following a termination of this service agreement, irrespective of the party declaring which such termination, or following the conclusion of a termination agreement, in whole or\u00a0in part from the obligation to perform work with continued payment of remuneration. The release shall initially\u00a0be irrevocable for the duration of any outstanding holiday entitlements, which are thereby settled. Subsequently, the release shall be maintained until the termination of the service agreement. It is revocable if there are questions in connection with the settlement of the employment relationship or if a temporary activity becomes necessary for operational reasons. The rest of the service agreement is not affected by this. The service agreements of the members of the Executive Board do not contain any change of control clauses. I.3 BENEFITS AND BENEFIT COMMITMENTS TO MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARDWHO HAVE LEFT THE EXECUTIVE BOARD IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2023 In financial year\u00a02023, Mr Frank Rosenberger resigned from\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board. Mr Rosenberger was originally appointed as a member of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board until the end of\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and Mr Rosenberger terminated the Executive Board mandate prematurely by mutual agreement as per the end of\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022. On the occasion of the termination,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0concluded a termination agreement with Mr Rosenberger. The subject matter of the termination agreement included the continuation of the service agreement until the end of the regular termination date, i. e. until\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0promised\u00a0Mr\u00a0Rosenberger that his remuneration would be settled in accordance with the contract until the termination\u00a0date of the service agreement. The fringe benefits and the company car were only granted until the termination of the Executive Board mandate. II. REMUNERATION RESTRICTIONS BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK AGREEMENTWITH THE ECONOMIC STABILISATION FUND Principle On\u00a04\u00a0January\u00a02021,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0had concluded a framework agreement with the Economic Stabilisation Fund (Wirtschaftsstabilisierungsfonds ?\u00a0WSF) on the granting of stabilisation measures, which sets out various\u00a0requirements for the remuneration of Executive Board members during the utilisation of stabilisation\u00a0measures (Framework Agreement\u00a0II). According to this agreement, any member of the Executive Board already appointed on\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02019\u00a0was not allowed to receive any remuneration in excess of the basic\u00a0remuneration of this member of the Executive Board as at\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02019\u00a0(including any Group remuneration in the event of dual employment at another Group Company), as long as at least\u00a075\u00a0% of the stabilisation measure had not been repaid. The framework agreement also stipulated that, as long as\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0makes use of the stabilisation measure, it would not grant and thus not constitute any bonuses, other\u00a0variable or comparable remuneration components or special payments in the form of share packages, bonuses or other separate remuneration in addition to the fixed salary, other remuneration components and benefits at the discretion of the Company or severance payments not required by law to members of the Executive Board ?including any Group remuneration?. For members of the Executive Board who were appointed as members of the Executive Board at the time the stabilisation measure was granted or thereafter, the upper limit was the basic remuneration of members of the Executive Board with the same level of responsibility as at\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02019. The\u00a0WSF\u00a0stabilisation measures were repaid with effect from\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023. The conditions and covenants to be fulfilled by\u00a0TUI\u00a0under Framework Agreement\u00a0II\u00a0generally ended on the stabilisation termination date. Procedure TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0had agreed corresponding amendments to the service agreements with all Executive Board members, adjusting the benefits generally promised under the remuneration system to the remuneration restrictions agreed with the Economic Stabilisation Fund. Due to the corresponding amendment of the service agreements and the waivers of the Executive Board\u00a0members,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0deviated until termination of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0stabilization measures from the remuneration system in place in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0with regard to the Short Term Incentive (STI) and the Long Term Incentive Plan\u00a0(LTIP). The deviation was in the interest of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and was a prerequisite for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0to be able to took advantage of stabilisation measures in accordance with the Economic Stabilisation Fund Act, if required. Apart from that, there were no deviations from the current remuneration system in financial year\u00a02023. III. OVERVIEW: INDIVIDUAL REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD III.1 ACHIEVEMENT OF TARGETS The following describes how the performance criteria were applied and the targets for the variable remuneration components were achieved in financial year\u00a02023. III.1.1 STI The multiplication of the target amounts with the weighted target achievement levels for\u00a0EBIT\u00a0and cash flow and the individual performance factor results in the amount taken into account for the payment of the\u00a0STI\u00a0per member of the Executive Board. With regard to\u00a0STI?s individual performance factor for the financial year\u00a02023, the Supervisory Board decided to define individual targets, success criteria for the performance of the entire Executive Board and success criteria for the stakeholder targets. The company-wide transformation process and the prioritisation and implementation of the\u00a0IT\u00a0roadmap were key objectives here. Furthermore, the focus was on customer and employee satisfaction. In addition, the members of the Executive Board have been given\u00a0ESG\u00a0targets. These include the implementation of emission reduction plans in the cruise segment, the definition and agreement of industry-leading standards for new construction and renovation in the hotel sector, and targets related to Sustainable Fuel (SAF) procurement. Following the termination of the remuneration restrictions, the Supervisory Board has also re-established\u00a0target achievement for\u00a0EBIT\u00a0(reported) and cash flow. The\u00a02023\u00a0summer programme showed a strong performance, exceeding the previous year and almost matching the pre-pandemic level. Challenging factors, especially at the beginning of the financial year\u00a02023, were the fuel and exchange rate developments. In\u00a0addition, events beyond\u00a0TUI?s control, such as the forest fires in Rhodes, were recorded. Despite these factors, reported earnings rose significantly year-on-year and\u00a0EBIT\u00a0(reported) showed a degree of target achievement of\u00a0119\u00a0%. The cash flow1\u00a0showed a degree of target achievement of\u00a067\u00a0%. Taking into account the weighting of the key figures, this leads to an overall target achievement of around\u00a0106\u00a0% for\u00a0STI\u00a02023. Thus, in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year, there is remuneration granted and owed within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a0162\u00a0para.\u00a01\u00a0sentence\u00a01, sentence\u00a02\u00a0no.\u00a01\u00a0of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) from the\u00a0STI\u00a0for the financial year\u00a02023.2 1\u00a0For a detailed definition of cash flow, please refer to the section ?Value-oriented Group management? in the summarisedmanagement report. 2\u00a0The definition of the remuneration granted and owed within the meaning of Section 162 para. 1 sentence 1, sentence 2 no. 1 AktGcan be found in Section\u00a0III. 3.1. Following the end of the remuneration restrictions, the Supervisory Board again set an individual performance factor for each member of the Executive Board based on the targets set for the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0as a precautionary measure despite the remuneration restrictions in place at the time. Overall, multiplying\u00a0the target amounts by the weighted target achievement levels for\u00a0EBIT\u00a0and cash flow as well as the individual performance factor results in an\u00a0STI\u00a0for the members of the Executive Board that is commensurate with the\u00a0results of the financial year. After evaluation, the Supervisory Board came to the following conclusions regarding the individual performance factor: Sebastian Ebel:\u00a01.2; David Burling:\u00a01.2; Mathias Kiep:\u00a01.2; Peter Krueger:\u00a01.2\u00a0and Sybille Reiss:\u00a01.2. The factor\u00a01.0\u00a0was defined for the former Executive Board members Friedrich Joussen and Frank Rosenberger, who still have service agreements that are due to expire. III.1.2 LTIP The payment of the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02020\u00a0?\u00a02023\u00a0is governed by the provisions of the remuneration system, which came into effect retroactively as of\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02019. The\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche was based on an average\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0share price of ?\u00a09.87\u00a0at the time of allocation. At the end of the performance period,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s average stock price was ?\u00a05.44. Due to the development of the\u00a0EPS\u00a0during the years of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, no target achievement level could be reached. The\u00a0EPS\u00a0were below the ?\u00a00.50\u00a0mark for financial years\u00a02020,\u00a02021\u00a0and\u00a02022, at which point the Supervisory Board is to set new absolute target values for the\u00a0EPS\u00a0as well as minimum and maximum values for determining the percentage target achievement in accordance with the relevant remuneration system. After the termination of the remuneration restrictions, the Supervisory Board defined corresponding absolute values. For the past financial years with negative\u00a0EPS, a target achievement of\u00a00\u00a0was defined. For the respective remaining terms,\u00a0the absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0target values were determined on the basis of the original approved planning at the beginning of the respective performance period. For the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02020\u00a0?\u00a02023, there is no remuneration granted and owed in December\u00a02023\u00a0within the meaning of Section\u00a0162\u00a0para.\u00a01\u00a0sentence\u00a01, sentence\u00a02\u00a0no.\u00a01\u00a0AktG.2 III.2 LOANS OR ADVANCES No loans or advances were granted to the members of the Executive Board in financial year\u00a02023, as in the previous year and the previous years. III.3 APPLICATIONS III.3.1 ?REMUNERATION GRANTED AND OWED? WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 162 (1) SENTENCE 1 AKTG IN FINANCIAL YEAR 2023 Pursuant to Section\u00a0162\u00a0para.\u00a01\u00a0sentence\u00a01, sentence\u00a02\u00a0no.\u00a01\u00a0AktG, all fixed and variable remuneration components ?granted and owed? to the individual members of the Executive Board in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0must\u00a0be disclosed. The values stated for both the\u00a0STI\u00a0and the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0for financial year\u00a02023\u00a0refer to the remuneration components ?granted and owed? in the respective financial year pursuant to Section\u00a0162\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a01\u00a0AktG.\u00a0They thus include all benefits earned in the respective financial year. The value of the\u00a0STI\u00a0therefore corresponds to the amount for the\u00a0STI\u00a0for financial year\u00a02023, which would not be paid out until financial year\u00a02024\u00a0in accordance with the service agreement. The value of the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02020\u00a0?\u00a02023\u00a0therefore corresponds in value to the amount for the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0whose four-year term ended on\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, but which would not be paid out until the\u00a02024\u00a0financial year in accordance with the service agreement. In the financial year\u00a02023, the members of the Executive Board neither received nor were promised benefits from third parties with regard to their activities on the Executive Board.</entry><entry

III.3.2 COMPLIANCE WITH THE MAXIMUM REMUNERATION AS REMUNERATION CAPS For financial year\u00a02023, in addition to the maximum amounts for the one-year and multi-year variable\u00a0remuneration, a maximum amount for the remuneration for financial year as a whole (including fringe\u00a0benefits and pension commitment) is provided for in accordance with Section\u00a087a para.\u00a01\u00a0sentence\u00a02\u00a0no.\u00a01\u00a0AktG. This maximum remuneration is ?\u00a07.5\u00a0m for the Chairman of the Executive Board and ?\u00a03.5\u00a0m for an ordinary member of the Executive Board and relates to the remuneration granted for a financial year. If the remuneration for financial year\u00a02023\u00a0exceeds the aforementioned maximum limit, the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0will be reduced accordingly. As the multi-year variable remuneration component is not available until the third year after the end of the reporting year due to the four-year performance period, compliance with the maximum remuneration for financial year\u00a02023\u00a0can only be reported conclusively as part of the Remuneration Report for financial year\u00a02026. III.3.3 COMPARISON OF THE ANNUAL CHANGE IN THE REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERSOF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARNINGS AND THE AVERAGEREMUNERATION OF EMPLOYEES OF TUI\u00a0AG The following table shows a comparison of the percentage change in the remuneration of the Executive\u00a0Board members with the development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s earnings and with the average remuneration of employees on a full-time equivalent basis as against the previous financial year.*\u00a0The remuneration of the Executive Board\u00a0members included in the table reflects the benefits earned in the respective financial year. For active members of the Executive Board, these values for financial year\u00a02023\u00a0correspond to the values stated in the table ?Remuneration granted and owed within the meaning of Section\u00a0162\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a01\u00a0AktG?. As a matter of principle, the development of earnings is presented on the basis of the development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s net profit for the year in accordance with Section\u00a0275\u00a0(2) no\u00a017\u00a0of the German Commercial Code (HGB). Since the remuneration of the Executive Board members also depends to a significant extent on the development of Group key figures,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s earnings trend also includes the development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0shown in the consolidated financial statements for financial years\u00a02020,\u00a02021,\u00a02022\u00a0and\u00a02023\u00a0and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s underlying\u00a0EBITA\u00a0shown in the consolidated financial statements for financial years\u00a02018\u00a0and\u00a02019. The comparison with the development of average employee remuneration is based on the average remuneration of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s workforce. Since the employee and remuneration structures in the subsidiaries are diverse, in particular in the case of employees abroad, it is appropriate to base the comparison of the development of average remuneration only on\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s workforce. This comparative group was also used to review the appropriateness of the remuneration of the Executive Board members. The remuneration of all employees, including executive employees within the meaning of Section\u00a05\u00a0(3) German Works Council Constitution Act\u00a0(Betriebsverfassungsgesetz ? BetrVG), was taken into account. Where employees also received remuneration as members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board, this remuneration was not taken into account. In order to ensure comparability, the remuneration of part-time employees was extrapolated to full-time equivalents. * Pursuant to Section 26j, paragraph 2, sentence 2 of the Introductory Act to the Stock Corporation Act (EGAktG), a comparison of\u00a0the average remuneration of employees on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five financial years pursuant to Section 162, paragraph\u00a01, sentence 2, no. 2 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) is not yet to be included in the Remuneration Report.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry

In addition to the active members of the Executive Board, those former Executive Board members were taken into account who still received remuneration from their active activities within the comparison period. 2\u00a0Mr Baier received a payout from his pension plan in financial years 2019 to 2023.

Tariff increases and related increases for non-tariff employees are also relevant in this context. 6\u00a0The comparison for financial years 2021 and 2022 was based on the amended definition of remuneration granted and owed pursuant to section 162 (1) no. 2 AktG. 7\u00a0Pro rata remuneration in financial year 2021. REVIEW OF THE APPROPRIATENESS OF EXECUTIVE BOARD REMUNERATION AND PENSIONS The Supervisory Board conducted the annual review of the Executive Board remuneration and pensions for\u00a0financial year\u00a02023. It came to the conclusion that the amount of the Executive Board remuneration and the\u00a0pensions are appropriate from a legal point of view pursuant to Section\u00a087\u00a0(1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG). For the assessment of the appropriateness of the Executive Board remuneration and pensions, the Supervisory Board also regularly calls on external advice. This involves assessing the relationship between the amount and structure of Executive Board remuneration and the remuneration of senior management and the workforce as a whole from an external perspective (vertical comparison). In addition to a status quo analysis, the vertical comparison also takes into account the development of remuneration ratios over time. Secondly, the remuneration level and structure are assessed on the basis of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s positioning in a comparative market (horizontal comparison). The entirety of the companies listed in the\u00a0DAX\u00a0and\u00a0MDAX\u00a0was used as a comparison group. In addition to the fixed remuneration, the horizontal comparison also includes the short- and long-term remuneration components as well as the amount of the Company pension plan. After the termination of the remuneration restrictions, the Supervisory Board did againa corresponding expert opinion on the appropriateness of the remuneration level for members of the Executive Board for financial year\u00a02023. For financial year\u00a02023, the consulting firm hkp group was commissioned to prepare an\u00a0expert opinion on the appropriateness of the level of remuneration for Executive Board members. The partner of hkp group commissioned to carry out the survey does not have any dependent relationship with\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board or the Company. The findings of the external consultant confirm the Supervisory Board?s assessment that the level of Executive Board remuneration is in line with the requirements of section\u00a087\u00a0(1) of the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) and the recommendations of the\u00a0GCGC. III.3.4 BENEFITS TO FORMER MEMBERS OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD For former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependents, total pension payments in\u00a0financial year\u00a02023\u00a0amounted to ?\u00a06,361.9\u00a0k (previous year ?\u00a06,248.9\u00a0k). Of this amount, ?\u00a0968.9\u00a0k was attributable to Michael Frenzel, who left the Executive Board on\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02014, and ?\u00a01,069.0\u00a0k to Horst Baier, who left the Executive Board on\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02018, in financial year\u00a02023. The remaining payments related to former members of the Executive Board who left\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board more than ten years ago. At the balance sheet date, pension provisions for former members of the Executive Board and their surviving dependants totalled ?\u00a059,098.9\u00a0k (previous year ?\u00a062,985.5\u00a0k) measured in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a019\u00a0? excluding Mr Ebel?s entitlements of ?\u00a03,796.0\u00a0k (previous year ?\u00a04,210.9\u00a0k) earned in the framework of his service for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group before\u00a031\u00a0August\u00a02006. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and Dr Eller agreed on the premature termination of the Executive Board mandate and the Labour Director mandate as per\u00a030\u00a0June\u00a02021. On the occasion of the termination,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0concluded a termination agreement with Dr Eller. The subject matter of the termination agreement included the continuation of the employment contract until the end of the regular termination date, i. e. until\u00a014\u00a0October\u00a02021.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has agreed to Dr Eller that it would continue to pay her remuneration in accordance with the service agreement until the termination date of the service agreement.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0also continued to make contributions to the Company pension scheme until that date. No entitlement arose from the\u00a0LTIP\u00a02020\u00a0?\u00a02023\u00a0in the financial year\u00a02023. On\u00a024\u00a0June\u00a02022, Mr Friedrich Joussen exercised his right to resign from his office as member of the Executive Board prematurely as of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02022. In the event of the right to resign being exercised, an expiry period of\u00a024\u00a0months had been agreed. During this expiry period,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0undertook to perform the service\u00a0agreement in accordance with the contract until the termination date.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0will continue to pay contributions to the company pension scheme until that date. In financial year\u00a02023, Mr Joussen was thus entitled to a fixed remuneration of ?\u00a01,100.0\u00a0k and a variable remuneration of ?\u00a01,346.2\u00a0k. TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and Mr Frank Rosenberger agreed on the premature termination of his Executive Board mandate\u00a0with effect from the end of\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022. On the occasion of the termination,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0concluded a termination\u00a0agreement with Mr Rosenberger. The subject matter of the termination agreement included the continuation\u00a0of the service agreement until the end of the regular termination date, i. e. until the end of\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02023.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0agreed to pay Mr Rosenberger his remuneration in accordance with the contract until the termination date of the service agreement.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0will also continue to make contributions to the company pension scheme until that date. Following the premature termination of his Executive Board mandate with effect from\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02022, Mr Rosenberger was thus entitled to a pro rata fixed remuneration of ?\u00a0550.0\u00a0k and variable remuneration of ?\u00a0492.9\u00a0k in financial year\u00a02023. Supervisory Board and Supervisory Board Remuneration CONFIRMATION OF THE REMUNERATION SYSTEM BY THE SHAREHOLDERS According to the German Stock Corporation Act (AktG) in the version of the\u00a0SRD\u00a0II, the Annual General\u00a0Meeting of a listed Company must resolve on the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board\u00a0at least every four years. A resolution confirming the existing remuneration is also permissible. The resolution must comply with new formal requirements.

colname=\"col1\">I.3 COMPARISON OF THE ANNUAL CHANGE IN THE REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERSOF THE SUPERVISORY BOARD WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARNINGS AND THEAVERAGE REMUNERATION OF TUI\u00a0AG EMPLOYEES The following table shows a comparison of the percentage change in the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board with the development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s earnings and with the average remuneration of employees on a full-time equivalent basis as against the previous financial year*. The remuneration of the\u00a0members of the Supervisory Board included in the table reflects the amounts earned in the respective\u00a0financial year. For financial year\u00a02023, these values correspond to the values stated in the table ?Remuneration\u00a0granted and owed within the meaning of Section\u00a0162\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a01\u00a0AktG?. Where members of the Supervisory Board had previously been members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Executive Board and had received remuneration for this, this would not be included in the comparative presentation. However, this does not apply to any member of the Supervisory Board. The development of earnings is generally presented on the basis of the development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s profit for the year in accordance with Section\u00a0275\u00a0(2) no\u00a017\u00a0of the German Commercial Code (HGB). The comparison with the development of average employee remuneration is based on the average remuneration of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s workforce. Since the employee and remuneration structures in the subsidiaries are diverse, in particular in the case of employees abroad, it is appropriate to base the comparison of the development of average remuneration only on the workforce of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. The remuneration of all employees, including executive staff as defined in Section\u00a05\u00a0(3) of the German Works Constitution Act (BetrVG), was taken into account. Employee remuneration did not include remuneration received by employees as members of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s Supervisory Board. In order to ensure comparability, the remuneration of part-time employees was extrapolated to full-time equivalents. * Pursuant to Section 26j, paragraph 2, sentence 2 of the Introductory Act to the Stock Corporation Act (EGAktG), a comparisonof the average remuneration of employees on a full-time equivalent basis over the last five financial years pursuant to Section 162,paragraph 1, sentence 2, no. 2 of the Stock Corporation Act (AktG) is not yet to be included in the Remuneration Report.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry

Following the successive lifting of the measures to restrict contact and travel in most countries, business has been mainly resumed in all segments in the course of the first half year of the\u00a02022\u00a0calendar year. To cover the resulting liquidity needs, the Group has carried out various financing measures in the financial years\u00a02020\u00a0to\u00a02022, which, in addition to three capital increases, the use of the banking and capital markets\u00a0and cash inflows from the sale of assets, also include financing measures from the Federal Republic of\u00a0Germany in the form of a KfW credit line initially totalling ?\u00a02.85\u00a0bn, an option bond from the German\u00a0Economic Stabilisation Fund (WSF) totalling ?\u00a0150\u00a0m and two silent participations from the\u00a0WSF\u00a0initially totalling ?\u00a01.091\u00a0bn. In financial year\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0reduced KfW?s credit line to ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn in various steps. In addition,\u00a0913\u00a0of the\u00a01,500\u00a0partial bonds with warrants issued to\u00a0WSF\u00a0were redeemed and the Silent Participation\u00a0II\u00a0of the\u00a0WSF\u00a0of ?\u00a0671.0\u00a0m was repaid in full ahead of schedule. The financing measures are described in detail in the annual reports for the past three financial years. On\u00a013\u00a0December\u00a02022,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has concluded a new agreement with the\u00a0WSF\u00a0on the repayment of stabilization\u00a0measures (?Repayment Agreement?). This agreement regulates the intended complete termination of the\u00a0stabilization measures granted by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0by means of a right of the Company (i) to repayment of the contribution made by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0as a silent partner in January\u00a02021\u00a0in the nominal amount of then ?\u00a0420\u00a0m (?Silent Participation I?) and (ii) to repurchase the warrant-linked bond\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a02026\u00a0(?Warrant Bond?) issued\u00a0by the Company to\u00a0WSF\u00a0in the remaining amount of ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m as well as the\u00a058,674,899\u00a0option rights (?Warrants?)\u00a0originally attached to the warrant bond. In addition, the Repayment Agreement regulates the implementation of capital measures for the purpose of refinancing the aforementioned measures. In February\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0implemented the ten-for-one reverse stock split previously resolved by the\u00a02023\u00a0AGM\u00a0in accordance with the provisions of the Economic Stabilisation Acceleration Act. As a result, the Company?s share capital declined from ?\u00a01.785\u00a0bn to around ?\u00a0179\u00a0m. The corresponding reduction amount of around ?\u00a01.606\u00a0bn was transferred to the company?s capital reserves. In accordance with the repayment agreement with the\u00a0WSF, the Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0resolved a capital increase with subscription rights of ?\u00a01.8\u00a0bn with the approval of the Supervisory Board on\u00a024\u00a0March\u00a02023. For the fully subscribed capital increase,\u00a0328,910,448\u00a0new shares were offered at a subscription ratio of\u00a08:3\u00a0and a subscription price of ?\u00a05.55. The subscription period for the new shares ended on\u00a017\u00a0April\u00a02023. Following receipt of the proceeds from the capital increase on\u00a024\u00a0April\u00a02023, Silent Participation I and the\u00a0around\u00a058.7\u00a0m warrants held by the\u00a0WSF\u00a0as well as the outstanding\u00a0587\u00a0of the\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a02026\u00a0bonds with warrants were fully redeemed. For Silent Participation I and the\u00a02023\u00a0coupon payable on it, a redemption price of ?\u00a0651.6\u00a0m was paid. ?\u00a030.8\u00a0m were used for the repurchase of the warrants and further ?\u00a061.9\u00a0m for the early redemption of the\u00a0587\u00a0bonds with a nominal value of ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m, including accrued interest of ?\u00a03.2\u00a0m. At the same time, the early repayment penalty for Silent Participation\u00a0II\u00a0of ?\u00a05.7\u00a0m, agreed with the\u00a0WSF\u00a0in April\u00a02022, became due.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has thus terminated and repaid all stabilisation measures of the\u00a0WSF. Moreover,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0reduced the volume of the KfW credit facility from ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn to ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn following completion of the capital increase. The capital increase completed in April\u00a02023\u00a0and the subsequent substantial reduction in government financing\u00a0will enable a significant improvement in the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s credit ratios and reduce current interest costs, allowing\u00a0TUI\u00a0to focus on growth and further market recovery. In May\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0extended the maturity of the existing credit lines of ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn by a further two years. The syndicated credit line with the\u00a019\u00a0banks (?\u00a01.64\u00a0bn), including the credit line with KfW (?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn), together referred to as the ?RCF?, will now mature in July\u00a02026. The\u00a0RCF\u00a0of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is subject to compliance with certain financial targets (covenants) for debt coverage and interest coverage, the review of which is carried out on the basis of the last four reported quarters at the end of the financial year or the half-year of a financial year. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s revolving credit facilities totalled ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn, they comprised the following ?\u00a01.64\u00a0bn credit line from\u00a019\u00a0private banks (incl. ?\u00a0190\u00a0m guarantee line)  ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn KfW credit line The KfW credit line, which was reduced to ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn after the successful capital increase, is not expected to be drawn on and serves only as a buffer. The aim is to return this credit line quickly. In the view of the Executive Board, the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group currently has and will continue to have sufficient funds,\u00a0resulting both from borrowings and from operating cash flows, to meet its payment obligations and to continue as a going concern in the foreseeable future. Therefore, as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, the Board does not identify any material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern. The Board does not foresee risks that may jeopardise the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern and does not believe that compliance with the financial covenants is at risk as at\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02024\u00a0and\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02024. In accordance with Regulation\u00a030\u00a0of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code, the Board confirms that, in its opinion, it is appropriate to prepare the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis. Principles and methods of consolidation Principles The consolidated financial statements include all significant subsidiaries directly or indirectly controlled by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. Control exists where\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has power over the relevant activities, is exposed to variable returns or\u00a0has rights to the returns, and has the ability to affect those variable returns through its power over the investee. Generally, the control is exercised by means of a direct or indirect majority of voting rights. If\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group holds less than the majority of voting rights in a shareholding, it may exercise control due to contractual or\u00a0similar agreements, as in the case of the participation in the\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group. Due to the contractual agreements\u00a0between the shareholders and the framework agreements with\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group as well as the considerable importance of tour operation for the economic success of\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is able to exercise a\u00a0controlling influence on decisions about the most relevant activities and consequently the amount of returns.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is subject to variable returns from\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group, in particular due to dividend payments\u00a0and fluctuations in the fair value of the stake itself.\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group is therefore consolidated although\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group only holds a\u00a050\u00a0% equity stake. In assessing control, the existence and effect of potential voting rights are taken into account that are currently exercisable when decisions about the direction of relevant activities are made. Consolidation of\u00a0subsidiaries starts from the date\u00a0TUI\u00a0gains control. When\u00a0TUI\u00a0ceases to control the corresponding companies, they are removed from the group of consolidated companies. The consolidated financial statements are prepared from the separate or single-entity financial statements of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and its subsidiaries, drawn up on the basis of uniform accounting, measurement and consolidation methods and usually audited or reviewed by auditors. Associates for which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is able to exert significant influence over the financial and operating policy decisions within these companies are accounted for using the equity method. Generally, significant influence is assumed if\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0directly or indirectly holds voting rights of between\u00a020\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0%. Stakes in joint ventures are also measured using the equity method. A joint venture is a company managed jointly by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group with one or several partners based on a contractual agreement, in which the parties that jointly exercise control have rights to the company?s net assets. Joint ventures also include companies in\u00a0which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group holds a majority or minority of voting rights but in which decisions about the relevant activities may only be taken on an unanimous basis due to contractual agreements. The dates on which associates and joint ventures are included in or removed from the group of companies\u00a0measured at equity are determined in a manner consistent with that applied to subsidiaries. At equity measurement in each case is based on the last annual financial statements available or the interim financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September if the balance sheet dates differ from\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s balance sheet date. This affects\u00a034\u00a0companies with a financial year from\u00a01\u00a0January to\u00a031\u00a0December, three companies with a financial year from\u00a01\u00a0November to\u00a031\u00a0October and two companies with a financial year from\u00a01\u00a0April to\u00a031\u00a0March. Group of consolidated companies In financial year\u00a02023, the consolidated financial statements included a total of\u00a0266\u00a0subsidiaries.

Even when taken together, these companies are of minor significance to the presentation of a true and fair view of the financial position and performance of the Group. Acquisitions ? Divestments Acquisitions of the current financial year A total of three companies were acquired. One of the acquisitions did not comprise any business operations. Another acquisition is immaterial and not explained in greater detail here. On\u00a026\u00a0September\u00a02023, an agreement was signed to acquire\u00a049\u00a0% of the shares in Pep Toni Hotels S. A.,\u00a0Palma de Mallorca. The purpose of the company is to invest in and develop leisure hotels and hotels in (tourist) cities worldwide. The purchase price of ?\u00a029,400\u00a0corresponds to the nominal value of the shares. The investment is carried as a\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group associate. Subsequently, the shareholders contributed equity in line with their stakes in the company. This equity was transferred to the company?s capital reserves. In this context, we refer to the section ?Companies measured at equity?. An insignificant company acquisition took place after the balance sheet date that requires no further explanation. Acquisitions of the prior financial year In financial year\u00a02022, no companies were acquired under\u00a0IFRS\u00a03. Divestments The non-consolidated shares in Peakwork\u00a0AG\u00a0were sold in financial year\u00a02023. The divestment of the shares and the payment of the purchase price of ?\u00a024.0\u00a0m took place in April\u00a02023. After the balance sheet date the following divestments took place: The shares in the joint venture\u00a0WOT\u00a0Hotels Adriatic Asset Company d. o. o., a company accounted for using the equity method, were sold by way of an agreement dated\u00a030\u00a0August\u00a02023\u00a0and effective as of\u00a020\u00a0October\u00a02023. The purchase price amounts to ?\u00a012.0\u00a0m and was paid on\u00a010\u00a0November\u00a02023. The preliminary gain on disposal from this transaction is zero. In this context, we refer to the section ?Assets held for sale?. The shares in the joint venture Raiffeisen-Tour\u00a0RT-Reisen GmbH, a company accounted for using the equity method, were sold by way of a purchase agreement dated\u00a029\u00a0August\u00a02023\u00a0and effective as of\u00a019\u00a0October\u00a02023. The consideration calculated as part of a purchase price distribution amounts to ?\u00a03.1\u00a0m. The payment was made on\u00a030\u00a0October\u00a02023. The preliminary gain on disposal from this transaction is zero. In this context, we refer to the section ?Assets held for sale?. On\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02023, an agreement was signed with\u00a0TUI\u00a0Global Hospitality Fund S. C. S. to sell Club Hotel\u00a0CV,\u00a0S. A. (Robinson Club Cabo Verde), consolidated in the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment. The divestment was completed\u00a0on\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02023. The purchase price was ?\u00a03.4\u00a0m. The purchase price was paid on\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02023. A\u00a0preliminary gain on disposal of ?\u00a04.6\u00a0m was generated from the transaction, reported under Other income. The divestment of the company resulted in the disposal of goodwill totalling ?\u00a02.3\u00a0m by the ?Robinson? cash-generating unit. In this context, we refer to the section ?Assets held for sale?. Foreign exchange translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the foreign exchange rates at the date of the transaction. Any gains and losses resulting from the execution of such transactions and the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the foreign exchange\u00a0rate at the date of the transaction are shown in the income statement, with the exception of gains and losses to be recognised in equity as qualifying cash flow hedges. The annual financial statements of companies are prepared in the respective functional currency. The\u00a0functional currency of a company is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the company operates. Where subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in functional currencies other than the Euro, being the Group?s reporting currency, the assets and liabilities are translated at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date (closing rate). Goodwill allocated to these companies and adjustments of the fair value arising on the acquisition of a foreign company are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign company and also translated at the rate of exchange applicable at the balance sheet date. The items of the income statement and hence the result for the year shown in the income statement are translated at the average rate of the month in which the respective transaction takes place. Differences arising on the translation of the annual financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are reported outside profit and loss and separately shown as foreign exchange differences in the consolidated statement\u00a0of changes in equity. When a foreign company or operation is sold, any foreign exchange differences previously\u00a0included in equity outside profit and loss are recognised as a gain or loss from disposal in the income statement through profit and loss. Translation differences relating to non-monetary items with changes in their fair values eliminated through profit and loss (e. g. equity instruments measured at their fair value through profit and loss) are included in the income statement. In contrast, translation differences for non-monetary items with changes in their fair values taken to equity are included in revenue reserves. Some\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group subsidiaries operate their business in a hyperinflation country (previous year: equally\u00a0Group companies in hyperinflationary economies). As the Euro is the functional currency for these companies, accounting in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a029, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, is not required. The translation of the financial statements of foreign companies measured at equity follows the same principles\u00a0for adjusting carrying amounts and translating goodwill as those used for consolidated subsidiaries. Net investment in a foreign operation Monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, essentially constitute part of a net investment in this foreign operation.\u00a0Foreign exchange differences from the translation of these monetary items are recognised in other comprehensive income. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group had granted loans of this type in particular to hotel companies in North Africa.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_124\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"304\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Exchange rates of currencies of relevance to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Closing rate</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Annual average rate</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1\u00a0? equivalent</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sterling</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.87</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.88</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.87</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.85</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">US\u00a0dollar</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.06</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.98</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.07</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.09</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Swiss franc</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.97</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.96</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.98</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.02</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Swedish krona</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11.55</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.95</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">11.34</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">10.43</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Consolidation methods The recognition of the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses is based on the acquisition method. Accordingly all identifiable assets, all liabilities and certain contingent liabilities assumed are measured at fair value as of the acquisition date. Subsequently, the consideration for the stake is measured at fair value and eliminated against the acquiree?s revalued equity attributable to the acquired share. The option to measure the non-controlling interests at their fair value (full goodwill method) was not used. Any excess of acquisition costs over net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill and recognised as an asset in accordance with the provisions of\u00a0IFRS\u00a03. Any negative goodwill is recognised immediately in profit and loss and presented as other income. When additional shares are purchased after obtaining control, the difference between the purchase price and the carrying amount of the stakes acquired is recognised directly in equity. The effects from sales of\u00a0stakes not entailing a loss of control are also recognised directly in equity. By contrast, when control is obtained or lost, gains or losses are recognised in profit and loss. In the case of business combinations achieved in stages (where the acquirer held an equity interest before he obtained control), the equity stake previously held in the acquired company is revalued at the fair value applicable at the acquisition date and\u00a0the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. For transactions involving a loss of control, the profit or loss does not only comprise the difference between the carrying amounts of the disposed stakes and the consideration received but also the result from the revaluation of the remaining shares. On loss of control of a subsidiary, the gain or loss on derecognition will be calculated as the total of the fair value of the consideration plus the fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiary less the share of the book value of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any gains or losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income from currency translations or the valuation of financial assets and liabilities will be reclassified to the income statement. When a subsidiary is sold, any goodwill allocated to the respective subsidiary is taken into account in the calculation of the profit or loss of disposal. The Group?s associates and joint ventures are measured at equity and included at the cost to purchase as at the acquisition date. The Group?s stake in associates and joint ventures includes the goodwill arising from the respective acquisition. The Group?s share in profits and losses of associates and joint ventures is carried in the income statement from the date of acquisition (Share of result from joint ventures and associates), while the Group?s share in the total other comprehensive income is shown in its revenue reserves. The accumulated changes arising after the acquisition are shown in the carrying amount of the shareholding. When the share in the loss of an associated company or joint venture equals or exceeds the Group?s original stake in this company, including other unsecured receivables, no further losses are recognised. Any losses exceeding that stake are only\u00a0recognised to the extent that obligations have been assumed or payments have been made for the associated\u00a0company or joint venture. Where the accounting and measurement methods applied by associates and joint ventures differ from the uniform accounting rules applied in the Group, the differences are adjusted. Intercompany receivables and payables or provisions are eliminated, as are intercompany revenue, other income and the corresponding expenses. Intercompany results from intercompany deliveries and services are reversed through profit and loss, taking account of deferred taxes. However, intercompany losses are an indicator that an asset may be impaired. Intercompany profits from transactions with companies measured at equity are eliminated in relation to the Group?s stake in the companies. Intercompany transactions are entered into on an arm?s length basis. Accounting and measurement methods The consolidated financial statements are prepared according to the historical cost principle, with the exception\u00a0of certain financial instruments such as financial assets and derivatives as well as plan assets from externally funded pensions benefit obligations held at fair value at the balance sheet date. The financial statements of the consolidated subsidiaries are prepared in accordance with uniform accounting\u00a0and measurement principles. The amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements are not determined by tax regulations but solely by the commercial presentation of the financial position and performance as set out in the rules of the\u00a0IASB. Revenue recognition TUI\u00a0recognises revenue upon transfer of control over distinct goods or services to the customer. In Markets\u00a0and Airlines,\u00a0TUI\u00a0predominantly generates revenue from the sale of package holidays. The flights, hotel accommodation and other services included in a package holiday are transformed into one product for the customer through a significant integration service provided by\u00a0TUI\u00a0as tour operator within the meaning of\u00a0IFRS\u00a015, so that the package holiday constitutes one performance obligation for\u00a0TUI. This revenue is recognised when\u00a0TUI\u00a0delivers the service for its customer, i. e. on a linear basis over the duration of the holiday tour, as customers consume their holiday on a pro rata basis.\u00a0TUI\u00a0generates further revenue from the sale of other tourist services, e. g. seat-only, accommodation-only, cruises, etc. Revenue is recognised when or as\u00a0TUI\u00a0has satisfied its performance obligation, either over time in relation to the duration of the journey if the services relate to a period of time, e. g. in the case of multi-day hotel stays, or at a point in time on the day of the performance of the performance obligation, e. g. for flight services on the day of the flight. Revenue from long-term contracts is recognised over the duration of the individual contract in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a015. Amendment fees do not constitute an independent performance obligation. Revenue is therefore recognised along with the delivery of the main performance obligation. If\u00a0TUI\u00a0has control over the asset before it is delivered to the customer,\u00a0TUI\u00a0acts as the principal in relation to that service. Otherwise,\u00a0TUI\u00a0acts as an agent. As a principal,\u00a0TUI\u00a0carries the recognised revenue and costs in\u00a0the income statement on a gross basis, e. g. for revenue from its own tour operator activities, for hotel revenue\u00a0in own hotels, and for aviation revenue. When acting as an agent,\u00a0TUI\u00a0carries the relevant revenue on a net basis at the amount of the commission received, e. g. for car rental and hotel revenue for third-party hotels in which\u00a0TUI\u00a0does not have control over the hotel rooms. Passenger-related aviation taxes and fees charged by\u00a0TUI\u00a0on behalf of third parties and passed on to these third parties are carried in the income statement on a net basis. TUI\u00a0uses the practical expedient offered under\u00a0IFRS\u00a015.121(a). For open performance obligations as at the\u00a0balance sheet date,\u00a0TUI\u00a0discloses all performance obligations for contracts with an original term of more\u00a0than twelve months, i. e. at least twelve months lie between the start of the contract (in principle the booking date) and the end of the contract (in principle the end of the service). TUI\u00a0has to pay compensation to customers for flight delays or cancellations (so-called denied boarding compensation). These payments are directly related to the obligation of the flight service. Therefore these\u00a0payments represent variable considerations. Hence, denied boarding compensations are shown net in revenue. Goodwill and other intangible assets Acquired intangible assets are carried at cost. Internally generated intangible assets are capitalised at cost\u00a0where an inflow of future economic benefits for the Group is probable and can be reliably measured. The\u00a0cost to produce comprises direct costs and directly allocable overheads. Intangible assets with a finite service life are amortised over the expected useful life. Intangible assets acquired as a result of business combinations are included at their fair value as at the date of acquisition and are amortised on a straight-line basis.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_125\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"512\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Useful lives of intangible assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Useful lives</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Brands, licences and other rights</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5\u00a0to\u00a020\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Transport and leasing contracts</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12\u00a0to\u00a020\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Computer software</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3\u00a0to\u00a013\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Customer base as at acquisition date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7\u00a0to\u00a015\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Due to changes in our strategy and delays in the digital transformation, the useful lives of certain software solutions were extended by up to three years. As a result of the adjustment of individual useful lives for\u00a0computer software, the economic useful life in individual cases has been extended from the previous ten\u00a0years to a total of\u00a013\u00a0years. For further information, please refer to the section ?Other intangible assets?. If there are any events or indications suggesting potential impairment, the amortised carrying amount of the intangible asset is compared with the recoverable amount. Any losses in value going beyond wear-and-tear depreciation are taken into account through the recognition of impairment charges. Depending on the functional area of the intangible asset, amortisation and impairment charges are included under cost of sales or administrative expenses. Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortised but are tested for impairment at least annually.\u00a0In addition, impairment tests are conducted if there are any events or indications suggesting potential impairment.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s intangible assets with an indefinite useful life consist exclusively of goodwill. Impairment tests for goodwill are conducted on the basis of cash-generating units (CGU) or groups of cash-generating units. Impairment charges are recognised where the carrying amount of the tested units, including the allocated goodwill, exceeds the recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and the present value of future cash flows based on continued use (value in use). The fair value less costs of disposal corresponds to the amount that could be generated between knowledgeable, willing, independent business partners after deduction of the costs of disposal. Impairment of goodwill is shown separately in the consolidated income statement. Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are measured at amortised cost. The costs to purchase include costs to bring\u00a0the asset to a working condition. The costs to produce are determined on the basis of direct costs and directly attributable indirect costs and depreciation. Borrowing costs directly associated with the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are included in the costs to acquire or produce these assets until the assets are ready for their intended use. To the extent that funds are borrowed specifically for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset, the underlying capitalisation rate is determined on the basis of the specific borrowing cost; in all other cases the weighted average of the borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings outstanding is applied. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is based on the straight-line method over the useful economic life. The useful economic lives are as follows:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_126\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"320\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"304\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Useful lives of property, plant and equipment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Useful lives</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hotel buildings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other buildings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">25\u00a0to\u00a050\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cruise ships</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0to\u00a038\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Aircraft</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Fuselages and engines</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">22\u00a0to\u00a025\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Engine overhaul</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">depending on intervals, up to\u00a012\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Major overhaul</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">depending on intervals, up to\u00a012\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Spare parts</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">up to\u00a010\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating and business equipment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3\u00a0to\u00a010\u00a0years</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Moreover, the level of depreciation is determined by the residual values at the end of the useful life of an asset. The residual value assumed at first-time recognition for cruise ships is between\u00a04\u00a0% and\u00a030\u00a0% of the\u00a0acquisition costs. The determination of the depreciation of aircraft fuselages and aircraft engines in first-time\u00a0recognition is based on a residual value of a maximum of\u00a05\u00a0% of the cost of acquisition. In addition, a residual value of\u00a020\u00a0% is used to determine the scheduled depreciation of spare parts. The payments made under a power by the hour arrangement relating to maintenance overhauls are capitalised as\u00a0PPE\u00a0under construction up to a maintenance event at which point the cost is transferred to the appropriate\u00a0PPE\u00a0category. Both the useful lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis when preparing the Group financial statements. The review of the residual values is based on comparable assets at the end of their useful lives as at the current point in time. Any adjustments required are recognised as a correction of depreciation over the remaining useful life of the asset. The adjustment of depreciation is recognised retrospectively for the\u00a0entire financial year in which the review has taken place. Where the review results in an increase in the residual value so that it exceeds the remaining net carrying amount of the asset, depreciation is suspended. In this case, the amounts are not written back. Any losses in value going beyond wear-and-tear depreciation are taken into account through the recognition of impairment losses. If there are any events or indications suggesting impairment, the required impairment test is performed to compare the carrying amount of an asset with the recoverable amount. Leases Leases are agreements transferring the right to use an identified asset for a given period of time in return for a payment. As a lessee,\u00a0TUI\u00a0leases moveable assets such as aircraft, vehicles and cruise ships, as well as, in particular, immoveable property such as hotel buildings and land, office buildings and travel agencies. As a lessor,\u00a0TUI\u00a0subleases some aircraft, travel agency and office space as well as a hotel. TUI AS LESSEE TUI\u00a0recognises right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities for the lease arrangements, in which it\u00a0is the lessee, in the statement of financial position. As an exception,\u00a0TUI\u00a0applies the recognition and measurement exemptions for all short-term leases and low-value asset leases. A short-term lease is a lease that has a lease term of twelve months or less and does not contain a purchase option. The lease payments for those leases are recognised as an expense in the cost of sales or in administrative expenses on a straight-line basis over the lease term or on another systematic basis. At the inception of an agreement,\u00a0TUI\u00a0evaluates whether it contains a lease. Apart from traditional lease, tenancy or leasing contracts, service or capacity agreements may also fall within the scope of\u00a0IFRS\u00a016. In connection with the purchase of mixed tourism services, the rental or purchase of the largest portion of a hotel?s room capacity is identified as a lease component if\u00a0TUI\u00a0commits to its contract partner to purchase a fixed allotment of more than\u00a090\u00a0% of the hotel?s capacity for a period of more than twelve months, provided\u00a0the agreement does not include an exemption to return committed capacity for self-marketing by the hotelier,\u00a0and if therefore an irrevocable payment obligation exists. For agreements that contain one or several lease\u00a0components alongside non-lease components,\u00a0TUI\u00a0uses the option not to separate these non-lease components, in particular for vehicle or\u00a0IT\u00a0leases and for hotel capacity contracts. At the commencement date, i. e. the date from which the lessee is entitled to exercise the right to use the underlying asset, a lease liability amounting to the present value of the lease payments not yet made as at that date is recognised. The lease payments include all fixed and in substance-fixed payments less any future lease incentives to be provided by the lessor. The lease payments also include variable payments linked to an index or an interest rate as well as expected payments from residual value guarantees. Lease payments for the exercise of extension, purchase and termination options are included if the exercise of these options is assessed as reasonably certain. As a rule, the lease payments are discounted at the lessor?s interest rate implicit in the lease. If that rate is not known to\u00a0TUI, the present value is determined using the incremental borrowing rate. After initial measurement, the carrying amount is increased to reflect interest on the lease liability and reduced to reflect the lease payments made. In addition, the carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured if there is a modification, a change in the lease term, a change in the lease payments (e. g.,\u00a0changes to future payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine such lease payments) or a change in the assessment of an option to purchase the underlying asset. The interest expense from the subsequent measurement of the lease liability is presented in the interest result. Variable lease payments not linked to an index nor to an interest rate are recognised through profit or loss in the period in which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In addition, a right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date. Right-of-use assets for the leased\u00a0items are measured at amortised cost less cumulative depreciation / amortisation and cumulative impairment and adjusted for revaluations of the lease liability. The costs of a right-of-use asset comprise the present\u00a0value of the future lease payments plus initial direct costs and the lease payments made prior to commencement less any lease incentives received and the estimated costs to be incurred to restore the leased asset to\u00a0the condition required by the terms and conditions of the lease. Capitalised right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and the expected useful life of the right-of-use asset. If the lease transfers ownership of the leased asset to\u00a0TUI\u00a0by the end of the lease term, or if the lease payments reflect the future exercise of a purchase option, the right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the leased asset. Depreciation of capitalised right-of-use assets is carried in the cost of sales or in administrative expenses. SALE AND LEASEBACK For sale and leaseback transactions,\u00a0TUI\u00a0initially determines in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a015\u00a0whether the transfer of the asset has to be accounted for as a sale. If the transfer is accounted for as a sale,\u00a0TUI\u00a0recognises the\u00a0right-of-use asset associated with the sale and leaseback transaction, as seller and as lessee, at the proportion of the previous carrying amount that relates to the right-of-use asset retained. The gain or loss from the sale\u00a0transaction is carried in profit or loss on a pro rata basis at the amount of the rights transferred to the buyer and lessor. If the transfer is not accounted for as a sale,\u00a0TUI\u00a0continues to recognise the legally transferred asset as before and carries a financial liability for the proceeds received. TUI AS LESSOR As a lessor,\u00a0TUI\u00a0classifies each lease as an operating lease or a finance lease. If\u00a0TUI\u00a0as a lessor has substantially\u00a0all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset, the lease is classified as an operating lease. If the lease transfers substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee, the lease is classified as a finance lease. For subleases, the lease classification has been made by reference to the right-of-use asset arising from the head lease in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a016\u00a0and not by reference to the underlying lease asset. The lease payments from operating leases are recognised in revenue on a straight-line basis over the lease\u00a0term. Any initial direct costs incurred in obtaining the lease are added to the carrying amount of the underlying\u00a0leased item and depreciated over the lease term on a straight-line basis. For finance leases,\u00a0TUI\u00a0recognises a lease receivable at an amount equal to the net investment in the lease\u00a0and derecognises the underlying leased asset or the right-of-use asset from the head lease. The lease payments made by the lessees are broken down into an interest portion and a redemption portion using the effective\u00a0interest rate method so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the balance of the net investment.\u00a0The redemption portions received are deducted from the lease receivable. The interest portion of the payments received is carried in the interest result. Financial instruments Financial instruments are contractual rights or obligations that will lead to an inflow or outflow of financial assets or the issue of own equity instruments for one of the two contracting parties and correspondingly to an inflow or outflow of financial assets for the other contracting party. They also comprise (derivative) rights or obligations derived in particular, from non-derivative financial assets. NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The classification and measurement of financial assets are determined on the basis of the business model assigned to manage financial assets and the related contractual cash flows. At initial recognition of financial assets, the classification comprises the categories ?Financial assets at amortised cost (AC)?, ?Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)? and ?Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss (FVPL)?. With the exception of trade receivables, non-derivative financial financial assets are recognised at fair value. Trade receivables are recognised with their values at the trading date on which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group under-takes to buy the assets. When recognised for the first time, they are either classified at amortised costs or at fair value, depending on their objective. Non-derivative financial assets are classified as financial assets at amortised cost when the objective of the entity?s business model is to hold the financial assets to collect contractually agreed cash flows, and when the cash flows exclusively constitute interest and principal payments on the nominal amount outstanding. For financial assets held at amortised cost, a loss allowance for expected credit losses is recognised in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a09. Loss allowances for financial assets are based on either full lifetime expected credit losses or\u00a012-month expected credit losses. A loss allowance for lifetime expected credit losses is required for\u00a0a financial instrument if the credit risk of that financial asset has increased significantly since initial recognition or if the financial instruments are trade receivables, lease liabilities or contract assets. For all other financial instruments, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the\u00a012-month expected credit losses. IFRS\u00a09\u00a0allows entities to apply a simplified approach inter alia for trade receivables. Lifetime expected credit losses on all these assets can be recognised at initial recognition.\u00a0TUI\u00a0applies the simplified approach for all trade receivables. Impairments and reversals of impairments are recognised under ?Impairment / reversals of impairment of financial assets? in the income statement. The equity instruments held in the balance sheet item ?Other financial assets? were irrevocably designated as ?Financial assets at fair value through\u00a0OCI? as they are held for medium- to long-term strategic objectives. These instruments are stakes in associated non-consolidated subsidiaries, equity investments and other investments. Recognising all fluctuations in the fair value in the income statement would not be in line with the Group?s strategy. They are allocated to assets unless the entity intends to sell them within twelve months after the balance sheet date. Dividends from these equity instruments are recognised in the income\u00a0statement unless the dividends are clearly a partial repayment of the cost to purchase the equity instrument. The cumulative gain or loss from the subsequent measurement of the equity instruments recognised in other comprehensive income will continue to be recognised in equity even after the equity instrument has been derecognised and reclassified to revenue reserves. All other financial assets not recognised at amortised cost or at fair value through\u00a0OCI\u00a0must be measured at fair value through profit and loss. Financial assets are derecognised at the date on which the rights for payments from the assets expire or are transferred and therefore at the date on which essentially all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. The rights to an asset expire when the rights to receive the cash flows from the asset have expired. For transfers of financial assets, it is assessed whether they have to be derecognised in accordance with the derecognition requirements of\u00a0IFRS\u00a09. Non-derivative financial liabilities are recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position if an obligation exists to transfer cash and cash equivalents or other financial assets to another party. A non-derivative financial liability is initially recognised at its fair value. For loans taken out, the nominal amount is reduced by discounts retained and transaction costs paid and discounted over the expected remaining term of the liability. The subsequent measurement of non-derivative financial liabilities is effected at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\u00a0TUI\u00a0does not use the fair value option. Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligations specified in the contract are discharged, cancelled or expire. All foreign exchange differences resulting from the translation of trade accounts payable are recognised in the income statement within cost of sales. Foreign exchange differences from the translation of liabilities not resulting from normal operating processes are reported under Other income / expenses, Financial expenses /income or Administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying receivables or payables. The bond with warrants and the convertible bond on shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0have to be accounted for as compound financial instruments. Compound financial instruments are divided into an equity and a debt component in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a032. The debt component shown under financial liabilities is valued, less the pro rata\u00a0transaction costs and added to the repayment amount using the effective interest method. The equity component is valued at the residual value that results after deducting the amount determined for the debt\u00a0component from the fair value of the entire instrument. The pro rata transaction costs of the equity component are deducted from this component. No gain or loss will result from the exercise or expiry of the relevant conversion option. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGE ACCOUNTING At initial measurement, derivative financial instruments are measured at the fair value attributable to them on the date the contract is entered into and recognised in the balance sheet. Subsequent remeasurement is also recognised at the fair value calculated at the respective balance sheet date. Where derivative financial instruments are not part of a designated hedging relationship in connection with hedge accounting, they are classified as ?at fair value through profit and loss?. The method used to recognise gains and losses depends on whether the derivative financial instrument has been fully or possibly only partly designated as a hedging\u00a0instrument, and on the nature of the hedged item. Changes in the fair value of a derivative financial instrument\u00a0not designated as a hedging instrument or the component of a derivative financial instrument not designated as a hedging instrument are immediately recognised through profit and loss. If, by contrast, an effective hedging relationship exists, the transaction is recognised as a hedge. The unrealised gains and losses from\u00a0the fair value valuation of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedging instruments within hedge accounting are initially recognised in equity without affecting profit or loss. In the case of derivative financial instruments that are not part of a hedging relationship, the effect on profit or loss is immediate, i. e. the changes from the fair valuation are recognised through profit and loss. TUI\u00a0Group uses the accounting policy choice provided by\u00a0IFRS\u00a09, enabling entities to continue applying the hedge accounting requirements of\u00a0IAS\u00a039. Hedge accounting is exclusively used to hedge the exposure due to foreign currency and fuel price fluctuations in cash flows from highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges). Hedges of balance sheet items (fair value hedges), i. e. hedges of the fair value of an asset or a liability, which would be accounted for at amortised cost, are currently not designated. Upon entering into a transaction,\u00a0TUI\u00a0documents the hedge relationship between the hedge and the underlying transaction, the risk management goal and the underlying strategy. In addition, a record is kept of the assessment, both at the beginning of the hedge relationship by using the Critical Terms Match method and\u00a0on a continual qualitative basis, as to whether the derivatives used for the hedge are highly effective in compensating for the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the underlying transactions. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives forming cash flow hedges is recognised in equity without affecting profit and loss. Any ineffective portion of such changes in the fair value, by contrast, is recognised immediately in the income statement through profit and loss. Amounts taken to equity are reclassified to the income statement and carried as income or expenses in the period in which the hedged\u00a0item or the hedge has an effect on results or it is no longer highly expected that the hedged item or a corresponding part thereof will occur. If a hedge expires, is sold or no longer meets the criteria of\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0for hedge accounting, the cumulative gain or loss remains in equity and is only recognised in the income statement through profit and loss when the originally hedged future forecasted transaction occurs. If the future transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative gains or losses recognised directly in equity are immediately recognised through profit and loss. More detailed information on the Group?s risk management activities is provided in Note\u00a041\u00a0and as well as in the ?Risk report? section of the Management Report. Contractual assets and trade receivables If\u00a0TUI\u00a0has fulfilled their contractual obligations, contractual assets or trade receivables are carried. Trade receivables are carried if the claim for the acquisition of the consideration is no longer subject to a condition. As a rule, this is the case when the Group is contractually entitled to issue an invoice to the customer that has not yet been paid in advance through a customer deposit. Due to the tourism business model under which customers pay for their travel services in advance,\u00a0TUI\u00a0generally does not have any contractual assets. Contractual costs The direct costs immediately resulting from obtaining a contract, e. g. sales commissions to travel agencies for sales of travel services, are capitalised as contractual costs in the statement of financial position upon payment of the commission. As a rule, the resulting expenses are recognised over the duration of the travel service in line with the associated revenue. Inventories The measurement method applied to similar inventory items is the weighted average cost formula. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash, call deposits, current account balances and other highly liquid current financial assets with an original term of a maximum of three months, such as shares in money market funds. Investments in money market funds are made in shares with a stable net asset value or\u00a0LVNAV\u00a0(low volatility net asset value). The investment criteria of the individual money market funds, their credit ratings, historical performance and stress tests meet the criteria for cash and cash equivalents. As the contractual cash flows of the money market funds do not exclusively comprise interest and principal payments, they are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Bank overdrafts are shown as liabilities to banks under current financial liabilities. Equity Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or conversion options are taken to equity on a net after-tax basis as a deduction from the issuance proceeds. Own shares The group?s holdings in its own equity instruments are shown as deductions from shareholders? equity at cost, including directly attributable transaction costs. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase or sale of shares. Any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost are taken to reserves. Pension provisions The pension provision recognised for defined benefit plans corresponds to the net present value of the defined benefit obligations (DBOs) as at the balance sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. If the value of the plan assets exceeds the value of the\u00a0DBO, the excess amount is shown within other non-financial\u00a0assets as far as the capitalisation is not limited under the asset ceiling defined in\u00a0IAS\u00a019. The\u00a0DBOs are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to public or private pension insurance plans on\u00a0the basis of a statutory or contractual obligation or on a voluntary basis. The Group does not have any further payment obligations on top of the payment of the contributions. The contributions are recognised under staff costs when they fall due. Other provisions Other provisions are formed when the Group has a current legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, where in addition it is probable that assets will be impacted by the settlement of the obligation and the level of the provision can be reliably determined. Where a large number of similar obligations exist, the probability of a charge over assets is determined on the basis of this group of obligations. A provision is also recognised if the probability of a charge over assets is low in relation to an individual obligation contained in this group. Provisions are measured at the present value of the expected expenses, taking account of a pre-tax interest rate, reflecting current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. Risks already taken into account in estimating future cash flows do not affect the discount rate. Increases in provisions due to accretion of interest are recognised as interest expenses through profit or loss. Government grants Government grants are recognised if there is reasonable assurance that\u00a0TUI\u00a0will comply with all attached conditions for receiving the grant and the grant will be awarded. Investment grants received are deducted\u00a0from the carrying amounts of assets in property, plant or equipment where these grants are directly allocable to individual assets. If a direct allocation of grants to individual items of property, plant or equipment is not possible, or if the grants are from other government programmes, the grants and subsidies received are recognised as deferred income and shown within Other liabilities. Grants related to income are deducted from related expenses in the period in which the corresponding expenses are incurred. Government grants\u00a0include, for example, income subsidies or social security contributions for short-time allowances. If short-time allowance is a personal benefit for the employee, the respective payments are not recognised as income in the statement of profit or loss. Touristic advance payments received (contract liabilities) A contract liability is an obligation of the Group to deliver goods or services for a customer for which the customer has already delivered a performance, e. g. in the form of payment of a deposit. In the tourism business model, customers pay deposits on most travel services prior to departure. The deposits received therefore constitute contract liabilities within the meaning of\u00a0IFRS\u00a015. Deferred taxes and income taxes Expected tax savings from the use of tax losses carried forward assessed as recoverable in the future are recognised as deferred tax assets. Regardless of the unlimited ability to carry German tax losses forward which continues to exist, the annual utilisation is limited by the minimum taxation. Foreign tax losses carried forward frequently have to be used within a given country-specific time limit and are subject to restrictions concerning the use of these losses carried forward for profits on ordinary activities, which are taken into account accordingly in the measurement. Income taxes are charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income if the tax relates to items that are charged or credited to equity or recognised in other comprehensive income without affecting Group profit or loss. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference or an unused tax loss can be utilised. Deferred taxes are measured at the tax rates and tax provisions applicable at the balance sheet date or adopted by law and expected to be applicable at the date of recognition of the deferred tax asset or the payment of the deferred tax liability. Deferred and current income tax liabilities are offset against the corresponding tax assets if they exist in the same fiscal territory and have the same nature and maturity. Based on the\u00a0OECD\u00a0initiative, numerous jurisdictions are in the process of the introduction of a global minimum tax. The aim of this minimum taxation is to ensure that multinational groups with a turnover of over ?\u00a0750\u00a0m are subject to a minimum taxation of\u00a015\u00a0%. As a potentially affected company,\u00a0TUI\u00a0is closely following the worldwide development towards the introduction of global minimum taxation and is analysing\u00a0the potential impact on\u00a0TUI. As the transposition into local law has not yet been finalised and the draft regulations published to date are highly complex,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has not yet been able to make a reliable estimate of\u00a0the future impact.\u00a0TUI\u00a0has applied the temporary exception issued by the\u00a0IASB\u00a0in May\u00a02023\u00a0from the accounting requirements for deferred taxes in\u00a0IAS\u00a012. Accordingly,\u00a0TUI\u00a0neither recognises nor discloses information about deferred tax assets and liabilities related to Pillar Two income taxes. Share-based payments Share-based payment schemes in the Group comprise both cash-settled and equity-settled schemes. For cash-settled transactions, the resulting liability for the Group is charged to expenses at its fair value as at the date of the performance of the service by the beneficiary. Until settlement of the liability, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at every closing date and all changes in the fair value are recognised through profit and loss. For equity-settled transactions the fair value of the awards granted is recognised under staff costs with a\u00a0corresponding direct increase in equity. The fair value is determined at the point when the awards are granted and spread over the vesting period during which the employees become entitled to the awards. The method\u00a0for the calculation of the granted awards is described in note\u00a040\u00a0?Share-based payments in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a02?.

Any uncertainties are appropriately taken into account in determining the values. All estimates and assumptions are based on the conditions and assessments as at the balance sheet date. In evaluating the future development of business, reasonable assumptions are made regarding the expected future economic environment in the business areas and regions in which the Group operates. Despite careful preparation of the estimates, actual results may differ from the estimate. In such cases, the assumptions and the carrying amounts of the assets and liabilities concerned, if necessary, are adjusted accordingly. As a matter of principle, changes in estimates are taken into account in the financial year in which the changes have occurred and in future periods. Judgements The judgements made by management in applying accounting policies that may have a significant impact on\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s assets and liabilities mainly relate to the following topics: Assessment of when the Group has control over an investee and therefore consolidates this investment  Definition of whether a Group company acts as an agent or as a principal in a transaction  Determination of whether an agreement is to be classified as a lease or contains a lease  Determination of the term of the lease as a lessee in the event of agreements with extension or termination options Determination of the term of the lease as a lessee TUI\u00a0determines the term of the lease based on the non-cancellable period for which the lessee has the right to use the asset, together with any periods covered by extension options, if exercise of that option by\u00a0TUI\u00a0is reasonably certain, as well as periods covered by termination options if\u00a0TUI\u00a0is reasonably certain that it will\u00a0not exercise that option. Many of\u00a0TUI?s individually negotiated aircraft and real estate leases contain extension or termination options. TUI\u00a0applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain that an option to renew will be exercised or that an option to terminate the lease will not be exercised. In this context,\u00a0TUI\u00a0considers all relevant facts and circumstances that create an economic incentive for\u00a0TUI\u00a0to exercise, or not to exercise, the extension or termination option, respectively. From the commencement date,\u00a0TUI\u00a0remeasures the lease term if there is either a significant event or a significant change in the circumstances within our control that alters any of our\u00a0assessments about what is reasonably certain. The lease term, for instance, is adjusted if an extension option is exercised or if a termination option is not exercised and if this had been considered differently in the original assessment. For aircraft leases, we determine the end of the lease term on the basis of the contractually agreed return date. For medium- to long-term property agreements, e. g. office buildings, hotels or travel agency leases, options to renew the lease are included in the lease term to the extent to which\u00a0TUI\u00a0presumes that the future exercise of the option is reasonably certain in the individual case. For information on potential future lease payments relating to periods after the exercise date for extension or termination options, please refer to Note\u00a015. Assumptions and estimates Assumptions and estimates that may have a material impact on the amounts reported as assets and liabilities in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group are mainly related to the following balance sheet-related facts and circumstances: Assumptions for use in impairment tests, in particular for goodwill and property, plant and equipment  Effect of climate-related risks on the useful lives and the measurement of assets  Determination of the fair values for acquisitions of companies and determination of the useful lives of acquired intangible assets  Determination of useful lives and residual carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment  Determination of actuarial assumptions to measure pension obligations  Recognition and measurement of other provisions  Determination of the incremental borrowing rate used to measure lease liabilities  Recoverability of future tax savings from tax losses carried forward and tax-deductible temporary differences  Measurement of tax risks  Recoverable amounts of touristic prepayments  Determination that the package holiday represents a performance obligation due to the significant integration service  Determination of period-related revenue recognition on a straight-line basis over the duration of the trip  Determination of the expected credit losses (ECL) of financial instruments Assumptions for use in impairment tests, in particular for goodwill andproperty, plant and equipment The impairment tests are performed on the basis of future discounted cash inflows derived from the medium-term corporate planning. Both the derivation of future cash inflows and the determination of the interest rate are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates and are associated with uncertainties, in particular due to the strong general increase in prices and interest rates, which could lead to a decline in demand for tourism products and increased expenses for input factors. In addition assumptions and estimates regarding the financial impact of climate-related risks were made, which are described further below. In the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0TUI\u00a0left behind the impacts of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic. In the holiday experience\u00a0division the complete product portfolio could be offered. In aviation business disruptions did not occur unlike in the financial year\u00a02022. The number of guests reached near pre crisis levels, revenues exceeded pre crisis levels. In contrast the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0was still affected by the general increase in prices, especially for fuel, and by changes in exchange rates.\u00a0TUI\u00a0was insufficiently hedged against these changes due to limited\u00a0access to relevant hedging instruments. However, overall all the segments increased their results in comparison\u00a0to the financial year\u00a02022. For the financial year\u00a02024\u00a0it is expected that customer volumes will reach\u00a02019\u00a0levels. In the course of the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0TUI\u00a0improved its financial position due to the recovery of its business, the capital increase and the prolongation of the\u00a0RCF. Accordingly\u00a0TUI\u00a0has now far more options to hedge against changes in fuel prices or exchange rates. The further digitalisation of our business and the expansion of existing and new business areas are expected to take effect. Below we describe the key assumptions underlying the medium-term business planning in the segments. In its business plan, Hotels &amp; Resorts expects to deliver further earnings growth due to capacity expansion, demand growth and increases in average selling prices. In the Cruises segment, results are expected to recover further in the financial year\u00a02024\u00a0as the winter season of the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0was still affected by the comparative late recovery of demand in\u00a02022. Furthermore, results will increase until\u00a02026\u00a0due to the expansion of the fleets of Marella and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises. In Summer\u00a02023\u00a0Marella took over one cruise ship from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises, which will deliver a full year?s trading result in\u00a02024.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises will launch a new ship in Summer\u00a02024\u00a0and expand its fleet to nine ships (excluding the\u00a0Hapag Lloyd Kreuzfahrten brand) in the following years to\u00a02027. However, the results will be negatively impacted by the cost of meeting the emission reducing regulatory measures, notably the introduction of the\u00a0EU\u00a0emission trading system from\u00a02024. The future development of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement depends in part on the development of customer numbers in Markets &amp; Airlines.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement will also generate growth through the sale of tours, activities and tickets due to the expansion of its own / direct distribution via the internet and the app. In Markets &amp; Airlines, beginning with the financial year\u00a02024\u00a0it is expected that customer numbers will reach\u00a02019\u00a0levels. Wider use of online distribution and distribution by the app, the provision of dynamic production\u00a0capacities for flights and accommodation and the investments in digitalisation are expected to further improve\u00a0the results. In addition,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has now by far more options to hedge against changes in fuel prices and in exchange rates in comparison to financial year\u00a02023. Conversely the emission trading system of the\u00a0EU\u00a0and\u00a0Great Britain will lead to higher expenses. In addition, the usage of alternative fuels with lower climate-damaging emissions will increase in order to reach emission reduction targets for\u00a02030\u00a0and beyond. These fuels are more expensive than conventional kerosine. For further information on assumptions and estimates in relation to climate related risks we refer to the section below. Other key factors are the weighted average cost of capital after income taxes (WACC), on which discounting is based, the sustainable growth rate and the growth in perpetuity. Changes in these assumptions may have a significant impact on the recoverable amount and the amount of any impairment loss. The weighted average cost of capital after income taxes (WACC), on which discounting is based, was derived from external capital market information about comparable companies. The cost of capital to Markets &amp;\u00a0Airlines was increased by an additional risk premium of\u00a02.1\u00a0% (previous year:\u00a01.9\u00a0%). This additional risk premium was based on an analysis of internal and external market expectations and reflects the elevated uncertainty with regard to medium- and long-term market developments. Additional country-specific risk premiums are included, in particular, in the measurement of individual hotels. For further details on the determination of\u00a0WACC\u00a0refer to the section ?Goodwill?. Finally we have implemented sensitivity analyses to estimate the uncertainty associated with the assumptions\u00a0on which the impairment tests are based. The sensitivities and their impact on the fair value result exclusively\u00a0from the adjustment of individual parameters. Possible compensatory measures were not taken into account.\u00a0Sensitivities have been calculated for changes of the\u00a0WACC\u00a0and sustainable growth in perpetuity. In addition, sensitivity analyses have been carried out for a general increase or decrease of future cash flows and for material climate related risks. For further details refer to the section ?Goodwill?. Effect of climate-related risks on the useful lives and the measurement of assets Overview of climate related risks The tourism industry faces significant impacts from climate change. As temperature rises the attractiveness\u00a0of certain destinations might decline. Extreme weather events due to climate change might damage our assets and might lead to increased cancellations of holidays. Political and legal developments might increase the\u00a0expenses for emission certificates and customer preferences might change. Climate change might also present\u00a0opportunities for\u00a0TUI\u00a0to extending the touristic season in summer destinations or to diversify to new regions. All these changes impact to some extend already and will have a more significant impact on long term financial performance. As a result of climate-related risks\u00a0TUI\u00a0has committed to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) to reduce emissions by\u00a02030\u00a0in comparison to a baseline\u00a02019. Our targets are: Reduction of airline\u00a0CO2e per revenue passenger kilometer by\u00a024\u00a0% by\u00a02030  Reduction of absolute\u00a0CO2e from our cruise operations by\u00a027.5\u00a0% by\u00a02030  Reduction of absolute\u00a0CO2e from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Hotels &amp; Resorts by\u00a046.2\u00a0% by\u00a02030 Furthermore it is the commitment of\u00a0TUI\u00a0to achieve net-zero emissions by\u00a02050. The reduction of emissions will be accomplished with investments in new technologies and the use of fuel with less\u00a0CO2\u00a0emissions. To assess the impact of climate-related risks on our financial performance and business model\u00a0TUI\u00a0has conducted a qualitative and quantitative climate risk assessment in the financial year\u00a02023. A number of assumptions underpin this assessment regarding changes to the intensity and frequency of weather related\u00a0events, technology development, development of energy and carbon prices and the development of knowledge on global warming. The impact of climate-related risks was assessed for two scenarios, one scenario which\u00a0implies a global warming of approximately\u00a04.3\u00b0C and a scenario which implies a global warming of approximately\u00a01.5\u00b0C, both by\u00a02100. The analysis was carried out for the periods until\u00a02030,\u00a02040\u00a0and until\u00a02050. The level of uncertainty of the results of the analysis increases over time. Given the uncertainty\u00a0TUI\u00a0has applied critical estimation and judgment in the evaluation of the impact of climate-related risks regarding the recognition and measurement within its financial statements which are described below. Effect of climate-related risks on the useful lives of assets The useful lives of assets can be affected by climate-related risks in different ways: Physical changes in the climate like an increased frequency and intensity of acute events (storms, fire and floodings) as well as long term trends like increased temperature might impact our assets  Transitional changes related to the transition to a low-carbon economy including policy, legal, technology and market changes might affect the use of our assets In the assessment of the impact of the climate change on the useful lives of our assets\u00a0TUI\u00a0applied the following assumptions and estimates: The impact of physical risks on our aircrafts and our cruise ships is assumed to be low. Both assets could be flexibly used and itineraries or flight routes could be adjusted. The main risk relates to the commitment of\u00a0TUI\u00a0to decarbonize its business. However, all aircrafts of the current aircraft fleet have the capability to utilise sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). In addition the useful lives of our aircrafts, which are mainly leased and\u00a0recognised as right of use assets, end before\u00a02050\u00a0so that\u00a0TUI\u00a0could replace the aircraft with new technologies such as hydrogen powered aircraft if these prove viable. Likewise our cruise ships can either already utilise sustainable marine fuel (SMF) or can be converted to do so. Accordingly\u00a0TUI\u00a0concluded that climate-related risks do not affect the useful life of aircrafts or cruise ships. TUI\u00a0assessed as well the useful lives of our Hotels in light of climate related risks. Based on the aforementioned analysis\u00a0TUI\u00a0concludes that the risk from acute weather events like storms, fire and floodings will increase only to a level which is still manageable through insurance and the large and regional spread of our hotels &amp; resorts portfolio. Furthermore the increase of these risks will most likely occur in the long term so that our leased hotels with a relatively short useful life are less affected. Based on this analysis\u00a0TUI\u00a0concludes that none of our hotels will have a reduced useful life due to sea level rise. The risk for our hotels relating to the decarbonization of our business is assumed to be low as there exists already technology to produce carbon neutral energy for example from renewable sources such as solar panels or wind turbines. The useful lives of our hotels could also be affected by consumer behaviour reacting to increased temperatures. Certain destinations might see a reduced number of tourists in the long term, especially in the peak season e. g. in summer in the Mediteranean. However, it is assumed that the shoulder seasons in spring and autumn will become broader which will mitigate this effect. In addition\u00a0TUI\u00a0has the ability to steer our customers to our owned Hotels and to manage reduced numbers of guests through reduction in use of\u00a03rd party capacity. Overall,\u00a0TUI\u00a0does not see any impact of climate-related risks on the useful life of hotels. Overall, useful lives and residual values have not been amended in the prior and current financial year as a result of climate related risks. Impact of climate-related risks on the measurement of deferred tax assetsin relation to losses carried forward TUI\u00a0applies a five-year planning horizon derived from its medium-term corporate planning when determining the usability of tax losses carried forward and deductible temporary differences. Medium-term climate-related risks are factored into the measurement of deferred tax assets in relation to losses carried forward. Accordingly, the considerably higher charges that will occur in the long term do not impact the measurement of deferred tax assets in relation to losses carried forward. Impact of climate-related risks on impairment tests, in particular for goodwilland property, plant and equipment When performing impairment tests, the discounted future financial charges determined on the basis of the\u00a0above-mentioned climate-related risk analysis were deducted from the discounted future cash flow surpluses calculated based on our medium-term planning. Due to the long-term nature of these future charges and uncertain technological and regulatory developments, the charges determined in this manner are subject to a high level of uncertainty. The underlying assumption is that until\u00a02030\u00a0TUI\u00a0will reduce its climate-damaging emissions in accordance with the\u00a0SBTi and will subsequently follow a linear path to achieving net-zero emissions by\u00a02050. It is likewise assumed that the emissions of our suppliers are reduced for the period until\u00a02050. These will be achieved in particular by gradually replacing aircraft fuel and bunker oil with fuels that do not cause climate-damaging emissions. The expectation here is that these fuels will be available in sufficient quantities. This assumption depends on the development of technologies and production capacities and is therefore subject to elevated\u00a0uncertainty. A key estimate concerns price movements for fuels without greenhouse gas emissions. Currently\u00a0the prices for these fuels are by far higher as conventional fuels. It is assumed that the prices will level off by\u00a02050. Technological innovation, such as in the form of hydrogen-powered aircraft, is not taken into account. Greater fuel efficiency was only considered insofar as it relates to the planned fleet renewal in aviation or else can be achieved by means of known technologies such as underwater coatings on cruise ships. Fleet expansion in the Cruises segment has also been factored in. In the segment Hotels &amp; Resorts, it is assumed that emission reductions will be achieved by means of existing and continued investments in renewable energies, such as solar panels. This reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will be underpinned by a public regulatory framework encompassing everyone, including\u00a0TUI?s suppliers, leading in particular to a reduction in free emission allowances or an increase in the price of emission certificates. While harmful gas emissions will be reduced in the manner described above, rising prices for emission certificates will generate substantial financial charges before the expenses for emission certificates drop to zero in\u00a02050. The calculation of these financial charges reflects\u00a0TUI?s own costs and the costs of emission certificates passed on by suppliers. In addition, physical risks from climate-related one-off events such as storms or floods or long-term developments such as rising temperatures, affecting the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment, were taken into account. Average annual charges were determined based on external studies. It is expected that the financial impact of these climate-related risks are relatively low. Overall, the use of low-emission fuels and rising prices for emission certificates will lead to significant financial charges, particularly for energy-intensive aviation operations in the Northern Region, Western Region, and Central Region segments. The Cruises segment will also be impacted. In Hotels &amp; Resorts segment, the burden will be relatively low; in fact, the autonomous generation of energy, such as by means of solar power, may even generate cost savings. One key assumption, then, concerns the extent to which costs for low-emission fuels and emission certificates can be passed on to customers.\u00a0TUI\u00a0assumes that the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions will generate general price increases (green inflation).\u00a0TUI\u00a0additionally benefits from opportunities to pass on costs across the entire value chain. Overall,\u00a0TUI\u00a0therefore assumes that it will be able to pass on\u00a090\u00a0% of the costs in aviation, a sector that is particularly affected, and\u00a095\u00a0% in other sectors. In the light of the uncertainties regarding the long-term financial burden from climate-related risks,\u00a0TUI\u00a0has calculated sensitivities for the particularly affected Markets &amp; Airlines and Cruises. These are presented in the section on ?Goodwill?. The sensitivities relate to assumptions on the development of climate related risks\u00a0in general, the development of prices for alternative fuels and emission certifivates and the potential for\u00a0passing on climate change-related costs to our customers. Overall,\u00a0TUI\u00a0does not regard climate-related risks as a triggering event for carrying out impairment tests. Business acquisitions and intangible assets In accounting for business combinations, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired have to be measured at their fair values. In this context, cash flow-based methods are regularly used, which may lead to different results depending on the underlying assumptions. In particular, some judgement is\u00a0required in estimating the economic useful lives of intangible assets and determining the fair values of contingent liabilities. Detailed information on business acquisitions and useful lives of intangible assets is provided in the section ?Acquisitions ? divestments? in the section on ?Principles and methods of consolidation? and in the section on ?Goodwill and other intangible assets? of the section ?Accounting and measurement methods?. Property, plant and equipment The measurement of wear-and-tear to property, plant and equipment items entails estimates. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0totals ?\u00a03,480.3\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a03,400.9\u00a0m). Material assumptions and estimates are the determination of useful lives and residual carrying amounts of property, plant and equipment. The effects of climate-related risks are also taken into account\u00a0here. From the analysis to review the amounts carried, an evaluation is carried out on a regular basis to assess whether there are any indications of a potential impairment. These indications relate to a number of areas\u00a0and factors, e. g. the market-related or technical environment but also physical condition. If any such indication\u00a0exists, management must estimate the recoverable amount on the basis of expected cash flows and appropriate interest rates. More detailed information on the useful lives and residual values of property, plant and equipment items is\u00a0provided in the section ?Property, plant and equipment? in the section ?Accounting and measurement methods?. Pension provisions As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, the carrying amount of provisions for pensions and similar obligations totals ?\u00a0670.4\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0601.3\u00a0m). For those pension plans where the plan assets exceed the obligation, other non-financial assets amounting to ?\u00a098.5\u00a0m are shown as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year ?\u00a0163.4\u00a0m). In order to determine the obligations under defined benefit pension schemes, actuarial calculations are used which rely on underlying assumptions concerning life expectancy and the discount rate. At the balance sheet date, the fair value of the plan assets totals ?\u00a01,905.8\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a02,076.4\u00a0m). As assets classified as plan assets are never available for short-term sale, the fair values of these plan assets may change significantly up to the realisation date. Detailed information on actuarial assumptions is provided in Note\u00a030. Other provisions As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, other provisions amount to ?\u00a01,181.9\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a01,296.0\u00a0m). When recognising and measuring provisions, assumptions to a considerable content regarding the probability of occurrence, maturity and level of risk are required. Determining whether a current obligation exists is usually based on review by internal or external experts. The amount of provisions is based on expected expenses, and is either calculated by assessing the specific case in the light of empirical values, outcomes from comparable circumstances or ranges of possible claims, or else estimated by experts. Due to the uncertainties associated with assessment, actual expenses may deviate from estimates so that unexpected charges may result. More detailed information on Other provisions is provided in the Notes to the statement of financial position in Note\u00a031. Lease liabilities As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, lease liabilities worth ?\u00a02,918.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a03,207.5\u00a0m) were carried, reflecting the present value of the future lease payments as at that date. The interest rate implicit in the lease can only\u00a0be easily determined in exceptional cases. In all other cases\u00a0TUI\u00a0therefore uses its own incremental borrowing rate to measure the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate is the interest rate\u00a0TUI\u00a0would have to pay to borrow over a similar term, and with a similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in a similar economic environment. Determining the incremental borrowing rate therefore regularly involves estimates regarding the interest rate the Group would have to pay. In this context, estimates are required, for instance, to determine the interest the Group companies would have to pay if no observable interest rates are available, or if adjustments are required regarding the specific agreed terms and conditions such as the transaction currency or contract term.\u00a0TUI\u00a0determines the incremental borrowing rate using observable inputs (bond yields and\u00a0CDS\u00a0quotations) and makes specific adjustments for individual companies (e. g. country risk premiums). Deferred tax assets As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, deferred tax assets totalling ?\u00a0310.6\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0222.0\u00a0m) were recognised. Prior to offsetting against deferred tax liabilities, deferred tax assets total ?\u00a0675.7\u00a0m, including an amount of\u00a0?\u00a0269.4\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0194.4\u00a0m) for recognised losses carried forward. The assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on the ability of the respective Group company to generate sufficient taxable income.\u00a0TUI\u00a0therefore assesses at every balance sheet date whether the recoverability of expected future tax savings is sufficiently probable in order to recognise deferred tax assets. The assessment is based on various factors including internal forecasts regarding the future earnings situation of the Group company.\u00a0TUI\u00a0uses a five-year planning horizon to derive the recoverability of tax loss carryforwards and deductible differences. If the assessment of the recoverability of deferred tax assets changes, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets will be reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow the benefit of part or all of that deferred tax asset to be utilised. Any such reduction\u00a0is subsequently reversed to the extent that it becomes probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available. More detailed information on deferred tax assets is available in the Notes to the statement of financial position in Note\u00a020. Income taxes The Group is liable to pay income taxes in various countries. Key estimates are required when determining income tax liabilities, including the probability, the timing and the size of any amounts that may become\u00a0payable. For certain transactions and calculations the final tax charge cannot be determined during the\u00a0ordinary course of business. After taking appropriate external advice, the Group makes provisions or discloses contingencies for uncertain tax positions based on the probable or possible level of additional taxes that might be incurred. The level of obligations for expected tax audits is based on an estimation of whether and to what extent additional income taxes will be due. Judgements are corrected, if necessary, in the period in which the final tax charge is determined. Recoverable amounts of touristic prepayments As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, the carrying amount of touristic prepayments totals ?\u00a0939.9\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0757.6\u00a0m). The assessment of the recoverable amounts of touristic prepayments made to hoteliers requires judgement about the volume of future trading with hoteliers and the credit worthiness of those hoteliers. To assess the recoverability of touristic prepayments,\u00a0TUI\u00a0considers the financial strength of those hoteliers, the quality of the hotels as well as the demand for each hotel and the relevant destination during the past and in forthcoming seasons. Financial instruments When measuring\u00a0ECL\u00a0of financial instruments under\u00a0IFRS\u00a09\u00a0TUI\u00a0uses, besides historical information, reasonable and supportable forward-looking information, which is based on assumptions for the future movement of different economic drivers. The uncertainty remains that this future\u00a0ECL\u00a0will not be in line with actual default rates due to market development. Segment Reporting Notes to the segments The identification of operating segments is based on the internal organisational and reporting structure primarily built around the different products and services as well as a geographical structure within\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group.\u00a0Allocation of individual organisational entities to operating segments is exclusively based on economic criteria,\u00a0irrespective of the participation structure under company law. The segments are independently managed by those in charge, who regularly receive separate financial information for each segment. They regularly report to the Group Executive Committee, which consists of six Executive Board members and five other executives. The legally binding decision regarding the use of resources is taken by the Executive Board.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s Executive Board has therefore been identified as the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a08. The Hotels &amp; Resorts segment comprises all Group-owned hotels and hotel shareholdings of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. The Cruises segment consists of the joint venture\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises, its subsidiary Hapag-Lloyd Cruises as well as the British cruise business Marella Cruises. The\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement segment comprises the companies providing services in the destinations. The income statement items of the aircraft leasing companies holding\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s aircraft and subletting\u00a0them within the Group have been fully allocated to the airlines using the respective aircraft (Northern\u00a0Region, Central Region and Western Region segments). The Northern Region segment comprises the tour operators and airlines in the\u00a0UK, Ireland and the Nordic countries and the stake in the tour operation business of the Canadian company Sunwing. Our strategic investment in Sunwing Travel Inc., Canada, sold its tour operator business, which was previously included in this segment, in May\u00a02023. This segment also includes the tour operator\u00a0TUI\u00a0Lakes &amp; Mountains, which plays a major role in securing the load factor for our\u00a0UK\u00a0aircraft fleet in winter. The Central Region segment comprises the tour operators and airlines in Germany and tour operators in Austria, Poland and Switzerland. The Western Region segment comprises the tour operators and airlines in Belgium and the Netherlands and tour operators in France. Apart from the above segments, the recognised items also include All other segments. This comprises in particular the central corporate functions and interim holdings of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group and the Group?s real estate companies, as well as central tourism functions such as information technology. The Future Markets Division\u00a0was dissolved in the year under review and the activities managed here were reclassified from All other segments to the Hotels &amp; Resorts,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement and Central Region segments. The prior periods were adjusted. Notes to the segment data The selection of segment data presented is based on the regular internal reporting to the Executive Board.\u00a0From the\u00a02020\u00a0financial year onwards, adjusted\u00a0EBIT\u00a0is the segment performance indicator within the\u00a0meaning of\u00a0IFRS\u00a08. We define the\u00a0EBIT\u00a0in underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0as earnings before interest, income taxes and result of the measurement\u00a0of the Group?s interest hedges.\u00a0EBIT\u00a0by definition includes goodwill impairments. Underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0is adjusted for by income and expense items impacting or distorting the assessment of the operating profitability of the segments and the Group due to their level and frequency. These separately disclosed items include gains on disposal from investments, major gains and losses from the sale of assets and major restructuring and integration expenses. In addition, adjustments are carried for all effects from purchase price allocations, ancillary acquisition costs and conditional purchase price payments. Adjustments made in the reconciliation to underlying\u00a0EBIT\u00a0also include goodwill impairments. In financial year\u00a02023, net income totalling ?\u00a045.8\u00a0m was adjusted as separately disclosed items. The adjusted separately disclosed items for the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0include a positive gain on disposal of\u00a0?\u00a091\u00a0m from the sale of the tour operator business by the equity method accounted company Sunwing Travel\u00a0Group Inc., Ontario in the Northern Region segment and a profit share from the disposal of our\u00a049\u00a0% stake in the joint venture Riu Hotels S. A. to a company of the Riu Group in the financial year\u00a02021\u00a0(?\u00a03\u00a0m). In addition, expenses in connection with the sale of an investment in All other segments (?\u00a01\u00a0m) and in the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment (?\u00a01\u00a0m) were adjusted. The adjusted restructuring expenses related to the Central Region (?\u00a04\u00a0m), All other segments (?\u00a045\u00a0m, in particular from the impairment of software) and\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement (?\u00a05\u00a0m, mainly from the revaluation of the risk following the termination of the Tantur /\u00a0TUI\u00a0Russia business in the\u00a0previous financial year). This was contrasted by income from the reversal of restructuring provisions no longer\u00a0required in the Northern Region (?\u00a03\u00a0m) and Western Region (?\u00a01\u00a0m) as well as in Hotels &amp; Resorts (?\u00a04\u00a0m). In financial year\u00a02022, net expenses totalling ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m were adjusted as separately disclosed items. The adjusted separately disclosed items for financial year\u00a02022\u00a0include restructuring expenses of ?\u00a094\u00a0m in the Hotels &amp; Resorts (?\u00a037\u00a0m), Central Region (?\u00a021\u00a0m), Northern Region (?\u00a019\u00a0m),\u00a0TUI\u00a0Musement (?\u00a09\u00a0m), All Other Segments (?\u00a014\u00a0m) and Western Region (?\u00a03\u00a0m) segments. Restructuring expenses also include income of ?\u00a09\u00a0m from the reversal of restructuring provisions no longer required in Western Region. In addition, income of ?\u00a019\u00a0m from the sale of the shares in Nordotel S.A, fully consolidated in the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment, to Grupotel dos S. A., a joint venture of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, income of ?\u00a016\u00a0m from the subsequent\u00a0purchase price adjustment of the disposal of our\u00a049\u00a0% stake in the Riu Hotels S. A. joint venture to a company\u00a0of the Riu Group in the previous year was adjusted. The adjusted expenses of ?\u00a023.7\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a030.1\u00a0m) from purchase price allocations mainly include scheduled amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions made in previous years. In accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a08\u00a0TUI\u00a0presents intercompany leases ? in line with the internal steering logic ? as if they were\u00a0IAS\u00a017\u00a0Operating leases in segment reporting. Apart from this indicator, internal and external revenue, depreciation and amortisation, impairments of other intangible assets (excluding goodwill), property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and investments as well as the share of result of joint ventures and associates are likewise shown for each segment, as these amounts are included when determining underlying\u00a0EBIT. As a rule, intersegment business transactions are based on the arm?s length principle, as applied in transactions with third parties. No single external\u00a0customer accounts for\u00a010\u00a0% or more of revenue. Assets and liabilities by segment are not included in the reporting to the Executive Board and are therefore not shown in segment reporting. Depreciation and write-backs relate to non-current assets by region. Non-current assets by region contain other intangible assets, property, plant and equipment, right-of-use assets and specific other non-current assets that do not meet the definition of financial instruments.

On the other hand, lower expenses were incurred for other interest and similar expenses, largely due to lower interest expenses in connection with the early redemption of the warrant bond and Silent Participation\u00a0II\u00a0of the\u00a0ESF\u00a0and lower expenses for exchange rate changes in lease liabilities in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a016.

In addition,\u00a0TUI\u00a0completed a capital increase on April\u00a024,\u00a02023\u00a0in which subscription rights were issued to the existing shareholders. As the subscription price of the new shares was below the market price of the existing shares, the capital increase included a bonus component. To take into account that the number of shares outstanding had increased without a corresponding change in resources, the weighted average number of shares was adjusted according to\u00a0IAS\u00a033\u00a0for all periods presented. The weighted average number of shares was therefore increased retrospectively for the time-weighted effect of the issue of subscription rights by\u00a061,556,666\u00a0shares (prior year:\u00a0109,600,893\u00a0shares). Dilution of earnings per share generally occurs when the average number of shares is increased by the addition of the issue of potential shares. This is not the case in the event of a loss. The situation described below therefore had no dilutive effect as at the previous year?s reporting date. In April and July\u00a02021, a convertible bond was issued for a total of ?\u00a0589.6\u00a0m. At a current conversion price of ?\u00a026.67\u00a0per share, the number of potential shares amounts to\u00a022.1\u00a0m.

In financial year\u00a02023, an increase in the carrying amount of goodwill of ?\u00a00.4\u00a0m (previous year reduction of ?\u00a022.5\u00a0m) resulted from foreign exchange differences. The following table presents a breakdown of goodwill by cash-generating unit (CGU) at carrying amounts. ?Other? consists of the two independent cash-generating units, Robinson, and Midnight International (formerly Blue Diamond), which belong to the Hotels &amp; Resorts segment.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_148\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Goodwill per cash-generating unit</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Northern Region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,185.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,204.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Central Region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">502.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">502.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Western Region</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">412.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">412.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Riu</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">343.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">343.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Marella Cruises</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">294.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">288.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">TUI\u00a0Musement</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">167.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">171.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">44.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">47.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,949.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,970.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, an impairment test of capitalised goodwill was performed at the level of cash-generating units. No impairments of capitalised goodwill were identified. For all\u00a0CGUs, the recoverable amount was determined on the basis of fair value less costs of disposal, being the higher value compared to the value in use. The fair value was calculated by discounting the expected cashflows. This was based on the medium-term plan for the respective entity as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. Budgeted revenues and\u00a0EBIT\u00a0margins are based on expectations with regard to the future business performance. We refer to the section ?Key judgements, assumptions and estimates?. The discount rates are calculated as the weighted average cost of capital, taking account of country-specific risks of the\u00a0CGU\u00a0and based on external capital market information. The unchanged high weighted average cost of capital reflects the current market situation. The table below provides an overview of the parameters versus the previous financial year, underlying the determination of the fair values per\u00a0CGU. As in the previous year, the\u00a0EBIT\u00a0margin has been adjusted for deductions of centrally incurred costs.

The financial year of the Canadian associated companies corresponds to\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s financial year. The\u00a0financial years of Pep Toni Hotels S. A. and of the joint ventures deviate from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s financial year, ending on\u00a031\u00a0December. In order to update the at equity measurement as at\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s balance sheet date, interim financial statements for the period ending\u00a030\u00a0September are prepared for these companies. Significant associates In\u00a02009,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group entered into a partnership with Sunwing. Sunwing was a vertically integrated travel\u00a0company comprising tour operation, an airline and retail shops. After the transfer of the hotel operation\u00a0and development company Blue Diamond Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc., St Michael / Barbados, to Sunwing in\u00a0September\u00a02016, Sunwing also included the hotel operation business with a chain of luxury beach resorts\u00a0and hotels in the Caribbean and Mexico. Sunwing?s hotel operation business is carried in the Hotels &amp;\u00a0Resorts segment, while the tour operation business is carried in the Northern Region segment. Sunwing transferred its tour operation, airline and retail shops to the Canadian airline WestJet Airlines Ltd. in the current financial year. Sunwing received essentially shares of the newformed business as consideration and in addition contingent considerations. Within the framework of the transaction the hotel operations business was transferred to the newly formed Midnight International Holdings Limited, in which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group directly holds\u00a049\u00a0% of its shares. Sunwing itself has no longer any operative business after the transaction\u00a0and was renamed in Midnight Canada Inc.\u00a0TUI\u00a0group continues to hold\u00a049\u00a0% of the shares of Midnight\u00a0Canada Inc. Sunwing realised a gain from the transfer of its activities in return for the shares in the newformed business. Accordingly, this gain increased pro rata the share of result of investments accounted for using the equity method by ?\u00a0110.3\u00a0m. A portion of the goodwill allocated to the segment Northern Region was disposed with the transfer of the operational business of Sunwing. This portion was determined as the relative value of the operations of Sunwing disposed of in relation to the retained segment Northern Region. The expense of ?\u00a019.5\u00a0m from the disposal of the goodwill is recognised in other expenses. Pep Toni Hotels S. A. is a company founded at the end of the reporting year, which will own and operate hotels. Significant joint ventures Grupotel dos S. A., founded in\u00a01998, owns and operates hotels in the Balearic and the Canary Islands. TUI\u00a0Cruises GmbH is a joint venture with the\u00a0US\u00a0shipping line Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd established in\u00a02008. The Hamburg-based company offers German-speaking cruises for the premium market.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Cruises GmbH currently operates eleven cruise ships.

The sale of the aircraft engines took place in February\u00a02023. As of March\u00a031,\u00a02023, the shares in the non-consolidated investment Peakwork\u00a0AG\u00a0with a value of ?\u00a024.0\u00a0m were classified as held for sale. The shares were sold in April\u00a02023. The purchase price payment of ?\u00a024.0\u00a0m was made in April\u00a02023. As of June\u00a030,\u00a02023, the Riu Punta Nizuc plot in Mexico with a total value of ?\u00a039.7\u00a0m was classified as held for sale. The plot was sold on September\u00a06,\u00a02023. The purchase price amounted to\u00a0MXN\u00a0817.0\u00a0m. As at the end of the prior financial year, the building at Jet Set House (Crawley) of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Airways Limited was classified as held for sale (?\u00a02.7\u00a0m). The disposal transaction was completed on\u00a03\u00a0October\u00a02022. The purchase price payment of\u00a0GBP\u00a06.5\u00a0m was made on\u00a03\u00a0October\u00a02022. (24) Subscribed capital The fully paid subscribed capital of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0consists of no-par value shares, each representing an identical\u00a0share in the capital stock. The proportionate share in the capital stock per no-par value share is ?\u00a01.00. As the\u00a0capital stock consists of registered shares, the owners are listed by name in the share register. The subscribed\u00a0capital of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0is registered in the commercial registers of the district courts of Berlin-Charlottenburg and Hanover. In the past financial year, after prior smoothing of the share capital through the retirement of three shares, the existing share capital of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0in the amount of ?\u00a01,785,205,850.00, divided into\u00a01,785,205,850\u00a0no-par value registered shares with a proportionate amount of the share capital of ?\u00a01.00\u00a0per no-par value share, was reduced in accordance with the provisions on capital reduction pursuant to sections\u00a0222\u00a0et seq. AktG in\u00a0conjunction with Section\u00a07\u00a0(6)\u00a0WStBG\u00a0for the purpose of transferring a part of the capital stock to the\u00a0company?s capital reserve by ?\u00a01,606,685,265.00\u00a0to ?\u00a0178,520,585.00. The reduction was effected by consolidation of shares. The capital reduction was carried out at a ratio of ten to one, so that ten no-par value registered shares were merged to form one no-par value registered share. The capital reduction was related to a recapitalisation of the Company within the meaning of Sec.\u00a022\u00a0StFG.\u00a0The reduction amount of ?\u00a01,606,685,265.00\u00a0was allocated to the Company?s non-distributable capital\u00a0reserve in accordance with Sec.\u00a07\u00a0(6) Sentence\u00a05\u00a0WStBG. Following the capital reduction, the Company?s capital stock in the amount of ?\u00a0178,520,585.00, divided into\u00a0178,520,585\u00a0no-par value registered shares was increased by issuing\u00a0328,910,448\u00a0new no-par value registered\u00a0shares with a proportionate amount of the share capital of ?\u00a01.00\u00a0per no-par value share to ?\u00a0507,431,033.00, divided into\u00a0507,431,033\u00a0no-par value registered shares. This increase in capital stock totalling ?\u00a0328.9\u00a0m was carried out using the authorisations granted by the Annual Stockholders? Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0to issue new registered shares against cash contributions for a maximum total of ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I) and to issue new shares against cash or non-cash contributions in the amount of ?\u00a0626.9\u00a0m (Authorised\u00a0Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0II\u00a0) entirely from authorised capital. Conditional capital The Annual General Meeting on\u00a09\u00a0February\u00a02016\u00a0had created conditional capital of ?\u00a0150.0\u00a0m for the issuance\u00a0of\u00a0bonds. The authorisation to acquire bonds with conversion or option rights or obligations or profit participation\u00a0rights (with or without a fixed term) was limited to a nominal amount of ?\u00a02.0\u00a0bn and expired on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02021.\u00a0This authorisation was fully utilised with the issuance of a bond with warrants totalling ?\u00a0150.0\u00a0m to the\u00a0Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF) in October\u00a02020. The outstanding bonds and warrants were repurchased in full on\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023\u00a0without the\u00a0ESF\u00a0having previously exercised its option right. The Extraordinary General Meeting on\u00a05\u00a0January\u00a02021\u00a0resolved to create conditional capital of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m in order to grant the\u00a0ESF\u00a0the right to convert\u00a0ESF?s asset contribution in the form of a silent participation of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m (?Silent Participation I?) at any time (in a single or several transactions) in full or in part into up to\u00a0420\u00a0m new no-par value registered shares with a proportionate share in the capital stock of ?\u00a01.0\u00a0per no-par value share. The new shares will be issued at the minimum issuance amount of ?\u00a01.0. The silent participation I was repaid in full on\u00a027\u00a0April\u00a02023\u00a0without\u00a0ESF\u00a0having previously exercised its conversion right. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a025\u00a0March\u00a02021\u00a0resolved to create conditional capital for the issuance of bonds totalling ?\u00a0109.9\u00a0m. The authorisation to acquire bonds with conversion or option rights or obligations or profit participation rights (with or without a fixed term) was limited to a nominal amount of ?\u00a02.0\u00a0bn and\u00a0expires on\u00a024\u00a0March\u00a02026. This authorisation was fully utilised with the issuance of a convertible bond totalling\u00a0?\u00a0589.6\u00a0m in April and July\u00a02021. As at the reporting date, no shares had been issued to serve the convertible bond. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0resolved to create two further amounts of conditional capital for the issuance of bonds worth ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m and ?\u00a081.1\u00a0m. The authorisation to acquire bonds with conversion or option rights or obligations or profit participation rights (with or without a fixed term) was limited to a nominal amount of ?\u00a02.0\u00a0bn and expires on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02027. As of\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, unused conversion rights of issued convertible bonds result in conditional capital of ?\u00a0109.9\u00a0m. In addition,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0has unused conditional capital in the amount of ?\u00a0243.4\u00a0m as of the balance sheet date, resulting in total unused conditional capital in the amount of ?\u00a0353.3\u00a0m. Authorised capital The Annual General Meeting on\u00a013\u00a0February\u00a02018\u00a0resolved to create authorised capital of ?\u00a030.0\u00a0m for the issuance of employee shares. The Executive Board of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0was authorised to use this capital in one or\u00a0several transactions to issue employee shares against cash contribution by\u00a012\u00a0February\u00a02023. No new employee\u00a0shares were issued in the completed financial year. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0resolved to authorise the Executive Board to issue new registered shares against cash contributions for up to a maximum of ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I). This authorisation will expire on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02027. The Annual General Meeting on\u00a08\u00a0February\u00a02022\u00a0also resolved to create authorised capital for the issuance\u00a0of new shares against cash and non-cash contribution of ?\u00a0626.9\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0II). The issuance\u00a0of new shares against non-cash contributions is limited to ?\u00a0162.3\u00a0m. The authorisation for this capital will expire on\u00a07\u00a0February\u00a02027. In the past fiscal year, the capital stock was increased by ?\u00a0328.9\u00a0m by making partial use of the latter two authorisations for authorised capital. Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/ I was mainly used in the amount of ?\u00a0140.4\u00a0m to fully repay the federal stabilisation measures and Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0II\u00a0was used in the amount of ?\u00a0188.5\u00a0m to reduce KfW credit lines. By resolution of the Annual General Meeting on\u00a014\u00a0February\u00a02023, the authorised capital of originally ?\u00a0671.0\u00a0m (Authorised Capital\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a0III) was deleted from the Articles of association without replacement, as the intended purpose of this authorisation was achieved in June\u00a02022\u00a0with the repayment of the Silent participation\u00a0II\u00a0granted by the\u00a0ESF. At the balance sheet date, total authorisations for unused authorised capital amounted to around ?\u00a0460.3\u00a0m\u00a0(prior year around ?\u00a01,320.2\u00a0m, of which ?\u00a0508.7\u00a0m could no longer be used). The further use of unused\u00a0authorised capital is subject to the Executive Board?s binding declaration of commitment from February\u00a02023,\u00a0which was announced at the Annual General Meeting, that it will be used primarily for the completion of the stabilisation measures respectively primarily for the reduction of KfW credit lines. (25) Capital reserves The capital reserves comprise transfers of premiums. They also comprise amounts entitling the holders to acquire shares in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0in the framework of bonds issued for conversion options and warrants. In the completed financial year, capital reserves rose by ?\u00a03,004.2\u00a0m from ?\u00a06,085.9\u00a0m to ?\u00a09,090.1\u00a0m. ?\u00a01,606.7\u00a0m\u00a0were transferred from subscribed capital to capital reserves in the context of the consolidation of shares in the ratio of ten to one. In addition the premium of the capital increase which was carried out in April\u00a02023\u00a0increased the capital reserves by ?\u00a01,498.0\u00a0m whereas the costs of the capital increase of ?\u00a066.0\u00a0m reduced\u00a0the capital reserve. With the resolution on\u00a024th March\u00a02023\u00a0to carry out a rights issue, the warrants presented\u00a0within capital reserves at their book value of ?\u00a034.5\u00a0m were to be recognised as a financial liability at the\u00a0present value of the repurchase amount. Accordingly the warrants were revalued, reclassified to current\u00a0liabilities and repurchased in April\u00a02023. The difference between the book value and the present value\u00a0reduced the retained earnings, the reclassification to liabilities therefore reduced the capital reserves by only the book value of ?\u00a034.5\u00a0m. (26) Revenue reserves In the completed financial year,\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0did not pay a dividend to its shareholders (previous year no dividend). The ongoing recording of existing equity-settled stock option plans resulted in a decrease in equity of ?\u00a00.0\u00a0m (previous year increase ?\u00a00.2\u00a0m) in the reporting period. Disclosures on these long-term incentive programmes are outlined in the section on Share-based payments in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a02. Foreign exchange differences comprise differences from the translation of the financial statements of\u00a0foreign subsidiaries as well as differences from the translation of goodwill denominated in foreign currencies. The net gain from investments in equity instruments in the amount of ?\u00a023.7\u00a0m designated at fair value through other comprehensive income includes ?\u00a023.2\u00a0m of the upward revaluation recognised directly in\u00a0equity of the non-consolidated investment Peakwork\u00a0AG, which was sold during the financial year. For\u00a0detailed explanations we refer to section ?Assets held for sale?. The proportion of gains and losses from hedges used as effective hedges of future cash flows is carried\u00a0directly in equity under other comprehensive income at ? +\u00a0169.3\u00a0m (previous year ? +\u00a0110.7\u00a0m). The increase in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0is mainly attributable to changes in exchange rates and fuel prices. The revaluation of pension obligations (in particular actuarial gains or losses) is also carried directly in Other income in equity. The valuation of the warrants and the silent participation I at the present value of their respective repurchase\u00a0amount lowered the retained earnings by ?\u00a0222.8\u00a0m in total in March\u00a02023. The revaluation reserve formed in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a027\u00a0(old version) in the framework of step acquisitions of companies is retained until the date of deconsolidation of the company concerned. (27) Silent participations In financial year\u00a02021, two silent participations were issued to the\u00a0ESF. They were both carried in equity in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a032. The silent participation\u00a0II\u00a0in the amount of ?\u00a0671.0\u00a0m was fully repaid in May\u00a02022. With the resolution on\u00a024th March\u00a02023\u00a0to carry out a rights issue, the silent participation I was revalued at the present value of the repurchase amount, reclassified to current liabilities and repurchased in April\u00a02023. The difference of the book value of ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m and the present value reduced the retained earnings. The silent participations are reduced by ?\u00a0420.0\u00a0m. (28) Use of Group profit available for distribution In accordance with the German Stock Corporation Act, the Annual General Meeting resolves the use of the profit available for distribution carried in\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s commercial-law annual financial statements.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s loss for the year amounts to ?\u00a0517.6\u00a0m (previous year loss of ?\u00a0530.9\u00a0m). Taking account of loss carried forward of ?\u00a0831.5\u00a0m (previous year profit carried forward ?\u00a0300.6\u00a0m)\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s balance sheet loss totals ?\u00a01,349.1\u00a0m. (29) Non-controlling interest Non-controlling interests mainly relate to\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0S. A. based in Palma de Mallorca, Spain.\u00a0TUI?s capital share in this hotel operator stands at\u00a050.0\u00a0%, as in the prior year. The financial year of\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0S. A. ends on\u00a031\u00a0December and thus deviates from\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s financial year. This reporting date was fixed when the company was founded. In order to include the\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s consolidated financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September, the\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group prepares sub-group financial\u00a0statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September, the balance sheet date. RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0Group, allocated to Hotels &amp; Resorts, operates owned and leased hotels and hotels operated under management contracts in tourism destinations of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. The table below provides summarised financial information on\u00a0RIUSA\u00a0II\u00a0S. A., Palma de Mallorca, Spain ? the\u00a0subsidiary for which material non-controlling interests exist.

Pension obligations vary, reflecting the different legal, fiscal and economic conditions in each country of operation, and usually depend on employees? length of service and pay levels. All defined contribution plans are funded by the payment of contributions to external insurance companies or funds. German employees enjoy benefits from a statutory defined contribution plan paying pensions as a\u00a0function of employees? income and the contributions paid in. Several additional industry pension organisations\u00a0exist for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group companies. Once the contributions to the state-run pension plans and private pension\u00a0insurance organisations have been paid, the Company has no further payment obligations. Apart from Germany,\u00a0major defined contribution plans are also operated the Netherlands and in the\u00a0UK. Contributions paid are expensed for the respective period. In the reporting period, the expenses for all defined contribution plans totalled ?\u00a084.8\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a080.5\u00a0m). Apart from these defined contribution pension plans,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group operates defined benefit plans, which usually\u00a0entail the formation of provisions within the Company or investments in funds outside the Company. Within this group,\u00a0MER-Pensionskasse\u00a0VVaG, a private pension fund in which German companies of the tourism industry are organised, represents a multi-employer plan classified as a defined benefit plan. In accordance with the statues of the plan, the plan participants and the employers pay salary-based contributions into the plan. There are no further obligations pursuant to the statutes of the plan; an additional\u00a0funding obligation of the participating companies is explicitly excluded. The paid-in contributions are invested\u00a0in accordance with the policies of the pension plan unless they are used in the short term for benefit payments.\u00a0As the investments are pooled and are not kept separately for each participating employer, an allocation of plan assets to individual participating employers is not possible. The investment risk and the mortality risk are jointly shared by all plan participants. Moreover, the pension fund does not provide any information to participating companies that would allow the allocation of any over- or underfunding or\u00a0TUI?s participation in the plan. For this reason, accounting for the plan as defined benefit plan is not possible, and the plan is\u00a0therefore in accordance with the requirements of\u00a0IAS\u00a019\u00a0shown like a defined contribution plan. In the\u00a0reporting period, contributions to\u00a0MER-Pensionskasse\u00a0VVaG totalled ?\u00a05.6\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a05.6\u00a0m). For the next financial year, contributions are expected to remain at that level. TUI\u00a0Group?s major pension plans recognised as defined benefit plans exist in Germany and the\u00a0UK.

Under\u00a0UK\u00a0law, the employer is obliged to ensure sufficient funding so that plan assets cover the pension payments to be made and the administrative\u00a0costs of the funds. The pension funds are managed by independent trustees. The trustees comprise independent members, beneficiaries of the plan and employer representatives. The trustees are responsible for the investment of fund assets, taking account of the interests of plan members, but they also negotiate the level of the contributions to the fund to be paid by the employers, which constitute minimum contributions to the funds. To that end, actuarial valuations are made every three years by actuaries commissioned by the trustees. The annual contributions to be paid to the funds in order to cover any shortfalls were last defined on the basis of the measurement as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02019. Since\u00a031\u00a0October\u00a02018, the main sections of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0UK\u00a0Pension Trust have been closed to future accrual\u00a0of benefits. As a result, current service cost no longer arises for services delivered by the employees. Since\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02018, increases in accrued pension benefits from the plan have been therefore calculated in line with the rules for deferred members. With the closure of the Pension Trust for future accrual, all existing staff in the defined benefit scheme were offered the opportunity to join the existing defined contribution plan to accrue pension from\u00a01\u00a0November\u00a02018\u00a0onwards. By contrast, defined benefit plans in Germany are mainly unfunded and the obligations from these plans are recognised as provisions. The company assumes the obligation for payments of company pensions when the beneficiaries reach the legal retirement age. The amount of the pension paid usually depends either on the remuneration received by the employee at the retirement date or the amount of the average remuneration over the employee?s service period. Pension obligations usually include surviving dependants? benefits and invalidity benefits. Pension payments are partly limited by third party compensations, e. g. from insurances and\u00a0MER?Pensionskasse.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_179\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"576\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Material defined benefit plans in Germany</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Scheme name</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Status</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Versorgungsordnung\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">open</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Versorgungsordnung\u00a0TUIfly GmbH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">open</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Versorgungsordnung\u00a0TUI\u00a0Deutschland GmbH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">closed</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Versorgungsordnung\u00a0TUI\u00a0Beteiligungs GmbH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">closed</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Versorgungsordnungen\u00a0TUI\u00a0Immobilien Services GmbH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">closed</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">In the period under review, defined benefit pension obligations created total expenses of ?\u00a029.0\u00a0m for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, principally comprising current service cost.

Pension obligations are measured on the basis of actuarial calculations based on country-specific parameters\u00a0and assumptions. The obligations under defined benefit plans are calculated on the basis of the internationally\u00a0accepted projected unit credit method, taking account of expected future increases in salaries and pensions. For the pension plans in the\u00a0UK, expected increases in salaries are not taken into account as they are no longer relevant for the measurement due to the plan amendment outlined above. In order to take account of the currently high inflation, significantly higher pension trends have been applied for the next scheduled pension adjustment for the German pension plans in deviation from the projected future pension increases indicated below for Germany.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_185\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Actuarial assumptions</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Percentage p. a.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Germany</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">United Kingdom</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Other countries</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Discount rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.5</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">3.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Projected future salary increases</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Projected future pension increases</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Percentage p. a.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Germany</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">UnitedKingdom</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Other countries</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Discount rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">3.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Projected future salary increases</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">1.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Projected future pension increases</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3.6</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">The interest rate applicable in discounting the provision for pensions is based on an index for corporate\u00a0bonds adjusted for securities already downgraded and under observation by rating agencies as well as\u00a0subordinate bonds in order to meet the criterion for high quality bonds (rated\u00a0AA\u00a0or higher) required under\u00a0IAS\u00a019. The resulting yield structure is extrapolated on the basis of the yield curves for almost risk-free bonds, taking account of an appropriate risk mark-up reflecting the term of the obligation. In order to cover\u00a0a correspondingly broad market, an index partly based on shorter-term bonds is used (for instance for\u00a0Eurozone bonds from the iBoxx ? Corporates\u00a0AA\u00a010+ and iBoxx ? Corporates\u00a0AA\u00a07\u00a0?\u00a010). Apart from the parameters described above, a further key assumption relates to life expectancy. In Germany,\u00a0the Heubeck reference tables\u00a02018\u00a0G are used to determine life expectancy. In the\u00a0UK, the S3NxA base\u00a0tables are used, adjusted to future expected increases on the basis of the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI)\u00a02022. The pension in payment escalation formulae depend primarily on the pension plan concerned.\u00a0Apart from fixed rates of increase, there are also a number of inflation-linked pension adjustment mechanisms\u00a0in different countries. Changes in the key actuarial assumptions mentioned above would lead to the changes in defined benefit obligations presented below. The methodology used to determine sensitivity corresponds to the method\u00a0used to calculate the defined benefit obligation. The assumptions were amended in isolation each time;\u00a0actual interdependencies between the assumptions were not taken into account. The effect of the increase\u00a0in life expectancy by one year is calculated by means of a reduction in mortality due to the use of the Heubeck\u00a0tables\u00a02018\u00a0G for pension plans in Germany. In the\u00a0UK, an extra year is added to the life expectancy determined\u00a0on the basis of the mortality tables.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_186\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation due to changed actuarial assumptions</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a050\u00a0Basis points</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a050\u00a0Basis points</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a050\u00a0Basis points</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a050\u00a0Basis points</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Discount rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a0145.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a0160.7</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?\u00a0171.0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+\u00a0193.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Salary increase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a07.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a06.8</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a012.2</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a011.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Pension increase</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a043.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a051.8</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a054.4</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a045.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a01\u00a0year</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a01\u00a0year</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Life expectancy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a079.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a079.1</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">The weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligations totalled\u00a013.5\u00a0years (previous year\u00a015.8\u00a0years)\u00a0for the overall Group. In the\u00a0UK, the weighted duration was\u00a013.4\u00a0years (previous year\u00a016.2\u00a0years), while it stood at\u00a014.1\u00a0years (previous year\u00a015.4\u00a0years) in Germany. Fund assets are determined on the basis of the fair values of the funds invested as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. The interest rate used to determine the interest income from the assets of external funds is identical with the discount rate used for the defined benefit obligation. For the forthcoming financial year, the companies of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group are expected to contribute around ?\u00a0106.2\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0104.4\u00a0m) to pension funds and pay pensions worth ?\u00a033.3\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a033.1\u00a0m) for\u00a0unfunded plans. The expected employer contribution to the pension funds mainly includes the annual\u00a0payment agreed with the trustees in the\u00a0UK\u00a0to reduce the existing coverage shortfall. For funded plans, the payments to the recipients are fully made from fund assets and therefore do not result in a cash outflow for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group. TUI\u00a0Group?s defined benefit plans entail various risks; some of which may have a substantial effect on the\u00a0Company. The purchase of insurance policies within the\u00a0UK\u00a0schemes serves to eliminate these risks in\u00a0respect of the liabilities due to pension scheme members covered by this insurance, and hence reduce the overall level of risk in respect of all the categories detailed below. Investment risk The investment risk plays a major role, in particular for the large funded plans in the\u00a0UK. Although shares usually outperform bonds in terms of producing higher returns, they also entail stronger volatility of balance sheet items and the risk of short-term shortfalls in coverage. In order to limit this risk, the trustees have built a balanced investment portfolio to limit the concentration of risks. Interest rate risk The interest rate influences in particular unfunded schemes in Germany as a decline in interest rates leads\u00a0to an increase in the defined benefit obligations. Accordingly, an increase in the interest rate leads to a\u00a0reduction in the defined benefit obligations. Funded plans are less strongly affected by this development as the performance of the interest-bearing assets included in plan assets regularly dampens the effects. For the funded plans in the\u00a0UK, the trustees have invested a part of the plan assets in liability-driven investment portfolios, holding credit and hedging instruments in order to largely offset the impact of changes in interest rates. Inflation risk An increase in the inflation rate normally increases the obligation in pension schemes linked to the final salary of beneficiaries as inflation causes an increase in the projected salary increases. At the same time, inflation-based pension increases included in the plan also rise. The inflation risk is reduced through the use of caps and collars. Moreover, the large pension funds in the\u00a0UK\u00a0hold inflation-linked assets, which also\u00a0partly reduce the risk from a significant rise in inflation. By investing, in particular, plan assets in liability-driven investment portfolios, which hold credit and hedging instruments, they aim to largely offset the\u00a0impact of the inflation rate. Longevity risk An increasing life expectancy increases the expected benefit duration of the pension obligation. This risk is countered by using regularly updated mortality data in calculating the present values of the obligation. Currency risk For\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, the pension schemes entail a currency risk as most pension schemes are operated in the\u00a0UK\u00a0and therefore denominated in sterling. The risk is limited as the currency effects on the obligation and the assets partly offset each other. The currency risk only relates to any excess of pension obligations over plan assets or vice versa.

Measurement of these provisions is based on the expected cost of the next maintenance event, estimated on the basis of\u00a0current prices, expected price increases and manufacturers? data sheets. In line with the terms of the\u00a0individual contracts and the aircraft model concerned, additions are recognised on a prorated basis in\u00a0relation to flight hours, the number of flights or the length of the complete maintenance cycle. Lower\u00a0maintenance expenses than expected led also to a reversal of ?\u00a06.6\u00a0m. Provisions for litigation relate to existing lawsuits. For further details on lawsuits, please refer to Note\u00a038. Restructuring provisions comprise payments for personnel measures as well as payments for the early termination of leases. They primarily relate to restructuring projects as part of our Global Realignment\u00a0Programme for which detailed, formal restructuring plans were drawn up and communicated to the parties concerned. The reversal of the provision in the amount of ?\u00a09.1\u00a0m is mainly due to the lower than expected reduction in the fleet size of the Group?s German airline. At the balance sheet date, restructuring provisions\u00a0totalled ?\u00a058.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a088.3\u00a0m), for a large part relating to benefits for planned personnel measures. Provisions for personnel costs comprise provisions for jubilee benefits and provisions for cash-settled\u00a0share-based payment schemes in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a02. For information on these long-term incentive\u00a0programmes, please refer to Note\u00a040\u00a0?Share-based payments in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a02?. Provisions for environmental protection primarily relate to statutory obligations to remediate sites contaminated with legacy waste from former mining and metallurgical activities. Provisions for onerous contracts include ?\u00a016.7\u00a0m for the early exit from a leased administrative building as the largest single item. Miscellaneous provisions include various provisions that, taken individually, do not have a significant\u00a0influence on\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s economic position. This item includes provisions for dismantling obligations and compensation claims from customers. Changes in other provisions outside profit and loss primarily relate to changes in the group of consolidated companies, foreign exchange differences and reclassifications within other provisions. Where the difference between the present value and the settlement value of a provision is material for the measurement of a non-current provision as at the balance sheet date, the provision is recognised at its present value in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a037. The discount rate to be applied should take account of the specific\u00a0risks of the liability and of future price increases. This criterion applies to some items contained in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s\u00a0other provisions. Additions to other provisions comprise an interest portion of ?\u00a025.4\u00a0m (previous year\u00a0?\u00a010.1\u00a0m), recognised as an interest expense.

The\u00a0decrease is mainly due to the reduction in liabilities to banks. In April\u00a02023, a capital increase with rights issue was successfully completed. Parts of the proceeds were used to redeem, or repurchase, in full the outstanding warrant bond including warrants at the nominal\u00a0amount of ?\u00a058.7\u00a0m plus accrued interest at fair value. The bond component of this warrant bond was\u00a0recognised in financial liabilities, while the separately tradable warrants were recognised in equity. The early termination rights by\u00a0TUI\u00a0as well as the conversion right and the put option held by the holders of the convertible bond represent embedded derivatives which were not separated in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a09\u00a0as they are classified as closely related to the host contract. The largest financing instrument is a revolving credit facility (RCF) between\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and an existing banking syndicate, which has included KfW since\u00a02020. Following the capital increase effected in April\u00a02023, the KfW line within the syndicated revolving credit facility was reduced from ?\u00a02.1\u00a0bn to ?\u00a01.05\u00a0bn so that the credit\u00a0facility decreased from ?\u00a03.74\u00a0bn to ?\u00a02.7\u00a0bn. In May\u00a02023, the revolving credit facility from the banking\u00a0syndicate was extended to July\u00a02026. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, there were no drawdowns on the revolving credit facilities (30\u00a0September\u00a02022\u00a0?\u00a0562.0\u00a0m). Current financial liabilities decreased by ?\u00a0221.4\u00a0m to ?\u00a098.5\u00a0m as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0as against ?\u00a0319.9\u00a0m as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02022.

The reduction in order commitments can be explained by aircraft orders\u00a0fulfilled in the year, delivery of Marella Voyager and due to the effects of foreign exchange for order commitments denominated in non-functional currencies. The reduction is to a greater extent partially offset by new\u00a0aircraft orders undertaken during the year. The commitment for\u00a0IT\u00a0obligations reported within other financial\u00a0commitments increased due to the extension of existing contracts.

The following share-based payment schemes are in effect within\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. 1. PHANTOM SHARES UNDER THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (LTIP) FOR THE EXECUTIVE BOARD OF TUI\u00a0AG 1.1 LTIP with share allocation from financial year 2020 (LTIP EPS20 ? 23) Since the\u00a02020\u00a0financial year, the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) consists of a programme based on phantom shares and is measured over a period of four years (performance reference period). The phantom shares are allocated in annual tranches. All Executive Board members have their individual target amounts defined in their service contracts. At the beginning of each financial year, this target amount is translated into a preliminary number of phantom\u00a0shares based on the target amount. It constitutes the basis for the determination of the performance-related pay after the end of the performance reference period. In order to determine that number, the target amount is divided by the average Xetra share price of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shares during the\u00a020\u00a0trading days prior to the beginning of the performance reference period (1\u00a0October of any one year). The entitlement under the long-term incentive programme arises upon completion of the four-year performance reference period and is subject to attainment of the relevant target. The performance target for determining the amount of the final payout after the end of the performance reference period is the average development over four years of the earning per share based on a pro-forma adjusted\u00a0EPS\u00a0from continuing operations (Earnings per Share ?\u00a0EPS) as reported in the annual report of the company. The average development of\u00a0EPS\u00a0per annum (in percent) is derived from the four equally weighted yearly\u00a0EPS\u00a0development values (in %). Each yearly\u00a0EPS\u00a0development value is calculated as the quotient of the\u00a0EPS\u00a0of the current financial year and the\u00a0EPS\u00a0of the previous financial year. The initial\u00a0EPS\u00a0value used to determine the target achievement is calculated at the beginning of the performance period from the first\u00a0EPS\u00a0in the performance period and the last\u00a0EPS\u00a0before the performance period. Target achievement for the average development of\u00a0EPS\u00a0per annum based on the annual amounts is determined as follows: An average absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0of less than\u00a050\u00a0% of the absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0value determined at the beginning of the performance period corresponds to target achievement of\u00a00\u00a0%.  An average absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0of\u00a050\u00a0% of the absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0value determined at the beginning of the performance\u00a0period corresponds to target achievement of\u00a025\u00a0%.  An average absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0of\u00a050\u00a0% or more of the absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0value determined at the beginning of the performance period up to an average increase of\u00a05\u00a0% corresponds to target achievement of\u00a025\u00a0% to\u00a0100\u00a0%.  An average increase of\u00a05\u00a0% p. a. corresponds to target achievement of\u00a0100\u00a0%.  An average increase of\u00a05\u00a0% to\u00a010\u00a0% p. a. corresponds to target achievement of\u00a0100\u00a0% to\u00a0175\u00a0%.  An average increase of\u00a010\u00a0% or more p. a. corresponds to target achievement of\u00a0175\u00a0%. For an average absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0of\u00a050\u00a0% or more of the absolute\u00a0EPS\u00a0value determined at the beginning of the performance period up to an average increase of\u00a05\u00a0%, corresponding to a target achievement of\u00a025\u00a0% to\u00a0100\u00a0%, and an average increase of\u00a05\u00a0% to\u00a010\u00a0% p. a., corresponding to a target achievement of\u00a0100\u00a0% to\u00a0175\u00a0%, linear interpolation is used to determine the degree of target achievement. The degree of target achievement is rounded to two decimal places. If the prior-year\u00a0EPS\u00a0amounts to less than ?\u00a00.50, the Supervisory Board defines new absolute targets for\u00a0EPS\u00a0as well as minimum and maximum amounts for determining the percentage target achievement for each subsequent financial year in the performance reference period. Due to the development of\u00a0EPS\u00a0as a result of the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, the Supervisory Board has made use of this clause and has accordingly defined absolute target values for the current tranches,\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02020\u00a0?\u00a02023,\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02021\u00a0?\u00a02024,\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02022\u00a0?\u00a02025\u00a0and\u00a0LTIP\u00a0tranche\u00a02023\u00a0?\u00a02026. In order to determine the final number of phantom shares, the degree of target achievement is multiplied by the preliminary number of phantom shares on the final day of the performance reference period. The payout amount is determined by multiplying the final number of phantom shares by the average Xetra share price of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0shares over the\u00a020\u00a0trading days prior to the end of the performance reference period (30\u00a0September of any one year). The payout amount determined in this way is paid out in the month of the approval and audit of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s annual financial statements for the relevant financial year. If the service contract begins or ends in the course of the financial year relevant for the allocation of the\u00a0LTIP, the entitlement to payment of the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0is determined on a pro rata basis. In the case of a capital increase from company funds, the number of preliminary phantom shares would increase in the same ratio as the nominal value of the share capital. In the case of a capital decrease without\u00a0return of capital, the number of preliminary phantom shares would decrease in the same ratio as the nominal\u00a0value of the share capital. In the case of a capital increase against contributions, a capital decrease with return of capital or any other capital or structural measures that have an effect on the share capital and cause a material change in the value of the\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0share, the number of preliminary phantom shares would also be adjusted. The Supervisory Board is entitled, at reasonable discretion, to make adjustments to neutralize any negative or positive effects from such capital or structural measures. The same rule applies in the case of a change in share price due to the payment of an unusually high superdividend. The Supervisory Board has made use of this authorisation for the capital increases carried out in January and October\u00a02021, March\u00a02023\u00a0and the share consolidation at a ratio of\u00a010:1\u00a0in February\u00a02023. The maximum\u00a0LTIP\u00a0payout is capped at\u00a0240\u00a0% of the individual target amount for each performance reference\u00a0period. This means that there is an annual\u00a0LTIP\u00a0cap which is determined individually for each Executive Board\u00a0member. The Supervisory Board is furthermore, according to section\u00a087\u00a0para.\u00a01\u00a0cl.\u00a03\u00a0German stock corporation\u00a0law, authorized to cap the\u00a0LTIP\u00a0payout in case of extraordinary circumstances (e. g. company mergers, segment disposals, recognition of hidden reserves or external influences). Performance Share Plan (PSP) for eligible Group executives The\u00a0PSP\u00a0governs the phantom share-based remuneration for eligible executives who are not members of the Executive Board.

The personnel expense is recognised upon actual delivery of service according to\u00a0IFRS\u00a02\u00a0and is, therefore, spread over a period of time. According to\u00a0IFRS\u00a02, all contractually granted entitlements have to be accounted for, irrespective of whether and when they are actually allocated. Accordingly, phantom shares allocated in the past are charged on a pro rata basis upon actual delivery of service. Overall, expenses from the addition of provisions for cash-settled share-based payments of ?\u00a03.8\u00a0m was recognised through profit or loss in financial year\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year income ?\u00a04.5\u00a0m). As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, provisions relating to entitlements under these long-term incentive programmes totalled ?\u00a010.9\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a07.6\u00a0m). (41) Financial instruments Risks and risk management Risk management principles Due to the nature of its business operations,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is exposed to various financial risks, including market risks (consisting of currency risks, interest rate risks and market price risks), credit risks and liquidity risks. In accordance with\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s financial goals, financial risks have to be mitigated. In order to achieve\u00a0this, policies and procedures have been developed to manage risk associated with financial transactions\u00a0undertaken. The rules, responsibilities and processes as well as limits for transactions and risk positions have been defined\u00a0in policies. The trading, processing and control have been segregated in functional and organisational terms. Compliance with the policies and limits is continually monitored. All hedges by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group are consistently\u00a0based on recognised or forecasted underlying transactions. Standard software is used for assessing, monitoring, reporting, documenting and reviewing the effectiveness of the hedging relationships for the hedges entered into. In this context, the fair values of all derivative financial instruments determined on the basis of the\u00a0Group?s own systems are regularly compared with the fair value confirmations from the external counterparties. The processes, the methods applied and the organisation of risk management are reviewed for compliance\u00a0with the relevant regulations on at least an annual basis by the internal audit department and external auditors. Within\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, financial risks primarily arise from cash flows in foreign currencies, fuel requirements (jet\u00a0fuel and bunker oil) and financing via the money and capital markets. In order to limit the risks from changes in exchange rates, market prices and interest rates for underlying transactions,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group uses over-the-counter derivative financial instruments. These are primarily fixed-price transactions. In addition,\u00a0TUI\u00a0can also use options and structured products. Use of derivative financial instruments is confined to internally fixed limits and other policies. The transactions are concluded on an arm?s length basis with counterparties\u00a0operating in the financial sector, whose counterparty risk is regularly monitored. Foreign exchange translation risks from the consolidation of group companies not preparing their accounts in euros are not hedged. Market risk Market risks result in fluctuations in earnings, equity and cash flows. Risks arising from input cost volatility are more fully detailed in the risk report section of the management report. In order to limit or eliminate these risks,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group has developed various hedging strategies, including the use of derivative financial instruments. IFRS\u00a07\u00a0requires the presentation of a sensitivity analysis showing the effects of hypothetical changes in\u00a0relevant market risk variables on profit or loss and equity. The effects for the period are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in risk variables to the portfolio of primary and derivative financial instruments as at the balance sheet date. It is assured that the portfolio of financial instruments as at the balance sheet date is representative for the entire financial year. The analyses of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s risk reduction activities outlined below and the amounts determined using sensitivity analyses represent hypothetical and thus uncertain risks. Due to unforeseeable developments in the global financial markets, actual results may deviate substantially from the disclosures provided. The risk\u00a0analysis methods used must not be considered a projection of future events or losses, since\u00a0TUI\u00a0is also exposed\u00a0to risks of a non-financial or non-quantifiable nature. These risks primarily include sovereign, business and legal risks not covered by the following presentation of risks. Currency risk The business operations of\u00a0TUI?s group companies generate payments or receipts denominated in foreign\u00a0currencies, which are not always matched by payments or receipts with equivalent terms in the same currency. Using potential netting effects (netting of payments made and received in the same currency with identical or similar terms),\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group enters into appropriate hedges with external counterparties in order to protect its profit margin from exchange rate-related fluctuations. Within\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, risks from exchange rate fluctuations are hedged, with the largest hedging volumes relating to\u00a0US\u00a0dollars, euros and pound sterling. The Eurozone limits the currency risk from transactions in the key tourist destinations to group companies whose functional currency is not the euro. The tourism business\u00a0operations are mainly affected by changes in the value of the\u00a0US\u00a0dollar and the euro, the latter predominantly affecting the\u00a0TUI\u00a0tour operators in the\u00a0UK\u00a0and the Nordic countries. In tourism operations, payments in\u00a0US\u00a0dollars primarily relate to the procurement of services in non-European destinations, purchases of jet and ship fuel and aircraft and cruise ship purchases or charter. The tourism companies use financial derivatives to hedge their planned foreign exchange requirements. They aim to take out cover ahead of the markets? customer booking profiles in the planned currency requirements in the run-up to the tourism season. In this regard, account is taken of the different risk profiles of\u00a0TUI?s group companies. The hedged currency volumes are adjusted in line with changes in planned requirements based on reporting by business units. Target hedge ratios are regularly reviewed with the aim of matching hedge ratios with the respective target hedging ratios for future seasons. Currency risks as defined by\u00a0IFRS\u00a07\u00a0arise from primary and derivative monetary financial instruments issued in a currency other than the functional currency of a company. Exchange rate-related differences from the translation of financial statements into the Group?s presentation currency are not taken into account. Taking account of the different functional currencies within the\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, the sensitivity analyses of the currencies\u00a0identified as relevant risk variables are presented below. A\u00a010\u00a0% strengthening or weakening of the respective\u00a0functional currencies, primarily euro and pound sterling, against the other currencies would cause the following effects on the revaluation reserve and earnings after income tax:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_198\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sensitivity analysis ?

Where interest-driven cash flows of floating-rate primary financial instruments are converted into fixed cash flows using derivative hedges and the critical terms of the hedging transaction are the same as those of the\u00a0hedged items they are not exposed to an interest rate risk. No interest rate risk exists for fixed-interest financial instruments carried at amortised cost. Changes in market interest rates mainly impact floating-rate non-derivative financial instruments and derivative financial instruments entered into in order to reduce interest-induced cash flow fluctuations. The table below presents the equity and earnings after income taxes effects of an assumed increase or decrease in the market interest rate of\u00a0100\u00a0basis points (previous year + / ?\u00a0100\u00a0basis points) as at the balance\u00a0sheet date. Maintaining the sensitivity of market prices at\u00a0100\u00a0basis points is based on the assumption that an elevated level of volatility in interest rates is likely to continue as some central banks are expected to continue with their rate hike cycle whilst others are likely to pause, or even start to cut rates, in the coming months.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_199\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sensitivity analysis ? interest rate risk</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Variable: Interest rate level forfloating interest-bearing debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a0100\u00a0basis points</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a0100\u00a0basis points</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a0100\u00a0basis points</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a0100\u00a0basis points</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings after income taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a01.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a01.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?\u00a00.3</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+\u00a00.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Impact of the reform of global benchmark interest rates The global reform of benchmark interest rates (IBORs) creates uncertainties for\u00a0TUI\u00a0in that variable benchmark interest rates available today, on which individual transactions concluded in foreign currencies are based, will no longer be available in the future or will be determined differently. At\u00a0TUI, these uncertainties only affect non-derivative risk positions. As in the previous year, there are no derivative risk positions. With regard to\u00a0EURIBOR, there is no impact from the change to the accounting for non-derivative assets and liabilities. In\u00a02019, the European Money Market Institute adapted\u00a0EURIBOR?s method of determination to ensure\u00a0EURIBOR?s compliance with the\u00a0EU\u00a0Benchmark Regulation. Quotes for\u00a0USD-LIBOR\u00a0were last published on\u00a030\u00a0June\u00a02023. Until September\u00a030,\u00a02024, a so-called synthetic\u00a0LIBOR\u00a0will be provided for one-month, three-month and six-month maturity rates. According to the\u00a0UK?s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), these synthetic rates may be used to settle certain legacy contracts. As of September\u00a030,\u00a02023, there are non-derivative liabilities with total carrying amounts of ?\u00a0310.0\u00a0m\u00a0(previous year: ?\u00a0492.7\u00a0m) relating to the leasing and financing of aircraft. Of this amount, ?\u00a0205.6\u00a0m is attributable to\u00a0USD-LIBOR\u00a0financings, for which a conversion to the alternative reference interest rate\u00a0USD\u00a0SOFR\u00a0has been negotiated but not yet contracted. Overall, no material impact is expected from the conversion of financing from\u00a0USD-LIBOR\u00a0to alternative benchmark interest rates. Fuel price risk Due to the nature of its business operations,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is exposed to market price risks from the purchase of fuel for the aircraft fleet and the cruise ships. The tourism companies use financial derivatives to hedge their exposure to market price risks for the planned consumption of fuel. They aim to take out cover ahead of the markets? customer booking profiles in the planned commodity requirements in the run-up to the tourism season. The different risk profiles of the group companies operating in different source markets are taken into account, including the possibility of levying fuel surcharges. The hedging volumes are adjusted for changes in planned consumption as identified by the group companies. Target hedge ratios are regularly reviewed with the aim of matching hedge ratios with the respective target hedging ratios for future seasons. If the commodity prices, which underlie the fuel price hedges, increase or decrease by\u00a015\u00a0% (previous year +\u00a015\u00a0% / ?\u00a015\u00a0%), on the balance sheet date, the impact on equity and on earnings after income taxes would be as shown in the table below. The sensitivity of market prices of + / ?\u00a015\u00a0% is based on the assumption that an above-average price volatility in fuel prices could be expected to continue over the coming months in the context of the current geo-political environment.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_200\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"272\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sensitivity analysis ? fuel price risk</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Variable: Fuel prices for aircraft and ships</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a015\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a015\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a015\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a015\u00a0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revaluation reserve</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a092.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a094.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a013.5</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a026.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings after income taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+\u00a00.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">+\u00a02.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">+\u00a015.0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">?\u00a03.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other price risks Apart from the financial risks that may result from changes in exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is not exposed to significant price risks at the balance sheet date. Credit risk The credit risk in non-derivative financial instruments results from the risk of counterparties defaulting on their contractual payment obligations. Maximum credit risk exposure corresponds in particular to the total of the recognised carrying amounts of the financial assets (including derivative financial instruments with positive market values). Furthermore, there are no material financial guarantees for the discharge of liabilities. Where legally enforceable, financial\u00a0assets and liabilities are netted. Credit risks are reviewed closely on conclusion of the contract and continually\u00a0monitored thereafter in order to swiftly respond to potential impairment in a counterparty?s solvency. Responsibility for handling the credit risk is generally held by the Group company holding the receivable. Since\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group operates in many different business areas and regions, significant credit risk concentrations of receivables from and loans to specific debtors or groups of debtors are not to be expected. A significant concentration of credit risks related to specific countries is not to be expected either. As in the previous year, at the balance sheet date, there is no material collateral held, or other credit enhancements that reduce the maximum credit risk. Collateral held relates exclusively to financial assets of the category trade receivables\u00a0and other receivables. The collateral mainly comprises collateral for financial receivables granted and maturing in more than one year and / or with a volume of more than ?\u00a01.0\u00a0m. Real property rights, directly enforceable guarantees, bank guarantees and comfort letters are used as collateral. Credit management also covers\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s derivative financial instruments. The maximum credit risk for\u00a0derivative financial instruments entered into is limited to the total of all positive market values of these instruments since in the event of counterparty default asset losses would only be incurred up to that amount. Since derivative financial instruments are concluded with different debtors, credit risk exposure is reduced. The specific credit risks of individual counterparties are taken into account in determining the fair values of derivative financial instruments. In addition, the counterparty risk is continually monitored and controlled using internal bank limits. IFRS\u00a09\u00a0requires entities to recognise expected losses for all financial assets held at amortised cost and for financial assets constituting debt instruments and measured at\u00a0FVTOCI\u00a0(Fair Value Through Other Comprehensive Income). In\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group, the items affected are financial instruments recognised at amortised cost in the following categories: trade receivables and other receivables with the sub-classes trade receivables, advances and loans, other receivables and assets as well as lease receivables. Additional classes are other financial assets and cash and cash equivalents. In determining expected losses,\u00a0IFRS\u00a09\u00a0distinguishes between the general and the simplified approach to impairment. Under the general approach to impairment, financial assets are classified into three stages. Stage\u00a01\u00a0is where financial assets are recognised for the first time or where credit risk has not increased significantly since initial recognition. At this stage, the expected bad debt losses that may arise from possible default events\u00a0within the next\u00a012\u00a0months after the respective balance sheet date are reported. For financial assets in stage\u00a01, entities are required to recognise\u00a012-month Expected Credit Losses (ECL). Stage\u00a02\u00a0is where credit risk has\u00a0increased significantly since initial recognition. Stage\u00a03\u00a0includes financial assets that additionally have objective evidence of impairment alongside the criteria of stage\u00a02. Stages\u00a02\u00a0and\u00a03\u00a0show lifetime\u00a0ECL. Under the simplified approach to impairment, a loss allowance is carried at an amount equal to life-time\u00a0ECL\u00a0at initial recognition for trade receivables and lease receivables, regardless of the credit quality of the accounts receivable and the lease receivables.\u00a0TUI\u00a0uses a provision matrix to determine the expected loss for trade receivables and lease receivables. Average historical default rates are determined for the following maturity bands. Not overdue, less than\u00a030\u00a0days past due,\u00a030\u00a0?\u00a090\u00a0days,\u00a091\u00a0?\u00a0180\u00a0days and more than\u00a0180\u00a0days past due. To determine the historical default rate, the weighted average of the last three years is calculated for\u00a0the receivables in default in the respective year in relation to the receivables portfolio at the end of the respective financial year. This is multiplied by the probability that a receivable will age into the final maturity band. The loss rates determined are adjusted by credit default swap (CDS) rates in order to take account of forward-looking information. The adjusted loss rates are based on average rates for the past few years. The economic environment of the relevant geographical regions is taken into account through a weighting of\u00a0CDS\u00a0rates. All model parameters mentioned above are regularly reviewed and updated. Under the simplified approach to impairment, trade receivable and lease receivables are transferred to Stage\u00a03\u00a0when there is any objective evidence of impairment. In principle\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group classifies whether a trade receivable\u00a0is to be transferred to Stage\u00a03\u00a0on an individual basis, depending on the region, after\u00a0180\u00a0days at the earliest. In the event of insolvencies or other objective indications of impairment before this date, a transfer to stage\u00a03\u00a0is made earlier. If a receivable is more than\u00a0180\u00a0days overdue, it is assumed to be impaired and, in the event\u00a0of uncollectibility, generally written down in full. Objective evidence of impairment of lease receivables includes, for example, significant financial difficulties on the part of the debtor, breach of contract (default or delay in interest and repayment) or concessions made for economic or contractual reasons in connection with the debtor?s financial difficulties. For all other financial assets carried at amortised cost impairments are determined in accordance with the general approach. For cash and cash equivalents, the low credit risk exemption of\u00a0IFRS\u00a09\u00a0is applied, according to which financial instruments with a low default risk at the time of acquisition can be classified in stage\u00a01\u00a0of the impairment model. Cash and cash equivalents include, for instance, cash in hand or bank balances that are exclusively due to counterparties with a high credit rating. In accordance with stage\u00a01\u00a0of the impairment hierarchy, a risk provision corresponding to the\u00a012-month credit loss is recorded in cash and cash equivalents upon initial recognition. At each balance sheet date, a verification is made as to whether the counterparties continue to have a rating of investment grade quality. As the corresponding financial assets have a maximum term of\u00a03\u00a0months, the impairment requirement is very low. A transfer from Stage\u00a01\u00a0to Stage\u00a02\u00a0or\u00a03\u00a0has no practical\u00a0relevance, as the business relationship would be terminated immediately in the case of a corresponding\u00a0event. For material advances and loans and other receivables and assets, the expected credit losses are determined by multiplying the probability of default with the loss given default and the exposure of default.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group determines the probabilities of default on the basis of an internal rating model. As part of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s business model, the ratings of debtors for material receivables are evaluated on the basis of this internal rating. Category\u00a01\u00a0of the rating model contains the debtors with the highest credit rating, whereas the debtors with the lowest credit rating are classified in the category\u00a07. If the credit risk has not significantly deteriorated\u00a0since initial recognition,\u00a012-month credit losses are determined (stage\u00a01). In the event of a significant increase\u00a0in the credit risk, the lifetime-expected credit loss is determined (stage\u00a02). A significant increase in the default risk is assumed on the basis of the internal rating and other relevant information such as changes in the economic, regulatory or technological environment. If there is any objective evidence of impairment, a transfer is made to Stage\u00a03. The gross carrying amount of a financial asset of all classes of financial instruments recognised at amortised\u00a0cost is written off when there is no longer the expectation of full or partial recovery a financial asset following an appropriate assessment. For individual customers the gross carrying amount is usually written off by the Group companies based on past experience of recoveries of such assets in the country specific business environment if the financial asset is no longer expected to be collected due to days overdue. For corporate customers,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s businesses conduct an individual assessment about the timing and the amount of\u00a0write off based on whether there is a reasonable expectation of recovery.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group does not expect significant recovery of amounts written off. However, written-off financial assets may still be subject to enforcement actions to collect overdue receivables. For advances and loans, other receivables and assets as well as other financial assets, the expected credit losses are determined on a portfolio basis. In significant individual cases, this portfolio approach is deviated\u00a0from, as the relevant information for determining the expected loss is available at the stage of the individual\u00a0instrument.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group ensures that solely financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics are combined, e. g. type of product and geographical region.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group initially carries the credit loss based on a loss rate\u00a0expected for the next twelve months. This loss rate is adjusted at regular intervals depending on the macroeconomic market environment. If the credit risk increases significantly, the lifetime expected credit loss is determined (Stage\u00a02). The assessment of a significant increase in the credit risk, because of the past due status of the instruments, is determined in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group on an individual basis by region, change in default\u00a0risk-related market data or change in contractual conditions, among other factors. Depending on the portfolio, a reclassification to stage\u00a02\u00a0is regularly made if the overdue amount is more than\u00a030\u00a0days past due. If there is objective evidence of impairment, the instrument is transferred to Stage\u00a03. In principle, the general approach assumes that the default risk of financial assets has increased significantly\u00a0since initial recognition if contractual payments are more than\u00a030\u00a0days overdue. However, this can be refuted\u00a0by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s available appropriate and comprehensible information. The assessment of the objective\u00a0evidence of impairment for all instruments falling within the scope of the\u00a0ECL\u00a0model is based on the following\u00a0indicators: e. g. severe financial difficulties of the debtor, breach of contract (default or delinquency in interest or principal payment) or concessions made for economic or contractual reasons in connection with financial difficulties of the debtor. As a result, such instruments are usually written off in full. CDS\u00a0rates are used as forward-looking information in the general impairment model, too. The impairment ratio for financial assets in the general approach that are not included in the ?default risk? table below is based on observable past default rates, but is set at a minimum of\u00a01\u00a0%. The\u00a01\u00a0% results from\u00a0this year?s calculation of the simplified approach. The decline is due in particular to the greatly reduced impact of the coronavirus pandemic. TUI\u00a0Group recognises an impairment gain or loss on all financial assets with a corresponding adjustment of the carrying amount through a provision for impairment. In order to improve the presentation, from the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year onwards only the expected credit losses will be shown in the ?Ageing structure? tables in the ?impairment for expected credit losses? column and only\u00a0the change in the impairment for expected credit losses will be shown in the ?changes in risk provisions? tables. The information relating to the previous year remains unchanged. In the ?Ageing structure? tables the specific bad debt allowance determined at subsidiary level is shown separately in the ?specific bad debt allowance? column. The previous year?s ?impairment? column includes both the impairment for expected credit losses and the specific bad debt allowance determined at subsidiary level. In the tables on ?changes in risk provisioning? the specific bad debt allowance determined at subsidiary level which is included in the risk provisioning as at\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0is removed in line ?Removing specific bad debt allowance from presentation?. The impairment ratios stated from the current year onwards relate exclusively to expected credit losses and no longer include the specific bad debt allowances determined at subsidiary level. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, trade receivables were impaired in the amount of ?\u00a049.7\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a059.5\u00a0m).

The previous year?s figures have beenadjusted accordingly. Insofar as the default risk can only be determined on the basis of past due information, the information is\u00a0contained in the tables ?ageing structure of impairment of financial instruments classified as other receivables and assets? and ?ageing structure of impairment of financial instruments classified as advances and loans?. Other financial assets carried at amortised cost at an amount of ?\u00a048.6\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a085.8\u00a0m) relate to\u00a0short-term deposits with banks. The full amount of these investments with a gross amount of ?\u00a048.7\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a086.2\u00a0m) is not overdue. Impairments of ?\u00a00.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a00.5\u00a0m) were carried in the framework of risk provisioning. In the financial year\u00a02023, there were no significant cash inflows from impaired interest-bearing trade receivables and other receivables (previous year of ?\u00a04.8\u00a0m cash inflows). The tables below show a reconciliation of the loan loss provisions for financial assets, measured at amortised cost, for which loan loss provisions are determined using the general approach or the simplified approach.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/><entry colname=\"col11\"/><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\"/><entry colname=\"col15\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_210\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Change in risk provisions for financial assets measured at amortised cost in the classes advancesand loans, other receivables and assets and other financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Stage\u00a0112-month-ECL</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Stage\u00a02lifetime-ECL(not impaired)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Stage\u00a03lifetime-ECL\u00a0(impaired)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Total</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk provisioning as at\u00a01\u00a0Oct\u00a02021</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">27.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">14.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">41.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Addition of impairment on newly issued / acquired financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">20.8</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">24.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Transfer to stage\u00a03\u00a0lifetime\u00a0ECL\u00a0(impaired)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a07.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a012.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">20.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Unrequired impairments on financial assets derecognised during the period and use of impairments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a015.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?\u00a015.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk provisioning as at\u00a030\u00a0Sep\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">41.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">50.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk provisioning as at\u00a01\u00a0Oct\u00a02022</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">41.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">50.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Addition of impairment on newly issued / acquired financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Transfer to stage\u00a03\u00a0lifetime\u00a0ECL\u00a0(impaired)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a01.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.5</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Unrequired impairments on financial assets derecognised during the period and use of impairments</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a01.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?\u00a00.8</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a03.1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?\u00a05.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Removing specific bad debt allowance from presentation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?\u00a039.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?\u00a039.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Change of models, risk parameters</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?\u00a01.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?\u00a01.4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Risk provisioning as at\u00a030\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.4</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">7.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, risk provisioning totals ?\u00a04.6\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a019.8\u00a0m) for the other receivables and assets class and ?\u00a00.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a00.5\u00a0m) for the other financial assets class as well as ?\u00a02.8\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a030.6\u00a0m) for the advances and loans class.

To that end,\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s liquidity management system uses the opportunities of physical and virtual cash pooling for\u00a0more efficient liquidity pooling. It also uses credit lines to compensate for the seasonal fluctuations in liquidity resulting from the tourism business. The core credit facility is a syndicated revolving credit facility agreed with the previous syndicate banks and KfW Bank, which has been included due to the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic. The total amount of the revolving credit facility has now been reduced to a total of ?\u00a02.5\u00a0bn. Details of the financing transactions are presented in the section ?Going-concern reporting in accordance with the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code?. As in the previous year, no material assets were deposited as collateral for liabilities. Moreover, the Group companies participating in the automated cash pool are jointly and severally liable for financial liabilities from cash pooling agreements. At the balance sheet date,\u00a019\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group companies are jointly and severally liable for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s financial debts from the revolving credit facility and the promissory note loan. The tables provided below list the contractually agreed (undiscounted) cash flows of all primary financial\u00a0liabilities as at the balance sheet date. Planned payments for future new liabilities were not taken into account. Where financial liabilities have a floating interest rate, the forward interest rates fixed at the balance sheet\u00a0date were used to determine future interest payments. Financial liabilities cancellable at any time are allocated\u00a0to the earliest maturity band. The analysis of cash flows from derivative financial instruments shows the contractually agreed (undiscounted)\u00a0cash flows by maturity of foreign exchange hedges and hedges of other price risks of all liabilities that existed at the balance sheet date.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"10\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_217\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash flow of financial instruments ?

For further information for hedging strategies and risk management see also the remarks in the Risk Report section of the Management Report. Derivative financial instruments and hedges Strategy and goals In accordance with\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s policy, derivatives are allowed to be used if they are based on underlying recognised assets or liabilities, firm commitments or forecast transactions. Hedge accounting based on the rules of\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0is applied to forecasted transactions. In the completed financial year, hedges consisted of cash flow hedges. Derivative financial instruments in the form of fixed-price transactions and options as well as structured products can be used to limit currency, interest rate and fuel risks. The\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic significantly impacted\u00a0TUI?s business operations, causing a strong increase in\u00a0TUI?s credit risk premiums. The significant increase in\u00a0TUI?s credit risk had a direct impact on the effectiveness of\u00a0hedging relationships according to\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0and explicitly on the retrospective hedge effectiveness test, because when calculating retrospective effectiveness, the credit risk is included in the derivative instrument entered into with the counterparty, but not in the hypothetical derivative. As a result, fuel price, interest rate and currency hedges had to be de-designated as they no longer met the effectiveness requirements of\u00a0IAS\u00a039. For the de-designated hedging instruments cash flow hedge accounting is terminated and the hedges are recognised as other derivative financial instruments. Based on these de-designations any further changes in the fair value of these instruments will be recognised in profit or loss in the income statement in the cost of sales or, in the case of interest rate hedges, in the financial result. For all fuel price hedges contracted from\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02023, the retrospective effectiveness will be determined, based on regression analysis. For fuel price hedges contracted before\u00a031\u00a0December\u00a02022, the dollar offset method will continue to be applied. This change in method allows hedge relationships to be presented more\u00a0appropriately, so that as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, no newly contracted fuel price hedges after the\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02023\u00a0have to be de-designated. Furthermore, from\u00a031\u00a0March\u00a02023, the designation of the hedged item for foreign\u00a0currency hedges is evaluated on a seasonal basis. The designation on a seasonal basis reflects the operational tourism business model with a summer and winter season within a financial year and corresponds to the hedging approach of\u00a0TUI?s risk management strategy. Due to the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic and its impact on the business operations of\u00a0TUI, the seasonal consideration of the hedge ratio of foreign currency hedges was temporarily suspended and a designation on a monthly basis has been established. This approach for designation of hedges no longer corresponds to the risk management strategy as the tourism operating business has returned to pre-crisis levels. As at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, the fair value of these reclassified fuel price hedges totalled ?\u00a03.5\u00a0m at a nominal volume of ?\u00a010.3\u00a0m, while the fair value of the interest rate hedges amounted to ?\u00a02.5\u00a0m at a nominal volume of ?\u00a046.0\u00a0m and the fair value of foreign currency hedges totalled ?\u00a00.3\u00a0m at a nominal volume of ?\u00a02.4\u00a0m. Cash flow hedges At\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, hedges in hedging relationships in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0existed to manage cash flows in foreign currencies with maturities of up to two years (previous year up to two years). The fuel price hedges in hedging relationships in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0had terms of up to two years (previous year up to one year). Hedges in hedging relationships in accordance with\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0to protect variable interest payment\u00a0obligations are currently not in the portfolio (previous year none). The impact on profit or loss for is\u00a0recognised at the time the expected cash inflow / outflow occurs.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_221\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"192\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Nominal amounts of derivative financial instruments used</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Remaining term</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?

Due to the\u00a0COVID-19\u00a0pandemic, a large number of hedges according to\u00a0IAS\u00a039\u00a0had to be terminated.

In order to hedge the risks of fluctuations in future cash flows from currency, interest rate and fuel price\u00a0risks,\u00a0TUI\u00a0regularly enters into hedges. The planned underlying transactions are used to determine the ineffective portions of hedges designated as cash flow hedges.

A description of the determination of the fair values of derivative financial instruments is provided with the classification of financial instruments measured at fair value.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"8\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_227\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Positive and negative fair values of derivative financial instruments shown as receivables or liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30\u00a0Sep\u00a02023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?

Financial instruments ? Additional disclosures Carrying amounts and fair values Where financial instruments are listed in an active market, e. g. shares held and bonds issued, the fair value or market value is the respective quotation in this market at the balance sheet date. For over-the-counter bonds, debt components of bonds with warrants and convertible bonds, liabilities to banks, promissory\u00a0notes and other non-current financial liabilities, the fair value is determined as the present value of future\u00a0cash flows, taking account of yield curves and the respective credit spread, which depends on the credit rating. In financial year\u00a02023, the fair values of other current receivables and current liabilities to banks were determined in line with the past financial year, taking into account yield curves and the respective credit risk\u00a0premium (credit spread) based on credit rating. As a result, the assumption that the carrying amount approximately corresponds to the fair value due to the short remaining term has been adjusted to the current market conditions. The fair values of non-current trade receivables and for parts of current other receivables and current other financial assets as well as cash and cash equivalents, current other financial liabilities and trade payables correspond to the present values of the cash flows associated with the assets, taking account of current\u00a0interest parameters which reflect market and counterparty-related changes in terms and expectations.\u00a0In\u00a0the case of cash and cash equivalents, current trade receivables, other financial assets, current trade payables\u00a0and other financial liabilities the carrying amount approximates the fair value due to the short remaining\u00a0term. The table below shows the reconciliation of the balance sheet items to the financial instrument categories by carrying amount and fair value of the financial instruments.</entry><entry

(as shown in the balance sheet) in the tables above can differ from those in the other columns of a particular row since the latter include all financial instruments. That is the latter columns include financial instruments which are part of disposal groups according to\u00a0IFRS\u00a05. In the balance sheet, financial instruments, which are part of a disposal group, are shown as separate items. If such financial instruments are included, further details on these financial instruments are explained in the sections ?Assets held for sale? and ?Liabilities related to assets held. The instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income within the other financial assets class are investments in companies based on medium to long-term strategic objectives. Recording all short-term fluctuations in the fair value in the income statement would not be in line with\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s strategy; these equity instruments were therefore designated as fair value through\u00a0OCI.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_231\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Aggregation according to measurement categories under\u00a0IFRS\u00a09 as at 30 Sep 2023</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Carrying amount offinancialinstruments Total</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fair Value\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at amortised cost</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,759.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,221.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at fair value ? recognised directly in equity without recycling</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">9.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">9.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at fair value ? through profit and loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">544.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">544.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at amortised cost</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4,796.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4,619.2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at fair value ? through profit and loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_232\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Aggregation according to measurement categories under\u00a0IFRS\u00a09 as at 30 Sep 2022</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Carrying amount offinancialinstrumentsTotal</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Fair Value\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at amortised cost</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,850.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,834.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at fair value ? recognised directly in equity without recycling</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">9.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">9.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at fair value ? through profit and loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">242.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">242.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at amortised cost</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5,545.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5,150.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">at fair value ? through profit and loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">33.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">33.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Fair value measurement The table below presents the fair values of recurring, non-recurring and other financial instruments measured at fair value in line with the underlying measurement level.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally transferred out of Level\u00a01\u00a0into Level\u00a02\u00a0if the liquidity and trading activity no longer indicate an active market. The opposite situation applies to potential transfers out of Level\u00a02\u00a0into Level\u00a01. In the reporting period, there were no transfers between Level\u00a01\u00a0and Level\u00a02. Reclassifications from Level\u00a03\u00a0to Level\u00a02\u00a0or Level\u00a01\u00a0are made if observable market price quotations become available for the asset or liability concerned. In the reporting period there were no other transfers from or to Level\u00a03.\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group records transfers from or to Level\u00a03\u00a0at the date of the obligating event or occasion triggering the transfer. Level 1 Financial instruments The fair value of financial instruments for which an active market exists is based on quoted prices at the reporting date. An active market exists if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, pricing service or regulatory agency and these prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arm?s length basis. These financial instruments are classified as Level\u00a01. The fair values correspond to the nominal amounts multiplied by the quoted prices at the reporting date. At\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0Level\u00a01\u00a0financial instruments only include shares in money market funds measured at fair value. Level 2 Financial instruments The fair values of financial instruments not traded in an active market, e. g., over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives,\u00a0are determined by means of valuation techniques. These valuation techniques make maximum use of observable market data and minimise the use of group-specific assumptions. If all essential inputs for the determination of the fair value of an instrument are observable, the instrument is classified as Level\u00a02. If one or several key inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is classified as Level\u00a03. The following specific valuation techniques are used to measure financial instruments: For over-the-counter bonds, debt components of warrant and convertible bonds, liabilities to banks,\u00a0promissory notes and other non-current financial liabilities as well as for current other receivables, current financial liabilities and non-current trade and other receivables, the fair value is determined as the present value of future cash flows, taking account of observable yield curves and the respective credit spread, which depends on the credit rating.  The fair value of over-the-counter derivatives is determined by means of appropriate calculation methods, e. g., by discounting the expected future cash flows. The forward prices of forward transactions are based on the spot or cash prices, taking account of forward premiums and discounts. The fair values of optional hedges are calculated on the basis of option pricing models. The fair values determined on the basis of the group?s own systems are periodically compared with fair value confirmations of the external counterparties.  Other valuation techniques, e. g., discounting future cash flows, are used to determine the fair values of other financial instruments.

This involves the market data and parameters required for measurement being compiled or validated. Non-observable input parameters are reviewed on the basis of internally available information and updated if necessary. In principle, the unobservable input parameters relate to the following parameters; the (estimated)\u00a0EBITDA\u00a0margin is in a range between ?\u00a05.9\u00a0% and\u00a034.2\u00a0% (previous year\u00a08.3\u00a0% and\u00a024.0\u00a0%). The constant growth rate\u00a0is\u00a01\u00a0% (previous year\u00a01\u00a0%). The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is in a range between\u00a011.0\u00a0% (previous\u00a0year\u00a09.5\u00a0% ?\u00a011.3\u00a0%). Due to materiality, no detailed figures have been provided. With the exception of the\u00a0WACC, there is a positive correlation between the input factors and the fair value. The increase in the fair values of the financial instruments in Level\u00a03\u00a0resulted mainly from revaluation effects of ?\u00a023.8\u00a0m and the sale of the shares in Peakwork\u00a0AG\u00a0of ?\u00a024.0\u00a0m. Financial instruments classified as Other financial assets include shares in corporations. The total fair value of these financial investments at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0is ?\u00a09.9\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a09.6\u00a0m). In the year under\u00a0review, there were no disposals (previous year ?\u00a00.0\u00a0m) of shares in corporations as part of the initial consolidation which were measured at fair value, as part of their first consolidation. None of these strategic financial investments were sold in the completed financial year. Dividend payments of ?\u00a00.1\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a00.3\u00a0m) resulted from these financial investments. At\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, other receivables in accordance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a09\u00a0in Level\u00a03\u00a0include a carrying amount of ?\u00a038.9\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a0106.5\u00a0m) for a variable purchase price receivable from the sale of Riu Hotels S. A. in the prior year, measured as a financial instrument in the category\u00a0FVTPL. The fair value is determined using a probability calculation for the future gross operating profit, taking account of contractual entitlements to an additional purchase price demand and an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate (4.25\u00a0% previous year\u00a01.99\u00a0% until\u00a02.87\u00a0%). Gross operating profit is defined as total revenue minus operating expenses. The range of potential purchase price payments varies due to different expectations of target achievement between ?\u00a00\u00a0and ?\u00a039.7\u00a0m (corresponding to a target achievement of &amp;lt;\u00a090\u00a0% to max.\u00a0105\u00a0%). The hotels concerned to deliver already reached around of\u00a0105.5\u00a0% in August\u00a02023. Therefore, the variable purchase price receivable is set at the maximum level of ?\u00a039.7\u00a0m. A sensitivity analysis shows that an increase in the hotels? gross operating profit of\u00a010\u00a0% (regarding calendar year\u00a02023) would not result in a change in the present value of the additional purchase price receivable (previous year ?\u00a02.0\u00a0m), while a reduction in gross operating profit of\u00a010\u00a0% would result in a change in the present value of around ? ?\u00a022.0\u00a0m (previous year ? ?\u00a024.7\u00a0m). An interest rate shift of + / ?\u00a0100\u00a0basis points would alter the present value of the purchase price receivable by around ?\u00a00.2\u00a0m (previous year ?\u00a00.5\u00a0m). Effects on results The effects of remeasuring the financial assets carried at fair value through\u00a0OCI\u00a0as well as the effective portions\u00a0of changes in fair values of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are listed in the statement of changes in equity.

The contracts for financial instruments are based on standardised master agreements for financial derivatives\u00a0(including\u00a0ISDA\u00a0Master Agreement, German master agreement for financial derivatives), creating a conditional\u00a0right to netting contingent on defined future events. Under the contractual agreements all derivatives contracted with the corresponding counterparty with positive or negative fair values are netted in that case, resulting in a net receivable or payable in the amount of the balance. As this conditional right to netting is not enforceable in the course of ordinary business transactions and thus the criteria for netting are not met, the derivative financial assets and liabilities are carried at their gross amounts in the balance sheet at the reporting date. Financial assets and liabilities in the framework of the cash pooling scheme are shown on a net basis if there is a right to netting in ordinary business transactions and\u00a0TUI\u00a0intends to settle on a net basis. These financial instruments are included in the balance sheet items in the tables shown above. The gross amount of these netted cash and cash equivalents is ?\u00a0181.9\u00a0m as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year ?\u00a0391.1\u00a0m), while the gross amount of the netted financial liabilities is ?\u00a015.1\u00a0m as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year ?\u00a0122.8\u00a0m). (42) Capital management TUI\u00a0Group?s capital management ensures that our goals and strategies can be achieved in the interest of our share- / bond- and credit-holders as well as other stakeholders. The primary objectives of the Group are as follows: Ensuring sufficient liquidity for the Group  Profitable growth and a sustainable increase in\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group?s value  Strengthening our cash generation allowing to invest, pay dividends and strengthen the balance sheet  Maintaining sufficient debt capacity and an at least unchanged credit rating \u00a0The financing measures carried out in the year under review are described in detail in the section on Going concern reporting in accordance with the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code, additional information can be found on page\u00a0188 and in the section on Financial instruments, page 249 in the Notes. Management variables used in capital management to measure and control the above objectives are Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) and the gross leverage ratio, presented in the table below. From a Group perspective, invested capital is derived from liabilities, comprising equity (including non-controlling interests) and the balance of interest-bearing liabilities and interest-bearing assets with an adjustment for the seasonality of the Group?s net financial position. The cumulative amortisations of purchase price allocations are then added to the invested capital. TUI\u00a0Group calculates the gross leverage ratio as the ratio of gross financial debt + lease liabilities + recognised\u00a0obligations from defined benefit pension plans to\u00a0EBITDA. Due to the lower gross financial debt and the improved\u00a0EBITDA, the gross leverage ratio improved in the\u00a02023\u00a0financial year to a value of\u00a02.6x (previous year\u00a04.7x). In the past financial year, we achieved our previous financial stability target of a gross leverage ratio with a coverage ratio below\u00a03.0x at\u00a02.6x.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_240\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"504\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Key figures of capital risk management</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00d8 Invested Capital</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5,115.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5,457.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Underlying\u00a0EBIT</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">977.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">408.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ROIC</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">19.1\u00a0%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7.5\u00a0%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,297.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,051.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Lease liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,918.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,207.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Defined benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">571.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">438.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBITDA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,858.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,203.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gross Leverage Ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">From financial year\u00a02024\u00a0onwards, we define the net-leverage ratio along the following basic lines:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_241\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"504\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Leverage Ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">? million</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financial liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,297.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2,051.3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">plus Lease liabilities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,918.1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,207.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">less Cash and cash equivalents</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,060.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,736.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">less Other current financial assets</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48.6</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">85.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Debt</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2,106.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3,436.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBITDA\u00a0(underlying)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,775.3</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,224.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net Leverage Ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Due to lower net debt and the improvement in our\u00a0EBITDA\u00a0(underlying), our net-leverage ratio improved to\u00a01.2x in the financial year\u00a02023\u00a0(previous year\u00a02.8x).

TUI\u00a0Group?s financial and liquidity management for all Group subsidiaries is centrally operated by\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, which acts as the Group?s internal bank. Financing and refinancing requirements, derived from the multi-year finance budget, are satisfied by the timely conclusion of appropriate financing instruments. The short-term\u00a0liquidity reserve is safeguarded by syndicated credit facilities, bilateral bank loans and liquid funds. Moreover, through intra-Group cash pooling the cash surpluses of individual Group companies are used to finance the cash requirements of other Group companies. Notes to the Cash Flow Statement The cash flow statement shows the flow of cash and cash equivalents on the basis of a separate presentation of cash inflows and outflows from operating, investing and financing activities. The effects of changes in the group of consolidated companies and of foreign currency translation are eliminated. In the period under review, cash and cash equivalents increased by ?\u00a0323.6\u00a0m to ?\u00a02,060.5\u00a0m. (43) Cash inflow / cash outflow from operating activities Based on the Group result after tax, the cash flow from operating activities is derived using the indirect\u00a0method.

Related parties controlled by\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group or over which\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group is able to exercise a significant influence are shown in the list of shareholdings (Note\u00a053) published in the Unternehmensregister (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.unternehmensregister.de\">www.unternehmensregister.de</url>). Apart from pure equity investments, related parties also include companies that supply goods or provide services for\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group companies. Through the Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF), the federal German government indirectly acquired two silent participations and a warrant bond, which combined form the stabilisation package for\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG. With the payments of ?\u00a0420\u00a0m made in connection with the first silent participation on\u00a025\u00a0January\u00a02021, a number of terms and conditions relating to the package entered into force, which\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0had to comply with. Due to the scope of those terms and conditions,\u00a0ESF\u00a0was able to exercise material control over\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0and hence was a related party. On\u00a027th April\u00a02023\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0bought the warrant bond and terminated the remaining silent participation. Thereupon the terms and conditions expired, disregarding some information requirements. Accordingly, the\u00a0ESF\u00a0is no longer a related party of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG\u00a0since this date. The return of the stabilisation measures is a significant business transaction with the\u00a0ESF. Please refer to Note\u00a027\u00a0?Silent participations? and Note\u00a010\u00a0?Earnings per share? for details regarding the warrant bond.

In addition, we have audited the combined management report\u00a0for\u00a0the parent and the group of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Berlin and Hanover / Germany, for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited those parts of the combined management report set out in the appendix to the auditor?s report. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the\u00a0IFRS\u00a0as\u00a0adopted by the\u00a0EU\u00a0and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section\u00a0315e\u00a0(1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of\u00a0the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0and of its financial performance for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, and  the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group?s position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated\u00a0financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of those parts of the combined management report set out in the appendix to the auditor?s report. Pursuant to Section\u00a0322\u00a0(3) sentence\u00a01\u00a0HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. Basis for the Audit Opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report\u00a0in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation (No.\u00a0537\u00a0/\u00a02014; referred to subsequently\u00a0as\u00a0?EU\u00a0Audit Regulation?) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the ?Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report? section of our auditor?s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article\u00a010\u00a0(2) point (f) of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services\u00a0prohibited under Article\u00a05\u00a0(1) of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our\u00a0audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a\u00a0whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 1. Recoverability of goodwill 2. Specific provisions Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: A. description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) B. auditor?s response 1. Recoverability of goodwill A.\u00a0In\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, goodwill totalling mEUR\u00a02,949.2\u00a0is reported under the item ?goodwill? in the statement of financial position. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year. Valuation is made by means of a valuation model based on the discounted cash flow method. Since the outcome of this valuation strongly depends on the estimate of future cash inflows by the executive board and on the discount rate used, in the light of the uncertainty of further impacts of the further geopolitical development and of the general price development there is an increased degree of forecasting uncertainty. Thus, the valuation is subject to significant uncertainty. Against this background, we believe that this is a key audit matter. The Company?s disclosures on goodwill are provided in Note (12) of the notes to the consolidated financial\u00a0statements. B.\u00a0We evaluated the process for performing the impairment test on goodwill, and carried out an assessment\u00a0of the accounting-relevant controls contained therein. Specifically, we satisfied ourselves of the appropriateness of the future cash inflows used in the calculation. For this purpose, among other things, we compared these figures with the current budgets contained in the three-year plan adopted by the executive\u00a0board and approved by the supervisory board, and reconciled it with general and industry-specific market expectations. Since even relatively small changes in the discount rate can have a material effect on the amount of the business value determined in this way, we also focused on examining the parameters used to determine the discount rate used, including the weighted average cost of capital, and analysed the calculation algorithm. Owing to the material significance of goodwill and the fact that the valuation also depends on macroeconomic conditions which are beyond the control of the Company, we also assessed the sensitivity analyses prepared by the Company for the cash-generating units with low excess cover (carrying amount compared to the realisable amount). 2. Specific provisions A.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0report provisions for maintenances of mEUR\u00a0778.6\u00a0under the statement of financial position item ?other provisions?. Furthermore, provisions for pensions and similar obligations of mEUR\u00a0670.4\u00a0were recognised as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. In our view, these facts are key audit matters, as the recognition and measurement of these significant items are based to a large extent on estimates and assumptions made by the executive board. The Company?s disclosures on provisions are provided under the Notes (30) and (31) as well as under the disclosures on recognition and measurement methods set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. B.\u00a0We evaluated the process of recognition and measurement applicable to specific provisions, and carried out an assessment of the accounting-relevant controls contained therein. In the knowledge that there is an increased risk of misstatements in financial reporting with estimated values, and that the valuation\u00a0decisions of the executive board have a direct and significant effect on the consolidated profit, we assessed the appropriateness of the values recognised by comparing them against historical values and by means of the contractual bases presented to us. Among other things, we assessed the computation of the expected maintenance costs for aircraft. This was done on the basis\u00a0of group-wide maintenance contracts, price increases expected on the basis of external market forecasts and the discount rates applied, supported by our own analyses;  assessed the appropriateness of the valuation parameters used to calculate the pension provisions. Among other things, we did so by comparing them against market data and taking into account the expertise of our internal pension valuation experts. Other Information The executive board and / or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the supervisory board,  the report of the audit committee,  the remuneration report pursuant to Section\u00a0162\u00a0German Stock Corporation Act (AktG),  the unaudited content of the combined management report specified in the appendix to the auditor?s report,  the executive directors? confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Section\u00a0297\u00a0(2) sentence\u00a04\u00a0and Section\u00a0315\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a05\u00a0HGB, and  all other parts of the annual report,  but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor?s report thereon. The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board and for the report of the audit committee. The executive board and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement pursuant to\u00a0Section\u00a0161\u00a0AktG on the German Corporate Governance Code, which forms part of the corporate governance statement included in the section ?Corporate Governance Report? set out in the combined management\u00a0report, and for the remuneration report. Otherwise the executive board is responsible for the other information. Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report The executive board is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply,\u00a0in all material respects, with\u00a0IFRS\u00a0as adopted by the\u00a0EU\u00a0and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section\u00a0315e (1)\u00a0HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with\u00a0these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive board is responsible for such internal control as it has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive board is responsible for assessing the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, it is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive board is responsible for the preparation of the combined management report\u00a0that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group?s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive board is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as it has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group?s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statementsand of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a\u00a0whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group?s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies\u00a0with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor?s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) and in supplementary compliance with the\u00a0ISA\u00a0will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the\u00a0combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive board and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive board and related disclosures.  conclude on the appropriateness of the executive board?s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor?s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based\u00a0on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor?s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a0as adopted by the\u00a0EU\u00a0and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section\u00a0315e (1)\u00a0HGB.  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.  evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group?s position it provides.  perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive board in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive board as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be\u00a0thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor?s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. Other legal and regulatory requirements Report on the Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated FinancialStatements\u00a0and of the Combined Management report Prepared for Publication Pursuantto Section 317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB Audit Opinion We have performed an audit in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB\u00a0to obtain reasonable assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as ?ESEF\u00a0documents?) prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the\u00a0SHA256:\u00a0070728ffe6af22f07d341897cb93b387edcdb8f50464acd728cb6370a599f788,\u00a0meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB\u00a0(?ESEF\u00a0format?). In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report\u00a0into the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above. In our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the\u00a0accompanying combined management report for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0contained in the ?Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report? above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above. Basis for the Audit Opinion We conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB\u00a0and on the basis of the\u00a0IDW\u00a0Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section\u00a0317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB\u00a0(IDW\u00a0AuS\u00a0410\u00a0(06.2022)). Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the ?Group Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0Documents? section. Our audit firm has applied the\u00a0IDW\u00a0Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW\u00a0QS\u00a01). Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents The executive board of the parent is responsible for the preparation of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents based on the electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report according to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a04\u00a0no.\u00a01\u00a0HGB\u00a0and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a04\u00a0no.\u00a02\u00a0HGB. In addition, the executive board of the parent is responsible for such internal controls that it has considered\u00a0necessary to enable the preparation of\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents as part of the financial reporting process. Group Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents in order to design\u00a0audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.  evaluate the technical validity of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents, i.e. whether the file containing the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU)\u00a02019\u00a0/\u00a0815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.  evaluate whether the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents enable a\u00a0XHTML\u00a0reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.  evaluate whether the tagging of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents with Inline\u00a0XBRL\u00a0technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles\u00a04\u00a0and\u00a06\u00a0of the Delegated Regulation (EU)\u00a02019\u00a0/\u00a0815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable\u00a0XBRL\u00a0copy of the\u00a0XHTML\u00a0reproduction. Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation We were elected as group auditor by the general meeting on\u00a014\u00a0February\u00a02023. We were engaged by the\u00a0supervisory board on\u00a019\u00a0April\u00a02023. We have been the group auditor of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Berlin and Hanover / Germany, without interruption since the financial year\u00a02016\u00a0/\u00a02017. We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor?s report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article\u00a011\u00a0of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation (long-form audit report).

Report of the Independent Practitioner Regardingthe consolidated non-financial statement Limited assurance report of the independent practitioner regarding the consolidated non-financial statement for the financial year from 1\u00a0October\u00a02022 to 30\u00a0September\u00a02023 To\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Hanover Our Engagement We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the consolidated non-financial statement, which is included in the combined management report for the parent and the group, of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Hanover / Germany, (hereafter referred to as ?the Company?) for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0(hereafter referred to as ?non-financial statement?). The\u00a0TCFD\u00a0compliance statement as well as further websites referred to in the consolidated non-financial statement, were not subject to our audit. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement in accordance with Section\u00a0315c in conjunction with Sections\u00a0289c to\u00a0289e\u00a0HGB\u00a0and Article\u00a08\u00a0of Regulation (EU)\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a0852\u00a0of the European Parliament and the Council of\u00a018\u00a0June\u00a02020\u00a0on the establishment of a\u00a0framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU)\u00a02019\u00a0/\u00a02088\u00a0(hereafter referred\u00a0to as ?EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation?) and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with their own interpretation of the wording and terminology contained in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as is presented in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. These responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company include the selection and application of\u00a0appropriate methods regarding the combined non-financial statement and the use of assumptions and\u00a0estimates for individual non-financial disclosures of the Group which are reasonable under the given circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have deemed necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement due to fraud (i. e., fraudulent non-financial statement) or error. Some of the wording and terminology contained in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainty and have not yet been officially clarified. Therefore, the executive directors have laid down their own interpretation of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted thereon in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. They are responsible for the reasonableness of this\u00a0interpretation. As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations,\u00a0the legal conformity of the interpretation is prone to uncertainty. The preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the non-financial statement is subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from assumptions made. Independence and Quality Assurance of the Audit Firm We have complied with the German professional requirements on independence and other professional rules of conduct. Our firm applies the national statutory rules and professional announcements ? particularly of the ?Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors? (BS\u00a0WP\u00a0/ vBP) and of the\u00a0IDW\u00a0Quality\u00a0Assurance Standard: Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Practices (IDW\u00a0QS\u00a01) promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) and does therefore maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system comprising documented regulations and measures in respect of compliance with professional rules of conduct, professional standards, as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements. Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the non-financial statement based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)\u00a03000\u00a0(Revised) ?Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information?, adopted by the\u00a0IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe\u00a0that the non-financial statement of the Company, with the exception of the external sources of documentation\u00a0(references to the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0compliance statement as well as to websites) referenced therein, has not been\u00a0prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section\u00a0315c in conjunction with Sections\u00a0289c to\u00a0289e\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement have a lesser extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner?s professional judgement. Within the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which we performed between August and December\u00a02023, we notably performed the following work and other activities: Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the Group?s sustainability organisation and of the stakeholder engagement,  Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees involved about the process of preparation, about the system of internal control relating to this process, as well as about the disclosures contained in the non-financial statement,  Identification of probable risks of material misstatements in the non-financial statement,  Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures contained in the non-financial statement,  Cross validation of selected disclosures and the corresponding data in the consolidated and annual financial\u00a0statements as well as in the combined management report,  Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial statement,  Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial statement. The determination of the disclosures pursuant to Article\u00a08\u00a0of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation requires the\u00a0executive directors to make interpretations of indefinite legal concepts. As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations, the legal conformity of the interpretation, and hence our related examination, is prone to uncertainty. Practitioner?s Conclusion Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement of the Company for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0does not comply, in all material respects, with Section\u00a0315c in conjunction with Sections\u00a0289c to\u00a0289e\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the executive directors? interpretation presented in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. Our practitioner?s conclusion does neither\u00a0include the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0compliance statement nor further websites referred to in the consolidated non-financial statement. Restriction of Use We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company (including the ?General\u00a0Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer and Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaften (German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms)? as of\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02017\u00a0promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW)). We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was performed for the purposes of the Company\u00a0and the report is solely designed for informing the Company about the findings of the assurance engagement.\u00a0Therefore, it may not be suitable for another than the aforementioned purpose. Hence, this report should not be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision. We are solely liable to the Company. However, we do not accept or assume liability to third parties. Our conclusion was not modified in this respect.

These statements are based on assumptions and estimates and may entail known\u00a0and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual development and results as well as the financial and asset\u00a0situation may therefore differ substantially from the expectations and assumptions made.

In addition, we have audited the combined management report\u00a0for\u00a0the parent and the group of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Berlin and Hanover / Germany, for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. In accordance with the German legal requirements, we have not audited those parts of the combined management report set out in the appendix to the auditor?s report. In our opinion, on the basis of the knowledge obtained in the audit, the accompanying consolidated financial statements comply, in all material respects, with the\u00a0IFRS\u00a0as\u00a0adopted by the\u00a0EU\u00a0and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section\u00a0315e\u00a0(1) German Commercial Code (HGB) and, in compliance with these requirements, give a true and fair view of\u00a0the assets, liabilities and financial position of the Group as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0and of its financial performance for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, and  the accompanying combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group?s position. In all material respects, this combined management report is consistent with the consolidated\u00a0financial statements, complies with German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. Our audit opinion on the combined management report does not cover the content of those parts of the combined management report set out in the appendix to the auditor?s report. Pursuant to Section\u00a0322\u00a0(3) sentence\u00a01\u00a0HGB, we declare that our audit has not led to any reservations relating to the legal compliance of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. Basis for the Audit Opinions We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report\u00a0in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation (No.\u00a0537\u00a0/\u00a02014; referred to subsequently\u00a0as\u00a0?EU\u00a0Audit Regulation?) and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW). We performed the audit of the consolidated financial statements in supplementary compliance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). Our responsibilities under those requirements, principles and standards are further described in the ?Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report? section of our auditor?s report. We are independent of the group entities in accordance with the requirements of European law and German commercial and professional law, and we have fulfilled our other German professional responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. In addition, in accordance with Article\u00a010\u00a0(2) point (f) of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation, we declare that we have not provided non-audit services\u00a0prohibited under Article\u00a05\u00a0(1) of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Key Audit Matters in the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our\u00a0audit of the consolidated financial statements for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a\u00a0whole and in forming our audit opinion thereon; we do not provide a separate audit opinion on these matters. In the following we present the key audit matters we have determined in the course of our audit: 1. Recoverability of goodwill 2. Specific provisions Our presentation of these key audit matters has been structured as follows: A. description (including reference to corresponding information in the consolidated financial statements) B. auditor?s response 1. Recoverability of goodwill A.\u00a0In\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023, goodwill totalling mEUR\u00a02,949.2\u00a0is reported under the item ?goodwill? in the statement of financial position. Goodwill is subject to an impairment test at least once a year. Valuation is made by means of a valuation model based on the discounted cash flow method. Since the outcome of this valuation strongly depends on the estimate of future cash inflows by the executive board and on the discount rate used, in the light of the uncertainty of further impacts of the further geopolitical development and of the general price development there is an increased degree of forecasting uncertainty. Thus, the valuation is subject to significant uncertainty. Against this background, we believe that this is a key audit matter. The Company?s disclosures on goodwill are provided in Note (12) of the notes to the consolidated financial\u00a0statements. B.\u00a0We evaluated the process for performing the impairment test on goodwill, and carried out an assessment\u00a0of the accounting-relevant controls contained therein. Specifically, we satisfied ourselves of the appropriateness of the future cash inflows used in the calculation. For this purpose, among other things, we compared these figures with the current budgets contained in the three-year plan adopted by the executive\u00a0board and approved by the supervisory board, and reconciled it with general and industry-specific market expectations. Since even relatively small changes in the discount rate can have a material effect on the amount of the business value determined in this way, we also focused on examining the parameters used to determine the discount rate used, including the weighted average cost of capital, and analysed the calculation algorithm. Owing to the material significance of goodwill and the fact that the valuation also depends on macroeconomic conditions which are beyond the control of the Company, we also assessed the sensitivity analyses prepared by the Company for the cash-generating units with low excess cover (carrying amount compared to the realisable amount). 2. Specific provisions A.\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG?s consolidated financial statements as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0report provisions for maintenances of mEUR\u00a0778.6\u00a0under the statement of financial position item ?other provisions?. Furthermore, provisions for pensions and similar obligations of mEUR\u00a0670.4\u00a0were recognised as at\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023. In our view, these facts are key audit matters, as the recognition and measurement of these significant items are based to a large extent on estimates and assumptions made by the executive board. The Company?s disclosures on provisions are provided under the Notes (30) and (31) as well as under the disclosures on recognition and measurement methods set out in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. B.\u00a0We evaluated the process of recognition and measurement applicable to specific provisions, and carried out an assessment of the accounting-relevant controls contained therein. In the knowledge that there is an increased risk of misstatements in financial reporting with estimated values, and that the valuation\u00a0decisions of the executive board have a direct and significant effect on the consolidated profit, we assessed the appropriateness of the values recognised by comparing them against historical values and by means of the contractual bases presented to us. Among other things, we assessed the computation of the expected maintenance costs for aircraft. This was done on the basis\u00a0of group-wide maintenance contracts, price increases expected on the basis of external market forecasts and the discount rates applied, supported by our own analyses;  assessed the appropriateness of the valuation parameters used to calculate the pension provisions. Among other things, we did so by comparing them against market data and taking into account the expertise of our internal pension valuation experts. Other Information The executive board and / or the supervisory board are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the report of the supervisory board,  the report of the audit committee,  the remuneration report pursuant to Section\u00a0162\u00a0German Stock Corporation Act (AktG),  the unaudited content of the combined management report specified in the appendix to the auditor?s report,  the executive directors? confirmation regarding the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report pursuant to Section\u00a0297\u00a0(2) sentence\u00a04\u00a0and Section\u00a0315\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a05\u00a0HGB, and  all other parts of the annual report,  but not the consolidated financial statements, not the audited content of the combined management report and not our auditor?s report thereon. The supervisory board is responsible for the report of the supervisory board and for the report of the audit committee. The executive board and the supervisory board are responsible for the statement pursuant to\u00a0Section\u00a0161\u00a0AktG on the German Corporate Governance Code, which forms part of the corporate governance statement included in the section ?Corporate Governance Report? set out in the combined management\u00a0report, and for the remuneration report. Otherwise the executive board is responsible for the other information. Our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report do not cover the other information, and consequently we do not express an audit opinion or any other form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, to consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements, with the audited content of the combined management report or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or  otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Combined Management Report The executive board is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that comply,\u00a0in all material respects, with\u00a0IFRS\u00a0as adopted by the\u00a0EU\u00a0and the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section\u00a0315e (1)\u00a0HGB, and that the consolidated financial statements, in compliance with\u00a0these requirements, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group. In addition, the executive board is responsible for such internal control as it has determined necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud (i.e. fraudulent financial reporting and misappropriation of assets) or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the executive board is responsible for assessing the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern. It also has the responsibility for disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern. In addition, it is responsible for financial reporting based on the going concern basis of accounting unless there is an intention to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or there is no realistic alternative but to do so. Furthermore, the executive board is responsible for the preparation of the combined management report\u00a0that as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group?s position and is, in all material respects, consistent with the consolidated financial statements, complies with German legal requirements, and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development. In addition, the executive board is responsible for such arrangements and measures (systems) as it has considered necessary to enable the preparation of a combined management report that is in accordance with the applicable German legal requirements, and to be able to provide sufficient appropriate evidence for the assertions in the combined management report. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the Group?s financial reporting process for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report. Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statementsand of the Group Management Report Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a\u00a0whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and whether the combined management report as a whole provides an appropriate view of the Group?s position and, in all material respects, is consistent with the consolidated financial statements and the knowledge obtained in the audit, complies\u00a0with the German legal requirements and appropriately presents the opportunities and risks of future development, as well as to issue an auditor?s report that includes our audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation and in compliance with German Generally Accepted Standards for Financial Statement Audits promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) and in supplementary compliance with the\u00a0ISA\u00a0will always detect a material misstatement. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements and this combined management report. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements and of the\u00a0combined management report, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinions. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit of the consolidated financial statements and of arrangements and measures relevant to the audit of the combined management report in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an audit opinion on the effectiveness of these systems.  evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used by the executive board and the reasonableness of estimates made by the executive board and related disclosures.  conclude on the appropriateness of the executive board?s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group?s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in the auditor?s report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and in the combined management report or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our respective audit opinions. Our conclusions are based\u00a0on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor?s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to be able to continue as a going concern.  evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements present the underlying transactions and events in a manner that the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and financial performance of the Group in compliance with\u00a0IFRS\u00a0as adopted by the\u00a0EU\u00a0and with the additional requirements of German commercial law pursuant to Section\u00a0315e (1)\u00a0HGB.  obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express audit opinions on the consolidated financial statements and on the combined management report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinions.  evaluate the consistency of the combined management report with the consolidated financial statements, its conformity with German law, and the view of the Group?s position it provides.  perform audit procedures on the prospective information presented by the executive board in the combined management report. On the basis of sufficient appropriate audit evidence we evaluate, in particular, the significant assumptions used by the executive board as a basis for the prospective information, and evaluate the proper derivation of the prospective information from these assumptions. We do not express a separate audit opinion on the prospective information and on the assumptions used as a basis. There is a substantial unavoidable risk that future events will differ materially from the prospective information. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with the relevant independence requirements, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be\u00a0thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, the actions taken or safeguards applied to eliminate independence threats. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in the auditor?s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter. Other legal and regulatory requirements Report on the Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of the Consolidated FinancialStatements\u00a0and of the Combined Management report Prepared for Publication Pursuantto Section 317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB Audit Opinion We have performed an audit in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB\u00a0to obtain reasonable assurance whether the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report (hereinafter referred to as ?ESEF\u00a0documents?) prepared for publication, contained in the file, which has the\u00a0SHA256:\u00a0070728ffe6af22f07d341897cb93b387edcdb8f50464acd728cb6370a599f788,\u00a0meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB\u00a0(?ESEF\u00a0format?). In accordance with the German legal requirements, this audit only covers the conversion of the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the combined management report\u00a0into the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0format, and therefore covers neither the information contained in these electronic reproductions nor any other information contained in the file identified above. In our opinion, the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report prepared for publication contained in the file identified above meet, in all material respects, the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB. Beyond this audit opinion and our audit opinions on the accompanying consolidated financial statements and on the\u00a0accompanying combined management report for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0contained in the ?Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements and of the Combined Management Report? above, we do not express any assurance opinion on the information contained within these electronic reproductions or on any other information contained in the file identified above. Basis for the Audit Opinion We conducted our audit of the electronic reproductions of the consolidated financial statements and of the combined management report contained in the file identified above in accordance with Section\u00a0317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB\u00a0and on the basis of the\u00a0IDW\u00a0Auditing Standard: Audit of the Electronic Reproductions of Financial Statements and Management Reports Prepared for Publication Purposes Pursuant to Section\u00a0317\u00a0(3a)\u00a0HGB\u00a0(IDW\u00a0AuS\u00a0410\u00a0(06.2022)). Our responsibilities in this context are further described in the ?Group Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0Documents? section. Our audit firm has applied the\u00a0IDW\u00a0Standard on Quality Management: Requirements for Quality Management in the Audit Firm (IDW\u00a0QS\u00a01). Responsibilities of the Executive Board and the Supervisory Board for the ESEF Documents The executive board of the parent is responsible for the preparation of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents based on the electronic files of the consolidated financial statements and of the group management report according to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a04\u00a0no.\u00a01\u00a0HGB\u00a0and for the tagging of the consolidated financial statements according to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1) sentence\u00a04\u00a0no.\u00a02\u00a0HGB. In addition, the executive board of the parent is responsible for such internal controls that it has considered\u00a0necessary to enable the preparation of\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents that are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements for the electronic reporting format pursuant to Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB. The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the process for preparing the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents as part of the financial reporting process. Group Auditor?s Responsibilities for the Audit of the ESEF Documents Our objective is to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents are free from material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB. We exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also identify and assess the risks of material intentional or unintentional non-compliance with the requirements of Section\u00a0328\u00a0(1)\u00a0HGB, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.  obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit on the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents in order to design\u00a0audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an assurance opinion on the effectiveness of these controls.  evaluate the technical validity of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents, i.e. whether the file containing the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents meets the requirements of the Delegated Regulation (EU)\u00a02019\u00a0/\u00a0815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, on the technical specification for this electronic file.  evaluate whether the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents enable a\u00a0XHTML\u00a0reproduction with content equivalent to the audited consolidated financial statements and to the audited combined management report.  evaluate whether the tagging of the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents with Inline\u00a0XBRL\u00a0technology (iXBRL) in accordance with the requirements of Articles\u00a04\u00a0and\u00a06\u00a0of the Delegated Regulation (EU)\u00a02019\u00a0/\u00a0815, in the version in force at the balance sheet date, enables an appropriate and complete machine-readable\u00a0XBRL\u00a0copy of the\u00a0XHTML\u00a0reproduction. Further information pursuant to Article 10 of the EU Audit Regulation We were elected as group auditor by the general meeting on\u00a014\u00a0February\u00a02023. We were engaged by the\u00a0supervisory board on\u00a019\u00a0April\u00a02023. We have been the group auditor of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Berlin and Hanover / Germany, without interruption since the financial year\u00a02016\u00a0/\u00a02017. We declare that the audit opinions expressed in this auditor?s report are consistent with the additional report to the audit committee pursuant to Article\u00a011\u00a0of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Audit Regulation (long-form audit report). Review of the Executive Board?s Declaration of Compliance with theUK Corporate Governance Code Pursuant to item\u00a09.8.10\u00a0R (1\u00a0and\u00a02) of the Listing Rules in the\u00a0UK, we were engaged to review the executive board?s statement pursuant to item\u00a09.8.6\u00a0R (6) of the Listing Rules in the\u00a0UK\u00a0relating to compliance with provisions\u00a06\u00a0and\u00a024\u00a0to\u00a029\u00a0of the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code included in the report on the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code, and the executive board?s statement pursuant to item\u00a09.8.6\u00a0R (3) of the Listing Rules in the\u00a0UK\u00a0included in the ?Viability statement? section of the combined management report and in chapter ?Going concern reporting according to the\u00a0UK\u00a0Corporate Governance Code? of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the financial year\u00a02022\u00a0/\u00a02023. We have nothing to report in this regard. OTHER MATTER ? USE OF THE AUDITOR?S REPORT Our auditor?s report must always be read together with the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report as well as with the audited\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents. The consolidated financial statements and the combined management report converted into the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0format ? including the versions to be submitted for inclusion in the Company Register ? are merely electronic reproductions of the audited consolidated financial statements and the audited combined management report and do not take\u00a0their place. In particular, the\u00a0ESEF\u00a0report and our audit opinion contained therein are to be used solely together with the audited\u00a0ESEF\u00a0documents made available in electronic form. GERMAN PUBLIC AUDITOR RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ENGAGEMENT The German Public Auditor responsible for the engagement is Annika Deutsch. Hanover / Germany,\u00a04\u00a0December\u00a02023 Deloitte GmbH Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaft Signed: Signed: Annika Deutsch Elmar Meier Wirtschaftspr\u00fcferin Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (German Public Auditor) (German Public Auditor) Appendix to the Independent Auditor?s Report: Parts of the CombinedManagement Report Whose Contents are Unaudited We have not audited the content of the following parts of the combined management report: the non-financial statement pursuant to Sections\u00a0315b and\u00a0315c\u00a0HGB\u00a0included in section ?Combined non-financial declaration of\u00a0TUI\u00a0Group? of the group management report,  the statement on corporate governance with the statement on corporate governance pursuant to Sec.\u00a0289f\u00a0and Sec.\u00a0315d\u00a0HGB, and  the other parts of the combined management report marked as unaudited. Report of the Independent Practitioner Regardingthe consolidated non-financial statement Limited assurance report of the independent practitioner regarding the consolidated non-financial statement for the financial year from 1\u00a0October\u00a02022 to 30\u00a0September\u00a02023 To\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Hanover Our Engagement We have performed a limited assurance engagement on the consolidated non-financial statement, which is included in the combined management report for the parent and the group, of\u00a0TUI\u00a0AG, Hanover / Germany, (hereafter referred to as ?the Company?) for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0(hereafter referred to as ?non-financial statement?). The\u00a0TCFD\u00a0compliance statement as well as further websites referred to in the consolidated non-financial statement, were not subject to our audit. Responsibilities of the Executive Directors The executive directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the non-financial statement in accordance with Section\u00a0315c in conjunction with Sections\u00a0289c to\u00a0289e\u00a0HGB\u00a0and Article\u00a08\u00a0of Regulation (EU)\u00a02020\u00a0/\u00a0852\u00a0of the European Parliament and the Council of\u00a018\u00a0June\u00a02020\u00a0on the establishment of a\u00a0framework to facilitate sustainable investment, and amending Regulation (EU)\u00a02019\u00a0/\u00a02088\u00a0(hereafter referred\u00a0to as ?EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation?) and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with their own interpretation of the wording and terminology contained in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as is presented in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. These responsibilities of the executive directors of the Company include the selection and application of\u00a0appropriate methods regarding the combined non-financial statement and the use of assumptions and\u00a0estimates for individual non-financial disclosures of the Group which are reasonable under the given circumstances. In addition, the executive directors are responsible for such internal control as they have deemed necessary to enable the preparation of a non-financial statement that is free from material misstatement due to fraud (i. e., fraudulent non-financial statement) or error. Some of the wording and terminology contained in the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon are still subject to considerable interpretation uncertainty and have not yet been officially clarified. Therefore, the executive directors have laid down their own interpretation of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and of the delegated acts adopted thereon in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. They are responsible for the reasonableness of this\u00a0interpretation. As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations,\u00a0the legal conformity of the interpretation is prone to uncertainty. The preciseness and completeness of the environmental data in the non-financial statement is subject to inherent restrictions resulting from the manner in which the data was collected and calculated as well as from assumptions made. Independence and Quality Assurance of the Audit Firm We have complied with the German professional requirements on independence and other professional rules of conduct. Our firm applies the national statutory rules and professional announcements ? particularly of the ?Professional Charter for German Public Auditors and German Sworn Auditors? (BS\u00a0WP\u00a0/ vBP) and of the\u00a0IDW\u00a0Quality\u00a0Assurance Standard: Requirements for Quality Management in Audit Practices (IDW\u00a0QS\u00a01) promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW) and does therefore maintain a comprehensive quality assurance system comprising documented regulations and measures in respect of compliance with professional rules of conduct, professional standards, as well as relevant statutory and other legal requirements. Responsibilities of the Independent Practitioner Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the non-financial statement based on our work performed within our limited assurance engagement. We conducted our work in accordance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE)\u00a03000\u00a0(Revised) ?Assurance Engagements Other than Audits or Reviews of Historical Financial Information?, adopted by the\u00a0IAASB. This Standard requires that we plan and perform the assurance engagement so that we can conclude with limited assurance whether matters have come to our attention to cause us to believe\u00a0that the non-financial statement of the Company, with the exception of the external sources of documentation\u00a0(references to the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0compliance statement as well as to websites) referenced therein, has not been\u00a0prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with Section\u00a0315c in conjunction with Sections\u00a0289c to\u00a0289e\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the interpretation by the executive directors presented in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. The procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement have a lesser extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed. The choice of assurance work is subject to the practitioner?s professional judgement. Within the scope of our limited assurance engagement, which we performed between August and December\u00a02023, we notably performed the following work and other activities: Obtaining an understanding of the structure of the Group?s sustainability organisation and of the stakeholder engagement,  Inquiries of the executive directors and relevant employees involved about the process of preparation, about the system of internal control relating to this process, as well as about the disclosures contained in the non-financial statement,  Identification of probable risks of material misstatements in the non-financial statement,  Analytical evaluation of selected disclosures contained in the non-financial statement,  Cross validation of selected disclosures and the corresponding data in the consolidated and annual financial\u00a0statements as well as in the combined management report,  Evaluation of the presentation of the non-financial statement,  Evaluation of the process to identify taxonomy-eligible and taxonomy-aligned economic activities and the corresponding disclosures in the non-financial statement. The determination of the disclosures pursuant to Article\u00a08\u00a0of the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation requires the\u00a0executive directors to make interpretations of indefinite legal concepts. As there is the inherent risk that indefinite legal concepts may allow for various interpretations, the legal conformity of the interpretation, and hence our related examination, is prone to uncertainty. Practitioner?s Conclusion Based on the work performed and the evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the consolidated non-financial statement of the Company for the financial year from\u00a01\u00a0October\u00a02022\u00a0to\u00a030\u00a0September\u00a02023\u00a0does not comply, in all material respects, with Section\u00a0315c in conjunction with Sections\u00a0289c to\u00a0289e\u00a0HGB\u00a0and the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation and the delegated acts adopted thereon, as well as with the executive directors? interpretation presented in section ?Disclosures according to the\u00a0EU\u00a0Taxonomy Regulation (2020\u00a0/\u00a0852)? of the non-financial statement. Our practitioner?s conclusion does neither\u00a0include the\u00a0TCFD\u00a0compliance statement nor further websites referred to in the consolidated non-financial statement. Restriction of Use We issue this report as stipulated in the engagement letter agreed with the Company (including the ?General\u00a0Engagement Terms for Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer and Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfungsgesellschaften (German Public Auditors and Public Audit Firms)? as of\u00a01\u00a0January\u00a02017\u00a0promulgated by the Institut der Wirtschaftspr\u00fcfer (IDW)). We draw attention to the fact that the assurance engagement was performed for the purposes of the Company\u00a0and the report is solely designed for informing the Company about the findings of the assurance engagement.\u00a0Therefore, it may not be suitable for another than the aforementioned purpose. Hence, this report should not be used by third parties as a basis for any (asset) decision. We are solely liable to the Company. However, we do not accept or assume liability to third parties. Our conclusion was not modified in this respect.

These statements are based on assumptions and estimates and may entail known\u00a0and unknown risks and uncertainties.

Advisor Vijay Kumar Thallam elaborated the approach in an e-mail interview with Sabine Balk and Hans Dembowski.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why is organic farming so important for India and other developing countries?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our planet is facing dramatic environmental change. We are now living in the sixth mass extinction, and it is a result of human activity. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that we must urgently change land-management patterns internationally (see Katja Dombrowski in Monitor section of D+C/E+Z e-paper 2019/09). Otherwise, average temperatures will rise more than 1.5 degrees - with dire consequences. Smallholder farmers and their families as well as landless agriculture workers are the least responsible for the climate crisis, but they face the gravest consequences. Rainfall is becoming ever more erratic. Dry spells and drought are worsening. Ground water is being depleted. Unseasonal rains and heavy storms are causes of concern too. Crop failure is becoming ever more likely. All countries therefore need solutions that ensure land is not degraded, soils are not eroded and farmers do not become distressed. One option is Zero Budget Natural Farming (ZBNF), our form of organic farming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What exactly is ZBNF?</p><p>ZBNF promotes poly-cropping, the simultaneous cultivation of several useful plants. 'Zero budget' means that the costs for the main crop are recovered from the other crops. 'Zero budget' also means that this kind of 'natural farming' does not require expensive external inputs. All inputs needed are generated on the farm itself. Our regenerative agriculture with holistic land-management practices relies on the powers of nature. ZBNF was pioneered by Subhash Palekar, a charismatic rural farmers' leader who has been advocating this for more than 20 years. It also builds on the work of many other eminent persons. The four principles - or 'wheels' as we say - are:</p><p>Beejamrutham: microbial seed coating through cow urine and cow dung-based formulations.</p><p>Jeevamrutham: enhancing soil microbiome through application of an inoculum made from uncontaminated soil, cow dung, cow urine and other local ingredients.</p><p>Achhadana (mulching): keeping the ground covered by cover crops and crop residues all year.</p><p>Waaphasa: build-up of soil humus with enhanced soil porosity and soil aeration.</p><p>Pest management is important too, of course, and ZBNF uses natural resources such as cow dung, cow urine, botanical extracts et cetera. Moreover, inter-cropping and poly-cropping, including trees, also help to manage pests. We do not use synthetic chemicals at all.</p><p>But wouldn't high-tech high-yield approaches be more profitable?</p><p>Well, we must first define what that term means. Nature is actually a very sophisticated and highly productive system. The complex networks of microbial populations below the ground are drivers of plant growth. For instance, about 25,000 kilometres of fungal hyphae are estimated to exist in a mere cubic meter of healthy soil. The hyphae have an important role in the exchange of nutrients. If chemical fertilisers and pesticides are applied, these networks are destroyed. A real high-tech approach must therefore build on a proper understanding of nature. The farmers are experimenting all the time, their knowledge is evidence-based. Hence, I see respecting their knowledge as 'high tech'. The guiding question is not just how much we can grow in one season but how much longer can we have green growth in a year.</p><p>Is your method feasible on all farms?</p><p>In Andhra Pradesh, we work with all types of farms - subsistence farms, small holdings and large farms. However, most of the 572,000 farmers enrolled in our ZBNF programme are subsistence farmers or smallholders with less than 0.8 hectares. Only 11?% have more than 1.6 hectares.</p><p>Can ZBNF feed India or indeed the world?</p><p>Yes, it can. Our experience shows that ZBNF crop yields do not decline over time. Mulching with a 365-day green cover actually intensifies farming in a sustainable way. The point is to keep even rain-fed lands covered with live crops all year long. By contrast, the current industrial agriculture system has undermined food security, not least because nutrition values have dramatically declined.</p><p>Have scientists tested the validity of your approach?</p><p>Well, in my eyes, the farmers themselves are the greatest researchers. They see season for season what works and what does not. However, we have also cooperated with academic research institutes:</p><p>The Centre for Economic and Social Studies (CESS) in Hyderabad is conducting socio-economic impact assessments.</p><p>The Nairobi-based World Agroforestry Centre (ICRAF) is evaluating the impact of ZBNF on soil fertility, water-holding capacity, biodiversity et cetera. They are also evaluating performance and impacts.</p><p>Scientists from the University of Reading in the UK are studying the impacts of ZBNF on soils and crop growth.</p><p>The Bangalore-based think tank</p><p>C-STEP (Centre for the Study of Science, Technology and Policy) is assessing how ZBNF reduces water and energy consumption.</p><p>The Delhi-based think tank CEEW (Council on Energy, Environment and Water) is checking what ZBNF does in regard to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well as what this approach can contribute to reducing fertiliser-subsidy expenditure.</p><p>How do you reach out to new farmers?</p><p>To fully transition to ZBNF, a village needs support for up to seven years, and individual farmers require up to five years. To spread the information, we rely on community resource persons (CRPs). These men and women have made the transition, performed particularly well and have been trained to teach others. They typically coach other farmers in neighbouring villages, where, after two to three years, new pools of CRPs can be identified. This peer-to-peer approach is very effective. What also matters is that all field officers of the State Agriculture Department are trained in ZBNF and are held responsible for supporting the CRPs.</p><p>Why is the empowerment of rural women an important dimension of ZBNF?</p><p>Women do a large share of the farm work. They till the land, rear cattle and other ruminants. They contribute labour for all farm activities, including sowing, weeding, harvesting, watering et cetera. At the same time, they are agents of change. Teaching a woman is akin to teaching a family. Any farming discourse is incomplete unless men and women of the household are involved. Women's self-help groups, moreover, are very important for reaching out to new farms. In rural Andhra, some 7.5 million women are organised in about 730,000 self-help groups (SHGs). They can now mobilise many more people. This movement started two decades ago, basically as savings and credit groups. They are well networked and campaign for social change, health issues, livelihoods et cetera. The SHGs and their federations have become a transformative force. To a very large extent, ZBNF fits their goals, and accordingly, they have become important promotors of our approach. Many of our CRPs belong to this network. They understand the negative implications of chemical food for the health of their families and the adverse effect agrochemicals have on the soil.</p>", "publisher": "Development and Cooperation", "instances": ["What exactly is ZBNF?

Nur wenige Tage sp\u00e4ter \u00fcberraschte die Herzogin erneut, als sie beim Groundswell Regenerative Agriculture Festival ihren funkelnden Verlobungsring wieder zur Schau stellte. Ihren Ehering hingegen lie\u00df sie abermals zu Hause. Warum Sophie ihren Ehering aktuell nicht konstant tr\u00e4gt, ist bisher unklar.

W\u00e4hrend der Hitzewelle in Gro\u00dfbritannien k\u00f6nnte Sophie ihren Ehering vorsorglich weggelassen haben.

This site is the world's first to Extract, Concentrate, and Convert (EC\u00b2) lithium in a fully integrated, end-to-end process from oilfield produced water. This announcement builds on last year's launch of alkali's EC\u00b2 platform, which guarantees a minimum 95 % lithium recovery at customer sites-empowering producers to deliver battery-grade lithium carbonate faster, cheaper, and more sustainably.</p><p>Gradiant's alkali owns and operates the Pennsylvania facility-including equipment, land, water and mineral rights, and permits. This vertically integrated model secures long-term U.S. lithium supply while avoiding the permitting and ownership delays that often stall critical mineral projects.</p><p>Currently in testing, the system has already proven key benchmarks: 97 % lithium recovery from produced water and 99.5 % purity for battery-grade lithium carbonate. Full commercial operations are on track for early 2026.</p><p>In a major commercial achievement, alkali has signed a multi-year offtake agreement to supply up to 5,000 metric tonnes annually of battery-grade lithium carbonate to a U.S. lithium-ion battery manufacturer for electric vehicles (EVs) and energy storage systems (ESS). The deal affirms strong market demand and the commercial readiness of alkali's solution.</p><p>alkali offers multiple models for partners and customers:</p><p>Deploy the EC\u00b2 solution to lithium producers</p><p>Design, build and operate integrated systems for partners</p><p>Produce and sell lithium from alkali-owned assets</p><p>alkali's patented EC\u00b2 process combines Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE), concentration, and final conversion into a single streamlined system. Compared to conventional methods, EC\u00b2 offers:</p><p>Up to 50 % lower capital and operating costs</p><p>Modular, pre-engineered systems for rapid global deployment</p><p>AI-optimized performance for real-time control and predictive maintenance</p><p>Reduced environmental footprint and streamlined permitting</p><p>Feedwater flexibility - including geothermal brines, battery recycling, and produced water sources</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Air Liquide to Invest Up to 200 Million Dollars in USA</emphasis></p><p>July 7 - Air Liquide will invest up to 200 million dollars in Louisiana, U.S., to modernize and connect an Air Separation Unit (ASU) to its existing network. This investment also includes the expansion of its pipeline infrastructure by an additional 30 miles along the Gulf Coast. These enhancements supporting a long-term contract renewal with Dow will strengthen the Group's long-term relationship with them. Additionally, this reinforced network will position Air Liquide to support industrial growth in Louisiana.</p><p>In the context of a long-term renewal contract, Air Liquide will continue to supply oxygen and nitrogen to Dow's St. Charles Operations site located in Taft, Louisiana. Site enhancements and extension of its Mississippi River pipeline system will allow Air Liquide to provide more efficient gas production and delivery. The construction is expected to be completed in early 2027.</p><p>By expanding its robust industrial pipeline network throughout Texas and Louisiana, Air Liquide will also be able to further support its nitrogen and oxygen customers along the Mississippi River with increased flexibility and competitiveness. This strategic investment will strengthen Air Liquide's position in the U.S. Gulf Coast and enable future growth opportunities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Catl Breaks Ground on Battery Integration Project in Indonesia</emphasis></p><p>July 8 - Ningbo Contemporary Brunp Lygend Co. (CBL), a subsidiary of Guangdong Brunp Recycling Technology Co. (Brunp), in partnership with PT Aneka Tambang Tbk (Antam) and Indonesia Battery Corporation (IBC), recently broke ground on the Indonesia Battery Integration Project at the Karawang New Industry City (Knic) in Indonesia's West Java Province. Brunp is a subsidiary of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. (Catl).</p><p>Spanning over 2,000 hectares, the Indonesia Battery Integration Project, with a planned investment of nearly 6 billion dollars, covers the full battery value chain including nickel mining and processing, battery materials and battery recycling at the FHT Industrial Park of East Halmahera, North Maluku Province, and battery manufacturing in Knic and Artha Industrial Hill (AIH) of Karawang, West Java Province.</p><p>The battery plant in Karawang will deliver an annual capacity of 6.9 GWh in the first phase. By applying Catl's Lighthouse Factory and Extreme Manufacturing experience, the plant will ensure efficient production of high-quality battery cells and modules to accelerate e-mobility and energy transition efforts in Indonesia and the world.</p><p>The other key component of the project is the establishment of Indonesia's first renewable energy circular system, with nickel mining and processing, battery materials, and battery recycling operations deployed at the FHT Industrial Park. This landmark project will use state-of-the-art technologies and renewable energy to achieve ultra-low energy consumption, enabling improved cost efficiency, and high-value battery material regeneration with a metal recovery rate of over 95 %. Once fully operational, the facility is expected to produce 142,000 tons of nickel and 30,000 tons of cathode materials annually, along with the capacity to process around 20,000 tons of recycled batteries.</p><p>This project, the largest initiative of its kind in Southeast Asia, clearly demonstrates Indonesia's dedication to promoting sustainable energy, declared Prabowo Subianto, President of the Republic of Indonesia while attending the ground breaking ceremony in Karawang. He also expressed enthusiasm for partnering with global stakeholders to develop a green battery industry ecosystem.</p><p>By vertically integrating the entire battery value chain, the Indonesia Battery Integration Project sets a strong example of green, circular industrial development, establishing a new benchmark in international industry collaboration. It is expected to create 8,000 direct jobs and generate 35,000 indirect job opportunities by the time it reaches full capacity, and it will make significant contribution to Indonesia's 2060 carbon neutrality target.</p><p>The ground breaking marks a key milestone in advancing the Indonesia Battery Integration Project, which will further enhance Catl's global footprint, create resilience of raw materials supply, and promote global battery circularity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Secures Contract for Japan's Largest CO2 Capture Plant</emphasis></p><p>July 10 - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (MHI) has received an order from Hokkaido Electric Power Co.

This<br/>return to positive RIG came despite soft consumer demand in many markets,<br/>including consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical<br/>tensions, as well as actions taken to reduce customer inventory. Organic growth<br/>was 2.1% in the first half (H1) and 2.3% in the second half (H2), with RIG of<br/>0.1% in H1, improving to 1.4% in H2.<br/>Organic growth of 2.2% was impacted by a slowdown in category growth and our own<br/>below-market development. We have a clear focus on accelerating category growth<br/>and improving our market share performance in 2025 and over the medium term. An<br/>important part of how we deliver this is focusing our resource allocation behind<br/>our strongest growth drivers: scaling existing winning platforms and brands;<br/>accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets'; and building new growth<br/>engines that capture emerging consumer trends.<br/>On market share performance, in 2024 we gained or held share in approximately<br/>half of our business cells by number, but in less than half of our business<br/>cells by sales value. The majority of the Group's market share loss is driven by<br/>18 key underperforming business cells, which together account for approximately<br/>21% of Group sales. We are executing our action plans at pace for each cell and<br/>are seeing some early signs of improvement.<br/>A key element of improving our performance is strengthening our value<br/>propositions to consumers and customers. We are increasing investment to deliver<br/>superior product taste and quality, unbeatable value, unmissable visibility and<br/>compelling brand communication. Price competitiveness is a priority in the<br/>context of the high inflationary environment for certain commodities, most<br/>notably coffee and cocoa. We are taking an agile approach to passing on input<br/>cost increases, selectively investing in price as we focus on restoring<br/>competitiveness. To strengthen brand communication, we are stepping up<br/>investment and improving efficiency and effectiveness. Advertising and marketing<br/>spend as a percentage of sales fell from 9.0% in 2019 to a low of 6.6% in H2-<br/>2022; in 2024, this recovered to 8.1% and is planned to increase further to 9%<br/>by the end of 2025.<br/>Efficiency and productivity<br/>At our Capital Markets Day in November 2024, we announced a new three-year cost<br/>reduction program we have called Fuel for Growth, which is in addition to<br/>existing cost efficiency initiatives. We target CHF 2.5 billion run-rate cost<br/>savings from the new program by the end of 2027, and these savings will be used<br/>to fund increased investment in growth.<br/>The Fuel for Growth program is expected to drive in-year savings of CHF 0.7<br/>billion in 2025, CHF 1.4 billion in 2026 and CHF 2.3 billion in 2027. By the end<br/>of 2027, we expect to have reached the full run-rate savings of CHF 2.5 billion.<br/>In 2025, CHF 300 million of the savings impact this year only, with the further<br/>CHF 400 million being recurring savings that reduce the cost base on an ongoing<br/>basis. Over CHF 300 million of the expected CHF 0.7 billion cost savings for<br/>2025 have already been secured.<br/>Approximately three-quarters of the total savings in Fuel for Growth will come<br/>in procurement, with the remainder coming from operational efficiencies and<br/>commercial investments. Within procurement, the most significant savings will<br/>come from AI-powered procurement and supplier management, spend consolidation<br/>and aggregation, and e-sourcing expansion and automation. Within operational<br/>efficiencies and commercial investments, key initiatives include reviewing<br/>operating models as well as opportunities in manufacturing and logistics. The<br/>savings in procurement and commercial investments are expected to have limited<br/>costs to achieve; operational efficiencies will typically incur one-off costs of<br/>approximately 2 times the annual savings.<br/>These Fuel for Growth savings are in addition to over CHF 1 billion per annum of<br/>ongoing efficiencies from existing Nestl\u00e9 Continuous Excellence initiatives.<br/>Expected phasing of Fuel for Growth cost savings program:<br/>  In CHF billion                    2025   2026   2027<br/>  2025 non-recurring                0.3<br/>  2025 recurring savings            0.4    0.4    0.4<br/>  2026 recurring savings                   1.0    1.0<br/>  2027 recurring savings                          0.9<br/>  Total in-year savings             0.7    1.4    2.3<br/>  Run-rate savings at end of 2027                 2.5<br/>Strengthening foundations<br/>Nestl\u00e9's success depends on alignment and in-market execution, and people are<br/>critical to that. 2024 was an important year of change in our leadership. Our<br/>new leadership team moved quickly to align and refocus the organization. We have<br/>simplified the Group's structure and reorganized Nestl\u00e9 Waters and premium<br/>beverages into a global, standalone business. This is complemented by the<br/>introduction of a more aligned performance management framework - our<br/>'Operational Master Plan' - to increase Group-wide performance and drive pace of<br/>execution across the organization. We have also accelerated our digital<br/>transformation as we move to becoming a real-time, end-to-end connected<br/>enterprise, powered by data and artificial intelligence.<br/>Operating sustainably is an important foundation for Nestl\u00e9, and we made<br/>progress across multiple areas. In particular, we delivered our 2025 greenhouse<br/>gas emission reduction target one year ahead of plan and made strong progress<br/>with our regenerative agriculture agenda.<br/>Guidance<br/>Our 2025 guidance is in line with the outlook we provided at the Capital Markets<br/>Day, with accelerated delivery of cost efficiencies offsetting recent increases<br/>in key commodity prices, especially in coffee and cocoa. In 2025, organic sales<br/>growth is expected to improve compared to 2024, strengthening through the year<br/>as we continue to deliver on our growth plans. UTOP margin is expected to be at<br/>or above 16.0% as we invest for growth. Guidance assumes no significant change<br/>in key macroeconomic variables.<br/>Our objective remains to deliver superior, sustainable and profitable growth. In<br/>the medium term, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be at 4% plus in<br/>a normal operating environment, with an underlying operating profit margin at<br/>17.0% plus.<br/>Financial review<br/>Sales<br/>Total reported sales decreased by 1.8% to CHF 91.4 billion, including negative<br/>impacts of 3.7% from foreign exchange movements and 0.3% from net divestitures.<br/>Organic growth was 2.2%. Pricing was 1.5%, reflecting a reduction in inflation<br/>across most categories after two years of high input cost and price increases.<br/>RIG returned to positive growth at 0.8% and was still impacted by soft consumer<br/>demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands in<br/>certain markets. Additionally, actions taken to reduce customer inventory in the<br/>second half of the year reduced full-year RIG by approximately 20 basis points.<br/>By geography, organic growth was driven by emerging markets and Europe, which<br/>together more than offset a decrease in North America. In developed markets,<br/>organic growth was 1.2%, with positive pricing and RIG. In emerging markets,<br/>organic growth was 3.7%, led by pricing with positive RIG.<br/>Organic growth by product category was as follows:<br/>  * Coffee was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth,<br/>    supported by the three leading coffee brands: Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and<br/>    Starbucks.<br/>  * Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by KitKat and<br/>    key local brands.<br/>  * PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for<br/>    science-based premium brands Purina ProPlan, Purina ONE and Friskies.<br/>  * Nestl\u00e9 Health Science achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit<br/>    growth in the second half of the year.<br/>  * Water reported low single-digit growth, with solid growth for S.Pellegrino<br/>    and supported by the successful launch of Maison Perrier.<br/>  * Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, supported by<br/>    continued momentum for NAN and Lactogen.<br/>  * Dairy posted negative growth, as a decline in coffee creamers and ambient<br/>    dairy more than offset growth for affordable milks and dairy culinary<br/>    solutions.<br/>  * Culinary reported negative growth, with mid single-digit growth in Maggi<br/>    more than offset by a decline in frozen food in North America.<br/>By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 2.1%. Organic growth of out-of-<br/>home channels was 3.2%. E-commerce sales grew organically by 11.3%, reaching<br/>18.9% of total Group sales.<br/>Gross profit and operating profit<br/>Gross profit was flat at CHF 42.7 billion, and the gross profit margin increased<br/>by 80 bps to 46.7%. The gross profit margin reached 47.2% in H1, then declined<br/>90 bps sequentially to 46.3% in H2, driven by higher input costs in coffee and<br/>cocoa.<br/>Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at<br/>8.3%. Marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased<br/>by 90 bps to 19.8%. This comprised: advertising and marketing expenses as a<br/>percentage of sales up 40 bps to 8.1%, as we began to step up investment; and<br/>administration expenses as a percentage of sales up 50 bps to 11.7% of sales,<br/>largely reflecting higher labor costs, the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and<br/>one-off items. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales was flat<br/>versus the prior year at 1.8%.<br/>Underlying trading operating profit was CHF 15.7 billion, a decrease of 2.2% on<br/>a reported basis and an increase of 1.3% in constant currency. The underlying<br/>trading operating profit margin was 17.2%, a decrease of 10 bps on a reported<br/>basis and flat in constant currency.<br/>Restructuring and net other trading items was CHF 1.1 billion compared with CHF<br/>1.5 billion in the prior year, with the reduction mainly due to lower<br/>restructuring costs. Trading operating profit increased by 0.8% to CHF 14.6<br/>billion. The trading operating profit margin reached 16.0%, an increase of 40<br/>bps on a reported basis and 50 bps in constant currency.<br/> As % of sales                                               Constant currency<br/>                             2024    2023   Reported change       change<br/> Sales                      100.0%  100.0%         -<br/> Cost of goods sold         -53.3%  -54.1%      80 bps<br/> Gross profit margin         46.7%   45.9%      80 bps<br/> Other revenue               0.4%    0.4%        0 bps<br/> Distribution expenses      - 8.3%  - 8.3%       0 bps<br/> Marketing and<br/> administration expenses    - 19.8% - 18.9%    - 90 bps<br/> Research and development<br/> costs                      - 1.8%  - 1.8%       0 bps<br/> Underlying trading<br/> operating profit margin     17.2%   17.3%      -10 bps            0 bps<br/> Other trading income        0.1%    0.1%        0 bps<br/> Other trading expenses      -1.3%   -1.8%      50 bps<br/> Trading operating profit<br/> margin                      16.0%   15.6%      40 bps            50 bps<br/> Other operating income      0.5%    0.3%       20 bps<br/> Other operating expenses    -0.4%   -0.8%      40 bps<br/> Operating profit margin     16.1%   15.1%      100 bps<br/>Net financial expenses and income tax<br/>Net financial expenses increased to CHF 1.5 billion from CHF 1.4 billion,<br/>reflecting a higher level of average net debt and an increase in interest rates.<br/>The average cost of net debt was 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2023.<br/>The Group reported tax rate was 25.0%, compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The<br/>increase was mainly due to a write-off in deferred tax assets from changes in<br/>utilization projections and the absence of the favorable one-off items that<br/>positively impacted 2023. The underlying tax rate increased by 70 basis points<br/>to 21.9%, driven by higher corporate and withholding tax rates in some<br/>jurisdictions, as well as changes in the geographical and business mix of<br/>profits.<br/>Net profit and earnings per share<br/>Net profit decreased by 2.9% to CHF 10.9 billion. Basic earnings per share<br/>decreased by 1.0% to CHF 4.19, reflecting the movement in net profit and the<br/>impact of the share buyback program.<br/>Underlying net profit was CHF 12.4 billion, a decrease of 2.6%, and an increase<br/>of 0.6% in constant currency. Underlying earnings per share was CHF 4.77, a<br/>decrease of 0.8%, and an increase of 2.5% in constant currency. The share<br/>buyback program contributed 1.1% to the underlying earnings per share change,<br/>net of finance costs.<br/>Cash flow<br/>Cash generated from operations increased to CHF 19.6 billion from CHF 19.2<br/>billion in 2023. Free cash flow was CHF 10.7 billion compared to the prior year<br/>free cash flow of CHF 10.4 billion, which included CHF 0.6 billion proceeds from<br/>the disposal of a financial asset, with the increase primarily due to lower<br/>taxes paid and lower cash restructuring costs, as well as reduced capital<br/>expenditure.<br/>Dividend<br/>At the Annual General Meeting on April 16, 2025, the Board of Directors will<br/>propose a dividend of CHF 3.05 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. Nestl\u00e9 has<br/>maintained or increased the dividend in Swiss francs over the last 65 years. We<br/>remain committed to the long-held practice of increasing the dividend in Swiss<br/>francs every year.<br/>The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April<br/>17, 2025. The net dividend will be payable as from April 24, 2025. Shareholders<br/>entered in the share register with voting rights on April 9, 2025, at 12:00 noon<br/>(CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights.<br/>Share buyback program<br/>In 2024, the Group repurchased 48.2 million Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares for CHF 4.4<br/>billion under the CHF 20.0 billion share buyback program that began in January<br/>2022 and was completed as planned in December 2024. Under the program, 187.4<br/>million shares were repurchased in the three-year period, of which 143.9 million<br/>have so far been cancelled. At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board of<br/>Directors will propose the cancellation of the remaining 43.5 million<br/>repurchased shares, reducing the share capital of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. from CHF<br/>262,000,000 to CHF 257,652,000. We do not currently anticipate initiating a new<br/>share buyback program in 2025.<br/>Net debt<br/>Net debt was CHF 56.0 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared to CHF 49.6<br/>billion at December 31, 2023. The increase largely reflected cash outflows for<br/>the dividend payment of CHF 7.8 billion and share buybacks of CHF 4.5 billion as<br/>well as the impact of foreign exchange movements. The ratio of net debt to<br/>Adjusted EBITDA was 2.90 times at December 31, 2024, compared to 2.54 times at<br/>December 31, 2023. This is towards the top of our target range of 2 to 3 times<br/>for net debt to Adjusted EBITDA.<br/>Return on invested capital<br/>Return on invested capital was 14.1%, compared to 13.9% in 2023. This<br/>improvement reflects a lower base of average invested capital, mainly linked to<br/>working capital, and a reduction in restructuring costs.<br/>Minority participations<br/>In late 2024, we established Nestl\u00e9 Equity Holdings to consolidate ownership of<br/>many of our minority participations, enhancing governance and allowing for a<br/>more consistent and efficient approach to managing these interests.<br/>Operating segment review<br/>                     Zone                    Zone    Zone    Nestl\u00e9<br/>             Total   North   Zone    Zone    Latin  Greater  Health              Other<br/>             Group  America Europe    AOA   America  China  Science  Nespresso Businesses<br/> Sales FY-<br/> 2024 (CHF<br/> m)         91,354  25,336  18,910  16,793  11,933   4,973   6,739     6,378      292<br/> Sales FY-<br/> 2023 (CHF<br/> m)         92,998  25,995  19,098  17,519  12,196   5,037   6,498     6,372      283<br/> Real<br/> internal<br/> growth<br/> (RIG)       0.8%    -0.8%   0.8%    0.6%   - 0.3%   4.3%     5.5%     1.6%       5.3%<br/> Pricing     1.5%    0.4%    2.5%    2.8%    2.7%   - 2.1%    0.7%     0.6%       1.3%<br/> Organic<br/> growth      2.2%   - 0.5%   3.3%    3.4%    2.5%    2.1%     6.2%     2.2%       6.6%<br/> Net M&amp;A    - 0.3%  - 0.1%  - 1.9%   0.0%    0.4%    0.1%     0.2%     0.2%       0.0%<br/> Foreign<br/> exchange   - 3.7%  - 2.0%  - 2.5%  - 7.5%  - 4.9%  - 3.5%   - 2.8%   - 2.4%     - 2.7%<br/> Reported<br/> sales<br/> growth     - 1.8%  - 2.5%  - 1.0%  - 4.1%  - 2.2%  - 1.3%    3.7%     0.1%       3.9%<br/> UTOP FY-<br/> 2024 (CHF<br/> m)         15,704   5,640   3,192   3,916   2,429    803     943      1,278      - 13<br/> UTOP FY-<br/> 2023 (CHF<br/> m)         16,053   5,768   3,127   4,109   2,520    832     777      1,291      -12<br/> UTOP<br/> Margin FY-<br/> 2024        17.2%   22.3%   16.9%   23.3%   20.4%   16.1%   14.0%     20.0%     - 4.3%<br/> UTOP<br/> Margin FY-<br/> 2023        17.3%   22.2%   16.4%   23.5%   20.7%   16.5%   12.0%     20.3%     - 4.3%<br/> UTOP<br/> Margin YoY - 10bps + 10bps + 50bps - 20bps - 30bps - 40bps + 200bps  - 30bps     Flat<br/>Zone North America<br/>Our growth in North America in 2024 was disappointing. Organic sales growth of<br/>-0.5% reflects mixed delivery across the portfolio, in the context of a<br/>challenging consumer environment. We delivered RIG-led positive organic growth<br/>in approximately two-thirds of the business by sales. This was offset by weak<br/>performance in frozen food and coffee creamers. Turnaround plans are underway in<br/>both businesses. In Zone North America, UTOP margin increased modestly, which<br/>was the result of an improvement in gross profit margin and a step-up in growth<br/>investments.<br/>Segment performance summary<br/>  * Organic growth was -0.5%, with -0.8% RIG and 0.4% pricing. Pricing was<br/>    negative in H2, driven by competitive dynamics in PetCare and price<br/>    adjustments in frozen food and coffee creamers.<br/>  * Reported sales decreased by 2.5% to CHF 25.3 billion, including a -2.0%<br/>    impact from foreign exchange movements and -0.1% from net divestitures.<br/>  * Market share gains were achieved in coffee, while we lost market share in<br/>    frozen pizza and coffee creamers.<br/>  * UTOP margin increased by 10 bps to 22.3%. Gross profit margin expanded,<br/>    supported by pricing, price pack architecture and mix management, and<br/>    structural cost control was strong. Advertising and marketing investment was<br/>    increased significantly to support future growth.<br/>Key sales growth drivers by product category<br/>  * PetCare was the largest growth contributor, with low single-digit growth<br/>    driven by premium brands, particularly in the cat and therapeutic diets<br/>    segments.<br/>  * Confectionery grew at a double-digit pace, driven by Tollhouse baking<br/>    products and pricing actions particularly in the second half of the year.<br/>  * Beverages (including coffee and coffee creamers) delivered positive growth<br/>    overall, with new product launches supporting continued strong momentum for<br/>    Nescaf\u00e9 and Starbucks, offsetting a decrease in Coffee mate.<br/>  * Infant Nutrition saw a sales decrease, with a decline in Gerber in the<br/>    context of a category slowdown in baby food.<br/>  * Frozen food posted negative growth, primarily reflecting the impact of price<br/>    competition in pizza and the winding down of the frozen meals business in<br/>    Canada.<br/>Zone Europe<br/>In Zone Europe, our sales growth was broad-based, with improved market share<br/>trends in a number of categories. Growth was mainly pricing led, reflecting the<br/>inflationary environment for coffee and confectionery, supported by positive RIG<br/>in coffee and PetCare. Growth was impacted by temporary delistings in the third<br/>quarter, but recovered in the fourth quarter, driven by coffee and<br/>confectionery. UTOP margin increased, with improved gross profit margin and<br/>portfolio optimization helping fund the step-up in growth investment.<br/>Segment performance summary<br/>  * Organic growth was 3.3%, comprising 0.8% RIG and 2.5% pricing.<br/>  * Reported sales decreased by 1.0% to CHF 18.9 billion, including -2.5% impact<br/>    from foreign exchange movements and -1.9% from net divestitures.<br/>  * Market share gains were achieved in coffee and PetCare, with losses in<br/>    confectionery and water.<br/>  * UTOP margin increased by 50 basis points to 16.9%, driven by strong gross<br/>    profit margin improvement and supported by portfolio optimization.<br/>Key sales growth drivers by product category<br/>  * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\u00e9 soluble coffee and<br/>    Starbucks products.<br/>  * Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and<br/>    key local brands.<br/>  * PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, led by Purina ONE, Gourmet and<br/>    ProPlan.<br/>  * Nestl\u00e9 Professional achieved mid single-digit growth, driven by beverage<br/>    solutions.<br/>  * Water saw low single-digit growth, impacted by supply constraints in the<br/>    second half of the year.<br/>  * Infant Nutrition posted negative growth, reflecting a category slowdown.<br/>Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa<br/>We achieved solid organic sales growth in Zone AOA, with most categories and<br/>regions reporting positive RIG. We improved market share trends, particularly<br/>for key global brands like KitKat, reignited growth momentum in PetCare and<br/>significantly stepped up e-commerce growth. Several macroeconomic headwinds<br/>weighed on growth, with consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to<br/>geopolitical tensions persisting throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we<br/>took action to reduce customer inventories in our infant nutrition and dairy<br/>categories. For the year, UTOP margin declined, driven by increased investment<br/>in advertising and marketing.<br/>Segment performance summary<br/>  * Organic growth was 3.4%, with 0.6% RIG and 2.8% pricing.<br/>  * Reported sales decreased by 4.1% to CHF 16.8 billion, strongly impacted by<br/>    foreign exchange movements, which reduced sales by 7.5%.<br/>  * Key markets driving growth were Central and West Africa, the Middle East and<br/>    North Africa, and the Philippines.<br/>  * Key market share developments were gains in PetCare and losses in dairy and<br/>    culinary.<br/>  * UTOP margin decreased by 20 basis points to 23.3%, driven by increased<br/>    investment in advertising and marketing.<br/>Key sales growth drivers by product category<br/>  * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\u00e9 soluble and ready-<br/>    to-drink offerings.<br/>  * Culinary delivered high single-digit growth fueled by strong sales momentum<br/>    for Maggi.<br/>  * Nestl\u00e9 Professional achieved high single-digit growth, with strong<br/>    contributions from most geographies and categories.<br/>  * Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and<br/>    supported by new product launches.<br/>  * PetCare achieved high single-digit growth, led by key brands Felix and<br/>    Purina ONE.<br/>  * Infant Nutrition posted low single-digit growth following actions to reduce<br/>    customer inventories.<br/>  * Dairy saw a sales decline, impacted by the introduction of a sales tax in<br/>    Pakistan as well as actions to reduce customer inventories and reshape the<br/>    portfolio.<br/>Zone Latin America<br/>Sales growth in Zone Latin America was pricing-led growth, with RIG declining<br/>slightly. During the year, consumer demand softened and financial pressure on<br/>customers increased in several markets due to higher borrowing costs. These<br/>headwinds led to actions to reduce customer inventories, which weighed on RIG in<br/>Q3. Improved growth in Q4 was driven by confectionery and coffee, with new price<br/>increase measures being taken in both categories. UTOP margin for the year<br/>declined due to increased investments in growth as well as higher costs linked<br/>to the acquisition of the Grupo CRM confectionery business.<br/>Segment performance summary<br/>  * Organic growth was 2.5%, with -0.3% RIG and 2.7% pricing.<br/>  * Reported sales decreased by 2.2% to CHF 11.9 billion, with a negative impact<br/>    of 4.9% from foreign exchange movements.<br/>  * Key markets driving growth were Brazil and Mexico; weaker performance in<br/>    smaller markets such as Peru and Colombia.<br/>  * Market share developments included gains in portioned coffee and culinary,<br/>    with losses in dairy and soluble coffee.<br/>  * UTOP margin decreased by 30 basis points to 20.4%. The reduction follows<br/>    increased advertising and marketing investments.<br/>Key sales growth drivers by product category<br/>  * Confectionery delivered high single-digit growth, driven by key local<br/>    brands, particularly Garoto, and supported by new product launches in<br/>    chocobakery.<br/>  * Nestl\u00e9 Professional grew at a double-digit pace, underpinned by customer<br/>    acquisition.<br/>  * Coffee saw mid single-digit growth, led by Nescaf\u00e9, with strong growth for<br/>    Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto.<br/>  * Culinary reported low single-digit growth supported by strong sales momentum<br/>    for Maggi.<br/>  * PetCare posted flat growth, supported by Felix and Friskies.<br/>  * Infant Nutrition and dairy reported sales declines as robust demand for NAN<br/>    infant formula was more than offset by a sales decline in Nido.<br/>Zone Greater China<br/>In Zone Greater China, growth was underpinned by positive RIG delivery in every<br/>quarter despite soft consumer demand and intense price competition in several<br/>categories. This performance was achieved by driving faster innovation in key<br/>categories and adapting route-to-market and channel strategies to capture new<br/>growth opportunities. The decline in UTOP margin reflects increased commodity<br/>costs and higher growth investments.<br/>Segment performance summary<br/>  * Organic growth was 2.1%, with 4.3% RIG and -2.1% pricing.<br/>  * Reported sales decreased by 1.3% to CHF 5.0 billion, as foreign exchange<br/>    reduced sales by 3.5%.<br/>  * Market share developments included gains in Infant Nutrition and<br/>    confectionery, with losses in culinary and dairy.<br/>  * UTOP margin decreased by 40 basis points to 16.1%, reflecting higher input<br/>    costs and increased advertising and marketing investments.<br/>Key sales growth drivers by product category<br/>  * Infant Nutrition was the largest contributor to organic growth, with high<br/>    single-digit growth, driven by NAN and supported by improved sales momentum<br/>    for illuma.<br/>  * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by distribution expansion and<br/>    new innovations, particularly in Nescaf\u00e9 ready-to-drink offerings.<br/>  * Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, with solid growth for Hsu Fu<br/>    Chi and Shark Wafer, supported by new product launches and e-commerce<br/>    growth.<br/>  * Nestl\u00e9 Professional delivered low single-digit growth in challenging market<br/>    conditions, while culinary and dairy-related categories reported negative<br/>    growth.<br/>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science<br/>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science delivered a significant step-up in growth and margin in<br/>2024, with all segments contributing to the improved performance. Organic growth<br/>recovered through the year, with double-digit growth in the second half. A key<br/>driver of the improved performance was the resolution of supply constraints for<br/>our U.S. vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business. UTOP margin<br/>increased strongly, driven by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost<br/>efficiencies.<br/>Segment performance summary<br/>  * Organic growth was 6.2%, with 5.5% RIG and 0.7% pricing.<br/>  * Reported sales increased by 3.7% to CHF 6.7 billion, including a foreign<br/>    exchange impact reducing sales by -2.8%.<br/>  * Market share increased in Medical Nutrition and stabilized in VMS after<br/>    declining in the second half of 2023.<br/>  * UTOP margin improved by 200 basis points to 14.0%. The increase was driven<br/>    by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies.<br/>Key sales growth drivers<br/>  * By geography, North America posted mid single-digit growth, Europe delivered<br/>    double-digit growth and other regions combined saw positive growth.<br/>  * VMS achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second<br/>    half and an improvement in market share trends.<br/>  * Active Nutrition posted mid single-digit growth, supported by strong<br/>    momentum for Orgain, Vital Proteins and healthy aging products.<br/>  * Medical Nutrition delivered double-digit growth, with continued market share<br/>    gains. Growth was driven by strong sales momentum for adult medical care<br/>    products, particularly Peptamen and Resource, as well as Vitaflo. Sales for<br/>    gastrointestinal products continued to grow at a double-digit rate.<br/>Nespresso<br/>Nespresso delivered solid RIG-led growth, driven by the continued rollout of<br/>Vertuo, particularly in the U.S. and continued good growth in out-of-home<br/>channels. Q4 saw the highest quarterly growth of the year, supported by strong<br/>seasonal campaigns and the impact of pricing actions.

Sales for the third<br/>   quarter 2024 were $6.8 billion, flat compared to the prior year<br/>   period (up 4 percent at CER). In Q3 2024, EBITDA more than<br/>   doubled to $0.7 billion (159% at CER), compared to a lower<br/>   baseline in Q3 2023.</p><p><br/>   Sales for the first nine months of 2024 were $21.4 billion, down<br/>   $3.0 billion or 12 percent year-on-year, compared to a strong<br/>   first nine months in 2023. Sales were down 9 percent at constant<br/>   exchange rates (CER).</p><p><br/>   EBITDA for the first nine months of the year was $2.7 billion, 23<br/>   percent lower (-12% at CER) year-on-year. The Group's EBITDA<br/>   margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 12.9 percent, down<br/>   1.7 percentage points compared to 14.6 percent in the same period<br/>   last year.</p><p><br/>   Adverse weather conditions across key markets affected<br/>   applications of crop protection products. Sustained price<br/>   pressure, particularly in the commoditized segments of the crop<br/>   protection portfolio (and notably in Latin America), and reduced<br/>   grower profitability had an impact on demand. Crop commodity<br/>   prices have continued to decline, reducing farmer income and<br/>   hampering demand for input materials.</p><p><br/>   The crop protection market is showing initial signs of recovery<br/>   with channel inventories now closer to normal levels. Syngenta<br/>   Group expects the market to further recover after the first half<br/>   of 2025 with a market also less impacted by lower crop prices and<br/>   overcapacity.</p><p><br/>   Syngenta Group has continued to implement further initiatives to<br/>   drive profitability improvements, streamlining operations and<br/>   improving cash flow, including optimizing working capital.</p><p><br/>   Q3 2024</p><p><br/>   Q3 2024</p><p>Q3 2023</p><p>Change</p><p>Change (CER)</p><p><br/>   $bn</p><p>$bn</p><p>%</p><p>%</p><p>Sales</p><p>6.8</p><p>6.8</p><p>0</p><p>4</p><p>EBITDA</p><p>0.7</p><p>0.3</p><p>112</p><p>159</p><p>9M 2024</p><p>9M 2024</p><p>9M 2023</p><p>Change</p><p>Change (CER)</p><p><br/>   $bn</p><p>$bn</p><p>%</p><p>%</p><p>Sales</p><p>21.4</p><p>24.3</p><p>-12</p><p>-9</p><p>EBITDA</p><p>2.7</p><p>3.5</p><p>-23</p><p>-12</p><p>Syngenta Crop Protection Q3 sales of $3.3bn were down by 3<br/>   percent, driven by adverse currency effects in Brazil offsetting<br/>   underlying volume growth as the market begins to stabilize.

Sales growth was boosted<br/>   by the market introduction of new seeds varieties and a strong<br/>   growth momentum for biologicals.

We are thrilled to welcome Agribios to the Yara family,\" said M\u00f3nica Andr\u00e9sEnr\u00edquez, Executive Vice-President for Europe at Yara. \"Soil health is thefoundation for resilient crop production and sustainable farming. Thisacquisition reflects our commitment to preserve and further improve soil health,helping grow a nature-positive food future.", "Thisacquisition reflects our commitment to preserve and further improve soil health,helping grow a nature-positive food future. By expanding our existing cropnutrition portfolio in Italy, we can continue to support farmers in making everynutrient count. Balanced crop nutrition, together with good agricultural practices and digitaltools, is crucial for the regeneration of our soils. An analysis of more than ahundred long-term fertilizer trials shows that fertilized land has a higher soilorganic matter content than unfertilized land. Using organic sources ofnutrients, in addition to mineral sources, results in the highest content ofsoil organic matter. Therefore, this acquisition will enable Yara to maximizethe synergies between organic-based and mineral fertilizers, which is integralto our regenerative agriculture offering. Used in combination, organic andmineral nutrients enhance soil health, improve resource use, increase nutrientuse efficiency, and boost crops' resistance to climate change. We're excited to join forces with Yara,\" said Giovanni Ravagnan, CEO ofAgribios Italiana. \"This is a pivotal moment for Agribios as we bring ourexpertise in organic-based fertilizers to the European stage. We eagerlyanticipate embarking on this new adventure, marking the beginning of anotherphase of development in the year of our 50th anniversary.

In 2013,   Syngenta was one of the first companies in the industry to launch   a comprehensive sustainability plan. The \"Good Growth Plan\"   successfully served as the organization's sustainability compass. The new priorities place sustainability at the core of the   company's strategy and demonstrate continued commitment to   sustainable innovation. This approach and clear targets help   integrate sustainability on a strategic and operational level   whilst creating long-term value:* Priority 1: \"Higher yields, lower impact\" through the       acceleration of crop productivity in the agricultural sector,       while reducing the impact on the planet through more       sustainable technologies. * Priority 2: \"Regenerate soil and nature\" by enabling the       adoption of regenerative agriculture practices to help       farmers improve productivity, soil health, biodiversity and       climate. * Priority 3: \"Improve rural prosperity\" by focusing on the       prosperity of low-income and under-served farmers and their       access to inputs, knowledge, finance and markets. * Priority 4: \"Sustainable operations\" by the means of reducing       the environmental impact of Syngenta Group's own operations       and the supply chain; strengthening a diverse and inclusive       culture and ensuring the health and safety of its employees. The new priorities leverage the power of innovation, guide   investments and collaboration as well as add a new level of   transparency through a Portfolio Sustainability Framework (PSF). To find out more about Syngenta Group's new sustainability   priorities, the specific targets and the PSF, please visit the   website Sustainability Priorities.

Following its recent<br/>   registration in Great Britain, farmers in more than 55 countries<br/>   globally are now able to access this powerful fungicide, with<br/>   strong sales across continents reflecting farmer demand for<br/>   effective control of a broad range of crop diseases. The company<br/>   is on track to achieve one billion US dollars in sales of<br/>   products containing ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology, marking the first time<br/>   its active ingredient achieves this milestone in only eight<br/>   years.</p><p>\"ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology is a game-changer for modern agriculture<br/>   and enables farmers to grow crops more sustainably,\" said Ioana<br/>   Tudor, Global Head of Marketing at Syngenta Crop Protection. \"It<br/>   represents a significant milestone in our efforts to secure high<br/>   yields with low impact to the planet and is exciting because of<br/>   its high levels of consistency and effectiveness. We're very<br/>   proud that our innovation is delivering such impact.\"</p><p>Worldwide, farmers lose an estimated 10-23 percent of their crops<br/>   to fungal diseases each year. An additional 10-20 percent is lost<br/>   post-harvest. In the top five most important calorie crops -<br/>   rice, wheat, corn, soybeans and potatoes - fungal infections have<br/>   been estimated to cause yield losses that could feed at least 600<br/>   million people every day for a year.</p><p>ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology offers a new solution that effectively<br/>   fights fusarium head blight in wheat, which produces mycotoxins<br/>   that contaminate harvests and threaten human and animal health.<br/>   In addition, it offers a step-change in performance against a<br/>   wide spectrum of other important diseases, such as septoria in<br/>   wheat and net blotch in barley. ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology is<br/>   registered in more than 100 crops including corn, soybean,<br/>   peanuts, vegetables, potatoes, grapes, tomatoes and fruit crops.</p><p>ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology embodies Syngenta's commitment to<br/>   sustainable innovation, core to its new Group-wide sustainability<br/>   priorities announced in April. The effectiveness and long-lasting<br/>   activity of thetechnology enable low use rates and potentially<br/>   fewer sprays especially in leaf spot diseases, while safeguarding<br/>   beneficial organisms. It is also an important tool for resistance<br/>   management. The technology works by inhibiting the activity of an<br/>   enzyme that is essential for fungal respiration, starving the<br/>   fungi from the energy they need to survive. It is designed to<br/>   adhere to the plant surface and to penetrate rapidly through the<br/>   leaf surface - creating a reservoir of active ingredient in the<br/>   waxy layer of the plant tissue that enables even distribution and<br/>   long-lasting protection as the plant grows.</p><p>The technology further highlights Syngenta's success with the<br/>   SDHI (Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) mode of action and the<br/>   company's ability to effectively design active ingredients that<br/>   address various farmer challenges. Following its first SDHI seed<br/>   treatment sedaxane, Syngenta launched its SDHI fungicide<br/>   isopyrazam which transformed farmers' ability to control sheath<br/>   blight in rice, and later SOLATENOL\u00ae technology to protect crops<br/>   against septoria and rusts. In Brazil, SOLATENOL\u00ae technology is<br/>   today regarded as crucial in farmers' fight against soybean pod<br/>   anomaly - a new fungal disease which spread within just three<br/>   years to 12 states across the country since it was first<br/>   identified.</p><p>Beyond innovation in research and development, Syngenta's success<br/>   is underpinned by its commitment to invest in cutting-edge<br/>   manufacturing operations. Strong global demand has fueled<br/>   investments aimed at increasing the efficiency of manufacturing<br/>   of ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology. These set the foundation for the<br/>   production of a growing portfolio of formulations containing<br/>   ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology that target specific grower needs in<br/>   different markets.</p><p>The latest Syngenta innovation in the SDHI family is TYMIRIUM\u00ae<br/>   technology, which was launched globally in 2022. In addition to<br/>   protecting crops against key fungal diseases, TYMIRIUM\u00ae<br/>   technology provides broad-spectrum protection against<br/>   plant-parasitic nematodes that reduce global crop yield by an<br/>   estimated 12 percent a year.</p><p>About Syngenta Group</p><p>Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural<br/>   technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.<br/>   With around 60,000 employees, operating in more than 100<br/>   countries, the company strives to transform agriculture with<br/>   science-driven, technological innovations to deliver high<br/>   productivity and high-quality food while fighting climate change<br/>   and restoring nature.

Syngenta is the only company within the<br/>   agricultural sector to be included in the latest EPA's National<br/>   Top 100 List of top users of green power from the Green Power<br/>   Partnership.</p><p><br/>   This recognition marks the latest milestone in the company's<br/>   actions to decarbonize its operations globally. Dr. Tom Gray,<br/>   Head of Active Ingredient Strategy and Operations at Syngenta<br/>   Group, said: \"We are proud to be recognized by the U.S.<br/>   Environmental Protection Agency for being a leader in the green<br/>   power market. The implementation of our global strategy for<br/>   sourcing renewable electricity is well underway, and we are<br/>   working hard to decarbonize further and improve the energy<br/>   efficiency of our operations. We are also collaborating closely<br/>   with our partners throughout our global supply chain to decrease<br/>   our entire carbon footprint.\"</p><p><br/>   The St. Gabriel production site is one of Syngenta's global<br/>   manufacturing centers of excellence equipped to handle highly<br/>   complex processes and meet the most stringent production and<br/>   quality standards. The site consumes more than 150 million kWh of<br/>   energy annually - equivalent to the annual electricity use of<br/>   14,000 homes in the country. Through the purchase of Renewable<br/>   Energy Certificates, Syngenta's site demonstrates that it sources<br/>   100 percent of its electrical energy from renewable sources such<br/>   as wind and solar - fully offsetting its electricity consumption<br/>   from fossil fuel-based sources.</p><p><br/>   Program Manager of EPA's Green Power PartnershipJames<br/>   Critchfield said: \"This list of the largest users of green power<br/>   across the nation is proof that good business practices can also<br/>   benefit the environment. EPA applauds the leading organizations<br/>   in the Green Power Partnership's Top Partner Rankings for their<br/>   notable commitment to expanding their use of green power and<br/>   protecting the environment.\"</p><p><br/>   Globally, Syngenta has also invested significantly at its other<br/>   production sites, as part of its published commitment to reduce<br/>   carbon emissions by 2030. In Switzerland, Syngenta's production<br/>   site in Monthey uses hydropower for a sizeable portion of the<br/>   site's electricity needs and generates the equivalent of half its<br/>   steam consumption by recovering heat from household waste<br/>   incineration. In 2023, Syngenta's Monthey site was awarded the<br/>   \"Go Carbon Free\" label by the Carbon Free Valais Foundation, in<br/>   recognition of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.</p><p><br/>   In Brazil, Syngenta's R&amp;D and manufacturing sites for its crop<br/>   protection and seeds businesses - also source 100 percent of<br/>   their electricity needs from renewable sources. This was achieved<br/>   alongside comprehensive efforts aimed at reducing water<br/>   consumption and waste generation, and at long-term net-zero<br/>   energy sourcing.</p><p><br/>   In China, the Kunshan manufacturing site emerged as Syngenta<br/>   Group China's first carbon-neutral facility after Beijing Green<br/>   Exchange, a platform for carbon emission trading in China,<br/>   awarded it in July for fully offsetting its carbon emissions<br/>   generated from its operations. The site is implementing<br/>   continuous improvements such as real-time monitoring of<br/>   electricity usage, alongside upgrading equipment to be more<br/>   energy efficient.</p><p><br/>   \"Syngenta is fully committed to a long-term journey to reduce<br/>   greenhouse gas emissions in the running of our operations,\" said<br/>   Gray. \"This is a key focus area for us, even as we drive<br/>   innovation to enable farmers to adapt to climate change and<br/>   increase the sustainability of agriculture.

These collaborations, which connect<br/>   expertise across industries and sectors, are aimed at making<br/>   possible novel solutions to agricultural challenges more quickly<br/>   and efficiently.</p><p>Two collaborations - with IBM Research and with US<br/>   biotech Maxygen - brought their respective pioneering approaches<br/>   in data-based predictions modelling, and in the directed<br/>   evolution of proteins more commonly leveraged in the<br/>   pharmaceutical industry, together with Syngenta's world-leading<br/>   agricultural research and proprietary data sets.</p><p>\"Helping growers sustainably feed a rapidly growing human<br/>   population requires a strong collaboration focus, not just across<br/>   agriculture but across industries,\" said Gusui Wu, Global Head of<br/>   Seeds Research. \"Collaboration is at the heart of how our<br/>   scientists approach innovation every day. It is embedded in our<br/>   scientific culture, and we are continually seeking out different<br/>   technologies, solutions, and partners to help us better serve<br/>   farmers.\"</p><p><br/>IBM Research and Syngenta accelerate optimization of chemical<br/>   compound synthesis with language models.</p><p>Syngenta Group, in collaboration with IBM Research, has enhanced<br/>   productivity in chemical synthesis using IBM-RXN - a software<br/>   developed to enable the use of language models for the synthesis<br/>   of new molecules and materials. IBM-RXN encodes, models, and<br/>   predicts chemical reactivity. By combining Syngenta's<br/>   world-leading chemistry research and proprietary data sets with<br/>IBM's world-class reactivity modelling capabilities and<br/>   leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), IBM's pioneering<br/>   modelling approach, enables the partners to deliver scalable,<br/>   accurate, and data-based predictions modelling. This enables<br/>   Syngenta to investigate multiple related compounds simultaneously<br/>   and prioritize routes that offer compounds with the most<br/>   desirable commercial attributes.</p><p>Syngenta is closing the data loop by connecting the IBM-RXN<br/>   platform to the synthesis platform. Reactivity predictions are<br/>   now an integral part of the design of synthetic procedures. The<br/>   models' outcomes are fully integrated with synthesis planning and<br/>   execution, establishing a virtual loop where high-quality data<br/>   generate more relevant models that, in turn, inspire better<br/>   synthetic procedures. The digitalization of synthetic workflows<br/>   and the adoption of predictive reactivity modelling are<br/>   increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of the synthetic<br/>   process. Both teams worked on extending reactivity modelling to<br/>   include bio-catalyzed reactions and metabolic transformations, to<br/>   support the design of more sustainable synthetic procedures that<br/>   have a better safety and environmental footprint.</p><p>As the predictive power of reactivity models increases,<br/>   scientists may become increasingly confident in delegating part<br/>   of their work to AI-enabled automation. This should allow<br/>   shifting the focus to the synthesis strategy and overall chemical<br/>   design.</p><p><br/>   Syngenta collaborates with Maxygen to optimize molecular enabling<br/>   technology.</p><p>US biotech, Maxygen, which specializes in the directed evolution<br/>   of proteins, is collaborating with Syngenta Seeds to optimize its<br/>   enabling technologies.</p><p>Since the collaboration launched, one of the success factors has<br/>   been the consistent and robust level of scientific engagement on<br/>   both sides. Both Maxygen and Syngenta adopted an open collegiate<br/>   approach from the start, with Syngenta giving the collaboration a<br/>   high-priority status as part of its core portfolio, enabling the<br/>   project to progress swiftly.</p><p>The teams from Syngenta and Maxygen met frequently to review<br/>   results, manage decision-making, adjust plans, and mark progress<br/>   milestones.

ABOUT MOSA MEATMosa Meat is a global food technology company pioneering a cleaner, kinder wayof making real beef. Our founders introduced the world's first cultivated beefhamburger in 2013, by growing it directly from cow cells. Founded in 2016, MosaMeat is now scaling up production of the same beef that people love, but in away that is better for people, animals, and the planet. A diverse and growingteam of food-loving problem-solvers, we are united in our mission tofundamentally reshape the global food system."]}, {"relevance_score": 129, "title": "EQS-News: La Fran\u00e7aise: Systemisch orientiertes Investieren - die L\u00f6sung des Zauberw\u00fcrfels (deutsch)", "published": "2024-02-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">La Fran\u00e7aise: Systemisch orientiertes Investieren - die L\u00f6sung des Zauberw\u00fcrfels</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>EQS-News: La Fran\u00e7aise Group / Schlagwort(e): Nachhaltigkeit/Nachhaltigkeit<br/>La Fran\u00e7aise: Systemisch orientiertes Investieren - die L\u00f6sung des<br/>Zauberw\u00fcrfels</pre></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">06.02.2024 / 08:56 CET/CEST<br/>F\u00fcr den Inhalt der Mitteilung ist der Emittent / Herausgeber verantwortlich.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Systemisch orientiertes Investieren - die L\u00f6sung des Zauberw\u00fcrfels</p><p>von Deepshikha Singh, Deputy Head of La Fran\u00e7aise Sustainable Investment<br/>Research &amp; Head of Stewardship, La Fran\u00e7aise AM</p><p>Das Konzept der Polykrise [1], vom Weltwirtschaftsforum (WEF) in seinem<br/>Global Risks Report 2023 [2] propagiert, bezieht sich auf eine Situation, in<br/>der mehrere Krisen ineinandergreifen - ihre Ursachen und Prozesse sind<br/>untrennbar miteinander verbunden und f\u00fchren zu verst\u00e4rkten Auswirkungen.

Systembasiertes Investieren oder transformatives<br/>Investieren ist eine Art des Investierens, die sich theoretisch an einer<br/>systemischen Theorie des Wandels [8] orientiert und einen umfassenden<br/>systemischen Interventionsansatz verfolgt. Obwohl es noch keine konkrete<br/>Definition gibt, sollten transformative Investitionen im Rahmen des<br/>nachhaltigen Investierens darauf abzielen, den \u00dcbergang von einer Art des<br/>Handelns zu einer anderen systemisch zu unterst\u00fctzen.

Immer mehr Unternehmen und Investoren haben<br/>erkannt, dass ganzheitliche soziale und \u00f6kologische L\u00f6sungen die<br/>Gesellschaft einer stabilen Zukunft n\u00e4her bringen werden als die reine<br/>Optimierung der Kohlenstoffabscheidung. Die gesundheitlichen Auswirkungen<br/>des Klimawandels wurden in den Klimavorschl\u00e4gen von 91 % der Regierungen in<br/>ihren national festgelegten Beitr\u00e4gen (Nationally Determined Contributions,<br/>NDCs) [9] ber\u00fccksichtigt. Allerdings bleiben die meisten dieser<br/>gesundheitsf\u00f6rdernden Vorschl\u00e4ge ohne Finanzierung. Der Riesensprung in der<br/>generativen KI wird als ebenso transformativ betrachtet wie die Erfindung<br/>des Buchdrucks [10]. Aber die Industrie sah sich auch mit grundlegenden<br/>Fragen zu ihren potenziell negativen sozialen und \u00f6kologischen Auswirkungen<br/>konfrontiert [11].</p><p>Regenerative Landwirtschaft [12] wird gelegentlich als Komplettl\u00f6sung f\u00fcr<br/>die Bew\u00e4ltigung von Klima-, Nahrungsmittel- und Naturkrisen gesehen. Von<br/>Unternehmen gesponserte Programme zur regenerativen Landwirtschaft, bei<br/>denen Landwirte f\u00fcr die Anwendung nachhaltiger Verfahren bezahlt werden,<br/>kommen jedoch nicht immer den heimischen Gemeinschaften zugute. Die<br/>Programme finden meist innerhalb der eigenen Lieferkette des Unternehmens<br/>statt. In einigen F\u00e4llen wurde auch festgestellt, dass regenerative<br/>landwirtschaftliche Praktiken ungewollt zu einem R\u00fcckgang der Ernteertr\u00e4ge<br/>(und damit zu einer Gef\u00e4hrdung der Ern\u00e4hrungssicherheit) beitragen und sich<br/>negativ auf die biologische Vielfalt jenseits des landwirtschaftlichen<br/>Betriebs oder auf die Eind\u00e4mmung des Klimawandels auswirken. Es hat sich<br/>gezeigt, dass kontextbedingte Unterschiede wie Bodentyp und Topografie die<br/>Ergebnisse in verschiedenen Regionen entscheidend beeinflussen [13]. Die<br/>Unternehmen m\u00fcssen in Zusammenarbeit mit den Landwirten einen<br/>ergebnisorientierten Ansatz verfolgen, um die Wirksamkeit regenerativer<br/>landwirtschaftlicher Verfahren zu bestimmen, und Methoden anwenden, die f\u00fcr<br/>die lokalen Gegebenheiten geeignet sind, w\u00e4hrend sie gleichzeitig Probleme<br/>auf landschaftlicher und globaler Ebene in Angriff nehmen.</p><p>Vielfalt und Inklusion sind seit dem Tod von George Floyd im Jahr 2020<br/>zunehmend wichtige Themen. Im Jahresverlauf 2023 r\u00fcckte die Rolle lokaler<br/>Gemeinschaften und indigener Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppen bei der Bek\u00e4mpfung des<br/>Verlusts der Biodiversit\u00e4t [14] und der Umgestaltung sozio\u00f6konomischer<br/>Systeme [15] besonders in den Mittelpunkt. Die Gesellschaft kann sich auf<br/>indigene Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppen st\u00fctzen, wenn es um die Bew\u00e4ltigung von<br/>Systemkrisen auf lokaler Ebene geht, indem sie sich mit ihren eigenen<br/>Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Priorit\u00e4ten befasst [16] - und die Seiten des Zauberw\u00fcrfels<br/>isoliert l\u00f6st -, bevor oder sogar anstatt nach einer universellen L\u00f6sung zu<br/>suchen. Indigene V\u00f6lker sind Experten darin, mit Unsicherheit zu leben und<br/>das Beste daraus zu machen. Von ihnen kann die Gesellschaft lernen, wie man<br/>in einer zunehmend unsicheren Welt lebt.</p><p>Wichtig ist auch die Erkenntnis, dass man weder systematisch einer Krise den<br/>Vorrang vor einer anderen geben kann, noch davon ausgehen kann, dass alle<br/>die gleichen Priorit\u00e4ten haben. Politische Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger aus dem<br/>globalen Norden k\u00f6nnen ganz andere Krisen benennen als diejenigen aus dem<br/>globalen S\u00fcden, was sich auf die Ausarbeitung von Ma\u00dfnahmen auswirkt. Die<br/>Einheitsl\u00f6sung kann manchmal ungewollt von einer Krise zur n\u00e4chsten f\u00fchren.<br/>Untersuchungen [17] haben gezeigt, dass die Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Eind\u00e4mmung von<br/>Corona verheerende wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen auf die Armen weltweit<br/>hatten. Bei der Vorbereitung auf k\u00fcnftige Pandemien m\u00fcssen<br/>Infrastruktursysteme und politische Ma\u00dfnahmen sorgf\u00e4ltig an lokale und<br/>regionale Gegebenheiten angepasst werden.</p><p>Diese Erw\u00e4gungen k\u00f6nnen jedoch auch ein Eingreifen bei einer potenziell<br/>gef\u00e4hrlichen und sogar dringenden \"Einzelkrise\" verhindern und/oder<br/>verz\u00f6gern, indem beispielsweise nicht sofort gehandelt wird, weil man<br/>bef\u00fcrchtet, eine andere Krise zu verschlimmern. Man hat Angst, eine gel\u00f6ste<br/>Situation zu vermasseln. Dieses Szenario trat auf der k\u00fcrzlich<br/>abgeschlossenen COP28 ein. Der offizielle globale Konsens bef\u00fcrwortete eine<br/>Abkehr von fossilen Brennstoffen anstelle eines schrittweisen Ausstiegs,<br/>auch aus Sorge um die Energiesicherheit f\u00fcr die breite Masse. Es m\u00fcssen<br/>Kompromisse geschlossen werden, aber reicht die Zeit daf\u00fcr aus?!</p><p>Transformative oder systembasierte Investitionen sind eine noch unzureichend<br/>entwickelte Finanz- und Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie. Die Investmentbranche muss<br/>bei der Entwicklung des Konzepts, der Prozesse und der Infrastruktursysteme<br/>kreativ und innovativ sein, damit sie einen systembasierten Ansatz verfolgen<br/>und tragf\u00e4hige Finanzierungsl\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Polykrise bieten kann.<br/>Innovative Finanzierungsmechanismen wie Debt-for-Nature-Swaps, naturbasierte<br/>L\u00f6sungen und Kreditverbesserungen waren ein wichtiger Bestandteil der<br/>Diskussionen auf der COP28, um die Mehrfachkrise von Natur, Klima und<br/>wirtschaftlichem Zusammenbruch in anf\u00e4lligen L\u00e4ndern/Gemeinden anzugehen.<br/>Laut Sustainable Fitch [18] wird erwartet, dass der Markt f\u00fcr nachhaltige<br/>Anleihen 2024 zunehmend soziale Zusatznutzen bei natur- oder klimabezogenen<br/>Emissionen verlangen wird. So k\u00f6nnte sich die Emission auf Bereiche<br/>konzentrieren, die einen Bezug zur Natur haben und in denen soziale<br/>Zusatznutzen spezifisch identifiziert werden, wie z. B.<br/>Ern\u00e4hrungssicherheit, oder Klimaprojekte, die auch Vorteile f\u00fcr die<br/>\u00f6ffentliche Gesundheit bringen.

In einigen F\u00e4llen wurde auch festgestellt, dass regenerative landwirtschaftliche Praktiken ungewollt zu einem R\u00fcckgang der Ernteertr\u00e4ge (und damit zu einer Gef\u00e4hrdung der Ern\u00e4hrungssicherheit) beitragen und sich negativ auf die biologische Vielfalt jenseits des landwirtschaftlichen Betriebs oder auf die Eind\u00e4mmung des Klimawandels auswirken. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass kontextbedingte Unterschiede wie Bodentyp und Topografie die Ergebnisse in verschiedenen Regionen entscheidend beeinflussen.\u00a0 Die Unternehmen m\u00fcssen in Zusammenarbeit mit den Landwirten einen ergebnisorientierten Ansatz verfolgen, um die Wirksamkeit regenerativer landwirtschaftlicher Verfahren zu bestimmen, und Methoden anwenden, die f\u00fcr die lokalen Gegebenheiten geeignet sind, w\u00e4hrend sie gleichzeitig Probleme auf landschaftlicher und globaler Ebene in Angriff nehmen. Vielfalt und Inklusion sind seit dem Tod von George Floyd im Jahr 2020 zunehmend wichtige Themen. Im Jahresverlauf 2023 r\u00fcckte die Rolle lokaler Gemeinschaften und indigener Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppen bei der Bek\u00e4mpfung des Verlusts der Biodiversit\u00e4t und der Umgestaltung sozio\u00f6konomischer Systeme besonders in den Mittelpunkt. Die Gesellschaft kann sich auf indigene Bev\u00f6lkerungsgruppen st\u00fctzen, wenn es um die Bew\u00e4ltigung von Systemkrisen auf lokaler Ebene geht, indem sie sich mit ihren eigenen Bed\u00fcrfnissen und Priorit\u00e4ten befasst ? und die Seiten des Zauberw\u00fcrfels isoliert l\u00f6st ?, bevor oder sogar anstatt nach einer universellen L\u00f6sung zu suchen. Indigene V\u00f6lker sind Experten darin, mit Unsicherheit zu leben und das Beste daraus zu machen. Von ihnen kann die Gesellschaft lernen, wie man in einer zunehmend unsicheren Welt lebt. Wichtig ist auch die Erkenntnis, dass man weder systematisch einer Krise den Vorrang vor einer anderen geben kann, noch davon ausgehen kann, dass alle die gleichen Priorit\u00e4ten haben. Politische Entscheidungstr\u00e4ger aus dem globalen Norden k\u00f6nnen ganz andere Krisen benennen als diejenigen aus dem globalen S\u00fcden, was sich auf die Ausarbeitung von Ma\u00dfnahmen auswirkt. Die Einheitsl\u00f6sung kann manchmal ungewollt von einer Krise zur n\u00e4chsten f\u00fchren. Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass die Ma\u00dfnahmen zur Eind\u00e4mmung von Corona verheerende wirtschaftliche Auswirkungen auf die Armen weltweit hatten. Bei der Vorbereitung auf k\u00fcnftige Pandemien m\u00fcssen Infrastruktursysteme und politische Ma\u00dfnahmen sorgf\u00e4ltig an lokale und regionale Gegebenheiten angepasst werden. Diese Erw\u00e4gungen k\u00f6nnen jedoch auch ein Eingreifen bei einer potenziell gef\u00e4hrlichen und sogar dringenden ?Einzelkrise? verhindern und/oder verz\u00f6gern, indem beispielsweise nicht sofort gehandelt wird, weil man bef\u00fcrchtet, eine andere Krise zu verschlimmern. Man hat Angst, eine gel\u00f6ste Situation zu vermasseln. Dieses Szenario trat auf der k\u00fcrzlich abgeschlossenen COP28 ein. Der offizielle globale Konsens bef\u00fcrwortete eine Abkehr von fossilen Brennstoffen anstelle eines schrittweisen Ausstiegs, auch aus Sorge um die Energiesicherheit f\u00fcr die breite Masse. Es m\u00fcssen Kompromisse geschlossen werden, aber reicht die Zeit daf\u00fcr aus?! Transformative oder systembasierte Investitionen sind eine noch unzureichend entwickelte Finanz- und Nachhaltigkeitsstrategie. Die Investmentbranche muss bei der Entwicklung des Konzepts, der Prozesse und der Infrastruktursysteme kreativ und innovativ sein, damit sie einen systembasierten Ansatz verfolgen und tragf\u00e4hige Finanzierungsl\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr die Polykrise bieten kann. Innovative Finanzierungsmechanismen wie Debt-for-Nature-Swaps, naturbasierte L\u00f6sungen und Kreditverbesserungen waren ein wichtiger Bestandteil der Diskussionen auf der COP28, um die Mehrfachkrise von Natur, Klima und wirtschaftlichem Zusammenbruch in anf\u00e4lligen L\u00e4ndern/Gemeinden anzugehen. Laut Sustainable Fitch wird erwartet, dass der Markt f\u00fcr nachhaltige Anleihen 2024 zunehmend soziale Zusatznutzen bei natur- oder klimabezogenen Emissionen verlangen wird. So k\u00f6nnte sich die Emission auf Bereiche konzentrieren, die einen Bezug zur Natur haben und in denen soziale Zusatznutzen spezifisch identifiziert werden, wie z. B. Ern\u00e4hrungssicherheit, oder Klimaprojekte, die auch Vorteile f\u00fcr die \u00f6ffentliche Gesundheit bringen. Es bleibt zu hoffen, dass dieser Trend zur Regel und nicht zur Ausnahme wird.

Full year<br/>   EBITDA decreased 18 percent from the Group's all-time high in<br/>   2022 (-14% CER). Sales in 2023 were impacted by continued<br/>   industry-wide channel destocking in Crop Protection, with<br/>   distributors and retailers actively reducing inventories<br/>   previously accumulated in reaction to the supply chain<br/>   disturbances of the prior years, while under pressure to lower<br/>   working capital due to prolonged higher interest rates.</p><p>Fourth quarter sales were $7.9 billion, up 5 percent (+6% CER),<br/>   driven by Syngenta Crop Protection and by strong growth of<br/>   Syngenta Group China.

The<br/>   resulting contraction in demand led to global volume and price<br/>   reductions, particularly in Latin America and commoditised parts<br/>   of the portfolio. These factors weighed on the comparison with<br/>   2022, when Syngenta Group achieved record sales and profits.</p><p>Syngenta Crop Protection sales in FY 2023 experienced a modest 5<br/>   percent decrease in comparison to the previous year, totalling<br/>   $15.5 billion.

Our revenue<br/>is  increasing  at  constant  exchange  rates  and  our  profitability  is being<br/>maintained by the ongoing improvement in our competitiveness. At the end of this<br/>2023-2024 1(st) first  half year,  the group's  revenue growth and profitability<br/>are in line with targets communicated in October 2023.<br/>Our  mission is more  than ever aligned  with consumer expectations, which place<br/>plant-rich food at the heart of consumer trends. The turnaround in profitability<br/>is  an essential  catalyst in  our strategy  of positive impact with sustainable<br/>growth and in support of this mission.<br/>The  Bonduelle Group is committed to  sustainable and local agriculture based on<br/>the  principles  of  regenerative  agriculture  to  which 46% of our growers are<br/>already  committed. As a family business,  we have been working hand-in-hand for<br/>decades with our farming partners, with whom we've forged strong ties.<br/>Our  relationship is based on trust, exchange  of know-how and goes far beyond a<br/>contractual  relationship. These  ties are  a strength  in meeting  the sector's<br/>environmental  challenges,  while  offering  our  consumers  healthy and quality<br/>products.<br/>With the commitment and agility of all the group's employees, we will pursue our<br/>transformation  and efficiency efforts in the second  half year, to enable us to<br/>achieve the targets set for 2023-2024.<br/>                                    *******<br/>The  2023-2024 half  year  financial  statements  were  approved  by the General<br/>Partner,  then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of February 29, 2024 and by the<br/>Statutory Auditors.<br/>Key figures<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>|                          | 1(st) half year | 1(st) half year |            |<br/>|  (in millions of euros)  |    2023-2024    |    2022-2023    | Variations |<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>| Revenue                  |     1,213.1     |     1,243.4     |   -2.4%    |<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>| Current operating income |      38.5       |      43.1       |   -10.7%   |<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>| Current operating margin |      3.2%       |      3.5%       |  -29 bps   |<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>| Consolidated net income  |       4.5       |      20.0       |   -77.4%   |<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>| Gearing(()(2))           |      0.95       |      0.79       |            |<br/>+--------------------------+-----------------+-----------------+------------+<br/>Revenue<br/>The  Bonduelle  Group's  revenue  for  the  1(st) half of fiscal year 2023-2024<br/>amounted  1,213.1 million  euros  compared  with  1,243.4 million  euros for the<br/>1(st) half  of previous fiscal year, up  +4.5% on a like-for-like basis((1)) and<br/>down -2.4% on reported figures.<br/>Activity by Geographical Region<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|      Total      |              |              |              |               |<br/>|  consolidated   |              |              |              |               |<br/>|     revenue     |  1(st) half  |  1(st) half  |  Variation   |   Variation   |<br/>| (in millions of |     year     |     year     |   Reported   | Like-for-like |<br/>|     euros)      |  2023-2024   |  2022-2023   |   figures    |  basis((1))   |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Europe Zone      |    786.4     |    739.1     |     6.4%     |     5.9%      |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Non-Europe Zone  |    426.6     |    504.2     |    -15.4%    |     2.5%      |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Total            |   1,213.1    |   1,243.4    |    -2.4%     |     4.5%      |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>Activity by Operating Segments<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|      Total      |              |              |              |               |<br/>|  consolidated   |              |              |              |               |<br/>|     revenue     |  1(st) half  |  1(st) half  |  Variation   |   Variation   |<br/>| (in millions of |     year     |     year     |   Reported   | Like-for-like |<br/>|     euros)      |  2023-2024   |  2022-2023   |   figures    |  basis((1))   |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Canned           |    594.7     |    597.1     |    -0.4%     |     10.6%     |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Frozen           |    148.9     |    138.5     |     7.5%     |     9.3%      |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Fresh processed  |    469.5     |    507.7     |    -7.5%     |     -3.9%     |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>|Total            |   1,213.1    |   1,243.4    |    -2.4%     |     4.5%      |<br/>+-----------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+---------------+<br/>Europe Zone<br/>The  Europe Zone  representing 64.8% of  the business  activity over the period,<br/>posted  overall growth of +6.4% on reported figures and +5.9% on a like-for-like<br/>basis((1))  over the 1(st) half year, with  all technologies showing growth over<br/>the period.<br/>The  downturn in  volumes remains  limited in  the region  despite a significant<br/>weakness  in food consumption. In canned and frozen retail activity, the private<br/>label  category grew in both volume and value, while branded products (Bonduelle<br/>and Cassegrain) increased in value but fell back in volume.<br/>The food service activity continued to grow, in both volume and value.<br/>The  fresh processed segment (bagged salads) was virtually stable in volume, but<br/>grew  in  value  in  retail.  However,  the  situation varied from one region to<br/>another,  with France affected by  bad weather leading to  a lower service rate.<br/>Germany  is operating  in a  difficult market  context while  Italy is recording<br/>solid growth.<br/>Fresh  prepared  segment  posted  growth  over  the  period,  fuelled  by  range<br/>renovations.<br/>Non-Europe Zone<br/>The Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 35.2% of the business activity over the<br/>period,  posted an overall decline of -15.4%  on reported figures and +2.5% on a<br/>like-for-like basis((1)).<br/>The  activity was  clearly penalized  by the  translation effects of the Russian<br/>ruble,  which lost an average of 40% of  its value between the 1(st) half of the<br/>2023-2024 fiscal year and the same half of the previous fiscal year.<br/>In the Eurasia region, the canned activity remained sustained in terms of volume<br/>and  value,  for  both  branded  products  (which are largely predominant in the<br/>region)  and private label category. The frozen activity recovered significantly<br/>over  the last quarter and  now shows sustained growth  in volume and value over<br/>the period as a whole.<br/>In  North America,  the decline  in fresh  processed products (bagged salads and<br/>meal  solutions) remained more limited than in the same period last year, due to<br/>negative  market trends. In this context,  branded complete meal solutions based<br/>on salads as well as salad kits (salad bags with ingredients) posted significant<br/>market share gains.<br/>Operating Income<br/>The  Bonduelle Group's recurring operating  income for 2023-2024 1(st )half year<br/>stands  at 38.5 million euros at current exchange rate and at 50.5 million euros<br/>at  constant exchange rates  against 43.1 million euros  the previous year. This<br/>corresponds  to a  +17.1% increase in  current operating  income, i.e. a current<br/>operating  margin of 3.9% on  a like-for-like basis(()(1))  and 3.2% on reported<br/>figures.<br/>The  Europe Zone succeeded in maintaining an operating margin of 5.6% on a like-<br/>for-like  basis((1)), close to that of the 1(st )half year of the previous year,<br/>thanks  to price  upgrades and  productivity efforts  which helped  to partially<br/>absorb increases in production costs, in particular for agricultural materials.<br/>Profitability  of  the  Non-Europe  Zone,  although  still lower than Europe, is<br/>improving  under the effect of the industrial competitiveness measures initiated<br/>in  spring  2023 in  North  America  and  continued  buoyant activity in Eurasia<br/>despite a very unfavorable exchange rate equation.<br/>After  taking  into  account  non-recurring  items  of -5 million euros over the<br/>period,  mainly reflecting a  decision by the  French Competition Authority, the<br/>Bonduelle  Group  operating  income  stands  at  33.4 million  euros on reported<br/>figures, compared with 41.5 million euros for the same period last year.<br/>Net Result<br/>Financial  result came to -17.4 million euros, compared with -17.5 million euros<br/>at  the end of the  previous half year. Interest  expense for the half year rose<br/>from  -11.5 million euros to -15.6 million  euros, mainly due to the increase of<br/>interest  rates (partially  offset by  interest-rate hedges)  and an increase in<br/>indebtedness  linked  to  the  rise  in  inventories  both  in  volume and value<br/>(inflation). The group's average financing rate increased over the period.<br/>The foreign exchange result for the half year was balanced (-0.2 million euros),<br/>compared with a loss of -4.5 million euros for the same period last year.<br/>The  tax charge stands  at 12.5 million euros  against 13.1 million euros in the<br/>1(st) half  of previous fiscal  year, with the  effective tax rate (78.3%) still<br/>distorted  by  the  non-activation  of  losses  from  the  North  American fresh<br/>activities  on the one hand and the  non-deductibility of the penalty imposed by<br/>the French Competition Authority on the other.<br/>Result from associates amounts to 1.1 million euros, mainly corresponding to the<br/>group's  share in the net result of  Nortera Foods, which is accounted for under<br/>the equity method.<br/>After  taking into  account financial  result, tax  charge and  result of equity<br/>method,  the Bonduelle Group's consolidated  net result for 2023-2024 1(st) half<br/>year  amounted  to  4.5 million  euros,  compared  with  20.0 million  euros the<br/>previous fiscal year, representing 0.4% of revenue.<br/>Financial Situation<br/>Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16) stood on December 31, 2023 at 649 million<br/>euros  against 556.7 million euros  at December 31 of  the previous fiscal year.<br/>After  taking IFRS  16 into account,  debt stood  at 716.5 million euros (versus<br/>633.9 million  euros at December 31 of the  previous fiscal year), and the debt-<br/>to-equity ratio (gearing(()(2))) was 0.95, compared with 0.79 at the same period<br/>last year.<br/>The  rebuilding of inventories in terms of  volume, and their revaluation due to<br/>significant  increases  in  production  costs,  in  particular  agricultural raw<br/>materials,  explains the rise in  debt over the period,  it being specified that<br/>the  seasonal nature of the activity (summer agricultural harvests) results in a<br/>high  level of debt at December 31, which  is not representative of average debt<br/>or debt at the end of fiscal year.<br/>Other significant information<br/>Annual Shareholder's Meeting held on Dec 7, 2023<br/>The  Bonduelle Group's  Annual Shareholder's  Meeting held  on December 7, 2023<br/>approved  the  payment  of  a  dividend  of  0.25 euro per share, with effective<br/>payment  on January 4, 2024, as well  as the election of  R\u00e9mi Duriez to replace<br/>Matthieu Duriez, whose mandate expired at this meeting, and the reappointment of<br/>Jean-Michel Thierry as members of the Supervisory Board.<br/>Outlook<br/>Like  the whole food industry, the Bonduelle Group operates in a general context<br/>of declining consumption, weighing on sales volumes, and inflation in production<br/>costs, partly offset by limited price increases.<br/>Despite  this environment, given the performance recorded in the 1(st) half year<br/>and  all the commercial initiatives of  targeted activations and promotions, the<br/>continuous  improvement of our  industrial efficiency and  the strict control of<br/>our  overheads, the Bonduelle Group confirms its objectives of revenue growth of<br/>around  5% and an increase in current operating  income of around 15% on a like-<br/>for-like basis(()(1)), announced in October 2023.<br/>((1))  at constant currency exchange rate  and scope of consolidation basis.

Only a few restaurant chains in London are purely vegan. Some coastal restaurants have a vegan fish and chip option on the menu. It is out there but has only been adopted by a minority. Vegetarians and vegans are still leading the market. The problem is that consumers do not fully understand what plant-based alternatives are. They wonder whether it is safe and, for example, want to know how you can get white plant meat from green peas. The market makers in general need more information about the consumers' preferences - and they have to communicate better, and above all in a more targeted way, if they want to transform the market further. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> What is already known today? </p><p> One source of information is The Smart Protein Project. They found out that consumers are disappointed with the taste of plant-based products. This outweighs, for example, the fact that it is ultra-processed. We took the 2021 UK raw respondent data from the Project and applied some cool analytics. We got more insights and understand the UK market with more clarity now. I have already started sharing this information with the UK's major retailers and brands. This is important, as a great part of the communication is pushed by brands. </p><p> What about the UK food strategy? </p><p> The food strategy was an excellent piece of work. But it has not been fully adopted. One of the key messages was that meat consumption in the UK needs to decrease by 30 percent to meet planetary boundaries. There seems to be little or no implementation plan on the recommendations, yet the NGOs have done a fantastic job to help educate institutions on the benefits of including more plant-based dishes on menus. One reason for this is we have not yet come together as the plant-based sector, but there is a strong willingness to do so. I am excited to announce that early next year we will be launching a new initiative that will bring many plant-based businesses together to align on important topics and decide how we will advance the sector. </p><p> Has Brexit changed the plant-based market? </p><p> There have been lots of macroeconomic changes since Brexit. Retailers want to move towards more natural, locally sourced food and shorter supply chains. There is an emphasis on reducing the carbon footprint of food and the entire supply chain including transport and other targets such as sustainable packaging. There is quite a strong partnership with WWF in the UK - Tesco and Sainsbury's have implemented their protein transparency initiative, with Tesco going one step further to make this information public. What we are also observing is a shift towards increased consumption of convenience food. Our convenience food market is comparable with the US market. Plant-based can definitely use the trend towards convenience to its advantage. </p><p> In which sense? </p><p> Convenience foods can be more profitable than whole foods. Bottled water is a very good example. You can get it ,,for free\" from your tap, but you will pay two pounds for a bottle. Plant-based is traditionally perceived as quite puristic. It can take longer to cook a plant-based meal and sometimes it can be more complicated, with more ingredients. If businesses can figure out how to get more plant-based in convenience meals, this could be a great advantage for them. Another important change which could be advantageous is rising awareness about HFSS: products with high fat, sugar and salt content. Much plant-based food has less HFSS. </p><p> How important is retail for achieving sustainability goals and how open is it for plant-based products? </p><p>Tesco helped to pave the way in the early years from 2018 onwards. Today, retailers have a good amount of space dedicated to chilled plant-based alternatives. All of the big ones have launched a private label range as well. Everyone is doing it in a similar way. The opportunity we have right now is to focus on consumer demand: retailers will respond once demand grows. Through COVID we saw total grocery grow, including plant-based. We are seeing a YOY decline in plant-based meats but a more complete picture is that the market is resetting to 2021 figures. Retailers are nervous. They are less interested in plant-based meat and more in shifting the focus of vegetarian food towards products that suit regenerative agriculture. Plant-based in retail has come to a hiatus. Recent demand for plant-based food is met with the current offering and most people dropping out are omnivores, showing how important they are as a group. And the problem goes deeper: sometimes consumers cannot tell what products they have tried. They do not know where they encountered the category the first time and cannot remember a brand. There is just this general sense of apathy and very low brand awareness. </p><p> Which brands are currently dominating the UK market? </p><p> There are not many brands. Quorn and Linda McCartney's products have a good level of brand awareness. But they have been in the market for a long time and we would expect this. Pilgrims brand's Richmond Meat-Free has been hugely successful. When it comes to a meat-type business, Pilgrims is the best one to reference. And Richmond's products have become category leaders. Those are brands doing well in terms of execution and growth. Richmond has even set up a new division and factory for plant-based products. For most other brands, as good as they are, it is difficult here. One problem I heard about is that plant-based meats are perceived as too similar (!!) to meat, and people who want to have a veg option want something different. </p><p> Is there a need for a new product type in the UK? </p><p> Green is a prominent colour used in the plant-based category and we know this signals health and organic, too. For the next wave of consumers, this may not be the right colour to attract them. We know the new wave of consumers is less motivated by health. They want great taste, and the semiotics of the category may not appeal to them. We need to think about plant-based 2.0. We need to tweak the narrative. </p><p> It will be interesting to see if consumers in leading markets like Germany and the Netherlands can be reached more effectively with sustainability and health messaging than in the UK. Our data covers this and we will look to publish it in the new year. That is where the Smart Protein Project research becomes helpful. If we reanalyse some of the data, we will probably see that flexitarians, vegetarians and vegans are an early minority. Mass market beliefs, on the other hand, are probably going to be consistent amongst all countries. People's belief in the necessity of meat as part of a good meal, for example, is probably going to be quite consistent amongst European markets. If the brands want to be successful, they have to find the macro and micro trends in food culture within the relevant markets. </p><p> \"The opportunity we have right now is to focus on consumer demand: retailers will respond once demand grows.\" </p><p> \"Plant-based meats seem too similar to meat, and people who want to have a plant-based option, want something different.\" </p><h>Indy Kaur</h><p>Indy Kaur is the CEO and Founder of Plant Futures, UK's leading consultancy and insights partner for plant-based businesses and retailers.

Group sales for the first<br/>   nine months of 2023 were $24.3 billion, down 6 percent<br/>   year-on-year (-3% CER) and EBITDA was 22% lower (-20% CER) when<br/>   compared to an exceptionally strong 2022.</p><p><br/>   In the first nine months of 2023, the industry-wide channel<br/>   destocking continued as distributors and retailers further<br/>   reduced inventories they built up in response to the supply chain<br/>   disruptions of 2022. Overall farmer income and use of<br/>   agricultural products, solutions and services remain robust.<br/>   However, high working capital costs for customers due to<br/>   sustained higher interest rates prompted many channel partners<br/>   and farmers to order closer to application. These factors weighed<br/>   on the comparison with the same period last year, when the Group<br/>   achieved record sales and profits.</p><p><br/>   Sales of the Group for the third quarter were $6.8 billion, down<br/>   13 percent (-13% CER) and EBITDA was $0.3 billion, down 68<br/>   percent from prior year. The EBITDA was significantly impacted by<br/>   a softer market in Brazil versus a record high in 2022 and a<br/>   one-time seed inventory correction in Brazil, in addition to the<br/>   timing of a royalty receipt, which was advanced to Q2 as noted in<br/>   the H1 earnings release.</p><p><br/>   9M 2023</p><p>9M 2023</p><p>9M 2022</p><p>Change</p><p>Change (CER)</p><p><br/>   $bn</p><p>$bn</p><p>%</p><p>%</p><p>Sales</p><p>24.3</p><p>25.9</p><p>-6</p><p>-3</p><p>EBITDA</p><p>3.5</p><p>4.6</p><p>-22</p><p>-20</p><p>Q3 2023</p><p>Q3 2023</p><p>Q3 2022</p><p>Change</p><p>Change (CER)</p><p><br/>   $bn</p><p>$bn</p><p>%</p><p>%</p><p>Sales</p><p>6.8</p><p>7.9</p><p>-13</p><p>-13</p><p>EBITDA</p><p>0.3</p><p>1.0</p><p>-68</p><p>-76</p><p>Sales of Syngenta Crop Protection and ADAMA were lower compared<br/>   to the exceptionally strong first three quarters of the prior<br/>   year. Crop Protection in China continued to see strong growth in<br/>   the first nine months of 2023, with sales up 16 percent<br/>   year-on-year, benefiting from launch of new technologies.<br/>   Syngenta Group's biological solutions grew 14 percent in sales<br/>   compared to the first nine months of the previous year.</p><p><br/>   The Seeds business grew 3 percent to $3.3 billion sales in the<br/>   first nine of months of 2023. Year-on-year comparison of Q3 was<br/>   distorted by an earlier phasing of royalty income, realized in Q2<br/>   this year, while being recorded in Q3 last year. The Seeds<br/>   business in Latin America saw lower sales and profit due to a<br/>   one-time inventory adjustment.</p><p><br/>   Syngenta Group China grew by 9 percent in the first nine months<br/>   of 2023, with total sales of $7.7 billion.

North America sales were 23 percent lower; Asia Pacific<br/>   sales (excluding China) were 16 percent lower.

Es ging u. a. um Dekarbonisierung der Lieferketten und darum, wie man Transparenz sicherstellen kann.</p><p>Alessandro Piccinini, BEO von Nespresso Deutschland: \"Wir muessen Kaffee fuer die Zukunft retten! In der Transformation der Kaffeebranche sind wir fuehrend - doch wir schaffen es nur mit Teamwork. Wir brauchen starke Partner an unserer Seite, um unsere Nachhaltigkeitsziele zu erreichen und die Kaffeebranche entlang der gesamten Wertschoepfungskette umzugestalten. Den Weg dahin wollen wir transparent machen, unsere langjaehrige Erfahrung allen zur Verfuegung stellen, und weiter die notwendigen Innovationen vorantreiben. Dafuer brauchen wir auch den Input und die Unterstuetzung von aussen. Das Umfeld des GTF ist genau richtig, um in den Dialog zu gehen und den vermeintlichen Spagat zwischen Wirtschaft und Umweltschutz zu meistern. Unser Ziel: auch in Zukunft den Erhalt eines qualitativ hochwertigen Kaffees sicherzustellen - und zwar gemeinsam mit der Branche und zum Wohle aller in der Wertschoepfungskette.\"</p><p>Dr. Christoph Hempsch, Head of Sustainability DHL : \"Kaffee wird ueberall auf der Welt genossen, aber nur an vergleichsweise wenigen Orten dieser Welt angebaut. Nachhaltige Logistik kann daher einen direkten, positiven Beitrag zum Gesamtfussabdruck des Produktes leisten. In Deutschland investiert Nespresso zusammen mit DHL durch die Nutzung des Services GoGreen Plus ganz konkret in die Reduzierung von CO2-Emissionen auf dem Weg aus den Nespresso Lagern in die Privathaushalte. Beispielsweise werden Nespresso Pakete durch DHL-Fahrzeuge mit alternativen Kraftstoffen abgeholt, ueberregional vermehrt mit der Bahn transportiert und bereits jedes vierte Nespresso Paket mit Elektrofahrzeugen zugestellt.\"</p><p>Markus Mutz, CEO &amp; Co-Founder OpenSC: \"Transparenz ist der Schluessel! Nur, was man kontinuierlich 'sieht', kann man auch dauerhaft verbessern - insbesondere am Anfang der Lieferkette, d. h. vor Ort in den Anbaugebieten, wo der ueberwiegende Teil des Klima-Fussabdrucks von Kaffee entsteht und auch die meisten sozialen Probleme existieren. Und dabei reicht es eben nicht, sich nur auf traditionelle Methoden der Ueberpruefung zu verlassen. Wir muessen beginnen, wirklich flaechendeckend Technologie zu verwenden, um relevante und verlaessliche Daten so zeitnah und kontinuierlich zu erfassen, dass man auf deren Basis wirkliche Veraenderung jeden Tag steuern, vorantreiben und verifizieren kann.\"</p><p>Andrew Green, Executive Director B Lab Germany : \"Ich freue mich sehr, an der Podiumsdiskussion am Nespresso Stand beim GTF teilzunehmen. Es ist nicht nur meine erste Veranstaltung als neuer Geschaeftsfuehrer von B Lab Germany, sondern auch eine Gelegenheit, die Bedeutung von Interdependenz und Stakeholder Governance mit den Gaesten des Festivals zu teilen.

So tragen sie zur Verbesserung der Lebensgrundlage der Landwirt:innen bei.</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 unterstuetzt die Farmer:innen bei der Umstellung auf regenerative Kaffeeanbaumethoden mit Schulungen und technischer Hilfe. Die Marke stellt darueber hinaus ertragreiche Kaffeepflanzensetzlinge zur Verfuegung. Beispiele fuer regenerative Landwirtschaft sind:</p><p>- Das Pflanzen von Deckfruechten hilft, den Boden zu schuetzen. Es hilft auch, dem   Boden Biomasse hinzuzufuegen, was die organische Substanz des Bodens und damit   die Kohlenstoffbindung im Boden erhoehen kann. - Die Verwendung von organischen Duengemitteln traegt zur Bodenfruchtbarkeit bei,   die fuer eine gute Bodengesundheit unerlaesslich ist. - Die zunehmende Nutzung von Agroforstwirtschaft und der Anbau von   Zwischenfruechten traegt zur Erhaltung der biologischen Vielfalt bei. - Das Beschneiden vorhandener Kaffeebaeume oder das Ersetzen durch krankheits-   und klimaresistente Sorten wird dazu beitragen, Kaffeeplantagen zu verjuengen   und die Ertraege der Landwirt:innen zu steigern.</p><p>Anbaulaender im Fokus, die fuer 90 % des NESCAF\u00c9-Kaffees sorgen</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 wird mit Kaffeefarmer:innen zusammenarbeiten, um die Wirksamkeit mehrerer regenerativer landwirtschaftlicher Praktiken zu testen, zu lernen und zu bewerten. Der Fokus liegt auf sieben wichtige Herkunftslaender: Brasilien, Vietnam, Mexiko, Kolumbien, Elfenbeinkueste, Indonesien und Honduras. Aus diesen Laendern stammen 90 % des Kaffees fuer die Marke.</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 hat zum Ziel:</p><p>- Bis 2025 100 % des Kaffees aus verantwortungsvoller Herkunft zu (https://www.n   estle.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years-nescafe-pl   an-2021-en.pdf) beziehen. - Bis 2025 stammen 20 % und bis 2030 50 % des Kaffees aus regenerativen   landwirtschaftlichen Methoden.

Landwirt:innen sollten durch die Umstellung ihr Einkommen verbessern koennen. Das Unternehmen wird entsprechend Programme bereitstellen. In Mexiko, Indonesien und in der Elfenbeinkueste wird NESCAF\u00c9 ein Pilotprojekt zur finanziellen Unterstuetzung starten. Das Projekt wird den Farmer:innen dabei helfen, den Wandel zur regenerativen Landwirtschaft zu beschleunigen. Durch dieses Programm wird NESCAF\u00c9 zusammen mit Kaffeefarmer:innen den besten Ansatz in den einzelnen Laendern testen und lernen. Massnahmenbeispiele:</p><p>- Bedingte Bargeldanreize fuer die Einfuehrung regenerativer landwirtschaftlicher   Praktiken. - Schutz des Einkommens durch Wetterversicherung. - Mehr Zugang zu Krediten fuer Landwirt:innen.</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 wird die Fortschritte verfolgen und die Ergebnisse seiner Programme vor Ort mit Kaffeefarmer:innen bewerten. Rainforest Alliance unterstuetzt die Marke im Rahmen der Monitoring- und Evaluierungspartnerschaft dabei. Diese Aktivitaeten werden durch neue und auf Fachwissen fokussierte Partnerschaften ergaenzt. Ein Beispiel dafuer ist die Zusammenarbeit mit Sustainable Food Lab rund um die Themen Einkommensbewertung, Strategie und Fortschrittsverfolgung von Kaffeefarmer:innen.</p><p>Reduzierung der Treibhausgasemissionen durch Bindung und Speicherung von mehr Kohlenstoff im Boden</p><p>Regenerative Landwirtschaft traegt auch dazu bei, der Atmosphaere Kohlendioxid zu entziehen und die Treibhausgasemissionen zu reduzieren. Deshalb ist regenerative Landwirtschaft ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Klima-Aktionsplans von Nestl\u00e9.

New risks are arising while the global community deals<br/>with known challenges such as the pandemic, war in Ukraine, economic<br/>turbulence and failing trust in established social institutions. Swiss Re's<br/>SONAR report, now celebrating its 10th anniversary, scans the horizon for<br/>emerging risks for the insurance industry.</p><p>Patrick Raaflaub, Group Chief Risk Officer at Swiss Re, says: \"A global<br/>pandemic, geopolitical conflicts, surging inflation and an unstoppable<br/>climate crisis - these are just some of the many risks that SONAR has<br/>examined over the past decade that have ultimately materialised. However,<br/>researching new risks is not about forecasting. It is about raising<br/>awareness of risks that may impact society and preparing ourselves<br/>accordingly.\"</p><p>Crypto assets and quantum computing create new risks within the global<br/>financial system</p><p>In the current highly technology-dependent financial system,<br/>cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether have established themselves as<br/>potential challengers to conventional currencies. Alongside these new forms<br/>of currency, further crypto assets have emerged. Tokens, for example, allow<br/>people to buy digital representations of real assets such as art works or<br/>real estate. They can be traded and grant their owner access to assets,<br/>products or services. Nowadays, an art lover can buy a fraction of a<br/>Picasso. The fluid ownership, taxation, regulatory issues and other risks<br/>related to the new asset classes present insurers with fresh challenges. For<br/>instance, are certain crypto assets implicitly covered by existing property<br/>or cyber policies?</p><p>The security of the new digital financial economy is also facing new risks.<br/>With quantum computing, for example, a new generation of computers is on the<br/>verge of completing tasks far beyond the reach of current machines. These<br/>hyper-smart technologies offer significant benefits: sophisticated weather<br/>modelling, advanced medical research capabilities and financial analysis.<br/>With increasing maturity, they can also become a threat to existing<br/>IT-security protocols, potentially hacking standard encryption keys used in<br/>online communications and data transfer.</p><p>A new generation of emerging risks arising from climate change</p><p>Swiss Re identified the threat of climate change as far back as 1979. More<br/>than 40 years later, the consequences of climate risk are very much present<br/>in our everyday lives. Beyond what we already see, climate change creates a<br/>new generation of emerging risks. This year's SONAR report explores how the<br/>thawing of permafrost, which covers a quarter of the northern hemisphere,<br/>could not only damage infrastructure and accelerate climate hazards but also<br/>release disease-carrying pathogens that have been frozen for decades.</p><p>Agriculture is an activity that is especially susceptible to climate change<br/>- yet it is also an area that is struggling to reduce its contribution to<br/>global warming. Emissions from global food production account for about 31%<br/>of total man-made carbon emissions. The challenge for agriculture is to<br/>improve productivity and feed more people while cutting emissions at the<br/>same time.

A<br/>limited decline in volumes over the period is explained by the quotas applied to<br/>certain products following a deficit harvest.<br/>The frozen activity showed positive volume growth both in food service, which is<br/>continuing its post-covid recovery, and in retail (success of recent innovations<br/>launched, in particular under the Cassegrain brand).<br/>The ready-to-use fresh segment (salad bags and processed), where cost increases,<br/>and  therefore price increases, are  more limited, showed growth  in value and a<br/>stability  in volumes.  Supply difficulties  and less  dynamic markets in salads<br/>were offset over the period by a particularly dynamic summer season in processed<br/>segment.<br/>Non-Europe Zone<br/>The  Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 40.6% of  the business activity in the<br/>1(st) half year, posted +17.0% at current exchange rates and -3.4% on a like for<br/>like basis((2)).<br/>In  an uncertain  geopolitical context,  the Eurasia  zone posted higher revenue<br/>(canned  and  frozen),  linked  to  price  increases,  with volumes in this area<br/>slightly down on the previous year.<br/>In  North  America,  the  ready-to-use  fresh  segment declined over the period,<br/>impacted on the one hand by the loss of contracts in the 2(nd) half of financial<br/>year  2021-2022, by a salad segment that was itself in decline, and on the other<br/>hand  by  an  agronomic  crisis  affecting  salad  yields in the Salinas region,<br/>generating  a significant shortage of products and a rise in purchase prices. In<br/>this  context, the Bonduelle Group decided to  adapt its manufacturing set up on<br/>the  East  Coast  of  the  United  States  to the expected level of activity and<br/>refocused on profitable business segments (see below).<br/>Operating income<br/>The  Bonduelle Group's recurring  operating profitability for  the first half of<br/>2022-2023 stands  at EUR 43.1 million, up 56.1% on reported figures and 60.9% on a<br/>like for like basis((2)) with a particularly favorable seasonality effect in the<br/>first  half  year.  The  current  operating  margin  was at 3.5%, up 94 bps when<br/>compared  to the first half year of  last financial year on reported figures and<br/>130 bps on a like for like basis((2)).<br/>In  the Europe Zone,  price increases, mainly  in long life technologies (canned<br/>and  frozen), helped  offset inflation  and maintain  profitability in the first<br/>half  year. Thus,  the margin  operating income  increased to  EUR 42.5 million on<br/>reported  figures (EUR 36.3 million for the  same period last year) representing a<br/>current  operating margin of 5.7% on  reported figures (5.8% on  a like for like<br/>basis((2)), compared with 5.5% for the same period last year).<br/>In  the Non-Europe  zone, the  current operating  profitability stands at EUR 0.6<br/>million,  representing a  current operating  margin of  0.1% on reported figures<br/>(respectively  EUR 1.1 million and 0.3% on a like for like basis((2))) compared to<br/>EUR -8.7 million over the same period last financial year.<br/>The ongoing negative contribution of Bonduelle Fresh Americas (BFA), despite the<br/>first  effects of  implemented initiatives,  limited the region's profitability,<br/>which  was offset by the  results of the Eurasia  zone, with beneficial currency<br/>effects improving the competitiveness of Bonduelle EurAsia Markets (BEAM) in its<br/>segments.<br/>After  taking into  account non-recurring  expenses of  EUR 1.5 million  linked to<br/>costs  and fees related to the reorganization  of the Florence site (New Jersey,<br/>USA),  operating  profitability  stands  at  EUR  41.5 million on reported figures<br/>compared  to  EUR  24.6 million  at  the  end  of  the first half year of previous<br/>financial year.<br/>Net result<br/>The  net financial result stands at EUR  -17.5 million against EUR -8.7 million last<br/>financial  year.  Despite  a  positive  volume  effect  linked to the group debt<br/>reduction  following the partial  disposal of its  canned and frozen activity in<br/>North  America at the end of last  year, financial expenses increased due to the<br/>rapid rise of interest rates in the main currencies in which the Bonduelle Group<br/>refinances its activities, particularly outside the Eurozone.<br/>Moreover,  the  group  recorded  foreign  exchange  losses mainly related to the<br/>extreme  volatility of the Russian ruble (EUR  -4.5 million), whose impact is more<br/>than   offset   by   recorded   competitiveness   gains   in  current  operating<br/>profitability.<br/>The tax charge increase (EUR 13.1 million compared with EUR 4.6 million in the first<br/>half  of  previous  year)  is  due  to the non-capitalization of Bonduelle Fresh<br/>Americas' losses over the period.<br/>After  taking into account the financial result, the result of the equity method<br/>accounted companies (including this year 35% of the net result of Nortera Foods)<br/>and  the tax charge,  the net result  of the continuing  activities amounts to EUR<br/>14.4 million  i.e. 1.2% of the revenue, increasing to 35.3% compared to the same<br/>period last year.<br/>The  consolidated net result  amounted to EUR  20 million against EUR 24 million the<br/>previous  year. It includes the result  of discontinued operations, i.e. for the<br/>first  6 months of 2022-2023 financial year, a  favorable adjustment of the sale<br/>price  of 65% of the BALL business unit for  an amount of EUR 5.6 million and, for<br/>the previous period, i.e. the first half of 2021-2022, 100% of the net result of<br/>Nortera Foods representing EUR 13.3 million.<br/>Financial situation<br/>The  Bonduelle Group's net financial debt stood on December 31, 2022 at EUR 556.7<br/>million  against  EUR 909.9  million  over  the  same  period last financial year,<br/>excluding  the impact of the application of IFRS 16, i.e. a debt-to-equity ratio<br/>(gearing((1)))  of 68.1% (118.6% last  financial year). The  decrease in debt is<br/>explained  by the partial  disposal of the  long life activity  in North America<br/>(BALL)   in  June  2022, partly  offset  by  the  increase  in  working  capital<br/>requirements, which is itself linked to the increase in the value of inventories<br/>due  to inflation. Finally,  the average cost  of debt, excluding  IFRS 16, in a<br/>context  of significantly  higher interest  rates, stands  at 3.93%, up from the<br/>first half of the previous financial year (1.59%).<br/>Restated  from IFRS 16, the group's net financial debt stands at EUR 633.9 million<br/>and the gearing(()(1)) ratio at 79.0%.<br/>It should be noted that the seasonal nature of the business (summer agricultural<br/>crops)   results  in  a  high  level  of  debt  on  December  31, which  is  not<br/>representative  of the average level  of debt or the  one observed at the end of<br/>the financial year.<br/>Other significant information<br/>Adaptation of the American industrial set up<br/>In order to improve its competitiveness in the ready-to-use fresh produce market<br/>in  the United States  and to refocus  its activity on  its valued segments, the<br/>Bonduelle Group is adapting the industrial structure of its activity on the East<br/>Coast of the United States.<br/>Thus,  the manufacturing activities  in Florence (New  Jersey) will be merged in<br/>the  coming months with the Swedesboro site,  also in New Jersey. This operation<br/>aims  to optimize the production of all products for customers nationally, while<br/>achieving gains in efficiency and coverage of fixed costs.<br/>The current Florence site will be converted into a warehouse for the East Coast,<br/>maintaining  these jobs on the site  and all current Florence production workers<br/>will be offered a position in Swedesboro. The net impact of this reorganization,<br/>estimated  to date between EUR  6.0 million and EUR 8.0 million and  of which EUR 1.3<br/>million  has already been noted in the first  half year, will be recorded in the<br/>2022-2023 fiscal year under non-recurring items.<br/>Amendment of the green syndicated loan of EUR 400 million<br/>On  February  6, 2023, the  Bonduelle  Group  signed  an amendment to its EUR 400<br/>million  syndicated revolving credit  facility (RCF) with  its banking partners,<br/>thereby  securing an essential  source of financing,  which is particularly well<br/>suited  to  the  seasonal  nature  of  the  group's financing needs, and on very<br/>competitive  terms,  despite  the  current  unstable  economic environment.

Eben weil wir Primark sind, sind wir ueberzeugt, dass wir nachhaltigere Mode fuer alle erschwinglich machen koennen.\"</p><p>Primark wird seine 397 Filialen in 14 Laendern nutzen, um seine Kundinnen und Kunden mithilfe der Kampagne \"How Change Looks\" ueber die Veraenderungen zu informieren, die das Unternehmen vornimmt. Darueber hinaus wird es den Kunden leichter gemacht, selbst Dinge zu veraendern. Zu den Initiativen gehoert unter anderem die Aufklaerung der Verbraucher ueber Methoden zur Verlaengerung der Lebensdauer ihrer Garderobe, beispielsweise durch die Vermittlung von Naehkenntnissen oder durch Anleitungen zum Waschverfahren.</p><p>Das Unternehmen wird jaehrlich ueber seine Fortschritte bei der Umsetzung der globalen Primark Cares-Strategie berichten.

Foerderung der Chancengleichheit fuer Frauen.
