In this context, Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) emerge as a strategic, effective and sustainable approach to mitigate environmental impacts3, going from local to global interest, in addition to promoting the resilience of ecosystems/biomes and human societies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NbS consist of the intelligent and sustainable use of natural processes (understanding the functioning of ecosystems/biomes, as well as the supply of their goods and services) to face socio-environmental challenges, such as carbon sequestration, firefighting, flood control, food and water security, among others4. This approach involves issues of ecosystem restoration and conservation, sustainable management of biodiversity, and even the recovery of the knowledge of traditional communities (fishing communities, indigenous populations, among others) about the functioning of natural systems, offering multiple interconnected benefits.</p><p>In this context, an important contribution of NbS in the fight against climate change lies in its ability to promote simultaneous mitigation and adaptation5. For example, forests, mangroves, native pastures, and wetlands can act as important carbon sinks, capturing carbon and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere and storing them naturally in biomass and soil. At the same time, these ecosystems can act as natural barriers against extreme weather events, such as sea-level rise, floods, droughts, and landslides, functioning as true green infrastructures. Thus, investing in the restoration and conservation of these environments is a cost-effective strategy, promoting very efficient climate and social resilience; in addition, NbS can subsidize profitable economic activities based on sound ecological assumptions, such as in the case of \u201cconventional\u201d (for forests) and \u201cblue\u201d (for mangroves and other coastal ecosystems6,7) carbon credit activities.</p><p>The NbS are a powerful instrument to support the formulation of public policies, since they can promote concrete paths to align sustainable development and climate action8,9 with socio-environmental equity. Through policies that encourage payment for environmental services, regenerative agriculture, integrated water management and large-scale ecological restoration; It is important to mention that these actions can (and should) be incorporated into regulatory frameworks and territorial planning instruments, in a local, regional and global context.</p><p>The inclusion of NbS in national and international policies, such as the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) established in the Paris Agreement (2017), is key to achieving ambitious and sustainable climate goals10,11. In 2025, humanity will once again have the opportunity to put NbS at the center of the climate discussion at the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that will take place in November in the city of Bel\u00e9m (Brazil). COP30 is being called \"the COP of nature\", since, among the planned agenda points, one of the most important is the expectation that there will be the integration of the biodiversity agenda and the climate agenda, that is, to protect biodiversity as a way to increase climate resilience. And in this context, this collection brings important contributions to promote this ambitious agenda to be debated at COP30.</p><p>The articles published in this collection demonstrate the potential that NbS have for the integration of ecological, social and technological knowledge. Scientific research aimed at understanding the functioning of ecosystems and their services is essential for the effective implementation of these solutions. Climate modeling, biodiversity inventories, studies on ecological interactions, and ecosystem service assessments are fundamental tools that can help decision-makers around the world and at various levels (governments, civil society, and companies). In addition, the involvement of local communities and traditional knowledge strengthens the legitimacy and effectiveness of NbS, contributing to a more participatory and contextualized science; the following are some examples of research made available in our collection that readers from all over the world can have access to in an open way.</p><p>Carlson et al.12 warn that coral reefs provide important economic benefits to coastal companies around the world, supporting activities such as recreation and tourism, as well as providing protection to properties against storms. However, these benefits are at risk worldwide, as corals decline rapidly as a result of processes such as ocean acidification and rising water column temperatures, and there is a shortage of investment in restoration. Despite all the scientific knowledge about the ecosystem services provided by corals, it is not clear whether companies operating in the coastal zone perceive coral reef services as valuable or if they consider that they are also responsible for these very important ecosystems. Thus, the research presents an interesting methodological approach to estimate business perceptions about coral health and value and to identify characteristics correlated with business decisions to participate in coral restoration at differential pay levels.</p><p>Another interesting contribution is from Sunkur et al.13 who point out in their research, some of the main remote sensing techniques to promote monitoring of mangroves with the goal of their resilience to climate change. This contribution is important because mangroves are among the richest ecosystems in the world, providing valuable goods and services to millions of people while increasing the resilience of coastal communities against the impacts of climate change, especially island nations. The authors also warn that despite the available knowledge about the importance of mangroves, these ecosystems are severely affected by various anthropogenic activities, which increase their vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>Based on the premises presented in the paragraphs above, the editors and authors of this collection invite the scientific community in general, decision-makers, organized civil society, representatives of the private sector, students and others interested in the subject to honor the published research; not with the intention of \"exhausting the debate\", but rather, to further encourage discussions and the generation of new contributions on this very important theme for the twenty-first century.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The author would like to thank the institutional support of the Foundation for Research and Scientific and Technological Development of Maranh\u00e3o (FAPEMA) and the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel (CAPES).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].IPCC.

By doing so, it aims to deliver better value for money for customers, while also providing broader societal benefits, such as a more resilient and high-quality environment and biodiversity, and improving local areas so that they're nicer for people to live in. \u00a0</p><p>Lessons learnt by the project, and continuous engagement with relevant stakeholders, contributed towards an increase in sector-wide funding for nature-based solutions in our recent price review (PR24) for the next five years, increasing from \u00a32.2bn at draft to \u00a33.3bn at final determination.\u00a0</p><p>Another project, Seagrass Seeds for Recovery, was a collaboration between Affinity Water, Project Seagrass, Oxford University and others. It was awarded \u00a3250k as part of the Innovation in Water Challenge in 2021. It focused on developing knowledge and capacity for restoring seagrass meadows across the UK to enhance biodiversity, improve water quality, and strengthen coastal resilience.\u00a0</p><p>The project successfully established the UK's first inland seagrass nursery at a site in Wales. This facility now holds 1.3M seeds and over 6,000 mature seagrass plants, including the rare <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Zostera noltii</emphasis>\u00a0species. The nursery has become a vital resource for ongoing restoration efforts and has contributed valuable knowledge about planting techniques, which are now being used in other projects across the country.\u00a0</p><p>By exploring the carbon-capturing capabilities of seagrass, the project also contributed to the broader debate on blue carbon and its role in climate strategy. This paves the way for integrating such nature-based assets into formal carbon accounting and climate policy frameworks.\u00a0</p><p>Among the newest winners of the fifth Water Breakthrough Challenge are projects like SandSCAPE and the Rainwater Management Platform. SandSCAPE, led by Thames Water and several partners, received \u00a32M to test underwater robots that clean chemical-free sand filters without interrupting water treatment - a technological leap in sustainable filtration.\u00a0</p><p>The Rainwater Management Platform, led by Wessex Water and partners, also received \u00a32M to develop an open-access digital platform to guide the planning and implementation of sustainable drainage systems (SuDS), helping to reduce sewer overflows, manage rainfall more effectively, and promote water as a resource rather than a waste.\u00a0</p><p>We are at a pivotal moment. The water sector is now backed by a growing body of evidence that nature-based solutions are not just beneficial but essential to building a resilient, climate-adapted water system. The challenges ahead - whether ecological, infrastructural, or societal - require urgent, coordinated action. By working with nature, not against it, and leveraging innovation and collaboration, we can create a water system that is sustainable, resilient, and fit for the future.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>The post

This additional financing aims to improve access to climate-resilient infrastructure in the cities of Bangui and Berb\u00e9rati by financing Nature-based Solutions, including the regeneration of urban forests and the planting of avenues and public spaces.</p><p><br/><br/>With this funding, about 300,000 people in Bangui and Berberati--including vulnerable groups such as refugees, internally displaced persons, returnees, women, and youth--will benefit from improved living conditions with improved access to flood-safe and erosion-protected infrastructure.<br/><br/>\"The Central African Republic, which is ranked second in the world in terms of high vulnerability to climate change, is exposed to numerous natural disaster risks exacerbated by deforestation and climate change,\" said Guido Rurangwa, World Bank Country Manager for the Central African Republic. \"Nature-based solutions have great potential for the country. By combining these with grey infrastructure in Bangui and Berberati, they will increase rainwater retention capacity, reducing the risk of flooding and soil erosion. Their multi-purpose nature will also provide many livelihood opportunities ranging from forest products to fishing opportunities.\"<br/><br/>PROVIR is part of the World Bank's programmatic support to the urban development sector in the Central African Republic and adopts an integrated approach. It supports the World Bank Group's climate change and resilience agenda, including the Climate Change Action Plan (2021-2025), which aims to promote green, resilient, and inclusive development and competitive cities.<br/><br/>Project preparation benefited from technical assistance and grants from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), City Climate Finance Gap Fund (Gap Fund), and NBS Invest.<br/><br/>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The World Bank Group.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB5-C1W3-S4PK-12YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This additional financing aims to improve access to climate-resilient infrastructure in the cities of Bangui and Berb\u00e9rati by financing Nature-based Solutions, including the regeneration of urban forests and the planting of avenues and public spaces.</p><p><br/><br/>With this funding, about 300,000 people in Bangui and Berberati--including vulnerable groups such as refugees, internally displaced persons, returnees, women, and youth--will benefit from improved living conditions with improved access to flood-safe and erosion-protected infrastructure.<br/><br/>\"The Central African Republic, which is ranked second in the world in terms of high vulnerability to climate change, is exposed to numerous natural disaster risks exacerbated by deforestation and climate change,\" said Guido Rurangwa, World Bank Country Manager for the Central African Republic. \"Nature-based solutions have great potential for the country. By combining these with grey infrastructure in Bangui and Berberati, they will increase rainwater retention capacity, reducing the risk of flooding and soil erosion. Their multi-purpose nature will also provide many livelihood opportunities ranging from forest products to fishing opportunities.\"<br/><br/>PROVIR is part of the World Bank's programmatic support to the urban development sector in the Central African Republic and adopts an integrated approach. It supports the World Bank Group's climate change and resilience agenda, including the Climate Change Action Plan (2021-2025), which aims to promote green, resilient, and inclusive development and competitive cities.<br/><br/>Project preparation benefited from technical assistance and grants from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), City Climate Finance Gap Fund (Gap Fund), and NBS Invest.<br/><br/>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The World Bank Group.         </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB5-C1W3-S4PK-13F5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"388\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Yet, these trade-offs and justice implications remain entrenched in an anthropocentric orientation, which is problematic in ecological and ethical terms. We discuss four common assumptions on trade-offs in NBS (instrumentalism, neutrality of science, collaborative consensus, and unitemporality) and rethink them through a multispecies justice lens, maintaining that dealing with trade-offs is a form of interspecies politics.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Research on the co-benefits of Nature Based Solutions (NBS) (e.g., refs. 1,2) typically assesses how diverse ecosystem services (e.g., carbon sequestration, pollination, air and water purification) and wider elements of health and livelihood (such as risk reduction, equity, sustainability transformation) can be simultaneously served through NBS (see ref. 3). Besides the potential for synergies between diverse ecosystem services, however, assessments also reveal disservices (e.g. refs. 4,5) and a potential for conflict between and among ecologically and socially desirable outcomes6, 7, 8, 9\u201310. The consideration of potential trade-offs and their effects in practice reflects a recognition that multiple benefits can conflict with one another, and that choices are inherent in the design and functioning of NBS, with implications for their desirability and appropriateness. Yet, the justice implications of how trade-offs are discussed and settled remain largely overlooked8, despite justice having become a key concern in NBS applications11. Leaving justice considerations in the periphery can increase, entrench, and aggravate social-ecological inequalities and vulnerabilities, particularly for individuals and communities that are already at risk. If NBS are to be designed and implemented in just ways, trade-off thinking needs to make justice implications explicit.</p><p>At the same time that scholarship on trade-offs largely overlooks questions of justice, discussions on justice in NBS have traditionally proceeded from an anthropocentric viewpoint12, 13\u201314. The discussion of the distribution of benefits and burdens, the participation in decision-making, and the recognition of stakes typically proceeds from the perspective and interests of human individuals and communities. However, given that choices in the design and implementation of NBS can have repercussions ranging from positive to detrimental for many living beings (and their relations) beyond the human, a narrow focus on humans is problematic in both ecological and ethical terms15, 16\u201317. In ecological terms, a narrow focus on humans misses out on ecological relationships that are easily overlooked in an Anthropocentric frame and risks undermining ecological integrity. In ethical terms, failing to acknowledge the value (beyond human utility), capabilities, and needs of the wider living world is a moral mistake, undermining multispecies justice (MSJ). It is in this context of recognition and consideration that justice is reconceptualized, and the subject of justice expanded to include nonhuman living beings and the interlinkages between species through the notion of MSJ16. At its core, MSJ recognizes that nonhuman beings and ecosystems can be bearers of rights and deserving of equitable consideration in decision-making processes, and advocates ethical relationships with and responsibilities to these species and ecosystems18,19. It is therefore critical to consider MSJ as a process and practice of reflexivity, not only a set of outcomes to be examined13.</p><p>This article does some of this reflexive work. Taking MSJ as a starting point, in this article, we expand the notion of which actors are due consideration in thinking about synergies and trade-offs in NBS design and implementation. In particular, we rethink trade-offs in NBS, asking how the expansion of the notion of justice to a wider set of subjects changes the characteristics, conflicts, and concerns that we see in NBS trade-off assessments. We thus focus on trade-offs rather than co-benefits, acknowledging that MSJ can also bring synergies into view, but insisting on the crucial work of considering who \u201closes out\u201d in those cases that synergetic win\u2013win scenarios are not possible. We stress that, ultimately, the ethical crux of working with NBS lies in how trade-offs are considered and dealt with. We do the work of rethinking trade-offs by critically discussing four assumptions underlying trade-off thinking in NBS, either explicitly or implicitly: an assumption of instrumentality, one of neutrality of science, one of collaborative consensus, and one of unitemporality. Each of these assumptions is discussed by bringing NBS and MSJ literatures into conversation with each other, and illustrated through a case study of urban NBS. We propose alternative foci for NBS trade-off discussions informed by the MSJ lens, and conclude that trade-offs should be understood as an issue of inter- and intraspecies politics, where being explicit about the stakes and justice implications of NBS interventions from a more-than-human perspective is both ecologically and ethically necessary. MSJ does not endorse a simple solution to the management of complex trade-offs, but rather an alternative lens through which to identify challenges, as well as understand problems and conflicts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ecocentric politics and ethics: lessons about multispecies spaces for multispecies justice</emphasis></p><p>The human-centered approach to justice considerations in NBS has recently been challenged12,14. Central to this call to abandon anthropocentrism is the urge to consider benefits and harms related to NBS interventions from a multispecies perspective, including more-than-human beings and ecological communities' needs and interests. This expansive framing of multispecies benefits and harms is at the core of MSJ: an ethical and political project that argues for the moral consideration of nonhuman beings as bearers of justice16. MSJ is both an ethical and a political project because it fundamentally re-evaluates our moral obligations to the nonhuman world, and seeks to translate these obligations into concrete changes in our social, legal, and political structures. Ethically founded on the idea of intrinsic value, the understanding that \u201call living organisms have a good of their own\u201d20 and \u201cthat nonhuman beings are not simply of value as a means to an end\u201d21, the crux of this thinking is that beings have value independent of human interests. The ethical project of MSJ argues that intrinsic value warrants extending moral consideration, responsibility for, and respect to all living beings16,22. Politically, this framework necessitates a rethinking of justice itself, aiming to broaden its scope beyond humans to include diverse species and their relationships, ultimately advocating for new forms of governance, laws, and social practices that foster a more just and sustainable multispecies world23.</p><p>Fundamental to this ethico-political project is MSJ recognition of the agency and capabilities of living beings\u2014that is, their functionings and abilities to flourish, develop, and live a life worth living16,24, 25\u201326. For some scholars, this is justified through arguments of animal sentience25, whilst others argue for the integrity of life27, 28\u201329. These arguments underline the interdependence and interconnectedness between living beings (including humans) and ecosystems, and maintain that extending moral consideration to the more-than-human realm opens diverse ways to include multispecies needs and interests in decision-making processes. This can be expressed by being more attentive, responsive, and embracing of more-than-human beings and collectives, as well as ways of knowing and being. Going further, rights-based approaches call for deeper political and legal transformations that challenge colonial, destructive, and violent legacies and histories30. This can lead to rethinking political processes and institutions that support reparations and Indigenous self-determination. It is important to recognize that MSJ aligns with and builds on Indigenous and relational worldviews, and similar ethical frameworks like the ethics of care, that emphasize deep, reciprocal relationships between humans and the natural world, viewing land, waters, animals, and plants as kin or relatives. Ethics are rooted in responsibility, reciprocity, and interconnectedness, rather than individual rights or instrumental value. When encountering conflicts and trade-offs, these frameworks, like MSJ, seek solutions that maintain the health of relationships, often prioritizing long-term ecological balance and bio-cultural continuity over short-term human gain.</p><p>The extension of moral consideration, however, does not by itself provide a balanced and conflict-free situation. On the contrary, it highlights and obliges us to think about the many and complex effects of decisions, actions, and types of relations that unfold across human and more-than-human worlds, the stakes of these decisions, and the processes through which we organize them. MSJ does not offer a set of normative principles or a universalist approach that can be implemented in different contexts and settings. While this could be considered a shortcoming in the eyes of those thinking about applications of MSJ, what MSJ offers is a starting point to recognize conflict and trade-offs through place-based approaches. MSJ does not eliminate conflict; it provides a framework for acknowledging the full spectrum of beings involved, understanding their interconnectedness, and seeking solutions that do not simply prioritize human interests. Put differently, the extension of moral consideration begs the question of interspecies politics that is attentive to the relations and interactions between multiple species \u201cabout the conditions of shared life\u201d31.</p><p>Drawing attention to several ethical dilemmas, it requires us to ask: what are the obligations that MSJ imposes? For example, when can wild animals or introduced plants be treated as disruptive in urban settings and rendered removable or killable if they also deserve moral consideration? How do we recognize and deal with conflicts of interest between different more-than-human species32,33 or between more-than-human species and disadvantaged communities32,34,35? When do humans have an obligation of action, and when is human interference a problem? How should we tackle a lack of human willingness to coexist with other species, whether or not based on human supremacist thought? And how do we change the techniques, ideas, and terminology that constitute a logic of domination? In short, MSJ insists on attention to the intra- and interspecies politics and ethics of environmental beings and communities that seek an \u201cinclusive, relational ecological world as the shared community of justice\u201d.</p><p>At the same time that an MSJ approach underlines conflicts and trade-offs by centering more-than-human beings and communities, the approach is powerful because it does not exclude humans from consideration. Instead, by emphasizing interconnectedness and mutual dependence, MSJ draws attention to shared vulnerabilities and resilience. For example, authors writing from an MSJ perspective have addressed entrenched dehumanization while acknowledging the real, embodied hardship of social inequalities, multidimensional poverty, and pervasive injustices in all societies\u201916, and asked whether the institutionalization of rights to nature is a continuation of Western, colonial tools of oppression36. What MSJ offers is a radically different way to debate, think about, and transform socio-natural and political processes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Interrogating stubborn NBS trade-off assumptions</emphasis></p><p>For urban NBS, a crucial question that emerges from the moral consideration of more-than-human others is how the concept of MSJ governs decisions about what NBS should look like, what living beings should be helped in their survival through NBS, and how these decisions should be made. In this section, we turn to this question from the vantage point of trade-offs in the design, planning, implementation, and use phases of urban NBS. As situations where achieving one thing requires giving up another, trade-offs are where conflicts and priorities come into play, and where decision-making involves making choices between competing alternatives with consequences for who receive the benefits or carry the costs of NBS interventions. As such, trade-offs in NBS can be considered political8, but \u201callegories of good versus evil\u201d are unhelpful in understanding and dealing with trade-offs because they are often complex37. Yet, trade-offs are how competing visions of NBS are debated, and their settling is consequential in ecological, ethical, and political registers. Given this, below we interrogate four common assumptions in NBS trade-offs, informed by an MSJ perspective.</p><p>We examine four key stubborn assumptions on NBS design and implementation with respect to i) instrumentalism, ii) neutrality of science, iii) collaborative consensus, and iv) unitemporality. The assumption of instrumentalism regards the goals of NBS, which are typically defined from an anthropocentric viewpoint and treat ecological beings and processes as means towards ends. The assumption of neutrality of science concerns the knowledge base of NBS, which typically treats science as factual and outside of value judgment. The assumption of collaborative consensus regards the process of NBS, which prioritizes deliberative strategies that presume agreement can be achieved and conflict can be resolved. Finally, the assumption of unitemporality concerns the temporal scale of NBS, which remains entrenched in modern temporality. We identified these assumptions based on prior review work on trade-offs in NBS that highlights foci on ecosystem services, land-use conflict, governance values, and socio-ecological dynamics8. Based on this systematic review, we went through a brainstorm and grouping exercise, through which it became evident that these assumptions are among the most widely held assumptions in NBS policy and governance, and that these assumptions show to be problematic once we take MSJ as the central ambition in the application of NBS. The assumptions and the implications of their problematization through an MSJ lens are illustrated with short case study vignettes. These case studies represent different life forms (rivers, plants, birds, insects; all in relation to other species) and are taken from various regions (Central America, North America, Europe, and Oceania), to showcase how questioning these stubborn assumptions is of relevance in a variety of different settings.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Assumption of instrumentalism</emphasis></p><p>It is common practice in NBS planning to understand trade-offs by focusing on ecosystem services and disservices (ES(D)) and mapping how these interact or conflict, in theory (during the NBS design phase) and in practice (once NBS are implemented) (e.g., refs. 38, 39\u201340) The framework of ES(D) is a tool to understand which services, understood as benefits, NBS are able to provide at the cost of others, while enabling a translation of generic stakeholder interests and preferences into explicit terms. Thereby, the ES framework can map how different stakeholders' preferences can find synergies or stand in conflict with each other. For example, Mosleh et al.41 indicate the differences in preferred ES for green infrastructure planning at the city level, while Wagner et al.42 illustrate the potential discrepancies between the desired ES of an area and the (in)ability of the area to provide those services. The distribution of benefits (services) such as recreational opportunities, esthetic value, and the provision of shade; and negative impacts (disservices) such as allergenicity, unwanted species, and perceived infrastructure risks is central herein43, 44\u201345. A focus on stakeholder perceptions, preferences, and participation in NBS trade-off analyses9,46 seeks to bring a focus on inclusivity and justice of NBS processes and outcomes.</p><p>Although ecosystem services and disservices provide a useful framework for understanding trade-offs and conflicts during the design, planning, implementation, and use phases of NBS, it has ethical and practical limitations. Ethically, the ES(D) framework inherently values nature based on the services it provides to humans, often emphasizing those that can be easily quantified or have direct economic benefits (e.g., water purification, carbon sequestration, flood regulation), whilst undervaluing the intrinsic worth of biodiversity, ecological communities and ecological processes47. This can contribute to the commodification of nature and, in turn, allow for market-based mechanisms (e.g., carbon markets, biodiversity offsets) where nature is treated as a form of capital that can be traded or offset48 and has been an ineffective tool in achieving public support for nature conservation49. At a practical level, the predominance of a single-city and single-service focus prevents a holistic assessment of biodiversity and ecosystem services synergies and trade-offs50, which is amplified by a misunderstanding between ecosystem functions and biodiversity51. These analyses reveal that \u201c[t]he impact of trade-offs is often related to the intensity of use of ecosystem[s]\u201d and that the most frequent trade-offs occur among provisioning and regulating ES46. An MSJ lens invites researchers and planners to consider how exactly life-supporting ecosystem functions at the foundation of human and non-human species\u2019 wellbeing are negatively impacted. For example, how the misappropriation and biopiracy of Indigenous ecological knowledge affects the stewardship of ecosystems, and the well-being of Indigenous communities52, or how discounting biodiversity and ecological communities that do not hold a significant value for people can risk the ecological integrity of nature-based solutions17.</p><p>A MSJ perspective also invites a deeper understanding of who benefits, who bears the harms, who is recognized and who is counted through NBS planning (see Case 1). Broader framings and deeper analyses that recognize the interconnections and relationality of the complex interrelated multispecies world we inhabit are now considered essential51,53. Similar arguments have been raised regarding the plural valuation of nature as a way to foster inclusivity amongst \u201cbenefits, stakeholders, knowledge systems and worldviews\u201d54, 55\u201356, and as a means to foster recognitional justice through the diverse representation and empowerment of marginalized worldviews57. Such a recognition requires moving away from a perspective of instrumental value, in which nature is valued as a means to satisfy human needs and interests and which still dominates ES literature58, and instead incorporates non-instrumental and plural values.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Case 1: Interurban Biological Corridors, San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica</emphasis></p><p>The Interurban Biological Corridors is a nature-based planning initiative in the metropolitan urban area of San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica. The corridors are developed as mechanisms for ecological conservation and social-ecological wellbeing59 by concretizing a vision of social-ecological connectivity, restoration, and conservation in cities. The interurban biological corridors connect protected areas at the regional scale, promoting habitat restoration, wildlife movement, and preservation of genetic diversity through the protection of river basins60. These Corridors, however, are also framed and managed as a social-ecological tool to improve human wellbeing; its effectiveness is measured and management interventions are based on the ES(D) framework61. To understand trade-offs, the managing institution uses an \u201canalysis of conflict zones\u201d approach to understand how, why, and between whom conflicts emerge and play out. This framework locates the emerging and unfolding of conflict in land-use practices, people\u2019s values, tensions between biodiversity conservation and establishing protection areas, and tensions due to land tenure and the use of the river as a resource. Trade-offs and conflicts are managed through a zoning approach aiming to regulate land-use changes in a top-down fashion, and based on principles of productivity and efficiency of space. While thus managing certain trade-offs, it simultaneously generates new trade-offs, such as polluted and environmentally degraded areas, areas that are protected in a static way, and unevenly distributed burdens and benefits62.</p><p>Bringing the MSJ approach to bear on the Corridors, a different picture emerges. Rivers would be considered a living system, rather than a resource for consumption or a production point of services. This could be recognized through the provision of legal personhood and independent rights to flourish; or through Indigenous collaborative governance representing the river\u2019s stakes in decision making settings63 \u201cManagement\u201d then becomes undesirable, as that would misrecognize the \u201cradically diverse life project, capabilities, phenomenologies, ways of being, functionings, forms of integrity, and relationalities\u201d16 of living organisms. Instead, the recognition and dealing with trade-offs and conflict would have to facilitate a process that considers the interest of the river, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">as a living being</emphasis>, rather than the interests of those around the river, as a resource. For example, diverting water for irrigation is not just a technical or economic decision\u2014it becomes a question of whether such an action infringes upon the river\u2019s \u201cright\u201d or capabilities to flow, to sustain its ecosystems, or to exist in a healthy state. This reframes trade-offs as negotiations among stakeholders, where the river\u2019s needs\u2014such as maintaining ecological integrity, flow, and self-renewal\u2014hold similar weight to human interests.</p><p>This shift complicates trade-offs, making them less about optimizing outcomes and more about navigating responsibilities, obligations, and relationships. It may lead to decisions that favor ecological integrity over short-term economic gain, or that prioritize restoration over exploitation. Ultimately, including a river in justice considerations invites a broader ethical imagination: one in which trade-offs are not simply technical dilemmas but moral dialogs among interdependent beings. It challenges dominant anthropocentric paradigms and opens space for more reciprocal, respectful, and sustainable ways of relating to the more-than-human world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Assumption of neutrality of science</emphasis></p><p>A core feature of NBS is that they should provide environmental benefits alongside social and economic ones, contributing to biodiverse futures and healthy ecosystems simultaneously. Knowledge stemming from the subdisciplines of ecology is therefore seen as pivotal to guide the planning and management of NBS, and to understand potential trade-offs between management options to ultimately ensure positive contributions to biodiversity. This knowledge comes into play, for example, through the provision of indicators, which are thought to capture potential improvement or deterioration of biodiversity through NBS by looking at such things as species variation and diversity, and by sorting native from non-native species (e.g. refs. 64, 65\u201366. For example, assessments of trade-offs related to biodiversity place a strict division between native and non-invasive species as being conducive to biodiversity, whereas non-natives and invasives are seen as disservice to biodiversity64. The underlying assumption is that ecological knowledge can objectively bring into view the benefits to biodiversity that NBS provide, and that the ecological concepts and techniques used facilitate an impartial description unhindered by bias.</p><p>While ecological knowledge on trade-offs brings much needed attention to issues of environmental processes and quality, and to the multifariousness of (managing for) ecological benefits (e.g. ref. 67), important ethical and political dimensions regarding the stakes for and treatment of diverse living beings in NBS have been overlooked due to the ways we conceptualize and represent relationships between and among different species. These dimensions come into view when we broaden the scope of consideration in NBS as inspired by an MSJ lens, challenging narrow or omitted representation of diverse species in NBS13. Here, we argue that this representation is not merely of concern regarding planning discourses but equally involves reflexive consideration of the conceptual and epistemological apparatus of science. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How</emphasis> we know affects <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">what</emphasis> we know, and ongoing engagement with concepts, frameworks, and practices is therefore critical to reveal blind spots and offer alternative approaches to understanding trade-offs in NBS in ways that are more conducive to MSJ68, 69\u201370.</p><p>Two developments in ecological science illustrate the need to trouble the common assumption of neutrality of ecological knowledge and the indicators for NBS derivative of it: the widespread disregard of the cognitive and emotional capacities of animals, and their well-being; and the insistence on nativeness as a conservation principle. As our understanding deepens regarding the cognitive and emotional capacities of animals\u2014and even the abilities of plants\u2014our approach to ecological knowledge is undergoing a profound transformation. No longer can we view ecosystems as collections of passive resources or lifeforms as mere data points. Instead, we are being called to recognize them as active participants in their own right, capable of experience, response, and relationship. For example, animal intelligence has long been disregarded in ecological scientific practice, where behaviorist views of animals as stimulus-response machines were dominant. This disregard is a problem when we consider that the capacity for intelligence is a prominent basis upon which moral consideration is dispensed, and the Descartian model of the animal as automaton popular in science ipso facto excludes animals from moral consideration. Recent work on animal cognition challenges this view of animals, reminding us that our scientific concepts and models are not outside of scrutiny, and that reflection on their limits remains important, especially when those scientific categorizations and understandings carry ethical and political implications of worth and consideration65. The exclusion of a concern for animal well-being in ecological sciences based on a supposed incommensurability with processes of predation and death, then can be called into question as well, based on the duty of moral consideration (whether based on intelligence, sentience, or another criterium). Similarly, typical classificatory systems of ecology, that sort out belonging and desirability of plant and animal species by differentiating between native and non-native species, can be questioned from an MSJ perspective13,71. Sometimes non-native species are harmless, provide benefits to their environments, and have conservation value72, 73\u201374. More fundamentally, species travel, landscapes are dynamic, and many ecosystems are transformed by humans, making the designation \u201cnative\u201d to some extent arbitrary and linked to a Romantic notion of pristine Nature75,76. The common conceptualization of native species as good and non-native species as bad, typically accompanied with metaphors drawing action into militaristic terms of fighting77, might not serve conservation efforts in the way that is customarily thought74,78. The presumed neutrality of science might then get in the way of alternative frames, such as cohabitation79.</p><p>Taking a MSJ perspective, which brings attention to the ethical and political dimensions of species and their organization, the critique of the assumption of neutrality is that ecological knowledge\u2014like all knowledge\u2014is not purely objective or universal, but instead influenced by broader social, cultural, and historical contexts, so that it becomes governed by discursive framings that inadvertently express ontological views and value judgment80,81. Paying attention to such framings and how they enable or hinder justice, then, is a key analytical task71. From the MSJ perspective we can see that, for instance, once animals are rendered intelligent, or animal sentience and welfare become a legitimate concern, the design and maintenance of NBS should not merely focus on the management of specific species, but should take life trajectories into consideration that acknowledge that NBS and the ecosystems making them up are multispecies communities in which social bonds are key71,79. Taking such a relational understanding of moral significance could thus enable NBS scholars to rethink the \u201centities\u201d traded off, as not merely about ecosystem services, but different interspecies constellations, thus recognizing sentience and sociability as dimensions impacting the justness of decisions. Not doing so risks failure to account for the needs and well-being from an intrinsic point of view and thus potential exploitation or mistreatment. Furthermore, an MSJ perspective invites us to have a more contextual understanding of the threats posed by non-native species. This includes rethinking which trade-offs are captured, and how to recategorise the threats and benefits posed by non-natives based on their combined ecological and human wellbeing benefits or harms (Case 2). Overall, the lessons from MSJ invite us to take a second look at the ecological concepts and knowledge we rely on in our approach to NBS, acknowledging that these concepts and knowledge have histories, alternatives, and world-creating abilities. They are not politically or morally innocent, but instead influence academic and policy practice in ways that can stand in tension to goals of justice. To move beyond the assumption of the neutrality of science, then, means to practice reflexivity to enable forms of accountable and just practices.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Case 2: Urban wetlands and Phragmites Australis in North East America</emphasis></p><p>Land managers of urban wetlands focus their efforts on limiting the dangers to the health of these ecosystems, in order for them to provide habitat and food for a biodiverse constituency and to offer ecosystem services to humans as well. The control of invasive species, for example through removal projects, is a key management strategy for wetland health. In the American North East, the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phragmites Australis</emphasis>, or common reed, is one of the main targets to control or eradicate, and lots of time, effort, and money are spent on removal. The non-native strain of this aquatic grass, introduced some 200 years ago through ship ballast, is now the most common Phragmites on the East Coast. It is typically seen as harmful because it is believed to compete with native vegetation, crowding or shading it out, and to alter habitats in ways that are inhospitable to diverse bird, fish, insect, and invertebrate species, destroying sites for reproduction and rearing of the young.</p><p>And yet, the onset of climate change leads some ecologists and communities to reconsider the view of Phragmites as a pest and a danger to wildlife and plants. With sea levels rising and extreme weather events such as storm surges expected to become more common, urban wetlands are increasingly recognized and valued for their capacity to slow down wind and water and thus protect property and life. However, crunched by the speed of sea level rise and the inability to migrate inland because of human structures, some urban wetlands are at risk of drowning82. The deep roots and fast-growing, dense stands of stems of the Phragmites, its ability to stabilize soil, and its ability to create more detritus and opportunity for elevation than other grass species, \u201cmay provide resource managers with a strategy of combating sea-level rise\u201d83. Added benefits in the context of climate change are its ability to sequester carbon dioxide84 and nitrogen85. Killing and removing Phragmites may make soils, especially on vulnerable coastlines, more prone to erosion.</p><p>The reconsideration of Phragmites\u2019 bad reputation should, however, not only be understood in terms of trading off biodiversity concerns over climate change impact considerations. The common sense knowledge on invasive species as harmful by definition has been questioned, with research suggesting that assumptions about low habitat value, detriment to biodiversity, and disturbance of marsh function may not hold in each case86, 87, 88\u201389. What is more, the eradication of Phragmites does not \u201cjust\u201d kill these grasses, but impacts other species\u2014including the native muskrat, American beaver, cottontail and diverse insects\u2014who eat and live in these plants87. This suggests that specificity matters, and that the treatment of native and invasive species should be context-specific, especially in contexts like the urban, where environmental altercation has been irreversible and long-lasting.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Assumption of collaborative consensus</emphasis></p><p>Recent literature emphasizes the need for collaborative approaches in NBS planning and implementation through concepts like co-creation90,91, co-production92,93, co-design94, and collaborative governance95,96. These approaches are thought to help manage trade-offs and catalyze synergies in NBS implementation97, assuming that consensus between diverse actors can be found98. For example, it has been argued that searching consensus on the benefits and costs of NBS can help decision-makers to design and implement NBS4,99,100, and accounting for stakeholders\u2019 perceptions on the likely co-benefits can enhance acceptability of the NBS9. However, these views lack sensitivity towards diverse perspectives on the claimed co-benefits; in particular, multispecies perspectives are generally lacking (exceptions refs. 14,101).</p><p>The assumption of co-benefits is debatable when we take an MSJ perspective, because it challenges the subject of benefit, recognizing that the distribution of harms depends on how the relationships between humans and other species are considered within specific contexts. For example, the habitats provided by NBS can also attract wild animals that are unwanted by their human neighbors, while rewilding efforts can be at odds with creating culturally appropriate foodscapes34. One way to manage multispecies conflicts is to include more-than-human species in an \u201cinterspecies democracy\u201d by considering their actions as a form of political communication31,102. Furthermore, more-than-human species are also embedded in historical and political contexts, which shape multispecies coexistence and conflicts103. Assuming consensual co-benefits of NBS often masks legitimately diverse viewpoints behind the alleged consensus104. Theories of rational deliberation have been criticized for their ignorance of conflict and the benefits of conflicts for democratic societies105, 106\u2013107. For example, the taken-for-grantedness of the idea that birds in urban green space will enhance human well-being108,109, may, in actuality, mask diverse conflicting views behind the assumed consensus on the co-benefits.</p><p>Overall, instead of assuming consensus on the co-benefits of NBS, we should interrogate whether and why consensus or dissensus is at play. Here, we should seek to understand the political and historical contexts of the multispecies encounters, the type of conflict occurring, the alternative ways to build consensus for conflict management, and how to engage more-than-human species in conflict management. Raymond et al. encourage the creation of \u201ctransdisciplinary safe\u201d spaces for dealing with intractable conflicts, which are never complete in NBS planning when representing multispecies needs13.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Case 3: The conflict between barnacle geese and humans in Helsinki, Finland</emphasis></p><p>This case illustrates the difficulty of consensus-seeking methods in managing conflicts, and MSJ can offer an alternative means of negotiating partial settlements. In the 1970s, barnacle geese were close to extinction and therefore protected under the Bern convention, while the hunting of these geese was forbidden through the EU\u2019s Birds directive in 1979110. This led to revitalization of the population reaching 1.4 million in 2020110, with around 6000 nesting individuals since in Helsinki 2015111. The geese arrive in Finland during their spring migration, and stay there until winter retreats from their Arctic breeding grounds112.</p><p>The presence and litter of barnacle geese has been considered to decrease the attractiveness of urban green spaces for people, and makes cleaning of the parks more expensive and difficult112. In the media, arguments made range from those arguing that the protection of barnacle geese should be ended113, to those that state \u201cgoose rage\u201d is incomprehensible114, and others that insist urgent solutions to a catastrophic geese problem are needed115. In 2024, the City of Helsinki launched a competition seeking new tools to collect litter from the city parks and beaches, and hired 45 employees because of the geese situation. It is suggested that a previously vibrant picnic culture has ended in the Kaivopuisto city park, nearby kindergartens do not make trips to the park anymore, and that prior to outdoor gymnastic sessions, the geese litter has to be collected in bags116,117.</p><p>Failed consensus-seeking management efforts include proposals for a branding campaign to produce a positive image of the geese, and geese guides, who would circle around the parks and tell people about the lives and positive aspects of the geese118. However, these proposals were not transformed into mainstream practices. Recently, the coexistence of geese and people has been proposed in urban green space management111, for example, by letting the city lawns grow higher to attract less geese, and by building small fences to limit the movements of baby geese who cannot fly119,120. From this checkered history with geese, what seems to be emerging are multispecies negotiations. In these negotiations, material changes in the physical environment (e.g., fences, dogs, height of the grass) enable changes in geese behavior in ways that support the subjective well-being of humans in urban areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Assumption of unitemporality</emphasis></p><p>Commonly, trade-off considerations in NBS focus on how different benefits and burdens manifest across time, from current situations to future scenarios121,122. For example, a study on the perceived benefits from a protected area in Manila, the Philippines, identifies current conflicting stakeholder interests between values for biodiversity, ecotourism, and urban development potential and the implications for future land-use changes121. Similarly, a study on conflicting values connected to urban coastal mangroves positions values in the present with projections for the future123. Some studies investigate changes over time, looking at the recent past, for example, tracing the dispersion of green spaces in a context of increasing urban development124,125, or investigating forced displacement in informal settlements resulting from greenbelt development126.</p><p>Yet such studies do not fully engage with the multiple temporalities of place. For example, historical time can be transformed by atmospheric carbon, reproductive time can be queered by microplastics, and species extinction affects notions of multispecies time (see ref. 127). In particular, studies commonly ignore the potential for phenological mismatches (e.g., between plants and pollinators), as well as mismatches between ecological, social, and political systems, for example the disconnects between short-term thinking of political cycles and the requirement for longer-term thinking to manage the biodiversity and climate crises (e.g., refs. 127, 128\u2013129) (Case 3). Also, benefits and burdens are not always expressed in the same time period130, 131\u2013132, and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">longue duree</emphasis> has a lasting legacy on socio-ecological constellations and their perceived justice19,133. The MSJ lens shows that social life cannot be conceived as distinct from the environment, and therefore, a rapprochement of different temporal worlds is critical to addressing temporal mismatches. It requires an improved understanding of how time is both embedded and contested within the intertwined social and ecological crises127, and in socio-ecological practices. It requires a deeper exploration of lived, situated experiences that take shape in particular expressions of time134, including seasonal rhythms and the different cycles, durations, and tempos involved in specific nature management practices (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ibid</emphasis>), as reflected in the case of urban beekeeping (Case 4). The MSJ lens thus encourages temporal reflection for NBS trade-offs: whose future do we care for? Whose pasts and presents do we recognize? How can we become attentive to a diversity of rhythms, life cycles, and experiences over species boundaries? 76</p><p>Two related analytical moves can help in attending to polytemporality135 and its repercussions for NBS trade-offs: decolonial thinking and more-than-human thinking. First, decolonial thinking reveals how colonial narratives of \u201cNature\u201d and practices of taming \u201cNature\u201d endure in and influence NBS planning and governance79,136,137. For example, the siting of port cities and the design of drainage systems in Suriname and Guyana hinged on Dutch and British colonial ideas of waterways as controllable and exploitable, ideas that remain central through notions such as \u201cflood control\u201d and \u201cutilizing natural resources\u201d79,138. Even when biocentrist pre-colonial notions of \u201cNature\u201d (as not separate from humanity, as something to be respected and lived in harmony with) are expressly revitalized in contemporary times, such as through Buen Vivir principles in Ecuador, this remains a theoretical exercise more than a success in practice35. Attending to this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">longue duree</emphasis> is a necessary step to understand how legacies of past social and multispecies injustice leave imprints on the present that may constrain breaking out of problematic pathways79. At the same time, scrutinizing colonial modes of planning and governance in NBS is a necessary step to recognize and redress past harms, current needs, and desired futures136. Second, more-than-human thinking challenges humanistic conceptions of time in favor of more-than-human timescales, assigning us to recalibrate ourselves to the different speeds of different forms of life139. This move brings into view how human timescales can disrupt those of other species, for example, when practices of environmental offsetting fail to account for the slowness of tree growth when a habitat sacrificed for urban development goals is supposedly unproblematically replaced by a new one140.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Case 4: Multispecies temporalities in urban beekeeping in Australia</emphasis></p><p>Integrating beekeeping programs into urban areas is an NBS that serves as a refuge for pollinators141 and that fosters learning about biodiversity and responsible actions around the home or office142. Such programs can be used to address trade-offs, such as how the use of commercial bug-sprays (i.e., pesticides) can have sub-lethal effects on urban bee populations143. This brings into focus the plurality of times at play in beekeeping practices, where plural versions of the future (e.g., collapse, recovery) find expression in trade-offs in the present (e.g., harvesting for honey or leaving honey for bees; whether or not to manage swarms). Urban beekeeping, then, requires coordination between human and bee temporalities made through diverse and imbricated more-than-human relations134,144,145. Accounts of urban beekeeping inf Australia134 highlight that beekeeping requires a kind of \u201cslowing down\u201d and becoming \u201cin tune\u201d with bees\u2014for example, slowing one\u2019s body, focusing on bees, and keeping one\u2019s distance.</p><p>The importance of time keeping and time telling over species boundaries is critical in beekeeping practices. Harvesting honey in ways that best protect the health of bees requires skillful sequencing, timing, and pacing of checking hives and the coordination of humans and bee tellings of time, which is never fully complete134. Beekeepers need to be attuned to the rhythms of seasonal changes, growth patterns, and circadian cycles to ensure the persistence of colonies. For example, beekeepers need to pay attention to the seasonality of the flowering of plants for bees (including differences in flowering frequencies, durations, and intensities between species), and the timing of swarming. Importantly, these plural temporalities are place-specific, meaning that urban beekeeping and its rhythms are not a homogenous (temporal) experience, but instead a situated practice146. In Australia, for example, where mass bee loss has not occurred and yet shapes attitudes towards beekeeping, honey production hinges on the irregular blossoming of Eucalyptus instead of seasonal cycles. The temporal coordination between diverse species that is critical to beekeeping is also diverse, warranting attention to the poly-temporal nature of the world. Such situated accounts of more-than-human relationships show how they stretch beyond current spacetimes (building on refs. 134,147), and that beekeeping is a negotiated, place-based practice where multiple more-than-human temporalities become entwined.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion: necessary shifts for multispecies justice in trade-offs thinking for NBS</emphasis></p><p>In this paper, we explored how the expansion of the notion of justice to a wider set of subjects changes the characteristics, conflicts, and concerns that we see in NBS trade-off assessments. Using insights from the project of MSJ, which urges us to attend to life projects and relationalities of living beings and systems for ecological and ethical reasons, we interrogated four common and unquestioned assumptions in how trade-offs are typically understood in NBS\u2013assumptions of instrumentalism, neutrality, collaborative consensus, and unitemporality. MSJ helps us to rethink trade-offs and conflict in NBS by insisting on (1) plural and non-instrumental values; (2) alternative frames of knowledge production and assessment; (3) ongoing negotiations with political stakes; and (4) different temporalities coexisting and clashing. The resulting shifting terrain of approaching trade-offs (Table 1) therefore insists on the situatedness of NBS in political, ethical, and historical contexts alongside ecological ones, while questioning the usefulness of thinking about trade-offs in near-universal terms. Thus, theorizing trade-offs as an issue of intra- and interspecies politics, we argue for an approach to NBS trade-offs that is explicit about both the stakes and justice implications of NBS interventions beyond the human, and about the inevitability of making, sometimes difficult, choices.Table 1</p><p>Traditional and MSJ-informed approaches to trade-offs in NBS</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Assumption</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Traditional approaches to trade-off assessments</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">MSJ perspectives on trade-offs</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Instrumentalism</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Focus on benefits/services and disservices</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Recognition of plural and non-instrumental values and considers questions of costs and benefits ?for whom??, leading to more nuanced assessments of conflict.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Neutrality</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Tendency to use indicators as measures of costs, benefits, and effectiveness, which are assumed to ?objectively? measure reality</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Emphasizes the ethical and political dimensions of costs and benefits, including issues of intelligence and sentience.

MSJ emphasizes a rapprochement of different temporal worlds, including how experiences are situated in different cycles, durations, and tempos over species boundaries.</p><p>Overall, the MSJ approach to NBS trade-offs challenges narratives of control and exploitation by centering more-than-human ontologies and epistemologies. How can we integrate such considerations into NBS planning and governance practice? A first step is to acknowledge that existing tools for trade-off assessments may be overlooking benefits and costs associated with NBS across different subjectivities. We therefore posit that the development of new trade-off tools, processes, and practices that attend to multispecies needs is warranted. What is more, it would be useful to have processes in place where constructive critique of the neutrality of trade-off assessment tool can be expressed, and find approaches through which to interrogate whether, how, and through what means collaborative consensus can be achieved\u2014or how to make choices, and \u201cpick sides\u201d, in accountable ways, when conflict is inevitable. This means being more reflexive about what is being traded off and how it affects the well-being of humans and more-than-human species. Relatedly, planners need to respect the different temporalities of place and how this provides meanings and functions to both humans and more-than-human species, changing the way that trade-offs are recognized and distributed over space and time. In this regard, intergenerational thinking148 could become part and parcel of NBS trade-off assessments. All this together points to the need to find ways to fairly represent more-than-human perspectives\u2014in both ecological and social terms\u2014in planning processes in order to get a better understanding of the unfolding dynamics of interspecies relations in place and how these help\u2014or hinder\u2014some lives to flourish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We thank Niki Frantzeskaki for feedback on an early draft, and Chiara Holtschneider for bibliographic assistance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Raymond, CM.

The focus is on solutions that not only protect against rising sea levels but also help restore natural ecosystems.</p><p><br/><br/>Working in the marine environment, protecting nature and ecological value are at the heart of DEME's activities. One of the ways in which we increase ecological value is by exploring opportunities to recover, improve, or develop ecosystems in each of our projects through the application of nature-based solutions. Instead of relying solely on traditional concrete or stone sea defenses, we believe we can adopt more natural systems that work in harmony with the environment. These include, among other things, gently sloping beaches reinforced with dunes and vegetation, as well as salt marshes and mudflats that naturally buffer and protect riverbanks. Such approaches not only enhance coastal resilience but also support biodiversity and landscape integration.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>DEME head office<br/>Tel: +32 3 250 52 11<br/>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:info@deme-group.com\">info@deme-group.com</email><br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G41-65T3-RYR9-Y427-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"223\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 24, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

All projects supported by the \u00a3600M fund involve partnership with one of six of the UK's privatised water utility companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a statement, Ofwat said: \"The Ofwat Innovation Fund is investing \u00a3600M over 10 years between 2020 and 2030 in collaborative projects which see water companies working with promising innovators from across different sectors globally to develop and deploy solutions to the water sector's biggest challenges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is delivered by innovation prize experts, Challenge Works (part of the Nesta group), in partnership with Arup and Isle Utilities.\"</p><p>The six projects highlighted in the report involved collaboration with 77 partners, including the Rivers Trust, the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), CIWEM (the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management), HR Wallingford, as well as technology companies, universities and local governments.</p><p>The projects include citizen science initiatives, projects to promote the integration of sustainable drainage systems (SuDs) into urban environments and identifying how to scale NBS to the landscape level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eight NBS projects benefiting from \u00a318M of Ofwat fund support</emphasis></p><p>There have been eight NBS related project funded through the Ofwat Innovation Fund.</p><p>Backed by over \u00a38M from the fund, mainstreaming nature-based solutions to deliver greater value\u00a0is a collaborative initiative integrating nature-based solutions into standard water management practices by breaking down the barriers to adoption, addressing flooding, drought and water quality issues at a landscape scale by leveraging multi-sectoral expertise.</p><p>The programme is now identifying barriers and enablers to NBS and preparing to test recommendations. The programme emphasises that using data and evidence to underpin its activities, testing regulatory and technical enablers and promoting the broader benefits of NBS, making them the first choice.</p><p>Catchment Systems Thinking Cooperative (CaSTCo) has received \u00a36.4M through the fund and is a collaborative initiative aiming to revolutionise how data about England and Wales' water environment is gathered and shared, with a focus on river health.</p><p>It is developing a a national framework for standardised environmental monitoring methods and supports local evidence gathering and community engagement across eight demonstration catchments,</p><p>Developing a market-based approach to deliver SuDS through street works aims to create a structured mechanism for integrating Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) into routine streetworks, using utility reinstatements as an opportunity for green infrastructure. This project, which has received \u00a31.3M from Ofwat, is developing and testing a market-based system where utilities and highways authorities can be incenitivised to utilise SuDS in their planned works. This will overcome one of the main barriers to SuDS implementation, which is the cost of excavations and permissions, since utilities companies are already digging for their planned works.</p><p>Water Net Gain, with \u00a31M funding from Ofwat, is developing a scheme for creating a distributed network of water storage on farmland, focusing on the southwest of England but looking to provide a scheme that can be implemented nationally. By compensating farmers to store water in smart ponds and lakes it addresses water scarcity. The Water Net Gain project is also developing a trading mechanism for farmers to sell stored water to buyers such as water companies, while also exploring legal, tax and regulatroy aspects.</p><p>SuDS iQ: A National SuDS Collaboration &amp; Evaluation Platform is using just under \u00a31M from Ofwat to create a national online collaborative platform focused on helping stakeholders plan, design and evaluate SuDS. The platform aims to enhance understanding of SuDS, the hydraulic and water quality benefits they can provide and their likely costs and carbon impact. This, it is believed, will accelerate the adoption of SuDS.</p><p>Seagrass Seeds of Recovery focusses on developing knowledge and capacity for restoring seagrass meadows across the UK to enhance biodiversity, improve water quality and strengthen coastal resilience. With a quarter of a million pounds behind it, the project is investigating pathways to captyure the value of seagrass's ability to sequester carbon, which also feeds into blue carbon debates and provides a platform for developing frameworks to integrate seagrass into climate change mitigation strategies.</p><p>Towards incentivisation for community-centric rainwater management has received \u00a3225,000 and has encouraged communities to adopt rainwater capture methods and reduce the strain on sewer networks during heavy rainfall, thereby mitigating surface water flooding and sewage discharges. An online platform offered freee water butts, while community events and social media campaigns raised awareness about the benefits of rainwater capture.</p><p>CatchmentLIFE has received \u00a3178,000 from Ofwat and is developing user-friendly software to model and visualise the impacts of habitat degradation on wildlife and ecological communities in UK rivers. The software will allow experts and citizen scientists to assess the effects of various pressures, including engineering, abstraction, land use changes and climate change on species and ecosystems. It will also provide access to existing monitoring data on water quality, habitats and species, alongside models designed by experts.</p><p>Read the <url

each of the projects</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Systemic barriers being broken down to mainstream NBS in water sector</emphasis></p><p>Ribble Rivers Trust is a partner of the Mainstreaming nature-based solutions to deliver greater value and CaSTCo projects.</p><p>Ribble Rivers Trust CEO Jack Spees said: \"Nature-based solutions have the potential to provide multiple socio-economic and environmental benefits by tackling flooding, drought and water quality issues at landscape scale.</p><p>\"However, there are systemic barriers currently preventing wider adoption and the benefits of nature-based solutions from being fully maximised, such as: fragmented or siloed investment, lack of standardisation and regulatory restrictions.</p><p>\"Being part of the Mainstreaming Nature-based Solutions programme allows us to tackle these issues by working collaboratively with multi-sectoral expertise.</p><p>\"Thanks to the Ofwat Innovation Fund, we are creating and testing new solutions that will help work towards removing the barriers, and mainstream nature-based solutions to deliver greater value for society and the environment for the future.\"</p><p>United Utilities is the lead partner of the Mainstreaming nature-based solutions to deliver greater value and CaSTCo projects.</p><p>United Utilties catchment innovation manager Rose Sumner said both projects \"are great opportunities to work collaboratively with Ofwat and organisations to think and act differently to overcome challenges facing the water sector.</p><p>\"Through CaSTCo, we have developed strong partnerships across the UK.</p><p>\"We're embracing a holistic, catchment systems thinking approach and as the project draws to a close later this year.</p><p>\"We will be embedding the learning from CaSTCo to improve the outcomes of our water systems and will continue to extend our improved approach to collaborative monitoring beyond our pilot schemes to improve the resilience of other catchments.</p><p>\"The Mainstreaming Nature-based Solutions project is currently in its first phase and will soon be publishing recommendations to overcome the barriers to NBS.</p><p>\"We're looking forward to developing and utilising the outputs and trialling them across the UK, helping us to build a more sustainable water future.</p><p>\"The project has already been able to influence Ofwat in the AMP8 planning; resulting in the inclusion of significant commitment to Nature Based Solutions across AMP\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Engineering firm HR Wallingford helping make SuDs planning more accessible</emphasis></p><p>HR Wallingford is a partner of the 'SuDS-iQ: A national SuDS collaboration &amp; evaluation platform' project.</p><p>HR Wallingford technical director, flood and water management Bridget Woods Ballard said: \"Effective collaboration between stakeholders is crucial to the successful planning and delivery of nature-based surface water management solutions - particularly those retrofitted into existing urban space.</p><p>\"By funding SuDS-iQ, the Ofwat Innovation Fund is giving us the opportunity to develop simple, accessible SuDS planning and evaluation tools embedded within a collaboration platform.</p><p>\"This will help improve collective understanding of SuDS performance, support stakeholders who don't have access to modelling software to compare options and improve communications during the scoping phases of a project.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Utility companies incentivised to leave SuDs behind in street works holes</emphasis></p><p>Thames Water is the 'lead company' on the 'Developing a market-based approach to deliver SuDS through street works' project.</p><p>Thames Water head of partnerships &amp; catchment planning Alex Nickson said: \"The risk of surface water flooding in London, as with many places, is growing because of climate change, the loss of permeable surfaces and more people living in areas of risk.</p><p>\"A key part of managing this risk is to reduce the rate and volume of stormwater trying to enter the drainage systems through Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS).</p><p>\"Through the Ofwat Innovation Fund, Thames Water and the Mayor of London have secured funding to develop and test a market-based approach to incentivise utility companies undertaking street works to install SuDS when completing their works.</p><p>\"Given the 165,000 major street works in London every year, if even a small percentage of these holes could be refilled with SuDS rather than road or pavement, this could meaningfully contribute to the reduction of surface water flood risk whilst also reducing disruption to road users and communities.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fund partner Isle Utilities looking forward to wider adoption of innovations</emphasis></p><p>Isle Utilities associate director Oliver Raud said: \"This learning report brings together valuable insights from a range of pioneering projects within the Ofwat Innovation Fund portfolio.</p><p>\"It highlights how collaboration, shared learning, and, crucially, systems thinking can accelerate transformation and drive improved environmental, societal and customer outcomes, from our upstream catchments, through to the sea.</p><p>\"We, at Isle, are proud to have supported this important work and look forward to seeing how these lessons and learnings can help deliver even greater impact across the sector.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate and biodiversity crises driving need for innovation</emphasis></p><p>Ofwat director, environment and innovation Jo Jolly said: \"Our water sector needs innovative solutions, and the culture to enable it, to navigate the crises we face - from climate change and biodiversity loss to rapid population growth.</p><p>\"Right across the sector, we need to collaborate at pace and drive a major shift towards nature-based solutions The Ofwat Innovation Fund has been a vital part of initiating this transition, and our ambition for ever more urgent progress is a central part of our new action plan for 2025-30.\"</p><p>Listen to<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcivilengineer.com/podcast/podcast-ofwat-on-funding-innovation-in-the-sector-and-securing-the-future-of-water-in-the-uk-26-02-2025/\"> a

The focus is on solutions that not only protect against rising sea levels but also help restore natural ecosystems.</p><p><br/><br/>Working in the marine environment, protecting nature and ecological value are at the heart of DEME's activities. One of the ways in which we increase ecological value is by exploring opportunities to recover, improve, or develop ecosystems in each of our projects through the application of nature-based solutions. Instead of relying solely on traditional concrete or stone sea defenses, we believe we can adopt more natural systems that work in harmony with the environment. These include, among other things, gently sloping beaches reinforced with dunes and vegetation, as well as salt marshes and mudflats that naturally buffer and protect riverbanks.

In this regard, the notion of Nature-based solutions implies that Africa should work with nature instead of destroying it as is currently the case in most African cities.<br/><br/>GGI blends traditional built infrastructure with natural systems such as wetlands, forests, and rivers-offering more cost-effective, resilient, sustainable and inclusive solutions.<br/><br/>At the event two major new reports were presented: Africa's Urbanisation Dynamics 2025-from the African Development Bank, OECD and Cities Alliance; and Growing Resilience: Unlocking the Potential of Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, a collaboration between the World Bank, WRI and the African Development Bank.<br/><br/>Africa's Urbanisation Dynamics 2025 presents an in-depth overview of future urbanisation patterns, featuring detailed data on population growth and the spatial development of over 11,000 urban centres across all 54 African nations.<br/><br/>'Africa's population is projected to grow by 900 million by 2050-with 700 million of that growth occurring in cities,' said Stefan Atchia, Manager, Urban Development Division, African Development Bank. 'Planning for this urban expansion must start now. Two out of three Africans will live in cities by 2050.'<br/><br/>Analyzing nearly 300 projects over the past decade, the 'Growing resilience' report identifies what works, key barriers, and strategies to scale up green, resilient development. It found a heavy reliance on grants-used in 84% of projects-while loans, although accounting for over 70% of total funding, were used in just 32% of projects. Expanding the use of blended finance and innovative instruments will be critical, participants heard. The report clearly indicated the sharp increase in new nature-based solutions projects and financing in Africa over the recent years, with Multilateral Development Banks accounting for over 70% of this investment.<br/><br/>'At WRI, we are committed to driving Africa's urban transition onto sustainable and livable pathways,' said Dr. Rebekah Shirley, Regional Deputy Director for Africa, WRI. 'Through our Green-Grey Infrastructure Accelerator, we're helping 11 cities in seven countries access funding, strengthen policies, and design projects that deliver tangible resilience benefits.'<br/><br/>Yet, there is room for improving nature-based solutions investment, providing technical assistance for early project preparation and diversifying financing mechanisms.<br/><br/>'We are working to restore degraded land, boost resilience, and create green jobs across the Sahel through initiatives like the Great Green Wall,' said Al Hamndou Dorsouma, Manager, Climate Change and Green Growth, African Development Bank, further emphasizing that 'Building on the Report's insights, the Bank will continue scaling up nature-based solutions support beyond traditional gray infrastructure finance through adopting a Green-Gray Infrastructure approach'.<br/><br/>Participants also heard from Muungano wa Wanavijiji, a grassroots movement in Nairobi's Mathare settlement working to protect rivers and rehabilitate open spaces. Their testimony reinforced the need to be responsive to community needs and integrated local leadership in nature-based solutions projects.<br/><br/>Closing the session, Michel Matera, Practice Manager for Western Africa, Urban, Resilience, and Land at the World Bank, reminded the audience:<br/><br/>'African cities are growing rapidly. Let's make sure they also grow sustainably, equitably, and resiliently-with nature as a key partner in that journey.'<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1M-PCB3-RRT7-439R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"781\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 13, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This study investigates the Parisian OASIS program\u2014a large-scale initiative to renature schoolyards\u2014through arthropod biodiversity surveys and interviews with 21 stakeholders. Findings reveal that green schoolyards host diverse arthropod communities, comparable to those in urban green spaces, contributing to ecological connectivity and multispecies justice. However, realizing their full potential requires significant shifts in urban governance, long-term management, and inclusive social appropriation. Justice is key: ensuring all school communities\u2014especially marginalized one\u2014benefit equally from green infrastructure. The success of these NbS depend on biodiversity-informed practices and sustained engagement from educators, students, families, and city officials. By integrating justice into design and implementation, green schoolyards can become transformative spaces for more equitable and inclusive NbS in urban environments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>The growing challenges posed by climate change, frequent heatwaves, and increasing pollution have spurred global efforts to \u2018green\u2019 cities and improve their resilience1,2. Among these strategies, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) have emerged as a key framework to address urban environmental challenges by leveraging natural systems3, 4\u20135.NbS are currently defined as \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services, resilience and biodiversity benefits</emphasis>6\u201d (p. 7). Urban areas are increasingly recognized as critical sites for implementing Nature-based Solutions (NbS), which provide essential ecosystem services through enhanced biodiversity and ecological connectivity, but also generate disservices7,8. These green spaces significantly contribute to public health by promoting physical activity, improving psychological well-being, and enhancing overall quality of life. Furthermore, NbS are valued for their potential to reshape the relationship between urban residents and nature9,10. Beyond managing local ecosystems, NbS can foster community engagement in decision-making processes and promote a more equitable distribution of environmental benefits11. Effective governance of NbS must therefore operate across multiple scales\u2014from individual sites to neighborhoods and cities\u2014while integrating social, economic, and ecological dimensions12. However, research consistently shows that such spaces are often unevenly distributed, with more affluent communities disproportionately benefiting13. A more comprehensive understanding of justice includes not only distributive outcomes, but also procedural justice (participation, recognition) and empowerment during NbS implementation14. Crucially, NbS should be developed through inclusive and participatory planning processes that actively involve local stakeholders, especially marginalized communities. Nevertheless, participatory processes are not immune to power imbalances and frequently fall short of their promises15. One of the key critiques of NbS is their often overly solutions-oriented framing, which can obscure deeper issues related to values, symbolic meanings, and governance processes. When applied narrowly, NbS risk reinforcing a separation between humans and nature, rather than fostering more integrated, just, and transformative relationships16.</p><p>The greening of schoolyards has emerged as a flagship initiative for experimenting with NbS, in part due to the complex roles these spaces play\u2014educational, recreational, and environmental17,18. In addition to addressing multiple socio-environmental challenges, including climate change, schoolyard NbS incorporate various dimensions of justice. These include implementation across diverse school environments, participatory design processes, recognition of children\u2019s diverse needs, and a strong emphasis on education. Traditionally designed for play and learning, schoolyards are now being reimagined as urban spaces for climate resilience, equitable access to nature and environmental education19. In this context, the co-production of NbS in schoolyards\u2014through the engagement of teachers, children, parents, and local communities\u2014holds promise for fostering inclusive approaches to urban sustainability, with potential benefits for both people and ecosystems20.</p><p>Upscaling schoolyards greening is not just a matter of multiplying a number of green facilities. Upscaling21 refers to the ways in which NbS can be deployed more widely and generate genuinely transformative change at different scales of time and space, engaging stakeholders of different status and professional sectors22. Different authors23 promote NbSs, and their scaling up, as drivers of climate change adaptation. This is all the more difficult as the implementation of NbS requires considerable consideration of the context, both environmental and social. In schoolyards greening, scaling up is a major challenge, not only to extend this strategy to all schools, but above all to participate in transforming the administrative and educational cultures of these areas. In other terms, transforming the teachers\u2019 pedagogical program and habits as well the appropriation of schoolyards and surroundings could contribute to widen the stakeholder\u2019s participation.</p><p>Consequently, the evaluation of NbS, including schoolyards, may involve equity and justice issues, civic participation, well-being and health. And yet, even today, most evaluation relate to biodiversity and ecosystem services3, 4\u20135. This underscores the need for a broader evaluation that avoid technomanagerial biases by enabling communities to shape how NbS can offer equitable and resilient responses to climate change. Developing such assessments necessitate an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary approach, involving stakeholders from civil society (such as naturalist collectives but also social stakeholders) and ensuring co-production with end-users12,24, 25\u201326.</p><p>In this paper, we examine how the greening of schoolyards\u2014originally introduced to mitigate urban heat islands and enhance climate adaptation\u2014also advances broader NbS goals, such as promoting urban biodiversity, transforming social-ecological systems, and strengthening human-nature relationships underlining the challenge of conjointly addressing them27. We hypothesize that scaling up NbS requires a dynamic interaction between physical changes (like biodiversity-friendly landscaping) and shifts in social practices and perceptions, particularly among key stakeholders such as administrators and educators. We assumed that the presence of spontaneous biodiversity, not originally anticipated, plays a crucial role in informing policy-making decisions, to influence stakeholders and highlight opportunities for expanding NbS. This creates a positive feedback loop between policy discourse, intentions, and biodiversity outcomes. As biodiversity metrics as well as city-dwellers well-being inform urban policies, subsequent greening initiatives reinforce nature\u2019s role in urban planning, driving further policy adaptations and fostering the development of governance approaches that integrate nature for more sustainable and resilient cities.</p><p>We explore three main research questions and their associated hypotheses:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How does the socio-technical production of nature in schoolyards occur?</emphasis> We hypothesize that the complexity of school environments, which involve multiple actors (children, teachers, administrators, parents, etc.), poses challenges for the collaborative management and scaling of NbS. The success of NbS in these contexts depends on the ability of these diverse actors to adapt their routines, coordinate their efforts, and align their sometimes-competing values. However, we expect that stakeholder groups have interests or values that may not be aligned, or may even conflict28.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What is the ecological contribution of renaturing schoolyards?</emphasis> We hypothesize that, although biodiversity might not be the primary objective of these initiatives, schoolyards can serve as small habitats that contribute to urban biodiversity, supporting species diversity, and potentially acting as stepping-stones between larger green spaces. In this perspective, schools are expected to have relatively similar levels of abundance and richness to green spaces, and the communities in both types of space to be similar (i.e., suggesting that connections and flows of non-human animals and vegetation are possible).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How do schoolyards function as privileged places for human\u2013nature interactions?</emphasis> We hypothesize that the implementation of NbS in schools reshapes the use of these spaces, promoting a diverse range of activities\u2014from free play to creative and environmental education\u2014that fosters a stronger connection between children and nature29. This in turn may influence broader societal perceptions of nature and drive the scaling up of NbS beyond school settings, serving as models for larger urban NbS implementations.</p><p>Therefore, the socio-ecological transformation of schoolyards\u2014driven by their redesign\u2014entails addressing a wide range of changes that affect children, teachers, administrative staff, and parents alike. This transformation engages with critical issues related to both individual and collective well-being, spatial justice in access to green infrastructure across urban neighborhoods, and the equitable redistribution of schoolyard spaces to inclusively serve all children through participatory design and empowerment30. Socio-ecological transformation is understood as being place-based and ecologically grounded, while also involving institutional change and cultural evolution.</p><p>To address these research questions and hypotheses, we adopt an interdisciplinary methodological approach that integrates ecological assessments with social science perspectives. This approach allows us to examine both the biodiversity present in schoolyards and the representations, practices, and interactions of the various stakeholders involved in these spaces. By combining species inventories with semi-structured interviews, we aim to connect the quantitative and qualitative dimensions of NbS. Specifically, we explore the diversity and abundance of biodiversity, the practices used to design, manage, and maintain this biodiversity, and the stakeholders\u2019 perceptions and uses of these green spaces.</p><p>The interdisciplinary nature of this approach is crucial for several reasons. First, it enables us to capture the complex ecological processes involved in renaturing schoolyards, while simultaneously analyzing how social and administrative practices influence these processes. Second, it allows us to examine the socio-technical production of nature from both ecological and stakeholder perspectives, revealing how different actors contribute to or hinder the success of NbS. Finally, this comprehensive approach provides a deeper understanding of how schoolyards function as experimental spaces for human\u2013nature interactions, highlighting the ways in which ecological and social dimensions interact to shape the success and scalability of NbS. Our case study, focused on the greening of schoolyards in Paris, France through the OASIS program (Fig. 1), provides an ideal setting to explore these interdisciplinary dynamics.Fig. 1</p><p>Example of three OASIS schoolyards 1. \u00c9cole Merlin 11th arrondissement 2.

The Paris City Council primarily relies on its central (e.g. DEVE) and local (e.g. SEJ) services to design, implement, and manage the project. Each of these three main stages involves a diverse range of stakeholders and services (Fig. 2). Initially, the district council and the school and early childhood affairs division (CASPE) select schoolyards for the project based on two criteria: the level of dilapidation of the schoolyard and, less frequently, existing proposals from the city\u2019s participatory budget. Once a schoolyard and the budget are approved for inclusion, the project moves into a co-design phase involving children, teachers, school staff and various experts, including the Council for Architecture, Urban Planning, and Environment (CAUE), landscape architects from the Public buildings and architecture department (DCPA) and section (SLA) and council services (school affairs, early childhood, cultural affairs, green spaces, youth and sport, etc.).Fig. 2</p><p>Diagram of the services involved in the Oasis project in Paris. Source: Cedissia About, 2023.</p><p>The CAUE de Paris is offering each school concerned an opportunity to co-design the future playground, the first stage of co-design being with the school\u2019s children. The aim of the workshops with the children is to come up with design recommendations using a project-based approach. Raising awareness of the challenges of climate change and providing references help them to materialise their intuitions and understand the main challenges of a playground. The workshops are then used to establish a diagnosis of the uses of the playground, based on observations and surveys carried out by the children, and to draw up proposals for future developments using scale models.</p><p>Then consultation workshops bring together the head of the school, the teachers, the City of Paris, the education officer and the after-school care staff, as well as, if possible, the maintenance staff, the parents, the school doctor and psychologist, the caretakers. These workshops are devoted to report back on the children\u2019s work and make proposals for development scenarios arising from the workshops, to take account of the technical constraints formulated and to finalise, with SLA, the technical layout. In parallel with the consultation workshops, a series of return visits are made to the operational departments of the City of Paris (SLA and CASPE). Recommendations are formulated by the CAUE based on the initial ideas put forward by the children. This collaboration is critical, as around January each year, a two-day project review occurs to discuss the 25 projects slated for the upcoming summer, focusing on technical challenges and assessing the ecological adequacy of the designs.</p><p>Despite this collaborative framework, communication can be challenging due to the diversity of involved services, and some stakeholders, such as maintenance staff, teachers, and local community members, often feel overlooked. The DCPA, along with its decentralized services, has been designated by the City Council to coordinate the greening efforts, leveraging its expertise in asset maintenance. However, the green spaces and environment Department (DEVE) faces staffing shortages that limit its capacity to oversee these projects effectively, as the demand for management of public green spaces continues to grow. Consequently, the decision to have the DCPA oversee the Oasis schoolyards necessitates the development of naturalist knowledge and expertise among all involved services.</p><p>The management of Oasis schoolyards varies across different schools. Typically, the CASPE assumes responsibility for cleaning and maintenance, serving as the primary contact for schools in case of issues. In some instances, teaching staff actively engage pupils in the daily cleaning of the playground. The DEVE may intervene through its decentralized services when necessary. Effective management requires a broad range of expertise, necessitating collaboration between both central and decentralized services, such as CASPE and SLA. However, challenges arise due to insufficient communication and staffing constraints, which hinder the coherence of the project.</p><p>Historically, management issues have been overlooked, though the School Affairs Department (DASCO) is now making efforts to involve DEVE in the management of some schools. Nevertheless, two thirds of the sampled schools remain unclear about whom to contact for support. Additionally, the management of vegetation has not been adequately planned, as school visits indicate that the responsibility for planting cannot fall solely on administrative and teaching staff, who often lack the necessary expertise and face increased workloads. This highlights the critical need to clarify the governance structure for managing Oasis schoolyards, particularly during the operational phase.</p><p>Initially, the Oasis school grounds project did not prioritize extensive greening efforts. However, a significant shift occurred after Parisian teams visited their counterparts in Brussels, where the focus was on \u201cbringing nature back into the city\u201d and reconnecting children with their natural environment (as explained by SERP Public-access facilities department). The Paris team including civil servants from the city hall as well as the CAUE was inspired by the extensive transformations in Brussels that emphasized vegetation while still achieving the goal of creating cool areas. They observed that replacing tarmac with permeable materials not only improved the environment but also proved to be more cost-effective: \u201cif you take away the tarmac and replace it, as we had done, with light, draining ground, it improves things. And if you replace it with earth and vegetation, it works even better. And incidentally, it\u2019s cheaper than the materials.\u201d (SERP). As a result, from 2020 onwards, the project specifications have been revised to give priority to more vegetation than in previous years, placing greater emphasis on biodiversity than originally intended, even if, according to the SERP, this is not necessarily easy. NbS are interesting as long as they are related to anthropocentric considerations. In fact, children\u2019s well-being is a key argument used by the City Council to gain support for the transformations from both departments and school staff. As one Oasis project manager from the CAUE explained: \u2018It shouldn\u2019t just be an environmental response [\u2026] To a certain extent, we did meet the challenges. [\u2026] I think that by talking so broadly about children\u2019s well-being, it was, I don\u2019t know if it was marginal, but in any case, it was a clear-sighted move. And it\u2019s also what enabled us to get the schools on board in a big way. Because, if you like, at the beginning a lot of schools will say: \u201cYes, but it\u2019s a political project\u201d. And we tell them: \u201cNo, in fact, it\u2019s also for the pupils, it\u2019s also for the children, it\u2019s also for the citizens of tomorrow\u201d.</p><p>Despite this progress, challenges remain due to the limited size of Parisian schoolyards, high pupil density, and the need for space for recreational activities. Following the Brussels visit, the DEVE updated the project guidelines to emphasize landscape design and increase vegetation. However, the greening approach often remains largely ornamental, with plant selection primarily focusing on esthetic preferences, such as flower colors and year-round foliage. Additionally, plant choices are restricted to local, non-toxic species sourced from the city\u2019s nursery, which further limits biodiversity potential.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of biodiversity in schoolyards and nearby green spaces</emphasis></p><p>Although vegetation was initially given low priority in the transformation of schoolyards, arthropods inventories reveal these areas support diverse communities, although often at lower levels than neighboring green spaces.</p><p>A total of 7929 individuals (3681 in schoolyards and 4248 in green spaces), attributed to 442 different morphospecies (280 in schoolyards and 345 in green spaces) and representing 16 orders, were collected and identified. Most individuals belonged to the Hemiptera, including aphids, mealybugs and bedbugs, followed by the Diptera, which encompasses flies, midges, and mosquitoes.</p><p>Variability in arthropod abundance was observed across different schoolyards (Fig. 3), with Merlin and Olivier M\u00e9tra nursery schools hosting the highest numbers of individuals, followed by La Br\u00e8che aux Loups primary schools and Guillaume Bud\u00e9 and Courteline secondary schools. The average total arthropod abundance found in schoolyards (230 \u00b1 104 individuals) was statistically no different (Chi\u00b2, \u03c7\u00b2= 0.85, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.36) from that of green spaces (265 \u00b1 138), except for Diptera, whose abundance was significantly higher in green spaces (test post hoc, z.ratio \u221e = \u20136.74, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Abundance of arthropods collected in schools and the nearest green spaces.</emphasis></p><p>Name pairs are made up of the first three letters of the school\u2019s name followed by the first three letters of the name of the nearest green space.

Four schoolyards stand out with the highest levels of morphospecies richness: Charles Hermite landscaped in 2018 (first generation of green schoolyards), (Olivier M\u00e9tra), Bud\u00e9 (second generation, respectively 2021 and 2023) and Courteline (Oasis candidate initiated by the local staff and helped by the City Council).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Number of arthropod morphospecies collected in schoolyards and the nearest green spaces.</emphasis></p><p>Name pairs are made up of the first three letters of the school\u2019s name followed by the first three letters of the name of the nearest green space. Data are ordered by increasing number of arthropods in schools. Source: M\u00e9lanie Gippet.</p><p>On average, schoolyards hosted 44 \u00b1 12 morphospecies, which is significantly lower than the 58 \u00b1 10 morphospecies found in nearby green spaces (Chi\u00b2, \u03c7\u00b2 = 14.07, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001). The disparity in morphospecies richness was particularly pronounced in Diptera, with an average of 25 morphospecies identified in green spaces compared to just 8 in schoolyards (test post hoc), z.ratio \u221e = \u20138.66, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001. At the stratum level, only the herbaceous layer of green spaces shows greater species richness than that of schoolyards (Chi\u00b2, \u03c7\u00b2 = 17.13, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.001).</p><p>Morphospecies richness positively correlated (Chi\u00b2, \u03c7\u00b2 = 20.99, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001) with the area of vegetation within the schoolyards, indicating that larger vegetated areas support greater biodiversity. Additionally, richness was associated with the proportion of vegetation surrounding the schoolyards (Chi\u00b2, \u03c7\u00b2 = 4.5112, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.034), while the distance from a green space showed no significant impact (Chi\u00b2, \u03c7\u00b2 = 1.0721, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.300).</p><p>Community composition varies greatly between school grounds and green spaces, and within each category of site. The arthropod communities present in schools and green spaces differ in their composition by more than 70% (ANOSIM, R = 0.25, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> = 0.001), mainly because of hemipterans of the Aphididae family, leafhoppers of the Eupteryx genus and ants of the Lasius genus, all of which are more common in schoolyards (in planters or on tarmac) and Chironomidae (a family of Diptera), which are more commonly found in the lawn areas of green spaces.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">NbS to reinforce human\u2013nature interactions</emphasis></p><p>Our interviews with teachers and school principals highlighted both a strengthening of the interactions between children and nature, as well as the gradual formation of a broader community interested in biodiversity issues.</p><p>The biodiversity dynamic goes hand in hand with landscaping based on NbS. According to some of the school principals and teachers who have observed the project, this approach profoundly transforms schoolyard spaces and the social interactions within them. The diversity of the landscape and ecology of these redesigned schoolyards promote more prosocial and cooperative play by challenging traditional power dynamics. The schoolyards are widely recognized by our interviewees for reducing conflicts as the fragmented nature of the schoolyards encourages less competition from children for a single space. Children disperse into groups with different activities. Previously, the boys occupied most of the space for ball games, while the girls were often confined to the margins. Creating different areas in the playground helps to reduce gender inequalities in the use of space. On another hand, they also create areas that are less visible to supervisors, making it more difficult to observe and manage conflicts in vegetated areas.</p><p>In addition, the variety of NbS in schoolyards reinforces the diversity of games and behaviors related to nature. Some of our interviews show that creatures, particularly ants and other insects, play a significant role in children\u2019s games. As one school principal observed: \u2018children are often fascinated by ants. I\u2019ve already seen children playing with ant houses in the orchard. Yes, they love it. They\u2019re quite respectful. They don\u2019t crush them or harry them. On the contrary, they make houses and paths !\u2019 These interactions and this wonderment for fauna also apply to plant species, as explained by the school principal in the 11th arrondissement of Paris who described the amazement of children when they dig up potatoes, comparing them to \u201cgold bars.\u201d</p><p>Some members of these communities show a long-term commitment, as the school principal in the 11th arrondissement explained: \u2018I\u2019ve been involved in this project for about 10 years now. I\u2019ve got my notebook with the vegetable garden plan every year, where I write down what we\u2019re going to sow and plant, and then I write down the names of the classes with the children and what they come to do.\u2019 In some schools, parents contribute to the project, for example by donating plants or making a one-time financial contribution. The sustainability of these initiatives and the growth of planted areas heavily rely on the commitment and personal motivation of the adults involved, whose sensitivity to nature and biodiversity issues varies. Some of them even dedicate their free time to maintain the schoolyards, often with significant help from the maintenance staff, who have had to adapt their work routines and for whom the development of these new schoolyards is a big and physically demanding job. As one maintenance worker remarked, \u2018this ground is shit, it doesn\u2019t soak up water and it\u2019s difficult to clean\u2019. However, the motivation to maintain the schoolyards is essential, and unites a diverse group of individuals. For some, this motivation stems from their childhood experiences in natural environments, where they became familiar with nature, through gardening for example. For others, the motivation is linked to their professional background, like the parent we met at Coll\u00e8ge Pierre Alviset, who now runs the school\u2019s gardening workshop. Additionally, many are motivated by seeing the deterioration and neglect of the schoolyard and feel a sense of responsibility to restore it. They feel it is both necessary and their responsibility to teach the importance of protecting nature and the environment, particularly in the current context.</p><p>However, this contribution is inconsistent, as it relies entirely on the goodwill of parents, as explained by a school principal in the 11th arrondissement, whose school has not received support from either the ERDF or the CAUE: \u2018Parents participate indirectly, because we have what are called school cooperatives in the schools [\u2026]. And it works with donations from parents, totally voluntary donations from parents, and with that money we can go on outings, for example, and a small part of that money is used to really keep the vegetable garden going, i.e., to buy potting soil, buy seedlings, seeds, that sort of thing.\u2019</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>How are nature-based solutions (NbS) implemented in schoolyards, and what are their limitations? The implementation of NbS represents an opportunity for the socio-ecological transformation of 73 hectares in a dense and highly mineralized city. However, Oasis schoolyards were initially designed not as natural spaces but as climate shelters aimed at mitigating urban heat island effects through landscaping projects. Biodiversity was considered secondary to this primary objective. The main argument then, as it is now, was children\u2019s well-being rather than environmental concerns. But these two don\u2019t need to be exclusive, as part of the child\u2019s agency is linked to the variety of environments children are able to experience, developing resourcefulness and autonomy, but also the richness of their lived space31. Above all chidren\u2019s well-being is closely related to their contact with nature in cities32. For teachers, NbS in schoolyards challenge traditional pedagogies and boost creativity, changing paradigms and roles.</p><p>After a visit by Paris City officials to Brussels, the design of Oasis schoolyards evolved to incorporate more nature and ensure a better distribution of NbS within schoolyards. Ultimately, departments responsible for green spaces expanded their role, and services such as CASPE now listen to schools\u2019 requests regarding courtyard management. Today, most schoolyards are planted with local species, using vegetation as a tool for temperature regulation. However, fauna has largely been overlooked by the designers of these Parisian schoolyards (including CAUE and other contractors operating within the framework agreement).</p><p>Thus, a better integration of NbS in schoolyards requires greater awareness of ecological processes and nature-related challenges. Not only do city officials lack knowledge and imagination regarding NbS as a cultural development tool, but so do teachers and students. They also lack insight into how such development could foster more child-friendly cities, improving children\u2019s life opportunities (rights in the city) and promoting their active involvement in urban development (rights to the city)33. The co-design and maintenance phases must be reinforced by involving school staff, pupils, and parents, which also requires better coordination among the city\u2019s decentralized services. As a landscape architect from the Paris Council explained, the more the school community is involved, the better the outcomes. Engaging children also means fostering discussions among pupils and encouraging collaboration among teachers, creating a ripple effect of participation.</p><p>Finally, the public use of schoolyards needs to be reconsidered so that these green, cool spaces can serve as refuges for Parisians during heatwaves. At the same time, they could become learning spaces for fostering human-nature relationships.</p><p>What is the ecological contribution of renaturing schoolyards? Biodiversity levels vary significantly between sites due to several factors. Since schoolyards often consist of small, fragmented planters or perennials beds, the richness of herbaceous species in school grounds is statistically lower than in larger green spaces. This difference may be attributed to the quality of the herbaceous layer: green spaces typically contain large extensive patches of flowering plants and extensive grass areas, sometimes left to rest. In contrast, grassy areas in schoolyards are often unprotected and subject to trampling, which puts pressure on colonizing species and may contribute to the observed lower species richness.</p><p>Despite the limited resources available in schoolyards, the comparable arthropod abundance levels between schools and green spaces confirms the ecological habitat function of schoolyards. Arthropod abundance in schoolyards could be explained by the absence or scarcity of predators34. The lower species richness observed in schoolyards compared to green spaces is expected, given that green spaces generally have larger, older, and more diverse plant populations. Since vegetation takes time to grow, it is reasonable to assume that biodiversity in schoolyards will increase over time.</p><p>The differentiation between arthropod communities in schools and green spaces raises further questions, and continued monitoring will be necessary in the coming years. This differentiation may be due to species turnover, a common phenomenon in urban environments35. This suggests that the differences in species composition between schoolyards and green spaces result from species substitution, rather than species loss, meaning that schoolyards do not simply contain a subset of the species found in green spaces, but rather different species altogether. Consequently, the hypothesis that schoolyards function as relay habitats (stepping-stones) between green spaces cannot be confirmed, as the arthropod communities in schoolyards do not appear to be subsets of those in green spaces.</p><p>These differences in community composition may be due to variations in plant composition between schools and green spaces36. Parisian green spaces often feature non-native exogenous ornamental species, except in cemeteries and the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes, whereas schoolyards are primarily planted with local species. This leads to differences in the arthropod species they attract. As explained by the manager of the DEVE, one of the major goals of Paris\u2019s 2018\u20132024 Biodiversity Plan (which will be extended in the upcoming 2024\u20132030 plan) is to plant or allow to grow 50% regional plant species in all new green space projects. The creation of Oasis schoolyards aligns with this Paris Council initiative.</p><p>Species abundance and richness are influenced to multiple factors, including the size of the vegetated area in the school grounds, the plant species, the design and planting of the vegetation, and the care provided by both the asset management team and the teachers and children. In short, enhancing biodiversity requires a broader focus on the production of urban spaces, especially the creation of natural areas within cities.</p><p>How do schoolyards function as privileged places for human\u2013nature interactions? Our results indicate that in some schools, a community actively engaged with the planted schoolyards. This interest in NbS depends on the sensitivities and education of staff members, as well as on their willingness to adapt their professional practices - whether they are school janitors, teachers or technical staff. The presence of nature in schoolyards could thus play an increasingly significant role in children\u2019s education and shaping their environmental attitudes37,38. New teaching and vocational practices, such as outdoor classes, should be widely deployed rather than the exception39. Additionally, more tools should be developed to enhance the connection with nature in schoolyards for all members of the school community. Observing interactions between children and insects, among other factors, highlights the importance of research focused on children\u2019s relationships with living organisms now present in school grounds due to renaturing efforts. This approach is supported by the work of the Common Worlds collective and multispecies ethnographic approaches40, 41\u201342. These are the elements that children, teachers, and parents are invited to engage with.</p><p>However, after 150 years of asphalt, managing natural soil is a challenge, according to the landscape designer of the city hall. Nevertheless, the envisioned transformation of teaching practices integrates pupils\u2019 engagement with nature as a tool for learning and fostering responsibility toward the environment. The aim is to develop pedagogical practices that move beyond a purely utilitarian view of the schoolyard and see the maintenance of schoolyard nature as part of cultivating a shared living environment43. This approach promotes education that is not only based on a rational understanding of nature but also on experiential learning as a situated practice41. The goal of developing such a practice is also to give more space for children\u2019s agentivity42. To encourage commitment and help stakeholders take ownership of the greened schoolyards, associations are involved in sharing naturalist knowledge and assisting staff members and pupils in making these spaces their own. This learning and appropriation process is long and resource-intensive, requiring both time and personnel. It also heavily depends on the involvement of school principals, who guide their teams in this direction. The leadership style has a strong and significant role in adopting change44.</p><p>However, several factors limit this community\u2019s investment in embracing biodiversity areas. Within schools, staff members (both teachers and extracurricular staff) assess the potential risks associated with creating Oasis schoolyards. They are concerned that children might get pricked or scratched by vegetation or fall on uneven ground. Additionally, the division of the grounds into different compartments with various play areas and plants raises concerns about children hiding or being out of sight. Any risk must be eliminated from the school premises while the child is under the responsibility of school staff. In our view, such behavior prevents the very learning of risk.</p><p>Furthermore, the broader community\u2019s engagement with Oasis schoolyards is hindered by the closed nature of schools. While the Oasis program does allow certain schoolyards to be opened to local residents\u2014particularly during heatwaves to address the shortage of green spaces\u2014this openness is often seen as a safety risk, with concerns about letting unsuitable individuals into the school premises. As a result, in some neighborhoods, the idea of opening schoolyards to the public as part of the renaturing project is seen as unrealistic even if it\u2019s out of schooltime.</p><p>Moreover, changing established routines, both professional and personal, poses challenges at many levels, amongst them, technical and individual44. Promoting free play requires offering elements that do not have obvious play functions, encouraging children to use their imagination. Vegetation should be seen as a resource that helps define zones, create different spaces, and guide movement, rather than simply taking up space in the schoolyard. However, these goals can sometimes conflict with teachers\u2019 safety concerns. For instance, how much contact with planted areas should children be allowed? How can shelters be created while ensuring proper supervision of pupils? To conclude while building committed communities in the maintenance of NbS is important, there is currently no socio-economic or political framework to fully support their development. The role of committed citizen or responsible resident needs further exploration, even though it can be difficult to engage communities of parents or local residents, particularly in working-class neighborhoods45. However, parents often express a strong interest in getting involved, suggesting that successful collaborations can emerge when school staff remain flexible and open to various constraints46. Scaling up Nature-based Solutions (NbS) requires the active commitment of various community stakeholders\u2014not just the public sector. Therefore, it is essential to strengthen support for collective engagement programs through funding and sustained commitment. To ensure justice in schoolyard NbS, it is important to examine governance structures and power dynamics in participatory design and long-term management. This also involves evaluating the benefits these solutions bring to children and school staff. Interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research is necessary to better understand how different aspects of NbS contribute to inclusive and equitable schoolyard design.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study areas</emphasis></p><p>In 2018, the City of Paris initiated an ambitious project aimed at desealing and greening the grounds of all 650 schools by 2050, covering approximately 73 hectares, or 0.7% of the city\u2019s surface (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-cours-oasis-7389\">https://www.paris.fr/pages/les-cours-oasis-7389</url>). The goal is to transform the schoolyards of Parisian nursery, primary, and secondary schools into \u2018oases,\u2019 creating local \u2018cool islands\u2019 to help mitigate urban heat. This initiative is a key component of the city\u2019s Resilience Strategy, which is based on the international network of Resilient Cities (established by the Rockefeller Foundation), of which Paris has been a member since 2015.</p><p>Although the project was initiated by the City of Paris, the support available to schools varies. Some schools have received financial aid from European funds (European Regional Development Fund, ERDF) and/or guidance from the local Paris City Council services, including the Architecture, Urbanism and Environment Council (CAUE). This support has supposedly enabled the organization of co-design and co-construct workshops with school staff and pupils prior to the transformations, involving classroom visits to gather input and ideas about redesigning the schoolyards. In contrast, other schools have not benefited from such financial or technical assistance.</p><p>Regardless of the level of support, the nature of schoolyard transformations has evolved since the project\u2019s inception. Initially, the focus was primarily on replacing impermeable asphalt with permeable surfaces (Fig. 5, left).Fig. 5</p><p>Schoolyards converted in 2019 (Amiral Roussin nursery school, 15th arrondissement) and 2020 (K\u00fcss nursery school, 13th arrondissement). Source: Tha\u00efs Andro.</p><p>Vegetation was minimal, often limited to fenced-off areas at the edges of the playground. However, from 2020 onward, the approach became more holistic, incorporating natural materials like wood, sand, and wood chips, introducing diverse landscaping features, and integrating vegetation directly into play areas, making it accessible to pupils (Fig. 5, right).</p><p>As part of this research, we selected 16 schoolyards (Fig. 6) using several criteria to ensure a diverse range of profiles: type of support received (ERDF + CAUE, CAUE only, or none), neighborhood income levels (high/medium/low), proximity to public green spaces, and the year of the schoolyard conversion.Fig. 6</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Location of the 16 schools studied and their nearest public green space in Paris, France.</emphasis></p><p>EM nursery school, EE junior school, EP primary school, COL secondary school. Source: M\u00e9lanie Gippet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualitative methods</emphasis></p><p>To investigate the Oasis school project, we conducted 21 private semi-structured interviews with key stakeholders. These included 16 project coordinators at the city or neighborhood level, and 5 local school staff members (teachers, headmasters, and maintenance personnel). This qualitative research was supplemented by a review of institutional documents related to schoolyard design by the CAUE, the history of the Oasis project, and municipal governance frameworks such as the Climate Plan, Biodiversity Plan, Circular Economy Plan, and Resilience Strategy, particularly in terms of their integration of the Oasis initiative. In addition, we held two group discussions with the interviewees (one with ten persons in 2023 and another one involving four workshops with 24 attendees from the various departments in 2024) to explore their perspectives on the changes brought about by the Oasis project, relatively to two main questions: how to develop the pedagogical use of schoolyards? What kind of maintenance and management should be adopted? The synthesis of the discussion was presented to the administrative heads of Paris, and discussed with school staff in order to better the engagement. We also conducted on site observations in schoolyards alongside headteachers and teachers to examine usages of the schoolyards by the children.</p><p>The goal was to not only capture the views of institutional actors but also incorporate the experiences of end users involved in the co-design process, such as school staff and children. The aim here is to understand the place and role of these stakeholders in the greening project, the network of stakeholders they work with, and their position on the place of biodiversity in greening. The interview guide was structured around five key analytical points:</p><p>Professional background and role in the Oasis project: Questions explored interviewees\u2019 professional backgrounds, the nature of their daily tasks and their specific roles within the Oasis project. This aimed to contextualize their involvement, identify their contributions to the Oasis project, and outlining their tasks, objectives, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.</p><p>Project management and network of stakeholders: This theme focused on how the project was managed and coordinated across various teams and stakeholders. We explored how information flowed between partners, and the nature of collaboration with contractors and schools. Key questions examined the processes for managing schoolyard transformations, including follow-up actions and monitoring systems.</p><p>Funding and decision-making processes: This section explored how the transformation projects were selected and funded, examining the role of participatory budgeting or other funding mechanisms. Questions also covered criteria for selecting schoolyards, tracking the success of interventions, and how funding was managed for unforeseen revisions or additional work.</p><p>Environmental impact and educational integration: This theme examined the environmental and social aspects of the Oasis project, focusing on its contribution to urban resilience and ecological transitions. It addressed the selection and management of vegetation, including the criteria for choosing plant species based on factors such as resilience, maintenance, and environmental impact. Interviewees reflected on the integration of the project into educational programs and how the newly created green spaces have changed the usage of schoolyards.</p><p>Integration into resilience strategy: This final theme examined the project\u2019s alignment with broader urban strategies, and its contribution to the city\u2019s resilience objectives.</p><p>All interviews were conducted in French, recorded and fully transcribed. A content analysis was carried out, using an analysis grid to divide the interviews into sections reflecting our main questions. As a research method, qualitative content analysis represents a systematic and objective means of describing and quantifying phenomena. The trustworthiness of our results is based on the fact that the inquiry\u2019s findings are \u201cworth paying attention to\u201d. It\u2019s also based on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">credibility</emphasis> (e.g. the accuracy of interviewees description), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">dependability</emphasis> (e.g. the stability of data), <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">conformability</emphasis> (e.g. the congruence between the interviewees), and transferability (e.g. the potential for extrapolation)47. Our results were discussed with the interviewees themselves and presented in front of city\u2019s services, headmasters, teachers and maintenance staff. Focus group were organized in order to work on sensitive matters, such as the role of different stakeholders in the management of green schoolyards. The interviews\u2019 excerpts used in the quotations have been translated into English for this paper after consent forms have been signed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Arthropods as indicators of urban biodiversity</emphasis></p><p>To assess biodiversity in schoolyards, we focus on arthropods, which are widely recognized as effective indicators of habitat quality, pollution levels, and land-use practices48, 49\u201350. Their short generation times make their populations particularly responsive to environmental changes, allowing for rapid detection of ecological shifts51. Furthermore, engaging with arthropods in educational settings fosters pupils\u2019 understanding of ecological interconnections. By observing behaviors like bees pollinating or small mammals dispersing seeds, children can develop a direct appreciation for the ecological services these species provide, fostering empathy and respect for all living organisms32,52,53.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Arthropod inventories and analysis</emphasis></p><p>To investigate the role of vegetated schoolyards as habitats and stepping-stones for arthropod communities, we conducted inventories in 16 schools and their nearest green spaces (Fig. 6). We compared arthropod abundance and richness between these sites, assessing each vegetation stratum (herbaceous, shrub, tree) individually and in combination. Environmental parameters, such as the surface area and plant diversity, the area of tree canopy within 100, 200, and 1000 meters, and the distance from the nearest green space, were quantified for each site using field observations and GIS data (Open Paris Data). Buffers of 100 m and 1000 m were chosen based on evidence that arthropod communities respond to habitat features at these scales54, and 200 meters corresponds to the average distance between schools and their nearby green spaces in our study.</p><p>Data collection occurred once per site from mid-May to mid-June 2023, under favorable weather conditions (temperature above 10\u00b0C, no rain, low wind). Where possible, paired sites (school and green space) were sampled on the same day to minimize variability. The non-invasive sampling protocol targeted three vegetation strata, with three replicates per stratum. Sampling locations were selected to ensure representativeness based on access to vegetation and foliage density. For the herbaceous stratum, a sweep net was used, while a beating tray was employed for the shrub and tree strata. After collection, each arthropod was photographed, taxonomically identified to the order level, and released on site. Photographs were then analysed to assign each individual to a morpho-species, based on key morphological traits like size, color, and body patterns55. This photographic approach is a common method in invertebrate biodiversity research56 and is used in the French national protocol for monitoring pollinators57.</p><p>Arthropod diversity was analysed at both alpha (within-site) and beta (between-site) scales using the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vegan</emphasis>58 and the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">betapart</emphasis> package59 from R software (version 4.1.2 R Core Team 2021). The threshold of statistical significance was considered to be \u03b1 = 0.05. Beta diversity was calculated with Sorensen\u2019s index of dissimilarity applied to species occurrence matrices60. To test the influence of environmental factors on arthropod diversity, generalized linear models (GLMs) with negative binomial distributions were applied. The variation in community composition between schools and green spaces was visualised using non-metric multidimensional positioning (NMDS, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vegan</emphasis> package). A similarity analysis (ANOSIM) was then used to statistically compare the species composition of school and green-space communities. Finally, a SIMPER analysis was carried out to calculate the average dissimilarity of communities between schools and green spaces, but above all to identify the species that weigh most in this dissimilarity. The values of the Sorensen index and its components (beta diversity) were compared with a Chi\u00b2 test.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work builds on the COOLSCHOOLS project (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.coolschools.eu\">www.coolschools.eu</url>) and has received funding from the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation program under grant agreement No. 101003758, the Spanish Research Agency (AEI), Innoviris (Brussels Capital Region), the Dutch Research Council (NWO), The Research Foundation\u2014Flanders (FWO), and France\u2019s Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR).

This article offers an innovative framework - the Adaptive Multifutures Framework (AMF) - that bridges implementation gaps through four interconnected components: participatory visioning, scenario planning, fractal design, and immersive visualization, aiming to transform how cities design and implement NBS.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As urban populations increase and climate change intensifies, cities worldwide face unprecedented challenges in ensuring resilience, sustainability, and quality of life for their inhabitants. The complex web of urban issues, from mitigating climate impacts to conserving biodiversity and enhancing human well-being, demands innovative and holistic solutions1,2. In this context, Nature-Based Solutions (NBS) have emerged as a promising paradigm to address these multifaceted urban challenges3,4.</p><p>NBS are defined as \u201cactions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously providing human well-being and biodiversity benefits\u201d5. This approach offers a way to tackle multiple urban issues concurrently, yielding environmental, social, and economic benefits6. From urban forests mitigating heat island effects to constructed wetlands managing stormwater and enhancing biodiversity, NBS have demonstrated potential to transform urban landscapes and improve city dwellers\u2019 quality of life7.</p><p>However, despite growing enthusiasm and increasing implementation, the effectiveness of NBS often falls short of expectations8. Several key factors contribute to this gap between potential and reality:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Short-sighted planning:</emphasis> Many NBS projects are designed as one-off interventions, failing to consider long-term impacts or how they fit into the broader urban ecosystem9.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limited stakeholder engagement:</emphasis> Top-down approaches often dominate, with experts and officials implementing solutions without meaningful input from local communities, resulting in projects that fail to resonate with or meet the needs of residents6.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oversimplification of urban complexity:</emphasis> Cities are intricate systems with countless interconnected parts, and many NBS projects fail to account for this complexity, leading to unintended consequences or missed opportunities10.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rigid visions of the future</emphasis>: Urban planners and policymakers often work with a single, inflexible vision of the future, an approach that can lead to solutions that quickly become obsolete in our rapidly changing world11.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Siloed expertise:</emphasis> NBS projects often lack truly interdisciplinary teams, resulting in solutions that fail to fully integrate ecological, social, and technological considerations3,9.</p><p>These limitations reflect a broader challenge in environmental management: the disconnect between scientific approaches and local ways of knowing and interacting with nature12. This disconnect is particularly pronounced in urban areas, where diverse communities, each with their own relationship to the environment, coexist. Several frameworks have been proposed to enhance urban NBS. For example, Raymond et al.6 introduced a framework for assessing and implementing the co-benefits of NBS, Barker et al.13 explored the potential of strategic planning in implementing NBS, and the European Union has developed a roadmap emphasizing collaborative and scenario-based planning14. However, many of these approaches tend to focus on individual components. Recognizing both their innovative potential and their inherent challenges\u2014such as the complexity of urban systems and resource requirements\u2014the present work adopts a critical perspective that underlines the need for an integrated strategy.</p><p>Several participatory and adaptive governance frameworks have sought to address the challenges in NBS planning. Adaptive co-management15 emphasizes iterative decision-making based on stakeholder input, while transition management16 applies long-term visioning and experimentation in urban sustainability contexts. Additionally, urban living labs17 have been employed to pilot nature-based interventions with active citizen participation. However, these approaches often focus on either stakeholder engagement or future scenario development in isolation, lacking a mechanism to integrate visioning, design, and evaluation into one iterative process.</p><p>In response to these limitations, the Adaptive Multifutures Framework (AMF) is introduced as a cohesive, iterative process that unifies <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">participatory visioning</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">scenario planning</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fractal design</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">immersive visualization</emphasis>. By merging these components, the AMF not only bridges known implementation gaps but also provides a realistic assessment of the challenges associated with urban sustainability. The framework represents an integrated approach to conceptualize, design, and implement NBS. It embraces uncertainty, complexity, and diverse knowledge systems to pave the way for more effective, resilient, and socially just urban solutions18.</p><p>As cities worldwide seek innovative approaches to address pressing environmental and social challenges, the AMF offers a timely and thought-provoking framework for reimagining urban futures in harmony with nature. By offering a framework that considers complexity, fosters genuine participation, and plans for multiple futures, the AMF contributes to transforming urban planning practices and NBS implementation, leading to more resilient, sustainable, and equitable cities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Adaptive Multifutures Framework: Bridging Gaps in Urban NBS Implementation</emphasis></p><p>The AMF emerges as a response to the growing recognition of limitations in current NBS implementation. As urban environments face increasingly complex and interconnected challenges, the need for a more holistic, adaptive, and inclusive approach to NBS has become evident9. The components of the AMF are illustrated in Fig. 1, which shows the interplay between participatory visioning, scenario planning, fractal design, and immersive visualization. Each component is interconnected and supports the others to create a holistic approach to urban planning and NBS implementation.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Illustration of the adaptive multifutures framework, highlighting the interplay between participatory visioning, scenario planning, fractal design, and immersive visualization.</emphasis></p><p>Iterative monitoring and multidimensional evaluation form a continuous layer across all components, embedding ecological, social, technical, and stakeholder-derived feedback into every cycle of the framework.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Participatory visioning: beyond technical expertise</emphasis></p><p>At the heart of the AMF lies the recognition that effective NBS require more than just technical expertise; they demand an understanding of local contexts, values, and potential future scenarios. Frantzeskaki et al.7 highlighted the importance of co-creation in NBS, noting that projects often fail when they don\u2019t align with local needs and values. The AMF\u2019s Participatory Visioning component directly addresses this gap by creating a collaborative space where diverse stakeholders \u2014including local residents, policymakers, scientists, and Indigenous knowledge holders\u2014can articulate their future aspirations for the urban environment. This process goes beyond traditional consultation, fostering stakeholder engagement and a sense of ownership and ensuring that NBS are grounded in local realities19. Stakeholders are systematically identified through structured mapping methods20, such as stakeholder analysis and empathy mapping21, to ensure comprehensive representation of diverse groups. Recognizing that stakeholder engagement alone does not guarantee equitable influence, the AMF explicitly addresses power imbalances through facilitated dialogue and structured deliberation techniques (e.g. adaptive facilitation22). These include facilitation methods designed to amplify marginalized voices and ensure that their inputs meaningfully shape outcomes. Through this inclusive approach, collective intelligence emerges, pooling stakeholders\u2019 knowledge and insights to co-create visions that are contextually appropriate and resilient to dynamic urban challenges. Participants co-define evaluation criteria at the outset, ensuring that monitoring metrics reflect both expert-defined parameters and community values.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scenario planning: embracing uncertainty</emphasis></p><p>Understanding current needs is not enough in our rapidly changing world. Albert et al.18 emphasized the importance of considering long-term dynamics and uncertainties in NBS planning. The AMF\u2019s Scenario Planning component responds to this challenge by exploring multiple alternative futures, enhancing the adaptability and resilience of NBS to uncertain future conditions projections23. The transition from deterministic to uncertainty-based planning represents a fundamental paradigm shift in urban planning practice. Traditional deterministic approaches, which rely on single-point forecasts and linear projections, often fail to capture the complex dynamics of urban systems. This limitation becomes particularly acute when planning NBS, where the interconnected nature of social-ecological systems demands more sophisticated approaches to uncertainty. By considering various social, economic, and environmental trends, the AMF ensures that NBS strategies remain robust across different scenarios. This approach represents an advancement over traditional planning methods, as it explicitly acknowledges and plans for the deep uncertainty inherent in urban social-ecological systems. Through this process, adaptive pathways are developed, allowing for flexible strategies that can be adjusted as conditions change13. Uncertainty management is thus embedded into the planning process, ensuring that NBS remain effective under a range of potential future conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fractal design: coherence across scales</emphasis></p><p>The AMF addresses a critical gap identified by Pauleit et al.24: the tendency for NBS to be implemented as isolated interventions rather than as part of a cohesive urban strategy. The Fractal Design component of the AMF ensures that NBS are coherent and mutually reinforcing across different urban scales. Fractal design, originally derived from mathematical and natural systems, is characterized by self-similarity and scalability\u2014principles that have been applied in urban planning to create environments where similar patterns recur at various scales25,26. This approach enables the translation of broad, strategic NBS scenarios into tangible, site-specific measures. This multi-scale approach, inspired by the work of Salingaros27 on the fractal nature of cities, enhances the systemic impact of NBS and improves their integration into the existing urban fabric. By designing NBS as part of a nested, interconnected system, fractal principles create coherent design outcomes where interventions at one scale (e.g., neighborhood parks) align with broader strategies (e.g., citywide green corridors). At the micro-scale, localized measures such as green roofs or community gardens are developed to reflect the overarching ecological goals, while at the meso- and macro-scales, these measures integrate into district-level and citywide networks, respectively. This ensures that the strategic intent\u2014whether in terms of flood mitigation, biodiversity enhancement, or social cohesion\u2014is maintained uniformly across scales. This approach fosters layered ecosystems, where ecological, social, and infrastructural systems overlap to form complex, resilient urban environments. For example, a green roof on a building might connect to a district-scale rainwater management network, which in turn feeds into a citywide strategy for climate resilience. This systemic thinking ensures that NBS not only address immediate challenges but also contribute to long-term ecological integrity and biodiversity enhancement. This nested, multi-scale perspective aligns with social-ecological-technical systems thinking28,29.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Immersive visualization: bridging understanding</emphasis></p><p>Stakeholder engagement has long been recognized as crucial for successful NBS implementation6. However, traditional methods often struggle to convey the complex, long-term impacts of NBS effectively. The AMF\u2019s Immersive Visualization component leverages advanced technologies to bridge this gap, allowing stakeholders to interactively explore and engage with the proposed NBS tangibly30. Building on the work of Lovett et al.31, this approach facilitates sensory experiences\u2014such as virtual reality simulations or augmented reality overlays\u2014that deepen stakeholders\u2019 understanding of NBS proposals and their potential impacts. This component could further use multiple sub-techniques, including 3D simulations, haptic feedback, and multisensory soundscapes, to transform abstract concepts into tangible experiences. By enabling stakeholders to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u201cwalk through\u201d</emphasis> future green spaces or visualize flood mitigation strategies in action, immersive visualization encourages more meaningful feedback and participation throughout the planning process30,32. The connection from immersive visualization back to participatory visioning is intended to depict a critical feedback loop. After stakeholders engage with the visualized scenarios, the insights and emotional responses gathered from this immersive experience inform a subsequent cycle of participatory visioning. In other words, immersive visualization is not an end point but rather a catalyst for renewed visioning exercises, which in turn drive the evolution of future scenarios. This iterative loop ensures that the framework remains responsive and adaptive over time, continually refining urban NBS proposals based on real-world feedback.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Synergistic Integration</emphasis></p><p>What sets the AMF apart is not just these individual components, but how they work together synergistically to address the multifaceted challenges of urban NBS implementation. For instance, the insights gained from Participatory Visioning inform the development of scenarios, ensuring that future projections are grounded in local realities and aspirations. These scenarios, in turn, guide the Fractal Design process, ensuring that NBS are resilient and effective across multiple possible futures. Immersive Visualization then brings these plans to life, facilitating iterative refinement based on stakeholder feedback. Moreover, to overcome potential digital divides and ensure accessibility, alternative engagement modes\u2014such as community workshops, accessible mobile applications, and physical models\u2014can be implemented in parallel with immersive visualization. This multi-modal approach guarantees that stakeholders with limited digital access or technical proficiency are not excluded. It promotes inclusivity by engaging historically underrepresented groups in urban planning processes. By ensuring that the voices of marginalized communities are heard, the AMF envisions a more equitable distribution of environmental benefits, such as improved air quality, green spaces, and resilience to climate change. This focus on equity is crucial for addressing systemic inequalities in urban development, where low-income or vulnerable populations often face greater environmental risks and fewer opportunities for participation in decision-making.</p><p>This integrated approach allows the AMF to address multiple limitations of conventional NBS implementation simultaneously, as outlined in Table 1. While traditional approaches often struggle with top-down planning, limited stakeholder engagement, and rigid designs9, the AMF offers a more flexible, inclusive, and adaptive framework. Moreover, the AMF responds to the call for greater integration of diverse knowledge systems in NBS design12. By combining scientific expertise with local and traditional ecological knowledge throughout the process, the AMF enriches NBS designs and improves their cultural appropriateness and effectiveness.Table 1</p><p>Comparison of Conventional NBS Approaches and the Adaptive Multifutures Framework</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\"

typeStyle=\"bf\">Innovations and implementation challenges</emphasis></p><p>The AMF provides a structured approach to addressing the complex challenges facing cities worldwide. The emphasis on fractal design principles brings a novel perspective to urban ecology. Recognizing cities as nested systems operating at multiple scales, the framework facilitates the creation of coherent ecological networks. This approach ensures that individual NBS interventions, from pocket parks to green roofs, connect to form larger ecological corridors and habitats, resulting in more resilient urban ecosystems that support biodiversity while enhancing residents\u2019 quality of life.</p><p>Implementing the AMF, however, requires enhanced interdisciplinary collaboration and a willingness among urban planners, policymakers, and community leaders to embrace innovative, adaptive approaches. The framework\u2019s emphasis on participatory processes and long-term visioning challenges traditional, often hierarchical, decision-making practices prevalent in urban planning. Overcoming institutional inertia necessitates sustained efforts, including capacity building, advocacy, and the creation of supportive policy environments that foster innovation and experimentation7.</p><p>A core component of the AMF is the development of \u201ccommunities of co-creation\u201d19. These diverse stakeholder networks, encompassing local residents, policymakers, scientists, Indigenous knowledge holders, and representatives from various urban sectors, are essential for genuinely inclusive participatory visioning and scenario planning processes33. While resource-intensive, these networks are crucial for creating well-rounded, context-specific NBS solutions that draw upon a wide array of knowledge systems. The scenario planning aspect of the AMF encourages urban planners to embrace uncertainty, an approach that can be uncomfortable for those accustomed to more deterministic methods. As Zegras et al.23 suggest, skilled facilitation and planning are crucial to navigating conflicting visions among stakeholders and finding common ground, thereby enhancing the resilience of NBS strategies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Adaptive capacity and iterative learning</emphasis></p><p>Iterative monitoring and multidimensional evaluation are integral to the framework, operating continuously across Participatory Visioning, Scenario Planning, Fractal Design, and Immersive Visualization. This embedded feedback layer ensures ecological, social, and technical performance data, alongside stakeholder insights are systematically assessed and inform revisions in each subsequent cycle. Each planning, implementation, and evaluation cycle feeds into the next, ensuring that the framework remains responsive to evolving urban conditions. In practice, this means that as new data, stakeholder feedback, and external factors\u2014such as policy shifts or climate impacts\u2014emerge, the initial scenarios and designs are revisited and refined. For example, updated climate projections may prompt a re-evaluation of flood mitigation strategies, while insights from immersive visualization sessions could lead to renewed participatory visioning exercises.</p><p>Another essential feature of the AMF is its emphasis on multidimensional evaluation, ensuring that implemented NBS are assessed through social, cultural, ecological, and economic lenses. While many existing evaluation frameworks prioritize quantitative environmental metrics such as carbon sequestration or water retention9, the AMF advocates for a participatory selection of evaluation indicators at the start of the planning process. This ensures that the criteria for success align with stakeholder priorities and contextual needs. To address trade-offs between different objectives\u2014such as biodiversity conservation versus social accessibility\u2014structured decision-making tools such as Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA)34 can be used to balance competing priorities transparently. Beyond MCDA, facilitated negotiation techniques and participatory trade-off exercises (e.g., scenario mapping and adaptive preference elicitation) are employed to surface latent priorities and mediate value conflicts. Uncertainty itself is treated as an explicit design parameter rather than a limitation, reinforcing procedural fairness, transparency, and legitimacy even when full consensus is not reached. Furthermore, evaluation within the AMF is not conducted solely by technical experts but involves a diverse group of stakeholders, including local communities, policymakers, and environmental practitioners, ensuring that outcomes reflect collective priorities. By integrating iterative monitoring, the framework allows continuous refinement of NBS strategies, enabling adjustments based on real-world performance rather than relying on static assessment models.</p><p>This continuous feedback loop, as illustrated in Fig. 1, embodies principles of adaptive management, a well-established concept in urban sustainability and resilience planning. By incorporating iterative learning and flexibility, the AMF not only anticipates uncertainty but actively adapts to it, thereby enhancing the long-term effectiveness of NBS interventions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Integrating design principles and ensuring technological inclusivity</emphasis></p><p>The AMF\u2019s use of fractal design principles demands high-level collaboration between urban designers, ecologists, and engineers. This interdisciplinary approach is vital to create coherent urban ecosystems that function effectively across scales27. It requires new forms of interdisciplinary training and cooperation, fostering a shared language among professionals from traditionally siloed fields.</p><p>While immersive visualization technologies are powerful tools for enhancing stakeholder engagement, there\u2019s a risk of creating a digital divide if not made accessible to all community members30,31. To ensure inclusivity, it\u2019s crucial to provide alternative modes of engagement, such as physical models and community workshops, allowing all stakeholders to participate meaningfully in the planning process regardless of their technological literacy or access.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Long-term commitment and transformative potential</emphasis></p><p>Securing long-term commitment and resources for AMF-driven projects remains a significant challenge. The framework\u2019s emphasis on adaptive management may conflict with short-term political cycles and funding mechanisms that prioritize immediate results. Developing mechanisms for sustained financial and institutional support, such as public-private partnerships and community-led stewardship programs, is crucial for maintaining momentum and achieving the intended outcomes of NBS projects.</p><p>Despite these challenges, the AMF represents a structured yet flexible approach with great potential for fostering transformative change in urban environments. By addressing the inherent complexities of urban systems and embracing diverse knowledge and perspectives, the AMF has the potential to reimagine urban planning and NBS implementation.</p><p>Piloting the AMF in diverse urban contexts will be critical to refine the framework, adapt it to local conditions, and develop best practices for broader implementation. This approach paves the way for the development of more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable cities, where environmental, social, and economic goals are pursued in an integrated manner, moving us closer to the vision of truly regenerative urban ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion: the AMF as a catalyst for urban transformation</emphasis></p><p>As we stand at the crossroads of multiple global crises, the AMF offers more than just a planning tool; it presents a new paradigm for urban development. The framework\u2019s emphasis on stakeholder engagement recognizes that urban sustainability efforts cannot succeed without including diverse voices. By incorporating participatory processes, the AMF ensures that local and traditional ecological knowledge contributes to shaping urban futures. This approach helps in creating NBS that are not only ecologically effective but also socially just and culturally relevant, ultimately enhancing community ownership and long-term sustainability.</p><p>Despite the challenges of implementation, including resource requirements and potential clashes with existing governance structures, the AMF provides a powerful framework for turning urban challenges into opportunities for transformative change. It is a catalyst for reimagining how cities can function as resilient ecosystems that balance human needs with ecological integrity.</p><p>As we move forward, the task is to translate this framework into action. Pilot studies across diverse urban contexts will be crucial for refining the AMF and developing best practices that can be scaled. This will require not only technical innovation but also changes in governance, policy, and public engagement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"refCR1\"/><link><marker>[1].</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"referenceCR1\"/></link>McDonald, RI.

This study introduces the concept of NBS temporal effectiveness, defined as the ability of NBS to provide co-benefits over short, medium, and long terms with varying intensities, as perceived by urban residents. Specifically, we investigated the potential conflicts in the temporal effectiveness in Trento, Italy, through a public participation GIS (PPGIS) approach (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 286). Our findings reveal that the intensity and directionality of conflict change across short, medium and long-term NBS, respondent groups, and the spatial context of implementation. Contrary to the common perception that immediate solutions are always preferred, NBS with long-term effectiveness can gain significant public support, particularly when they demonstrate greater benefits than short-term alternatives. This study contributes to the NBS literature by being the first to explore the concept of temporal effectiveness and its implications for public preferences, demonstrating that considerations regarding temporalities must be made when planning NBS interventions, as conflicts may arise in relation to interventions with different temporal effectiveness.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>In the urban context, nature-based solutions (NBS) have gained increasing attention due to their potential to address societal challenges and enhance resilience against climate change1, 2\u20133. NBS can provide a range of different benefits, depending on the type and scale of the intervention, and the characteristics of the local context4,5.</p><p>NBS effectiveness is assessed through qualitative and quantitative indicators, which can be categorized as follows: environmental indicators, such as the tones of carbon stored or the percentage increase in species diversity; human health and well-being indicators, such as the reduction in mortality rates due to air pollution; citizen participation indicators, such as the proportion of citizens actively involved in implementing green projects; and transferability indicators, which measure aspects related to the transfer and monitoring of projects6. The selection of indicators to evaluate NBS effectiveness depends on the goal and type of intervention, as well as the geographical and temporal scale7. Indeed, NBS are living and dynamic systems, and the ecosystem services (ES) they provide \u2014i.e. the direct and indirect benefits that ecosystems provide to human well-being\u2014 can change over time8,9. Factors such as the type of ecosystem used, the vegetation composition and growth time10, and the location influence NBS implementation and the socio-ecological processes they support11,12. The interaction between these factors and external attributes\u2014including biodiversity, local climate, topography, land cover, human activities, and management practices\u2014 may further affect the temporal dynamics of ES flows from NBS13,14. This means that certain types of NBS may take many years to achieve their full range of benefits, and different ES can emerge at various stages4,15. Some ES may manifest immediately following NBS implementation, while others may only become apparent in the long run16. This highlights the significant role that time plays in the success of NBS, as they may not always provide an instant solution to environmental or social challenges17.</p><p>In general, three main patterns can be identified in ES temporal dynamics: linear dynamics \u2013 continuous increase or decrease in ES supply and demand; periodic dynamics \u2013 linear trends with oscillations around a mean value, and irregular events \u2013 occasional disturbances in ES supply and demand18. Despite the recognition of the temporal dynamics of NBS and their co-benefits7,18,19, few studies have analyzed how the co-benefits of NBS evolve over time. Most existing NBS frameworks do not incorporate dynamic simulations20, and NBS effectiveness is often assessed at a single point in time, without accounting for growth and development21,22. Moreover, analyses of NBS typically assume that both the solutions themselves and the conditions under which they operate (e.g., climate, urbanization) remain unchanged23. This assumption represents a significant gap in the literature6.</p><p>Similarly, the ES literature has not fully addressed temporal dynamics. A review by Rau et al.24 reveals that only 2% of the ES literature considers temporal dynamics. Likewise, a review by Obiang Ndong et al.22, which examined 103 studies, found that only 6% investigated the spatio-temporal relationships of ES. In this context, short-term ES dynamics are typically analyzed using experimental data and field samples/observations, while long-term studies often rely on remotely sensed data, secondary data, or simulations18,25,26. Overlooking which NBS are more effective in the short or long term, as perceived by residents, constitutes a barrier to their implementation6,20. This issue becomes particularly evident when comparing NBS with grey infrastructure, which often appears to deliver quicker benefits, even though this is not always the case9. This limitation is also reflected in the economic evaluations of NBS. A recent review of cost-benefit analyses on urban NBS showed that most studies assume the full delivery of co-benefits within the first year of implementation, and maintain this assumption throughout the entire lifecycle of the infrastructure, affecting the accuracy of the economic evaluations27.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested to enhance NBS impact assessment and monitoring methodologies to reflect changes in the effectiveness of co-benefits over time, emphasizing the importance of considering the time required for these benefits to materialize7. A report from the European Union-funded Nature4Cities project28 provides a factsheet for each type of NBS, detailing both the benefits and co-benefits they offer and their respective maturation periods. For example, interventions like urban farms, rain gardens, or swales can become fully operational within relatively short timeframes (usually one to five years), thus delivering immediate benefits. Conversely, tree-based solutions\u2014such as urban forests or street trees\u2014may take up to a decade to mature, but in this context, that longer timescale yields more substantial advantages than short-term interventions, including enhanced carbon sequestration, biodiversity gains, and improved flood mitigation. It is important to note, however, that these temporal dynamics do not apply uniformly to every NBS, and a longer path to full effectiveness does not necessarily translate into greater benefits in every case.</p><p>Building from the two fundamental concepts of NBS effectiveness and temporality, we introduce the concept of \u201cNBS temporal effectiveness\u201d. This term refers to the time required for an NBS to deliver its full range of benefits at maximum capacity and is founded on a trade-off between the timing of benefits and their magnitude: the more immediate the benefits, the lower their potential magnitude. The classification is structured as follows:</p><p>NBS with short-term effectiveness: this category includes NBS that delivers limited co-benefits that reach their maximum effectiveness within one year from the implementation.</p><p>NBS with medium-term effectiveness: this category includes NBS that deliver enhanced co-benefits compared to short-term NBS, achieving their full effectiveness within 3\u20135 years of implementation.</p><p>NBS with long-term effectiveness: this category includes NBS that deliver enhanced co-benefits compared to medium-term NBS, which can take up to 10 years to achieve their full effectiveness.</p><p>We hypothesize that short-term NBS interventions primarily involve vegetated components such as grassy meadows and annual plants, medium-term interventions include a combination of annual plants and fast-growing trees, and long-term NBS involve trees and perennial plants that take more time to mature but ultimately yield greater benefits. Finally, it is important to recognize that the same NBS can generate different benefits at varying times and magnitudes, depending on factors such as the species involved, the vegetation\u2019s maturity, local context, and prevailing environmental conditions29,30. This classification is not intended as a framework for categorizing NBS types according to benefit timing and effectiveness, as such a framework would require dedicated monitoring and simulation studies31,32, which are scarce in the literature. The proposed classification should be viewed primarily as a guide to investigate how the time lag in generating co-benefits affects support for NBS as well as the extent to which citizens are willing to trade immediate but lower benefits for delayed but higher benefits and vice versa, and must be adapted to each specific context, since local settings and environmental conditions can influence the temporal effectiveness of the chosen NBS.</p><p>Despite the recognition of these dynamics within the NBS literature, little research has conceptualized and assessed the temporality of NBS co-benefits as perceived by residents. Previous studies have identified both the delayed realization of benefits33,34 and the associated knowledge gap35 as barriers to NBS implementation. They have also stressed the need to explore public preferences regarding the temporality of NBS to enhance their social acceptance36, and to include temporal variability of co-benefit in the economic assessment of NBS27. However, temporal dynamics of NBS remain understudied. This represents a critical knowledge gap, as understanding these dynamics and learning how to leverage them to address citizens\u2019 needs can improve the effectiveness of NBS planning. For instance, it can help prevent mismatches between expected and actual benefits, which might otherwise undermine public support for NBS.</p><p>While the temporal effectiveness of NBS remains generally understudied, there is an even greater lack of research examining public preferences and support for NBS in relation to their temporal effectiveness using Public Participation GIS (PPGIS). PPGIS is a participatory mapping approach that enables participants to locate and describe features on a map, integrating their knowledge, values, and preferences into collaborative spatial decision-making, and can thus be regarded as a type of planning support system37, 38\u201339. Numerous studies demonstrate the versatility of PPGIS in the context of NBS and land-use planning by capturing social values and cultural ES40, 41, 42\u201343, identifying meaningful places for NBS planning44, addressing environmental justice and social integration45, 46\u201347, co-designing interventions48, and evaluating support for environmental policies and management49,50. PPGIS has also been used to identify potential synergies and conflicts in land use51,52, further underscoring its relevance as a decision-support tool in sustainable urban and regional planning. Although the use of PPGIS in scientific research has grown over time, planning professionals still exhibit some reluctance toward participatory approaches, often perceiving expert opinions as more reliable53. As emphasized by Ives et al.42, future empirical research employing PPGIS should not only address scientific and theoretical considerations but also explore its practical application in landscape planning.</p><p>This study is positioned within this context and presents a PPGIS study in the city of Trento, located in northeastern Italy, with the following objectives:</p><p>To identify clusters of respondents based on their preferences for the temporal effectiveness of NBS.</p><p>To spatially identify the potential for conflict concerning support for NBS with short-, medium-, or long-term effectiveness.</p><p>To achieve these objectives, we employed a PPGIS approach to collect and map citizens\u2019 preferences for different types of NBS, categorized by their temporal effectiveness. In doing so, we expand the application of PPGIS to assess the emergence of potential land-use conflicts related to the temporal effectiveness of NBS and discuss their implication in the planning of NBS. This study is organized as follows: Section \u201cResults\u201d presents the main findings, which are further discussed in Section \u201cDiscussion\u201d. Finally, Section \u201cMethods\u201d outlines the methodology employed for conducting the participatory survey, along with the spatial and aspatial analyses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PCA and cluster analysis</emphasis></p><p>We selected the first five principal component from PCA that represented distinct preferences on the implementation of NBS: PC 1 - Opposition to NBS, PC 2 - Support for short-term NBS, PC 3 - NBS are not necessary, PC 4 - Support for medium-term NBS, PC 5 - Support for long-term NBS. Supplementary Table 1 presents the mean value and standard deviation of each item, as well as the Eigenvalue and Cronbach\u2019s alpha for each component, confirming the validity and reliability of the identified dimensions.</p><p>These components were then used as input for the k-means cluster analysis to identify clusters of respondents with different temporal preferences for NBS. To avoid redundancy, the component \u201cNBS are not necessary\u201d was excluded from the clustering process, as its conceptual meaning overlaps with that of the component \u201cOpposition to NBS\u201d. The cluster centroids, representing the normalized mean values for each principal component, were analyzed to characterize the groups. These centroids illustrate how the clusters vary across the main principal components identified by the PCA (Table 1).Table 1</p><p>Mean differences in factor scores by component and cluster group</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"10\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\" morerows=\"1\">Component</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Cluster 1</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Cluster 2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Cluster 3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col5\">C1 vs C2</entry><entry colname=\"col7\" nameend=\"col8\" namest=\"col7\">C1 vs C3</entry><entry colname=\"col9\" nameend=\"col10\" namest=\"col9\">C2 vs C3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean (SD)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Mean (SD)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Mean (SD)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry><entry colname=\"col7\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col8\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col10\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Opposition to NBS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.32 (0.77)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">?0.95 (0.59)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.75 (0.68)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">?12.70</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt;

This result is consistent with the characterization of these clusters, as their focus on short- and long-term NBS can excludes a clear distinction in support for medium-term solutions.</p><p>Within each cluster, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of each item and conducted pairwise comparisons using independent-sample t-tests (Supplementary Table 2). It is important to note that the component \u201cOpposition to NBS\u201d includes negatively worded items, meaning that lower scores indicate a lower degree of opposition (or greater support) for NBS.</p><p>Supplementary Table 3 show the distribution of the socio-demographic characteristics across the three clusters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mapped points</emphasis></p><p>A total of 1285 points were mapped in support of NBS development (Table 2). The western and eastern districts of Trento were merged due to the low number of points mapped in these areas, likely because these districts are already characterized by a high presence of natural areas. Overall, the category with the highest number of mapped points was long-term NBS, while the amount of support for the other two categories was similar. Cluster MT mapped nearly the same number of points for medium-term and long-term NBS, with fewer points mapped for short-term NBS. Cluster ST showed a preference for short-term NBS, and a nearly equal number of points for medium-term and long-term NBS. The main difference in mapped points was found in Cluster LT, which showed a strong preference for long-term NBS, mapping more than double the points compared to the other two categories. This cluster also showed a slight preference for medium-term compared to short-term NBS.Table 2</p><p>Distribution of mapped points by NBS type, cluster and district</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"9\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">East Trento</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">West Trento</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Centro - Piedicastello</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Gardolo</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Mattarello</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Oltrefersina</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">S.

This highlights that preferences for the temporal effectiveness of NBS are strongly dependent on the local context. Cluster ST shows minor exceptions when short-term NBS are compared to long-term NBS. However, when short-term NBS are compared with medium-term NBS, Cluster ST demonstrates a clear preference for short-term NBS across all districts. Cluster MT presents a main exception in the central district of S. Giuseppe and Santa Chiara, both when medium-term NBS are compared with short-term NBS and when they are compared with long-term NBS. In contrast, Cluster LT shows a preference for long-term NBS in all comparisons. The analysis also shows how preferences are distributed when the preferred NBS category of a cluster is not included in the comparison. In these cases, both Cluster ST and Cluster MT tend to favor long-term NBS when compared with medium-term and short-term alternatives, respectively. Conversely, Cluster LT demonstrates a preference for medium-term NBS when compared with short-term NBS.</p><p>The intensity of the conflict varies depending on the category of NBS compared, the clusters considered, and the geographic areas (Fig. 2). In particular, central neighborhoods consistently show higher levels of conflict across all cases analyzed. In these areas, conflict arises even when the preferred category of NBS is not included in the comparison. In general, in cases of conflict, the direction of preference tends to remain oriented towards the reference NBS for all clusters. Exceptions are observed with Cluster MT, which showed a high level of conflict in the S. Giuseppe and Santa Chiara neighborhood. In this area, Cluster MT expressed a relative preference for short-term NBS when compared with medium-term NBS, and a preference for long-term NBS when compared with medium-term NBS. Furthermore, Cluster ST exhibits a preference for long-term NBS in the Oltrefersina neighborhood.Fig. 2</p><p>Relative conflict for the development of NBS with different temporal effectiveness by cluster.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>We present a PPGIS study that spatially assesses relative preferences and potential conflicts regarding the implementation of NBS with different temporal effectiveness, i.e., NBS that provide the full range of benefits in the short, medium, or long term in different intensity. We explored public preferences by dividing the population into three clusters that grouped together respondents with similar level of support for a specific NBS temporal category. The main contribution of our study is the introduction of the concept of NBS temporal effectiveness and the spatial assessment of its role in shaping public preferences for NBS, an aspect previously overlooked in the literature20,21. The classification of NBS into three temporal categories and the introduction of the trade-off between the immediacy and magnitude of benefits provide a theoretical framework useful for simplifying and structuring the analysis of temporal preferences. This prompted respondents to reflect on the extent to which they would be willing to sacrifice more substantial benefits for greater rapidity, or conversely, to forgo rapidity in favor of more impactful benefits. Additionally, the use of PPGIS required them to apply this reasoning specifically to each area where they would support the implementation of an NBS, taking into account the contextual needs. Our results indicate support for all temporal categories of NBS, with a higher preference for those with long-term effectiveness. The intensity and direction of conflict vary depending on the pairs of NBS temporal categories being compared, respondent groups, and urban contexts.</p><p>Previous PPGIS studies had shown that preferences for NBS vary according to factors such as landscape attributes42,54, the level of vegetation55,56, sociodemographic characteristics such as gender57,58, ethnicity57, age59, education60, proximity to home55,61, and perceived benefits and values62. Our study provides a significant contribution to the PPGIS literature by demonstrating for the first time, that temporal effectiveness is also a key factor influencing preferences for NBS. Responses to motivational questions, along with the number of mapped points, indicate a general support of all temporal categories, aligning with previous studies that found that people generally support green spaces42, and reveal a stronger preference for long-term NBS. This finding constitutes a significant contribution to the NBS literature, as existing studies have often identified the temporal lag in benefit production as a barrier to their implementation33,34. In contrast, our results indicate that citizens not only support but often prefer interventions requiring over 10 years to deliver the full range of benefits, as long as these benefits are more substantial than those of more immediate NBS. This highlights the importance of clearly communicating this aspect when planning for long-term NBS to reduce initial skepticism toward interventions whose positive effects are not immediately visible. Furthermore, it could lead to increased public support for NBS when compared to gray infrastructure, which is often favored due to its capacity to provide immediate results9.</p><p>The application of the methodology proposed by Brown and Raymond63, and Lechner et al.52, enabled the analysis of the directionality and intensity of conflict, between and within population groups with different attitudes. This allowed for a more detailed understanding of the distribution of preferences, identifying areas, clusters, and types of interventions most subject to divergences of opinion52,64. Respondents belonging to a specific cluster, while generally showing a preference for a particular category of NBS, in some areas revealed stronger preferences for other categories. This is consistent with previous conflict analyses using PPGIS52. This flexibility in preferences was observed particularly in the short- and medium-term. In contrast, the long-term cluster demonstrated a more consistent preference for long-term NBS across all areas. This tendency may arise from an aversion to low-impact public interventions, which are perceived as quick fixes aimed at rapidly gaining public support but potentially requiring additional investment in the future. This is confirmed by the responses from this cluster to the motivational questions (see Supplementary Table 2).</p><p>Despite the importance of territorial context, our analysis shows that it is not always possible to identify an unanimously preferred category of NBS for a specific area across all clusters. This is consistent with previous PPGIS studies65 that showed that patterns linking intervention areas to specific land uses occasionally emerge, and that preferences for NBS are not solely linked to objective territorial characteristics but are also influenced by personal factors and priorities that may be difficult to capture45,66. For example, there seems to be a tendency to prefer short-term NBS in densely populated central urban areas, where there is a pressing need to quickly improve quality of life. Conversely, these interventions tend to lack support in peripheral areas, such as low-density residential neighborhoods and agricultural zones. However, these patterns are not consistent across all clusters, highlighting the complexity of the issue and the need to implement multiple solutions in certain areas, as observed in previous studies67. This emphasizes the need for participatory approaches, and future studies could delve deeper into the personal motivations behind these preferences. Future studies could also conduct analyses to understand how temporal preferences vary in relation to more specific urban attributes, such as land use, proximity to home, availability of green spaces, neighborhood density, or the socio-economic characteristics of the area.</p><p>Conflicting preferences were also identified within the same clusters, leading to the identification of areas of potential conflict. In these areas, it is important to further investigate the reasons behind the disagreements and find acceptable solutions, for example, by engaging local stakeholders to identify solutions that balance different preferences for NBS42,65,68. Our results show that preference conflicts are more intense in central neighborhoods, characterized by higher population density and limited green spaces. These are the most frequented areas of the city and, as a result, are subject to the opinions of a larger number of people. These areas received the highest number of mapped points, consistent with findings from previous PPGIS studies69. This concentration can be partially explained by the phenomenon of spatial discounting, i.e., people tend to favor locations that are easily accessible and close to home, as highlighted in prior research65,67.</p><p>Our study presents a new perspective on NBS planning by focusing on the consideration of their temporal effectiveness and the preferences that people have regarding it. We found that citizens have specific preferences regarding the timing and impact of the benefits associated with NBS, and that such preferences are place-specific and vary across different population groups. Furthermore, we discovered that differing temporal preferences can, in some cases, lead to potential conflicts. Taking these factors into account can enable the adoption of more inclusive and targeted strategies, enhancing both the effectiveness and the acceptability of NBS interventions.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the temporal lag of NBS can act as a barrier to their implementation6,34. Adopting long-term NBS in contexts where the community demands immediate solutions, or vice versa, risks failing to meet citizens\u2019 expectations regarding the capacity of NBS to address environmental and social challenges. This challenge can be overcome by planning NBS interventions that account for the temporal needs of local communities, increasing their acceptability and improving citizens\u2019 perceptions of their effectiveness. Moreover, technical solutions are often perceived as more favorable than NBS because they provide immediate results9. Our study shows that people can provide greater support for long-term NBS when they demonstrate to provide greater overall benefits compared to immediate solutions. Furthermore, the analysis of preference directionality provides an additional tool to understand whether, and to what extent, the planned NBS is acceptable to the local community in a specific area63. This approach facilitates aligning planning choices with the needs of the communities, fostering collaboration among different social groups64; and contributing to greater acceptance of the proposed solutions.</p><p>This study has some limitations. First, we acknowledges that the classification of NBS into three temporal categories (short, medium, and long term) represents a simplification. We are aware that the different ES provided by the same NBS may follow different temporal dynamics and do not always reflect a clear trade-off between the immediacy and magnitude of benefits and that NBS and ES temporal patterns are not always linear. However, since this study represents a first attempt to understand the role of temporality in public preferences for NBS, we believe that this classification can serve as a reasonable starting point for capturing preliminary insights into the issue of NBS temporality, even though it does not fully reflect the complexity of ecosystem dynamics. Future studies could integrate preference analysis with simulation models of NBS temporal dynamics to improve the precision of the results and provide a more comprehensive understanding of how citizens\u2019 preferences align with the actual temporal dynamics of NBS. In addition, we recommend that future studies on NBS undertake dynamic analyses of NBS effectiveness over time, as this crucial aspect remains largely underestimated in the literature.</p><p>A further limitation of our study is the overrepresentation of younger generations, which may have influenced the results. Moreover, the use of convenience and voluntary sampling might have affected the representativeness of the sample and favored the inclusion of individuals more inclined to prefer a specific temporal typology of NBS. Issues related to sample size and representativeness are common in PPGIS studies46,70,71, and previous PPGIS studies have shown that sociodemographic biases linked to different sampling techniques have a limited influence on mapped data67,69. To improve the validity and generalizability of findings, future research should consider adopting more representative sampling methods, such as random sampling, and aim for a larger and more balanced sample72.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>Trento is an Alpine city of ~120,000 inhabitants, located in the Eastern Italian Alps. The administrative area of the city spans over 158 km\u00b2, of which 72 km\u00b2 are covered by forests (Fig. 3a). Around 70% of the population lives on the valley floor, where most of the industrial and commercial areas and infrastructure are also concentrated. Agricultural areas, mainly vineyards and apple orchards, occupy the non-urbanized patches on the valley floor and the sunny hillsides. The rest of the population resides in small villages scattered across the surrounding hills and mountains.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Land use and administrative subdivisions in the Municipality of Trento.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Distribution of land use and land cover types. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> Administrative districts of Trento.</p><p>The city of Trento is divided into 12 administrative districts (Fig. 3b), each with specific local responsibilities. Each district represents a territorial area with individual characteristics, encompassing neighborhoods that vary in terms of population density, economic activities, and distribution of, and access to, different types of green and blue spaces73,74. In the urbanized area of Trento, private gardens cover 4.6% of the municipal area, while public green spaces occupy 2%52,75. A recent survey conducted by the Municipality of Trento shows that one in three residents visits a park daily, and almost 70% of residents are frequent users of green areas, highlighting their importance to the community75. Currently, the Municipality of Trento is actively engaged in several projects aimed at increasing green spaces, promoting biodiversity, and developing green infrastructure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Respondent sampling</emphasis></p><p>The target population for our study consisted of Trento residents aged 18 and above. To reach city residents, we used a convenience and voluntary sampling approach, where participants were recruited through survey invitations shared via email, and social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and LinkedIn), an in person using flyers distributed across the city76,77. Those who consented to participate completed the survey individually. A total of 286 respondents responded to the survey. Supplementary Table 4 compares the sociodemographic characteristics of the Trento population (Census data) with those of our sample. The gender distribution among respondents\u201446.2% female (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 132) and 51.8% male (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 148)\u2014aligns reasonably well with that of the population (51.9% female and 48.1% male). Younger age groups are overrepresented in our sample, particularly those aged 18\u201334, who make up 52.1% of our respondents compared to 23.6% of the population. Conversely, older age groups are underrepresented, with individuals aged 55 and above comprising only 12.6% of our sample compared to 46.2% in the overall population. Underrepresentation of certain socio-demographic groups (e.g. the elderly) in PPGIS studies have been widely acknowledged in literature and therefore sampling biases should be considered when interpreting the findings72,78,79.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PPGIS survey design</emphasis></p><p>The data for this study was collected between July 12, 2024, and September 1, 2024, using an online survey format via the participatory mapping platform Maptionnaire. The survey collected spatial and aspatial data on respondents\u2019 support or opposition to developing NBS with different temporal effectiveness in Trento (for full survey, see Supplementary Note 1). Initially, participants were provided with detailed information about the research project and gave informed consent to participate, with the option to withdraw from the survey at any point. Respondents had the option to complete the survey in either Italian or English.</p><p>The survey included multiple-choice questions, Likert-scale questions, and mapping tasks. In the first section, respondents were asked to identify their residence on a 400 \u00d7 400 m2 grid to ensure privacy. In the second section, we described and provided general examples of the three NBS temporal categories based on our proposed classification of NBS temporal effectiveness. These categories were designed to require respondents to consider a trade-off between the rapidity at which the benefits could be realized and their magnitude, acknowledging that an NBS delivering faster results might provide smaller benefits, and vice versa (Table 5).Table 5</p><p>Description of the NBS temporal categories used in the survey</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Label</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">NBS temporal category</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Description</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Short-term NBS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">NBS with short-term effectiveness</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Provide limited environmental and social benefits that appear within a year of their creation.

However, these benefits only emerge within 6\u201310 years of the NBS implementation. The vegetated component of this NBS can include parks with trees and perennial plants or tree-lined avenues.</p><p>For each category of NBS, respondents were asked to map where they would support their implementation. They were allowed to map as many points as they wished, with no restrictions on the minimum or maximum number of markers. For each mapped location, respondents were asked to select two environmental or social co-benefits from a list of nine, indicating the ones they aimed to achieve with that specific NBS. Similarly, in the third section, we asked respondents to map where they would oppose the development of short-, medium-, or long-term NBS. At the end of the second and third sections, respondents answered 1\u20135 Likert-scale questions about their motivations for supporting or opposing the three typologies of NBS. These motivation questions were based on insights derived from prior interviews with Trento stakeholders, aimed at identifying the reasons for supporting or opposing the implementation of NBS with short- and long-term effectiveness. These responses were analyzed and coded using Maxqda80 software and included in the survey. Finally, in the last section, we collected socio-demographic data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Clustering respondent in groups</emphasis></p><p>We conducted a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group the motivational questions regarding support and opposition to NBS with different temporal effectiveness. PCA is a statistical technique that reduces a dataset of multiple variables to a few principal components\u2014linear combinations of the original variables that capture the maximum variance\u2014providing a simplified approximation of the original data81. The findings from the PCA were then used to inform the clustering of respondents82. The analyses were conducted using R software. The PCA was performed on a dataset that included the responses to the 27 motivational questions from the survey. This analysis was conducted to reduce the dimensionality of the motivational items. We employed an oblique rotation method to allow for correlation between components82, thereby capturing the complexity of social phenomena more accurately. For each component, we calculated the factor scores and finally selected the first five components, as they were the ones with eigenvalues greater than 1, that explained 60% of the total variance. The interpretation of each component was informed by the factor loadings of the items, which reflect the strength of their association with the respective component. The reliability of all components was assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha, with \u03b1 \u2265 0.7 considered sufficient, indicating the internal consistency of the grouped motivational items83. These measures help address common critiques of PCA- such as forced orthogonality, weak interpretability, and insufficient verification of component consistency84- by enhancing the interpretability and stability of the derived components. We then used these components as input for a K-means cluster analysis, aiming to divide respondents into groups that reflect the attitudes toward supporting NBS with different levels of temporal effectiveness. Cluster analysis, however, has some inherent limitations, including its reliance on specific variables and the fact that it will generate clusters even when no meaningful structure exists in the data84. To mitigate these issues, we included in the K-means analysis, only components with sufficient reliability scores, and conducted pairwise t-tests to assess whether the mean PCA scores differed significantly between each pair of clusters, followed by Bonferroni corrections to adjust for multiple comparisons85. The adjusted <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-values were computed to determine the significance of the differences between clusters, setting an alpha level of 0.05. This approach helps validate the distinctiveness of each cluster and partially addresses concerns regarding the stability and interpretability of the resulting groups.</p><p>We then analyzed the distribution of prioritized benefits across clusters and categories of NBS to identify patterns linking cluster membership with the prioritized benefits, as well as the benefits expected from each category of NBS.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spatial analysis</emphasis></p><p>For each cluster, we assessed the directionality of preference and the intensity of conflict for each pair of NBS typologies (short-term NBS vs. medium-term NBS; short-term NBS vs. long-term NBS; medium-term NBS vs. long-term NBS). This analysis was performed following the methodology proposed by Brown and Raymond63 and Lechner et al.52, using QGIS 3.22 software. As a preliminary step, we cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate points mapped in the same areas by the same respondent. Using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), we created nine density maps, one for each pair of NBS typologies and clusters. The KDE search radius was determined through an adaptation of Silverman\u2019s rule-of-thumb bandwidth estimation formula86 and a heuristic approach by testing different size buffers for maximum data inclusion and appropriate level of detail, while the grid size was determined using Eq. (1):1where  represents the mean nearest neighbour distance between point pairs87. We estimated these parameters for each of the nine datasets, and then used their average value for all KDE estimates. The final search radius was 1000 m, and the grid size was set to 25 m. We kept a smaller grid size to improve the map resolution.</p><p>For each cluster, we then assessed the directionality of preference for each pair of NBS temporal category using Eq. (2). For example, to assess the directionality of preference between short-term and medium-term NBS, the pixel values were calculated using Eq. (2) as follows:2where \u201cSupport ST\u201d and \u201cSupport MT\u201d are the pixel values derived from the density of PPGIS points in each grid cell using KDE for the support of short-term NBS and medium-term NBS respectively. Values were rescaled to range from 0 to 1 to indicate the strength of support for each NBS category, while negative values (ranging from \u22121 to 0) indicated stronger support for the compared NBS category. The rescaling was based on the maximum pixel value recorded. This approach was then consistently applied to all pairs of NBS typologies within each cluster.</p><p>Afterward, we estimated the intensity of conflict following Eq. (3) proposed by Brown and Raymond63 and Lechner et al.52:3</p><p>The relative conflict analysis involved rescaling the maximum absolute pixel value, irrespective of sign, calculated as the difference between NBS temporal categories. Low relative conflict values indicate a general consensus on the preferred NBS category in that pixel area, whereas high values indicate opposing preferences. The same rescaling value was used as in the relative preference analysis, allowing for direct comparison between relative preference and conflict. For example, a high value of relative preference (e.g., indicating preference for short-term NBS) combined with a high conflict value suggests that, despite a preference for short-term NBS, there is also significant support for medium-term NBS in that area. The analysis was performed for each pair of NBS typologies within each cluster. Finally, we estimated the mean value of directionality and conflict in each district of Trento.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We would like to thank Prof. Tuuli Toivonen and the GREENTRAVEL project (ERC, project 101044906) and University of Helsinki for funding the data collection through the Maptionnaire software.

It found that 1,645 individual initiatives had been invested in or set up to improve water stewardship, with total funding more than doubling from $22bn in 2013 to $49bn by 2023.</p><p><br/>Flood risk mitigation was highlighted as the biggest NbS area for investment. Water quality improvements were also driven by forest and ecosystem restoration, with a focus also given to grasslands, shrublands, and wetlands. NbS initiatives were focused on safeguarding drinking water supplies, conserving freshwater ecosystems and decreasing flood risk.<br/>Nearly all (97%) of the investment came from government funding, but the report notes an \"accelerating rate\" of private finance availability. User-driven investments from utilities, cities, and corporations were being unlocked through new finance models such as dedicated water funds, debt swaps, and green bonds.<br/>China, the European Union, and the United States accounted for 94% of total investment between 2013-23. However, the report states that Africa experienced the fastest growth in terms of investment outlay in that period.<br/>The Nature Conservancy's global director for resilient freshwater Daniel Shemie said: \"As the climate and biodiversity crises accelerate, it's fantastic to see public and private spending recognize the power of nature to safeguard drinking water supplies and shrink the impact of natural disasters.<br/>\"More important than talk is money-and, while private finance is still a comparative drop in the ocean, the 30x growth over the past decade and growing momentum behind user-driven investments give reason for optimism, especially as public funding and foreign assistance comes under pressure in many parts of the world.\"<br/>The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) was the driest year for global rivers in more than thirty years. A report indicates that river flows and reservoir inflows have been below normal levels for the past five consecutive years. In 2023, more than 50% of global catchment areas showed abnormal conditions, with most exhibiting water deficits.<br/>A revealed that a looming water crisis endangers water resources and freshwater ecosystems valued at approximately $58trn annually.<br/>In response, investors are increasingly urging firms to enhance how they are tracking and reporting water-related risks.<br/>Almost 300 investors, collectively representing more than $21trn in assets, which targets businesses in sectors with a high water footprint that are not yet disclosing comprehensive data on their water footprint, water stewardship and risk management.<br/>CDP analysis has revealed the widespread under-reporting of water-related risks by large companies.\u00a0\u00a0is at risk from water-related issues in corporate operations and supply chains worldwide,\u00a0.<br/>As such, CDP has increased the number of companies asked to disclose more than twofold year-on-year. The enhanced pressure from investors comes as businesses face physical risks related to extreme weather events made more likely due to the climate crisis, and linked to water systems.<br/>Large businesses and quality, and half of them are unable to confirm that they are engaging their suppliers on water stewardship.<br/>Published 11th June 2025<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NLAEDT-httpswwwedienetinvestmentsinnaturebasedsolutionsforwatersecurityhavedoubledinadecade</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NLAEDT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G17-GSH3-RV6J-3027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><timeReceived>11:14 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Faversham House Ltd  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Edie.net</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63415\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 11, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NATURE CONSERVANCY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>China &amp;

Who is paying for them, and why \u2013 and how is their financing typically structured? Allison Mansbach and Will Parsons from Finance Earth tell all in our latest explainer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What are \"nature-based solutions\"? What problems are they solving?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Allison Mansbach and Will Parsons: Nature-based solutions (NbS) cover a range of actions and interventions that use ecosystems and natural processes to solve environmental and social problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The beauty of nature-based solutions is that that they deliver many different benefits at the same time. The focus has often been on biodiversity loss and climate change, but NbS can also address many related challenges, such as water pollution, air pollution, soil depletion, health and wellbeing issues and social inequalities. For example:</p><p>These multi-faceted benefits make NbS a powerful tool for tackling complex, interconnected issues. Although NbS can theoretically include any action involving nature, it is essential that solutions are designed together with local communities to ensure they deliver impactful benefits and meet community needs.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry>Which other terminology or concepts would you like to see covered in our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pioneerspost.com/tagged/3200\">Impact 101 series</url>?

However, the term \"nature-based solutions\" began to appear and be used <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org/sites/default/files/content/documents/2021/nbs_from_concept_definition_to_global_standard_emmanuelle_cohen-shacham.pdf\">more broadly over the last decade</url>, with the recognition that \"grey\" or engineered infrastructure does not always provide the most effective solutions and that nature can provide a range of readily available solutions instead.</p><p>Organisations like the World Bank and the International Union for Conservation of Nature <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/news/back-to-nature\">began using the term around the late 2000s</url> to highlight the importance of preserving and restoring natural systems to combat environmental decline and climate change. The term has since gained momentum as it aligns conservation efforts with broader societal and economic goals.</p><p>Analysis by the Green Finance Institute suggests that nature degradation could lead to a 12% loss to the UK's GDP</p><p>The rise of NbS as a mainstream concept reflects a growing awareness among governments, businesses and wider society about the interconnected relationship between nature, the economy and livelihoods, and the fundamental risks that nature loss poses to economic health. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenfinanceinstitute.com/insights/assessing-the-materiality-of-nature-related-financial-risks-for-the-uk/\">Analysis by the Green Finance Institute</url> suggests that nature degradation could lead to an estimated 12% loss to the UK's GDP, greater than the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p><p>There is also growing clarity around how businesses can address their environmental impacts. Emerging global frameworks such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://tnfd.global/\">Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD</url>) and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://sciencebasedtargets.org/about-us/sbtn\">Science Based Targets Network (SBTN)</url> aim to guide businesses and policymakers in integrating nature into their decision-making. Regulatory pressure is also increasing, with greater legal requirements for businesses to report on their environmental impacts and exposure to related risks \u2013 examples include the EU's <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.ec.europa.eu/capital-markets-union-and-financial-markets/company-reporting-and-auditing/company-reporting/corporate-sustainability-reporting_en\">Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive</url> and the UK's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/sustainability-disclosure-requirements-implementation-update-2024\">Sustainability Disclosure Requirements</url>.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry>Support independent journalism covering the impact economyAs an entrepreneur or investor yourself, you'll know that producing quality work doesn't come free.

Aviva, for example, has made substantial commitments as part of its sustainability and net zero strategy \u2013 it has <url normalizedValue=\"https://static.aviva.io/content/dam/aviva-corporate/documents/socialpurpose/pdfs/2021-climate-transition-plan.pdf\">pledged \u00a3100m for NbS projects</url> in the UK and Ireland by 2030. In 2023, Aviva donated \u00a338m <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aviva.com/newsroom/news-releases/2023/02/aviva-helps-restore-rare-native-british-rainforests/\">to support the restoration of Britain's lost rainforests</url>, and invested a further \u00a310m into <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aviva.com/newsroom/news-releases/2023/02/aviva-becomes-a-carbon-partner-of-the-woodland-trust-with-a-10-million-pound-donation/\">woodland creation and peatland restoration projects</url> for carbon sequestration over five years. Similarly, Gresham House recently launched a <url normalizedValue=\"https://greshamhouse.com/news-media/gresham-house-launches-strategy-to-accelerate-restoration-of-uk-biodiversity-and-enhance-natural-capital/\">$380m biodiversity fund</url> dedicated to the creation of \"habitat banks\" in light of Biodiversity Net Gain requirements. (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-biodiversity-net-gain\">Biodiversity Net Gain</url>, or BNG, requires developers in England to counteract and ameliorate the impacts that projects such as housing developments have on biodiversity, either by improving the habitat on-site or funding habitat creation off-site. Habitat banks are areas of land where habitat restoration is carried out to meet developers' off-site BNG requirements. To help deliver the requisite minimum 10% uplift in biodiversity, developers can choose to buy BNG 'units' from a habitat bank.)</p><p>Other asset managers like Abrdn are incorporating nature-positive investments into their portfolios, reflecting the growing demand for sustainable finance. Oxygen Conservation, Nattergal, and Highlands Rewilding are notable examples of private companies investing in large-scale land restoration and conservation projects in the UK. Additionally, private estates such as Knepp, in southern England, are leading rewilding efforts that not only restore ecosystems, but also generate revenue through eco-tourism and sustainable land management.</p><p>In addition, large multinationals like Mars, Cargill and Walmart are funding nature-based solutions through philanthropic partnerships, such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.earth/fif/\">Fisheries Improvement Fund</url> (developed by WWF and Finance Earth).</p><p>Local authorities, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oceancitynature.co.uk/\">Plymouth City Council</url>, and water companies are also increasingly investing in nature-based solutions to manage flood risks, improve water quality, enhance biodiversity and deliver community benefits.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry>Glossary: related termsNatural capital: the stock of natural assets, like forests, wetlands, soil and animalsEcosystem services: the benefits that natural capital and natural systems provide, such as clean air and water, medicine, food, flood management and coastal protectionNatural climate solutions: nature-based solutions which specifically focus on reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissionsGreen infrastructure: a broad term which applies to natural and semi-natural areas and interventions designed to deliver ecosystem services, often connected to urban and rural development, for instance sustainable drainage systems, green roofs, parks and street treesNature markets: the preferred term of the UK government for the financing of NbS projects and the purchase and sale of the benefits they generate</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>How is such financing typically structured?</p><p>AM &amp; WP: Financing for NbS varies depending on the type of project and organisation providing the finance. Ultimately there is no \"one size fits all\" and the type of finance will need to be structured based on how suitable it is for the specific project. Since many nature markets are nascent, financing for NbS is often \"blended\", combining philanthropic or public funding with private investment.</p><p>For instance, Highlands Rewilding has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.highlandsrewilding.co.uk/crowdfund-launch-2022\">used a crowdfunding campaign</url> to engage local Scottish communities and investors in their rewilding efforts. Organisations like Nattergal attract investments from high-net-worth individuals who are interested in supporting sustainable land management and biodiversity projects. Aviva's investments have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://connect.avivab2b.co.uk/broker/articles/news/Taking-a-stand-on-sustainability-at-BIBA-2024/\">made from the balance sheet</url>, on the basis that they will develop nature markets and help Aviva achieve its net zero target.</p><p>Projects may also be financed by the sale of credits or 'units'. In 2023, Finance Earth worked with Surrey Wildlife Trust to secure a \u00a31m commitment from Shepperton Studios, a Surrey-based film studio, to purchase biodiversity units in order to meet its Biodiversity Net Gain obligations. This enabled Surrey Wildlife Trust to carry out extensive grassland restoration.</p><p>There are also examples of debt finance enabling NbS. For example, we worked with the RSPB (the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) to secure a loan for the creation of habitat in south Devon to support the cirl bunting, a farmland bird threatened by agricultural intensification. This loan is being repaid through contributions from the local council to deliver compensatory habitat for housing development.</p><p>What are the particular challenges of financing nature-based solutions?</p><p>AM &amp; WP: Financing nature-based solutions faces several challenges, primarily due to uncertain revenue streams and evolving business models. While there are a few established codes such as the Woodland Carbon Code or Peatland Code in the UK, there remains a general lack of agreed standards and methodologies for other potential markets and ecosystem services. This creates uncertainty for potential buyers around what benefits they are purchasing and what they can claim. Several codes are under development, like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/uk-saltmarsh-code\">Saltmarsh Code</url> \u2013 some of the funding commitments from Aviva will support the piloting of this code.</p><p>There is also a limited pipeline of investment-ready projects. Despite growing interest from the private sector, there's often a mismatch between available capital and projects that can deliver measurable outcomes and returns. Many NbS initiatives are not yet at a stage where they can adequately quantify their impacts or potential revenues, which is essential for attracting investment. This gap is exacerbated by the immaturity of the market and a shortage of skills, knowledge and expertise necessary for project development. (Finance Earth's <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.earth/uknaccelerator/\">UK Nature Accelerator</url> aims to address these issues by providing technical assistance and guidance for project developers.) Another positive step has been the UK government's Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) grant programme, which has been critical in supporting UK nature projects towards securing investment.</p><p>There is a limited pipeline of investment-ready projects. Many NbS initiatives can not yet adequately quantify their impacts or potential revenues</p><p>Policy uncertainty also poses a challenge. Stable regulatory frameworks and supportive environmental policies are essential for creating robust nature markets at scale. Some helpful initiatives have included the UK government's <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/642542ae60a35e000c0cb148/nature-markets.pdf\">Nature Markets Framework</url> and BSI's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/capabilities/standards-services/the-nature-investment-standards-programme/\">Nature Investment Standards Programme</url>. Nonetheless, inconsistency in policy has stalled progress in some areas. This has included mixed messages about nutrient neutrality rules in the UK, providing uncertainty around emerging markets and initiatives for trading nutrient credits.</p><p>Concerns about greenwashing and the integrity of nature projects further complicate the landscape. Government initiatives like the UK's <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/642542ae60a35e000c0cb148/nature-markets.pdf\">Nature Markets Framework</url> can help address these concerns. Recognising a gap in current policy and guidance, Finance Earth worked with leading environmental NGOs to publish the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finance.earth/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nature-Market-Principles-Full-Document-September-2023.pdf\">Nature Markets Principles</url>, aimed at ensuring accountability and mitigating risks associated with over-claiming by businesses.</p><p>Where are the biggest opportunities in this field right now?</p><p>AM &amp; WP: The biggest opportunities currently stem from the surge in corporate interest to address operational impacts and dependencies on natural resources. Companies across various sectors \u2013 particularly in food, agriculture, forestry and fisheries \u2013 are increasingly recognising the urgency of implementing sustainable practices within their supply chains. This shift is driven by a growing awareness of the massive economic and reputational risks posed by environmental degradation, which can directly affect their operations. As a result, businesses are seeking to support initiatives that enhance the sustainability of their supply chains, leading to increased investment in nature-based solutions projects that enhance biodiversity, improve soil health and protect terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Water companies and other industries heavily reliant on natural resources are also exploring partnerships and funding opportunities to mitigate their environmental impacts, creating fertile ground for developing new financing mechanisms that align corporate goals with environmental outcomes.</p><p>Established nature markets in the UK also present significant opportunities for nature-based solutions finance. The two government-backed carbon codes (the Woodland Carbon Code and the Peatland Code) are catalysing demand for investment in nature restoration projects. These frameworks offer robust, science-based market infrastructure for monitoring, reporting and verifying CO\u2082 emissions, ensuring that investments are both effective and accountable. The track record of transactions within these markets further enhances investor confidence, making it easier for businesses to engage in nature-based solutions.</p><p>While there is growing interest in investing in nature-based solutions, strong regulatory frameworks will be required to drive and sustain long-term, meaningful action at scale.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYNPSP-460807248</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYNPSP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DH1-5H41-JDJN-61T7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">483804</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2227\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024  Pioneers Post Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

nitf:lede=\"true\">A new wetland area has been created on a Shropshire farm as part of a pioneering project to reduce the risk of flooding using nature-based solutions.</p><p>It's hoped a new wetland at Cruckmeole Farm, near Shrewsbury, will provide an estimated 400 to 500 cubic metres of water storage.</p><p>The new wetland forms part of the Rea Brook demonstrator project - one of eight projects managed by Shropshire Council, informing the Severn Valley Water Management Scheme (SVWMS) that seeks to tackle flood risks and improve water resilience across the Upper Severn catchment in both England and Wales.</p><p>Proposals for the new wetland were put forward by the landowner, who wanted to reduce the risk of flooding to a nearby A-road and surrounding areas.</p><p>Working in collaboration with the Severn Rivers Trust, which is delivering the Rea Brook demonstrator, the wetland was carefully designed to balance ecological sensitivity with practical flood mitigation.</p><p>Constructed in June, its design features a large offline pool and a series of smaller scrapes that are designed to slow the flow of water from surrounding hills and residential areas before it reaches the Rea Brook.</p><p>Cecilia Young, catchment officer with the Severn Rivers Trust, said: \"The design was carefully adapted following ecological surveys to protect species-rich habitats, demonstrating a commitment to biodiversity alongside flood resilience.</p><p>\"We are looking forward to collating the data and seeing how this wetland will prove the benefits of nature-based solutions to water management.\"</p><p>Shropshire Council said monitoring equipment, including a camera trap and gauge board, will be installed to track its performance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Image: Wetlands International Afrique<br/>The NGOs will combine their efforts to deliver nature-based solutions projects in Kenya's coastal Lamu county, which is at risk from coastal flooding and erosion as well as freshwater shortages caused by drought.</p><p><br/>Around 6.5 million people in Kenya are affected by drought each year, and 75,000 are impacted by flooding. These extremes can be devastating for the 60% of the population working in agriculture.<br/>WWF-UK and the British Red Cross will work to restore the Southern Swamp mangrove forest as a means of providing resilience against coastal flooding, storms \u00a0and erosion. The forest will slow water flow and reduce the force of waves and winds.<br/>Beyond their benefits in terms of resilience amid extreme weather, mangrove forests also provide rich habitats and act as effective carbon sinks. The NOAA estimates that they can store up to ten times more carbon per unit area than trees on land, due to their root systems.<br/>WWF-UK and the British Red Cross will also provide trees to community groups in the area around Lake Kenyatta. The planting and management of the trees should reduce soil erosion and nutrient leaching, thereby protecting the lake and the agricultural lands in its vicinity.<br/>The British Red Cross's CEO Beatrice Butsana-Sita said: \"We know that climate change is having devastating effects on communities around the world. It's making extreme weather events more common, more dangerous and longer-lasting, and posing ever-increasing threats to people's lives, homes and livelihoods.<br/>\"But we also know that working with nature can be one of the most effective ways to help communities build resilience in the face of unprecedented challenges.<br/>\"By combining the Red Cross' longstanding experience supporting people to prepare for and respond to climate-related emergencies with WWF-UK's expertise in protecting our environment, we will be able to make a real difference to people facing some of the greatest risks as a result of climate change.\"<br/>The partnership us being supported by \u00a31m of funding from the People's Postcode Lottery's Postcode Planet Trust - a fund dedicated to providing grants to projects benefitting wildlife across the world.<br/>The partnership in Kenya is part of a larger global effort between Postcode Lottery Group, Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies and WWF to respond to the interlinked climate and nature crises. Nature-based solutions projects under this larger collaboration are already underway in Ethiopia, Mozambique, the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Philippines.<br/>Related article:<br/>Published 28th January 2025<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NLAEDT-httpswwwedienetukngospartnertoscalenaturebasedsolutionsforclimateadaptation</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NLAEDT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F0K-6403-RWRX-M4X2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><timeReceived>12:01 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Faversham House Ltd  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Edie.net</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63415\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 28, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Kenya, Ethiopia, Mozambique, DR Congo &amp;

a series of projects aimed at addressing nutrient loss and its impact on water quality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The projects, between April 2024 and March 2025, were funded by the UK government's Farming in Protected Landscapes programme and Westmorland and Furness Council-s Climate and Nature Fund.</p><p>Sarah Swindley, chief executive of the Lake District Foundation, said: \"Farmers are at the heart of the Windermere catchment and their knowledge is vital in tackling the challenges we face.</p><p>\"These projects show the power of collaboration and practical support to make positive change on the ground.</p><p>\"By working together we can protect the lake, support farm businesses and create a more sustainable future for this special place.\"</p><p>Workshops brought together farmers, advisers, and stakeholders to discuss soil management, nutrient loss, and 'nature-based' solutions.</p><p>More than 700 hectares of farmland received soil testing and nutrient management plans, and some farmers opted to carry out independent testing.</p><p>Findings showed that while artificial fertiliser use has dropped due to rising costs and changing attitudes, nearly half of the fields tested had above-target phosphorus levels.</p><p>According to the foundation, this points to a need for greater focus on preventing soil erosion.</p><p>Most participating farmers said they were now more interested in nutrient management.</p><p>The project-s final phase explored 'nature-based' solutions and so-called 'green finance', though the foundation says concerns remain around financial returns, ongoing support, and legal clarity.</p><p>The Lake District Foundation recommends continuing a 'community-led' approach to encourage knowledge sharing and behaviour change.</p><p>It also suggests supporting 'practical action' on high-risk farms and offering guidance and case studies to build confidence in new methods.</p><p>The foundation believes this work demonstrates the importance of collaboration in protecting Windermere and securing a sustainable future for the wider catchment</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

This paper starts from the premise that multispecies justice (MSJ) thinking provides a needed biocentric approach to NBS, and explores how a Capability Approach (CA) can be a bridge to integrate MSJ into urban NBS. The premise was tested through an embodied methodology used to design and deliver multi-city workshops in urban novel ecologies; settings often described as abandoned and hosting novel ecosystems. This research improved the understanding of participant\u2019s awareness and knowledge of more-than-human agencies in shaping space and time, and in identifying social and environmental vulnerabilities and opportunities that can foster or hinder multispecies flourishing. We conclude by exploring how the CA can bridge NBS and MSJ and argue for the potential of marginal, less-valued novel ecologies as important elements of socially and biodiversity-rich urban futures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>In an era of climate change and rapid urbanization, Nature Based Solutions (NBS) are becoming an essential part of urban sustainability agendas worldwide. NBS are held to offer systemic ecosystem management solutions to address complex urban challenges by delivering multiple social-ecological co-benefits1. NBS provide opportunities for better living amidst climate change.</p><p>While ecological solutions like NBS are increasingly valued and advocated in urban settings, they are typically designed and implemented in an anthropocentric way, often cast through the language of ecosystem services (ESS), which prioritizes the needs and wants of humans and casts other species in mainly instrumental ways2,3. This is problematic because it limits the scalability and effectiveness of NBS as holistic urban solutions3; and it is unfortunate because ESS was meant to give greater recognition to nature, the species, and relations that make it up, and its functions4. For example, researchers caution this approach may significantly compromise the health and wellbeing of both human and nonhuman communities, posing a serious challenge to urban resilience and future city design\u2014particularly in the face of emerging threats from climate change, social inequities, and economic impacts on multispecies livelihoods and equity5. We here propose that recent discussions about how to adequately take into account justice considerations in the design, implementation, and governance of NBS6, 7\u20138 is a promising vector through which to address this issue. The consideration of justice is necessary to ensure NBS can be effective, but so far, the needs and capabilities of nonhuman species remain largely overlooked in these discussions.</p><p>In recent years, the field of multispecies studies has emerged to address pervasive anthropocentrism and its related issues. This perspective considers the needs, agency, and freedoms of other species as equally important to those of humans, offering a path toward a more inclusive and equitable approach to planning and ecosystem management9,10. Within this framework, the concept of multispecies justice further emphasizes the rights and capabilities of nonhuman communities, supporting a vision of urban environments where all species can thrive. The call for multispecies justice seeks to expand ethical, political, and social considerations beyond humans. It is an evolving terrain of thought, with the focus of justice varying from individual animals to species, ecosystems, and the planet11. While a diverse and emerging body of scholarship, its various branches are connected by a deep moral concern for the plight of nonhuman life in a world increasingly inhospitable to its existence, whilst sharing a commitment to ethical reflection that respects the complexity and interconnections of life on Earth10.</p><p>For NBS, a multispecies justice approach encourages responsibility and care in processes of co-learning and co-becoming12. The MSJ perspective also supports the long-term effectiveness of NBS as it offers alignment with ecosystem dynamics and biodiversity needs rather than imposing technofixes that emphasize interventionist approaches. Despite this recognition, challenges remain in operationalizing and putting into action multispecies justice, as it needs to go against deeply entrenched anthropocentric biases and rethink the subjects and procedures of justice anew11,13.</p><p>To address this gap, we explore how the Capability Approach (CA)\u2014an approach to justice widely applied in social and public policy to evaluate human wellbeing and justice, as exemplified by the Human Development Index\u2014can serve as a bridge to operationalize multispecies justice in NBS design and implementation. This framework, when used from a multispecies perspective, provides a method for identifying the functionings of nonhuman species\u2014which are reflections of an organism's ability to be or do something crucial, such as reproduce, make use of habitat, and engage in interspecies interactions\u2014and assessing the conditions and opportunities necessary for their survival and well-being14. Our research employs theoretical reasoning by applying the capability approach to develop a framework that embeds multispecies justice into urban NBS, expanding beyond anthropocentric planning towards biocentric forms of planning. This framework is then applied through empirical fieldwork to investigate how multispecies perspectives can enhance NBS implementation across multiple cities including Dublin, Ireland, New York City, USA, and Melbourne, Australia.</p><p>Through embodied, participatory experimental workshops (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 8) and engagement strategies, we explore ways to involve communities in envisioning and designing NBS that acknowledge and support nonhuman beings. This approach fosters awareness, empathy, and imagination around multispecies justice and more-than-human worlds15 and is an effective way to engage diverse stakeholders and communities in urban planning, design, and decision-making processes that meaningfully and critically consider the needs of nonhuman species, the interconnectedness of people and ecosystems, and the goal of mutual flourishing. A place-based understanding of more-than-human awareness and interdependencies can generate ecological empathy, a relational practice which creates pathways to restore human-nature connections16. Field research was conducted in novel ecosystems\u2014self-sustaining urban environments that emerge without direct human intervention. These landscapes, common in cities, offer a valuable testing ground for multispecies approaches, as they already function as informal NBS, requiring minimal maintenance while supporting biodiversity. By studying these environments, we examine how NBS can be designed to work with, rather than against, ecological processes.</p><p>We thus propose a critical conceptual move for NBS to become less anthropocentric and more biocentric in its design and application. Using the CA, we move from functions to functionings, which decenters the needs of humans vis-a-vis ESS and instead centralizes the needs of nonhuman beings. Thus, honing in on ecosystem capabilities instead of ecosystem services, we pave a way where the needs of nonhuman species are on equal footing with those of humans. Through this interdisciplinary approach, we argue that integrating multispecies justice and the CA into NBS design can significantly enhance their effectiveness, affordability, and long-term viability. Our findings contribute to a growing body of research that challenges the status quo of urban resilience planning, advocating for governance models that incorporate the diverse needs of human and nonhuman communities alike. By rethinking NBS from a multispecies perspective, we offer a framework for creating more adaptive, scalable, and ecologically attuned solutions that ensure mutual survival in an increasingly complex and changing world.</p><p>To create a link between multispecies justice and the CA, in what follows, we review literature to discuss the roots, key concepts, and empirical operationalization of the CA. Originally conceived by Amartya Sen and subsequently developed by Martha Nussbaum and others, the CA is rooted in the Aristotelian concept of \u201cflourishing\u201d. The fulcrum of this approach is desired \u201cbeings\u201d and \u201cdoings\u201d17 (p.91), such as being healthy, playing, and procreating. These \u201cbeings\u201d and \u201cdoings\u201d are termed \u201cfunctionings\u201d. The eponymous \u201ccapabilities\u201d of the approach are the set of functionings that enable flourishing by the life that pursues it18 (p. 40). While the ideas of functionings and capabilities are directly related, they are viewed as theoretically distinct within the CA framework to facilitate conceptual coherence19. The relationship between functionings and capabilities equates to a relationship between outcomes and opportunities. The latter of which emerges as a consequence of an individual's situatedness in a specific context. As noted by Nussbaum, \u201cFunctionings are beings and doings that are outgrowths or realizations of capabilities\u201d20 (p. 25). Although conceived with respect to humans, Nussbaum21,22 and others23 have suggested expanding the scope of the approach to encompass a multitude of species. Nussbaum has used the CA to formulate a theory of \u201cjustice for animals\u201d. Resonant with the CA's Aristotelian roots, she anchors this justice-oriented work in a trinity of related concepts, namely: sentience, intrinsic value, and striving. She holds \u201cthat sentience\u2014the ability to feel, to have a subjective perspective on the world\u2014is a necessary basis for being a subject of justice\u201d24 (p. 97). Being the \u201csubject of justice\u201d is tied to sentience, whereby creatures are seen as \u201cends\u201d in themselves rather than only as \u201cmeans\u201d to another's end25. This is because sentience endows a creature with a life that matters intrinsically to them from their subjective perspective. With a life that intrinsically matters to them, all creatures strive to flourish in the species-specific form of life that is natural to them. As a hedgehog strives to flourish by living the form of life that is natural to it, so too a robin strives to flourish in the (different) form of life that is natural to being a robin.</p><p>Indeed, it is this concern with \u201cstriving\u201d that furnishes the theoretical innovation of the CA. Whereas Kantian-informed justice approaches focus on recognizing the \u201cdignity\u201d of nonhuman animals as \u201cends\u201d in themselves, the Aristotelian-inflected CA moves beyond respect for the sentient subject as a rights bearer to a concern for the striving of that subject. Consequently, from a CA standpoint an \u201cinjustice centrally involves <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">significant striving</emphasis> blocked by not just <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">harm</emphasis> but also <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wrongful thwarting</emphasis>, whether negligent or deliberate\u201d24 (p. 8 (emphasis in original)). \u201cAgency\u201d is thus core to justice in this animal inflected CA, as acknowledging and respecting the multiple forms of agency expressed by animals qualifies the justice owed them. Accordingly, multispecies justice can be conceived from a CA perspective as actions that preserve and promote the agency of animals in realizing the species-specific forms of life that are natural to them.</p><p>While conceiving justice in more-than-human terms is a welcome development in CA thinking, the \u201canimal justice\u201d advanced by Nussbaum is limiting. This is because it inadvertently imposes a form of anthropocentrism in profiling the subjects of moral standing\u2014the very anthropocentrism that Nussbaum criticizes Korsgaard25 and Wise26 for espousing. To fasten moral standing on sentience as the ground of subjectivity, is to perpetuate a centering of morality on the heightened sense of self that is definitive of humans. This is evident in Nussbaum's conclusion that humanely killing fish for food is normally permissible as they don't have a well-developed sense of themselves as subjects existing across time (c.f27). For Nussbaum, they are seen to experience pleasure and pain, but not \u201cthemselves\u201d as experiencing subjects. The choice to delimit moral value to animals with an abstractly rationalized subjectivity is thus to privilege certain forms of striving. This view arbitrarily marginalizes the agency of much life on our planet. Should a focus be placed on the \u201cstriving of life\u201d, rather than the subjectivity of that life, a more expansive moral horizon comes into view. This decentering of the CA from an implicit human pivot can be assisted by an engagement with biocentric philosophy. As this perspective's most noted advocate, Paul Taylor argues for a biocentrism that is sensitive to how each organism is a \u201ccenter-of-a-life\u201d that is \u201cpursuing its own good in its own way, according to its species-specific nature\u201d28 (p. 45). With considerable systematicity, he reasons an \u201cattitude of respect for nature\u201d that is orientated by nonmaleficence and noninterference. Such respect for the agency of life fashions a corrective to justice thinking in this space by producing a biocentric CA (BCA) that is more \u201cmultispecies\u201d in its concerns.</p><p>Although both Nussbaum's animal-centered CA and Taylor's biocentrism are essentially individual in their moral ontologies, this does not discount the value of ecosystems. Afterall, life is shaped by its evolutionary history and the character of the environment in which it finds itself. Capabilities are the outcome of an organism's ability to express its agency in interaction with the environment. \u201cNaturalness\u201d is not what matters\u2014thriving is a matter of resources, opportunities and constraints an environment affords the individual. The history of progress in justice thinking has largely involved expanding recognition of who counts as a subject of justice through a mix of empathy and rationality. Empathy allowed us to imagine ourselves as another, and rationality enabled us to establish principles governing how others should be respectfully treated. From ethnic minorities, women, children and the mentally disabled, expanding this moral circle of inclusion has nonetheless been fashioned by appeals to similarity with those already included29. Multispecies justice is different. It challenges our moral imagination and our ability to \u201cknow\u201d different ways of striving. Nussbaum suggests that sympathetic imagining can help us \u201cto extend and refine our moral judgements in this area\u201d14 (p. 355). In what follows, we present the findings of how such sympathetic imagining can be stimulated by consciously immersing oneself in a space where life is abundantly evident and by storytelling about such life to yield a sense of personal identification with it.</p><p>By using an embodied methodology and a vocabulary built on species traits (sensu30,31), this study explored human-nonhuman relationalities through a series of interactive activities in eight workshops across different urban locations displaying novel ecological configurations. By drawing on the field of functional ecology32, 33\u201334 and using it as a means for unpacking what is \u201cnatural\u201d for different organisms we provide a much-needed link between multispecies justice and ecological science. As will be demonstrated, this facilitates articulation and reflection on what may thwart the form of agency characteristic of an organism and help identify how an injustice may manifest (see Fig. 1). We argue for the feasibility that novel ecological configurations may offer equal or greater opportunities for organisms than would historical ecosystems. It is thereby reasonable to conclude that a novel ecological configuration could theoretically provide an equal level of multispecies justice as a non-novel one. Moreover, it is possible to conceive that such novel ecologies may actually enhance opportunities for (some) organisms to express their agency in otherwise ecologically denuded landscapes, for example in our urban areas. These emergent ecosystems are a less explored field of urban research and practice35,36. Still, what is known indicates that they can contribute to urban biodiversity conservation37,38, social-ecological resilience39, 40\u201341, and multispecies justice42. This aligns with the study's findings which demonstrate an enhanced understanding of the role of more-than-human agencies in shaping space and time. They also underscore the potential of novel ecologies to provide valuable insights into fostering opportunities for multispecies flourishing.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conceptual diagram of the capability approach: justice as agent flourishing via functionings.</emphasis></p><p>This diagram illustrates a conceptual representation of the Capability Approach through agency\u2014ability to influence, shape, relate, be, and do\u2014as central to the processes and outcomes of justice. It is via functioning that agencies can be enacted (or not) within the constraints of the environmental conditions, allowing for organisms to flourish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p>Exploring multispecies capabilities using participatory workshops and engagement strategies in these novel ecologies cultivated acts of noticing43,44 among participants. This enabled them to better situate the connections between human-nonhuman species, envision positive uses of greenspaces, and more generally embrace a multispecies approach to NBS planning and design. These acts of noticing helped participants cultivate newfound appreciations of the interconnection between species, soil, insects, rubbish, roads, and other human-made structures which they connected through memories, stories, and experiences.</p><p>The results highlight how local communities can actively envision and design NBS that support and acknowledge nonhuman species through three key ideas: agency, vulnerabilities, and opportunities. In the first instance, the workshop improved understanding of the role of more-than-human agencies in shaping space and time. Secondly, it helped participants' understanding of social and environmental vulnerabilities through issues like displacement, ownership, and misrecognition. The third finding highlighted the potential of novel ecologies to offer valuable insights for fostering opportunities for multispecies flourishing. Understanding more-than-human agencies, which can be understood as the functions and capacities of expression of living organisms in relation to others, and the vulnerabilities that hinder those agencies, presents pathways to cultivate and design strategies that allow those agencies to thrive and flourish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">More-than-human agencies</emphasis></p><p>More-than-human agencies were conveyed through two key components: niche creation and encounter-interaction. Niche creation was expressed as a capability of individuals within ecological systems to realize their own functionings or expressions in shaping and co-shaping their environment, in crafting their \u201chome\u201d and space. Species agencies in these novel ecologies were seen as taking over space. In some instances, their agencies were suffocating or preventing other species from thriving. Species like that are \u201ccreepers\u201d, \u201cclimbers\u201d, and can \u201ccarpet the ground\u201d, because they \u201c\u2026aren't indigenous species [\u2026] they've really overtaken and [are] strangling out some of the trees there as well\u201d [W07]. The agency of plants and animals in these spaces seemed to be reliant on their nativeness, particularly in Melbourne [W06, W07, W08]. Despite this, towards the end of the workshops, the agencies of these niche creators were considered as stabilizers of the riverbanks and an expression of what is possible in the confined spaces that occur between hard borders (roads, fences and footpaths) and soft borders (soil in the banks) and highly disturbed landscapes. Novel ecologies were seen as being protectors and refugia. The density, thickness, and different levels of plants and trees create hiding spaces for snakes, birds, and other critters. Natural processes of decay and weathering form a \u201ctangle of branches and fallen trees [which] create a small inaccessible place where the trimmer could not go. So, it leaves a potential refuge for small animals and birds\u201d [W05] and a sense of safety and a nest for people [W08, W05]. Agency was also expressed as the capacity to connect or of novel ecologies as conduits, providing space for movement, reproduction and other functions to occur.</p><p>Agency as encounters-interactions emphasized humans, plants, animals, soils, trees, roads, water and other elements as being with each other and reacting to each other in ways that encourage or thwart their agencies. Within these novel ecologies, abiotic elements function as platforms for growth, for life to grow. Some of these included \u201cbig rocks with the fungi growing or the moss growing, lichen, and stuff like that\u2026\u201d and rubbish and weeds as preventing this growth [W08]. Certain elements such as soil, water, the river and certain species, are life-supporting elements; whilst the interactions with the built environment and some of its negative effects such as compacting and industrial contamination, as preventing growth [W07]. Living with signs of abandonment, however, was also part of these environments, with \u201c\u2026the sense that there are all these sort of industrial degraded areas that are being reclaimed by plants\u201d [W08], or that \u201cpiles of rubble and other unknown material were making the site in a particular kind of way, more wetter\u201d [W04], or with rubbish like \u201c\u2026aluminium cans and chunks of PVC pipe, there's an entire bed head, which was kind of interesting, and that's embedded in the organic garbage. It's like a weed\u201d [W06].</p><p>Study sites that included rivers or nearby waterbodies showcased both niche creation and encounter-interaction. Rivers were seen as agents in themselves and as having agentic forces. Sometimes as a threat, with the agency of the river causing conflict and disturbing the thriving of human-nonhuman species: \u201c[t]o me the creek is a kind of a menace, really [\u2026] It's [a] polluted thing that sometimes rises and wrecks what we're trying to do\u201d [W08]. However, when the river is able to flood and extend itself, it is able to support much more wildlife [W07]. But niche creation and encounters-interactions went beyond river systems and extended to notions of water as a vital force that continuously shaped the landscape and arguments for water to be allowed to flow freely and adapt to the site, functioning as water retention places, as a rising force [W02] and the interaction of water with abandoned sites to shape each other into the future [W01,02,07,08]. Like water, long-lived intergenerational beings such as River Redgum trees were perceived as having powerful agencies which allow them to experience the landscape \u201clike a history book\u201d, revealing its spatial-temporal changes and transformations [W07].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vulnerabilities: (il)legality and misrecognition</emphasis></p><p>Vulnerabilities, threats, impacts and risks to individuals, species and social-ecological communities were identified as barriers to multispecies flourishing in these novel ecologies. Being vulnerable to land use changes, and having unclear boundaries and ownership, often leads to contestation with little room to consider the lives of nonhuman beings inhabiting these spaces. A first understanding of vulnerability came from the idea of displacement and erasure. This was evident through underlying conflicts and ambiguities around notions of ownership and land-use regulations at each site where the workshosp were conducted. Ownership was expressed by participants, particularly in locations like Melbourne and NYC, as a deep-rooted problem that promotes focusing on self-interest and suppressing consideration for multispecies collectives. These conflicts, tensions, and trade-offs between urban development needs and the formation of novel ecosystems emerge primarily because these spaces are not recognized as NBS or as having social-ecological value in their present form. This misrecognition, stemming from environmental governance and legislation and the public, in general, ends up creating narratives of (il)legality\u2014what is allowed and expected to \u201cbe\u201d in a space. Thus, who \u201cowns\u201d the space and under which legislation and governing authority dictate how life unfolds in these spaces. An abandoned parking lot in Ireland was a site sitting between different ownership statuses, positioning it in a space of ambiguity between legal constructs of private ownership and the river and its edges, considered a commons [W01].</p><p>Vulnerabilities were also conveyed from misrecognitions that highlighted the time span of living beings. While some species were revered for their life spans, with long-lived species considered \u201cmajestic\u201d [W01] and \u201cwise\u201d [W08], fast-lived species did not seem to have these recognitions\u2014unless they were pollinators. Fast-lived species, like the ones typically found in novel ecologies, such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Taraxacum officinale</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Artemisia vulgaris</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Plantago</emphasis> spp., because of their abilities to withstand harsher and more inhospitable environments, were recognized as being a manifestation that matched the reality of anthropogenic, novel habitats. Time was also viewed as a vulnerability from an intergenerational sense. The loss of species and ecosystems was also tied to the fragility in which these ecologies always seem to be, which is in a state of transition, and ultimately, loss. Participants reflected on the sadness that arises when considering the loss of access to these species, particularly in relation to the experiences that children can no longer have in these spaces. This was related to accessibility and knowledge exchange because \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">\u2026 if you don't have access to these things, there's no one then showing you the things that they used to do as a child. And it all just gets erased</emphasis>.\u201d [W04].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multispecies capabilities to promote the agency of living beings</emphasis></p><p>Preserving and promoting the agency of living beings in realizing the species-specific forms of life that are natural to them was identified through four actions: gentle management, pedagogical engagement, novel habitat enrichment, and the creation of new legal protections. Firstly, a strategy expressed by participants was to adopt a gentle management [W01] or a mindful management [W03] approach that allows species to be, giving them space to exist, with some degree of \u201cin between management\u201d. This could take the form of \u201cnot weeding as many dandelions, gentle pruning\u2014some of the heavier stuff needs to be cut so some of the lighter stuff can grow\u2014thin it a bit\u201d [W01]. Sometimes this was expressed as a separation between people and what was considered \u201cnatural\u201d with a group expressing the need to \u201cleave it alone or semi-managed, keep people separate to make sure that certain species like children and dogs don't get into areas\u201d [W05]. Interestingly, this expression of gentle actions was also expressed through strategies of slow replacement in which the role of non-native or invasive species was recognized as important in the habitat, but with the intention to slowly replace them with native species \u201cbecause this is what's going to make this place flourish with more biodiversity\u201d [W08]; a less managed space can be helpful and can have benefits but there has to be some level of care and protection [W06]. Participants showcased more radical visions from participants wanting to \u201cgive back space\u201d for others to flourish, such as by \u201cabandonment of buildings and space to allow ecosystems to flourish; with notions of science fiction and post-apocalyptic futures\u201d [W06].</p><p>This array of opinions, allied by a shared sense of the need for gentle management signals the nascency of thinking on the links between ecological novelty and multispecies justice. As with many debates in nature conservation45,46, this reflects the fact that deliberations on this topic are positioned within evolving value frameworks that are inherently interwoven with unfolding debates at the intersection of conservation science and practice. At this fledgling stage in public conversations about novel ecosystems and MSJ, this diversity of views should not so much be seen as conflict as the airing of ideas on what should be teased out as the twinning of these concepts develops into an intervention agenda. Accordingly, the exchange of such perspectives offers an opportunity for deep learning as the reasoning of others prompts reflection on one's own opinions. Conducted in the cordial fashion exhibited in the workshops, this can facilitate a spiral of collaborative re-learning as participants share thoughts on what was seen, said, and experienced in the walks, storytelling, and role playing game.</p><p>Increasing ecological knowledge and awareness through pedagogical engagement as a capability for multispecies flourishing was another key action and recurrent theme expressed throughout all workshops. Engagement, bringing people back to these sites, and showing messy and scruffy ecologies were some of the challenges highlighted for raising awareness. Novel ecologies were also seen as pedagogical spaces, with them becoming demonstration sites [W01/W02]. Although education might seem like a human-centered activity, as participants reflected on their story of a family of wombats and their entangled lives with other species, ecosystems and humans, they highlighted the importance of childhood education and fostering stewardship and ecological knowledge for action, and as such their story reflecting multispecies entanglements in light of climate change and disasters [W06]. Creating a pedagogical landscape to enable multispecies capabilities to flourish also highlights interconnectedness and interdependence, \u201cin which people, wildlife, technology, and infrastructure are part of the landscape\u201d [W05].</p><p>Enriching the health, wellbeing, and integrity of novel habitats was the third point of action, in which participants understood river systems and novel landscapes as entities in and of themselves. A baseline for multispecies flourishing was understood across regions as the need to improve relations of co-existence which would create a base point to allow species to adapt to the local context and climate. This included moving from actions of control to actions of co-existence and working with the river to allow its species to flourish and adapt to an uncertain future, including a hotter climate [W07]. This climate and species-needs adaptation was expressed as \u201crecognizing and adapting to [a] sustainable management regime to the changing climate, and the species lifespans and how that's changing. So being more adaptive to that.\u201d [W07]. Participants in Melbourne gave an example: brown butterflies live a short life, it would be good to provide them with a habitat that is enriching for them, where they can lay their eggs, eat and reproduce, such as wildflowers [W08] and in Ireland as enhancing capacities in water retention; water as a vital element, making the sites as sponges [W03].</p><p>Finally, participant discussions from workshops in Melbourne, NYC, and in Ireland revolved around creating new legal protections for these local ecologies. This was proposed as an approach that could create multispecies capabilities. \u201cThe legality of things and regulatory frameworks and how they can also be protected, just as we protect and put into law and constitution so many things\u201d [W08] was considered critical for many participants. The idea of community agreements, policies and political agendas was suggested as ways to protect contested sites, such as the abandoned lot in NYC [W02]. This could take the form of \u201c\u2026legislation [that] will allow for space and protection for dynamism within the space\u201d [W02]. Developing protections that \u201cprotect the creek from development, which will protect the water supply and make the river ecosystem more resilient to climate change [W08]. Clarifying space ownership could provide better ways of managing the contestation of space. For example, \u201ca community garden or to manage certain areas or friends' groups might work across it. It might be council and then a bit of VicTrack and a bit of\u2026 but it'd be interesting because I don't know who would get a permit to get volunteers working right next to a railway. It would have to be a paid role and you'd have to fully go and rip it out and stuff.\u201d [W06]. This also highlights the different actors, agencies and formal/informal arrangements all interacting with these spaces. Finally, and more radically, participants in Melbourne discussed \u201ccentering our governing bodies and systems through the lives and needs of other species, like the trees which live for hundreds of years\u201d [W08].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Using the CA to understand multispecies justice has given us a tool to explore how novel ecologies and the people entangled with them can help us reframe this emerging nature. As a framework for multispecies development, the CA emphasizes the promotion of wellbeing and multispecies flourishing by enabling humans and other beings to realize their functionings by having opportunities, freedoms to express and enact their \u201cbeings and doings\u201d. Enabling capabilities for multispecies flourishing, as we have explored through the embodied and relational processes in the workshops, can assist NBS in cultivating spaces for discussion or consideration of multispecies thriving. This can further be advanced by recognizing and improving our knowledge of other species agencies and integrating this into NBS thinking\u2014planning, design and implementation. In the context of novel ecologies, in the following propositions, we discuss how this can be accomplished:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Implement a \u201cshared vulnerabilities\u201d framework to plan NBS</emphasis></p><p>This research showed that different dimensions of vulnerabilities are key to identifying processes and outcomes that can be unjust. In his work with capabilities and climate change, Schlosberg47 (p.458) offers us a practical framework for mapping local vulnerabilities to climate change which \u201ccan help us understand the expected environmental impacts and the threats to basic human capabilities that rely on the continued functioning of environmental processes and conditions.\u201d This provides a practical guide to identify risks, disadvantages, and threats at the local level. If we expand our understanding of vulnerabilities as a shared space of relational impacts, shared vulnerabilities across living beings and communities9, we can then start to imagine collectively ways to adapt, repair, and minimize damage, displacement, and suffering. NBS planning tends to focus on environmental benefits and ecosystem services but often overlooks their crucial role in vulnerability reduction or amplification48, 49\u201350. NBS can find inspiration in applying a \u201cshared vulnerabilities\u201d approach to examining injustices, both in process and outcomes. NBS can integrate relational models for measuring and mapping \u201cshared vulnerabilities\u201d. These models can use existing frameworks that assess vulnerability of social-ecological systems in which threats, vulnerabilities, and adaptation capacities are understood as interconnected variables49,51, and account for multiple exposures52, but with a deeper framing that moves beyond understanding ecological systems as providers of ecosystem services. Rather, detailed local assessments of multispecies capabilities can be integrated into these models to account for shared impacts and responses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recognize novel ecologies as pedagogical landscapes to bridge MSJ and NBS</emphasis></p><p>Novel ecologies offer an opportunity to examine and advance our understanding of (in)justices in urban landscapes for several reasons. Harms or injustices occur when there is a combination of power dynamics and interests that exert domination, render invisible, and misrepresent53, and this is particularly relevant when looking at the transformation of ecosystems through different socio-economic processes that displace and eradicate the lives of the Other, both human-nonhuman beings13. These processes create spaces that are abandoned, deemed as wastelands, and forgotten. With the use of an embodied methodology, through this research, we have shown that it is \u201cpossible for the Self to deepen connections with Distant and perhaps even Unknown Others and to begin to grasp the Others' identity, experience, vulnerability, and suffering\u201d13 p.284. These unloved others54, thus, can function as a bridge to connect NBS with multispecies justice thinking.</p><p>When looking at urgent challenges in cities\u2014like water scarcity, extreme heat, and other events, and their compounding and relational impacts and effects on justice, NBS needs to broaden its scope to both: include more-than-human thinking3, but also shift its focus on protecting only landscapes that are deemed ecologically significant and/or restoring areas based on ideals of historical ecologies. Anthropogenic, novel ecosystems containing novel assemblages are passive, resilient, low-cost solutions that can be part of NBS. These marginal ecologies offer alternative opportunities to address these global impacts, and focusing on the capabilities of these passive ecosystems that are already working can offer insights into how NBS can become a more \u201ccomprehensive\u201d approach to these challenges. This aligns with similar work that highlights the value of novel ecosystems for their potential to address certain challenges: climate change impacts, supply a series of ecosystem services, provide habitat for biodiversity, including threatened species, and serve as a platform for social-ecological experimentation and enhancing multispecies justice38,42,55, 56, 57, 58\u201359.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Link capacities, traits, and systemic circumstances</emphasis></p><p>Using life history traits (key factors\u2014such as growth rate and size\u2014that affect a living being's survival and reproduction ability) both for articulating and relating to the otherness of other species and using it to ground and further the capability approach to multispecies justice is still in its infancy. The functionings and capabilities are captured and specified by species-specific traits (e.g., specialized beak of a hummingbird), and the growing information about traits can be used to understand what may constitute an opportunity for who. We see potential for the two perspectives to frame and extend each other's applicability: The work on functional traits helps articulate the otherness and needs of other species, thus providing a much-needed ecological grounding to the capacities, whilst the CA affords an extended discussion about how to think about past, current and future species assemblages. It also establishes a connection between traits and agency, which has been mostly implicit or given an evolutionary meaning in the traits literature. The stronger ecological foundation may help address the still unresolved questions of what \u201cfair opportunities\u201d may mean when life (defined by traits), is always constrained by environmental circumstances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Plan and design NBS as creator of capabilities</emphasis></p><p>We found that a recognition of agencies, vulnerabilities, and capabilities of living beings in novel ecologies challenges perceptions and awareness of NBS by helping us rethink the way we relate to \u201cabandoned\u201d or so-called wasted sites in our urban regions. NBS can therefore be understood <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">as creators of capabilities</emphasis>: thinking how NBS design interventions can be assessed in terms of human-non-human capabilities (i.e., access to valuable functionings). This can be for example, through the recognition of more-than-human socialities43, thus creating environments that enable other species to have spaces of engagement, nourishment and sociality. Tsing's arts of noticing60 as a strategy \u201cto appreciate the multiple temporal rhythms and trajectories of the assemblage\u201d60 (p. 24) can be an awareness-raising strategy for NBS. Just as NBS initiates participatory and democratic processes with diverse human stakeholders to understand their preferences, values, needs, and capabilities, it can explore and develop new platforms that enable communicative human-nonhuman animal relationships or interspecies communication. This can be done through creative/theoretical ways such as exploration of future fictional futures61 and improving our knowledge of the needs, vulnerabilities, sufferings, and aspirations of Others, expanding beyond the animal, and considering plants, fungi, and ecosystems. NBS can also work toward embedding intergenerational capabilities in NBS processes. Integrating intergenerational, evolutionary capabilities \u2013 as the ability to change or continue into the future\u2014would require considering the lifespan, environmental conditions, projections, and vulnerabilities of multiple beings.</p><p>These strategies can cultivate a unique ethic of care, empathy, and understanding of more-than-human worlds and needs. A deeper engagement with an ethic of empathy and compassion that includes the discarded, the unloved, and the stray62 provides some guidance to help us navigate the complexity of NBS planning within an MSJ framework. Rather than guided by a technocratic or instrumental framing such as the ecosystem services63, the CA moves away from economic metrics, and instead accounts for shared vulnerabilities and deprivations, looking into the future to cultivate opportunities that allow more-than-human agencies to thrive and flourish.</p><p>In conclusion, our work uses the CA framed under a multispecies justice understanding to explore how urban novel landscapes or marginal ecologies provide barriers and opportunities for enabling multispecies capabilities when planning NBS. We examine how an exchange of ideas structured by methods designed to stimulate empathy, relationality, and an embodied understanding of species perspectives elicit deeper meanings through reflection and co-learning that enhance our appreciation of what a focus on capabilities can offer to urban biodiversity conservation, particularly when looking at marginal, novel habitats. Additionally, we identify and unpack how key dimensions of NBS planning, design, and conservation in cities can apply multispecies justice considerations in realizing these. This work does not provide measurements or assessments of capabilities but rather offers new interpretations of how thinking in terms of capabilities supplies scope for identifying synergies between multispecies justice and NBS. Organized around a series of theoretically informed workshops, the research findings reported in this paper emphasize how such participatory methods can be mobilized to prompt, probe, and propose new ways of understanding nature and our relationship with it. By expanding who/what counts as part of the moral community, these methods help reframe what conservation is and could be. This calls forth new decision situations and considerations as the marginal, forgotten, and often disliked spaces of our cities are reconceived. New geographies of meaning are thereby kindled wherein spaces such as \u201cwaste ground\u201d are transformed into \u201cnovel ecosystems\u201d that provoke ethical reflection previously eclipsed by development agendas. This unlocks opportunities for the identification of NBS interventions as bridges between expanded understandings of conservation and justice in designing and managing the built environment.</p><p>However, our approach is not without its limitations. Notably, empathizing \u201cwith\u201d species experiences is not experiencing \u201cas\u201d species64. Seeking appreciation of how nonhuman others may perceive their environment via storytelling and role play is thus an inherently imperfect endeavor. Nonetheless, we contend that these methods prompt a curiosity in striving of non-human life that encourages a moral sensitivity to what a multispecies justice might entail. By inducing reflection on what conceptions of \u201cnature\u201d matter, this approach facilitates dialog on how to exploit and create policies and designs that rethink the nature of our cities by rethinking the natures within them. Doing so can help foment new constituencies among the public, politicians, and professional practitioners to effect change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>This study used an embodied methodology grounded in the Capability Approach (CA) as well as different theoretical-methodological strategies to cultivate a process of co-learning and understanding65, 66\u201367 (see Fig. 2). While traditionally focused on human well-being, the CA has been expanded to consider nonhuman species, emphasizing sentience, intrinsic value, and the innate drive of all beings to flourish. Using this as both a conceptual lens and methodological foundation, eight participatory workshops with seventy-seven participants were conducted at sites characterized as novel ecosystems in the cities of Australia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 3), Ireland (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 4), and the USA (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 1).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conceptual diagram relating the capability approach to a MSJ research approach.</emphasis></p><p>This diagram illustrates the approach to operationalize MSJ through the biocentric understanding of the Capability Approach. Embodiment, relationality, and empathy\u2014essential practices of MSJ\u2014are methodologically explored through transect walks, storytelling, and role-playing.</p><p>We intentionally situate this fieldwork within urban novel ecologies\u2014self-sustaining ecosystems that emerge with little or no human intervention\u2014in cities worldwide. These urban ecosystems are often described as vacant, derelict, and host to novel ecosystems (i.e., ecosystems that have been significantly altered by human activity and now exist in new, self-sustaining forms). We consider these ecosystems to be a passive type of NBS, and for this study included river margins, railway corridors, and abandoned and \u201cin-between\u201d spaces in multiple urban locations (see Fig. 4). Given the emergent nature of these spaces, it provides a space to explore how nonhuman beings enact their agency, with little human intervention and control, and flourish and shape these ecosystems. The fact that they host nonnative species, in many cases \u201cunwanted\u201d (labeled as \u201cinvasive\u201d species), also offers opportunities to explore how participants reflect on multispecies interactions and the intrinsic value of non-human species in these novel urban habitats.</p><p>To facilitate co-learning, relational thinking, and deeper engagement with each site, participants engaged in sensory, experiential, and reflective activities to immerse themselves in urban novel ecologies, observe interspecies interactions, and explore spatial dynamics (see Fig. 3). Through transect walks, they physically experienced these environments, fostering a direct connection with place. Storytelling provided a means to share personal and collective narratives, deepening relational understandings of urban ecosystems, while role-playing encouraged participants to adopt the perspectives of nonhuman species, cultivating empathy and awareness. They fostered reciprocity, care, and responsibility toward shared spaces, recognizing the interconnectedness of humans, places, and nonhuman beings. The study assessed whether these embodied approaches could shift participants' attitudes toward more collaborative, empathetic, and inclusive planning practices that actively consider multispecies perspectives in urban design and planning.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Photograph depicting one of the workshops conducted in Dublin, Ireland.</emphasis></p><p>This site is adjacent to the National College of Art and Design, Dublin 8, Ireland. It is called \u201cThe Field\u201d and has been transformed from an abandoned parking lot to a landscape with a novel assemblage of species and ecological functions. The photograph contextualizes the types of novel ecologies the research focuses on. Author: M. O'Donnell</p><p>Each workshop brought together diverse local stakeholder groups (see Fig. 4), including communities of practice (e.g., urban planners), epistemic communities (e.g., academics), and interest groups (e.g., residents)68. By incorporating diverse perspectives and activities, the workshops provided a collaborative platform for stakeholders to identify the lives of other species, how these ecologies have been formed, and what a multispecies future could look like. This aligns with relational approaches to sustainability transformations that recognize the value in the distinct lifeworlds in \u201csharing spaces\u201d69, potentially able to generate paradigm, policy and practice shifts in green space planning These workshops also foster an understanding of the novel ecosystem's cultural and relational significance, building empathy toward other communities and non-human species through participatory methods such as storytelling and role-playing15,70. Providing participants with the opportunity to assume other roles and reflect on how to \u201cwalk together in a world of many worlds\u201d69 provides a safe space to help advance the quality of decision-making71, where the future is imagined not only from a social and cultural needs perspective but also considering ecological integrity and the capabilities and agencies of non-human beings.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Workshop design: activities, locations, and participants.</emphasis></p><p>This figure describes: <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> the three activities carried out in the workshops, \u201cfollowing through walking\u201d or transect walks; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis> the location and type of novel ecosystem in each location; and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis> participant composition, number of participants (pn) per workshop, and the workshop identifier (W01-W08).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Embodied activities</emphasis></p><p>The workshops implemented a series of interrelated activities that included: 1) following through walking72, 2) sharing and imagining through storytelling as co-learning, and 3) role-playing to de-center our positionalities and understandings of the world (see Fig. 4). The activities were identified through a systematic literature review on co-design73 and chosen based on their role for sympathetic imagining which challenges perceptions, attitudes, biases and allows participants to reimagine the agency, abilities, needs and aspirations of other species14. These embodied practices encouraged openness, curiosity, and critical self-awareness of others' functionings, vulnerabilities, needs, and opportunities to enhance multispecies livelihoods. These types of methodologies encourage acts of attentiveness44 and of cultivating ecological empathy\u2014through embeddedness, fostering more-than-human awareness and perspective-taking across multiple timescales15. It fosters attitudes of reciprocity, recognizing the interconnectedness between human and non-human beings. Such shifts in attitude may promote deeper collaboration, nurturing care and responsibility towards shared spaces69, and cultivating more inclusive and relational ways of understanding and caring for urban ecosystems74. The workshops followed the same format throughout each of the locations, however, the species assigned to participants during the role-playing exercise altered, as these \u201croles\u201d were based upon the participants' interactions during the walk section of the workshop and the human-nonhuman relations that emerged through subsequent discussions.</p><p>The first activity consisted of \u201ctransect walk\u201d or following through walking practice through a novel ecosystem to observe and experience the wild, spontaneous, and other life forms and characteristics that emerge. This embodied approach allowed participants to understand \u201c<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">that when experiences are directly inhabited, they produce different meanings and \u201csituated knowledges</emphasis>\u201d\u201d75. Participants were provided handouts with prompts to assist in immersing themselves within the spaces, such as identifying species and environmental characteristics, to try to notice the sensorial aspects such as smells and textures, and to reflect on opportunities and challenges to be discussed as a group following the walk. The second activity consisted of reflecting on the experience of walking and sharing of participants' feelings and behaviors, and identifying other nonhuman species and elements that formed part of that experience. This then led to a co-learning activity that involved a storytelling exercise. Storytelling offers insight into history, values, knowledge, and culture while encouraging participants to reflect on these elements and engage in forward-thinking76. Using a \u201cnature-based desired futures\u201d approach \u201coffers space for reflection, creative exploration, and weaving together of new, hopeful, caring, emancipatory stories\u201d77.</p><p>The third activity consisted of a role-playing exercise in which participants were asked to imagine how their stories from the previous activity were experienced and enacted not through their selves, but through the experience of another species. Games are widely seen as effective tools for social learning, enabling us to acquire new knowledge and perspectives to affect social-ecological transformations71. Each participant was assigned a species identified during the walk, e.g., a particular plant or animal (including human). A round table discussion was then held, and participants were asked to explain their roles, needs, and aspirations in their environment and together collaborate by highlighting interactions and relationships between them and charting future pathways for the story they imagined. To finalize the workshop, we all reflected on the research process, the different activities, how they related to each other, and if there were any learnings or new understandings that had emerged. Each 2 h workshop consisted of 7\u201315 participants recruited by identifying researchers engaged with local novel ecologies in the different cities and by identifying groups interested in novel ecologies. This assisted in the identification of local sites and inviting participants. At all study sites, workshops were organized with the assistance of local gatekeepers and leaders, mostly from local universities, and community, and environmental organizations. Though working with local gatekeepers or leaders can present challenges, such as limited access and longer research time frames78, building these relationships with them was vital to our research process. Given local leaders have an established level of trust within their communities, this was a useful strategy to engage participants in our research process.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Approach to data analysis</emphasis></p><p>Each workshop was fully voice recorded and manually transcribed. In addition, participants made written records of their experiences during the walks and storytelling activities. The researchers facilitating the workshops took notes on observations throughout each of the workshops. All this data was collected, systematized, analyzed, and coded through an iterative process using both deductive and inductive approaches (See coded data in SM1). The purpose of using a deductive approach is that it provides a framework or \u201cstart-list\u201d that anticipates certain concepts being in the data aided by existing theory and the research aims and questions79. For this analysis, we used a start list with core concepts such as functionings, agency, needs, abilities, and opportunities. However, this analysis is not only a top-down, theory-driven process, but it is also iterative and uses an inductive or bottom-up approach in which the data creates new meanings through a detailed analytical process of coding the text as themes and concepts emerge79,80. Using this two-way process provides a starting framework to understand the data, but also ensures that important and critical meanings are not missed or obscured from initially looking at pre-existing themes79.</p><p>Similar concepts were then collapsed into similar categories to make the data set manageable and identify relationships between second-order and higher-level themes79. (See SM1, Tables 1-3 for the coded data, sub-themes and categories). The Supplementary Material includes 3 tables which correspond to the three workshop activities: 1) activity 1 (walk): coded data into second-level subthemes (e.g., \u201cspecies being and doing\u201d, species interconnections, and function of space) and higher-level themes (e.g., more-than-human agencies), 2) activity 2 (storytelling): coded actions to improve human-nonhuman relationalities and creating opportunities for multispecies flourishing, and 3) activity 3 (role-playing game): coded to identify functionings and potential opportunities (capabilities) for multispecies flourishing. The initial coding was conducted by the lead author, and the following inductive iterations of the data analysis were interpreted and re-interpreted through reflective discussions amongst all authors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors express their sincere gratitude to the participants, whose invaluable contributions of time, knowledge, and personal experiences were fundamental to this research.

These efforts aim to enhance biodiversity while providing services such as carbon sequestration, water purification and soil fertility.<br/>The whitepaper emphasises biodiversity's critical role in economic stability, noting that According to , wildlife vertebrate populations have declined by 73% over the past 50 years, underscoring the urgent need for ecosystem restoration.<br/>Triodos Bank is already funding nature-based projects such as the restoration of 23,000 acres in Scotland with a \u00a320.55m loan to Oxygen Conservation. It is also supporting the creation of a large woodland in South West England through a \u00a33.85m loan to Avon Needs Trees.<br/>Triodos Bank's chief commercial officer Jacco Minnaar said: \"Investing in nature-based solutions is crucial for restoring our natural environment and mitigating the effects of the climate crisis.<br/>\"Our dedication is evident in our emphasis on five interconnected transition themes: energy, food, resources, societal, and wellbeing.<br/>\"By focusing on these themes, we strive to develop a comprehensive approach to sustainability that benefits the environment while also improving the quality of life for communities around the globe.\"<br/>Kunming-Montreal Declaration<br/>Triodos Bank has set targets to report on the impact of its projects by 2026 and reduce negative impacts through engagement with companies in its investment portfolio. These efforts align with global frameworks like the Kunming-Montreal Biodiversity Framework and the UN Principles for Responsible Banking.<br/>The Kunming-Montreal declaration on biodiversity and accompanying Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) was negotiated by the UN and signed by more than 120 nations after a challenging UN-led process during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its headline commitment is to halt the destruction of nature this decade and to accelerate regeneration at an unprecedented scale and pace.<br/>Nature finance gap<br/>Earlier this year, the OECD\u00a0<br/>Meeting this goal requires a $5bn uplift within 15 months, equivalent to around a 30% increase.<br/>Finance will be needed for conservation, restoration and creation alike, and will need to be targeted at different ecosystems. Historic under-investment in coastal and marine ecosystems, for example, will also need to be addressed urgently.<br/>The report emphasises that wealthy nations will need to do most of the heavy lifting, providing support to nations and regions in the global south facing nature risks including extreme weather, urbanisation and increased manufacturing to meet export demands.<br/>Inform your nature strategy at edie 25<br/>Readers leading the development or delivery of their organisation's nature strategy are encouraged to attend edie's biggest event of the year, providing ample opportunities for gaining insight, inspiration and new connections.<br/>\u00a0will take place in central London on 26-27 March 2025 and earlybird tickets are on sale NOW!<br/>Taking place across two floors and multiple rooms,\u00a0offers two full days packed with keynote presentations, action-oriented panels, best-practice case studies, and interactive audience-led discussions.

It's no secret that we have used up many non-renewable resources already.</p><p>The ultimate resource, when it comes to natural capital, is that which we classify as renewable.\\xE2\\x80This type of resource can be continuously renewed - but only if we use it sustainably. Treat these assets well and they are our most valuable.\\xE2\\x80Unfortunately, they are more often overexploited. </p><p>Among the damaging repercussions of unsustainable consumption of natural resources are climate change and biodiversity loss, which represent huge risks to human civilization, including economies and markets.  </p><p>Recognising this, an increasing number of companies and countries are pledging to do their bit to address the problem, such as by reducing their own consumption of natural resources, and by cutting greenhouse-gas emissions. But decarbonisation of economies is a challenging process.</p><p>This fact, along with growing awareness of the wide-ranging risks associated with nature loss, has fostered increasing interest in nature-based solutions: efforts to protect and restore natural capital through activities such as afforestation or wetland restoration. Such projects can improve nature's ability to perform carbon sequestration, the process whereby ecosystems trap carbon from the atmosphere.</p><p>New opportunities are emerging for companies to contribute to the renewal of nature and thereby offset their emissions. For example, the growth of voluntary carbon markets enables investors to purchase carbon removal credits, which certify the removal and sequestration of CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a, via nature-based schemes such as forestry projects, or engineered removals. Such credits can contribute to net-zero targets.</p><p>But it is also possible to invest directly in in nature-based solutions, such as forests, peatland or mangroves, in order to access the carbon credits they generate and gain more control over the outcomes of the project. Well-managed nature-based solutions can rehabilitate habitats for wildlife, enhance soil and water quality, and even mitigate flood risk.</p><p>The credits can be sold on to other investors or retired to offset emissions from elsewhere in an institution's portfolio. They can act as a useful hedge against rising carbon prices in the future.</p><p>Investments to help safeguard and replenish natural capital can therefore yield important sustainability benefits and the prospect of financial returns.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Important information</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THIS IS A MARKETING COMMUNICATION</emphasis></p><p>Except where stated as otherwise, the source of all information is Aviva Investors Global Services Limited (AIGSL).

flood resilience, councillors heard.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coun Katie Kimber (Lab, Luddenden Foot) asked senior Calderdale councillors  what steps the council was taking to hold water companies to account for its role in both drought resilience \u2013 given its recent hosepipe ban \u2013 and flood risk management.</p><p>\u201cCan the council clarify how it is working with Yorkshire Water and regulators to ensure investment in infrastructure, nature-based solutions and climate adaption keep pace with the increasing challenges of both scarcity and flooding?\u201d she said.</p><p>Cabinet member for Climate Action and Housing, Coun Scott Patient, said the council was engaging with Yorkshire Water and relevant regulators to ensure \u201crobust\u201d investment in their infrastructure.</p><p>This included nature-based solutions and climate adaptions to help meet both flood and drought risk.</p><p>\u201cGetting that balance right is really important.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve consistently lobbied Yorkshire Water since the 2015 floods to adopt proactive reservoir management to slow down valley flows and reduce flood risk,\u201d he said.</p><p>Coun Patient (Lab, Luddenden Foot) said this had seen the company \u201cdraw down\u201d the amount of water from reservoirs above Hebden Bridge, giving the reservoirs more capacity \u2013 some on purpose but more recently this had happened naturally because, unfortunately, of drought.</p><p>The council welcomed Yorkshire Water\u2019s pilot plan to jointly manage local reservoirs in Calderdale for flood mitigation, and scrutiny work done by councillors headed by Coun Kimber was important, said Coun Patient.</p><p>Their recommendations include identifying a council officer as a first point of contact for waterway pollution issues, making funding available for highways work with gulley cleaning in consideration, expanding use of sustainable drainage systems, exploring external funding opportunities and look at approaches taken by other councils to combat waterway pollution.</p><p>It should also continue working with local landowners, farmers and stakeholders on land management to enhance water quality and management, and educate residents and business owners on steps that can be taken to reduce waterway pollution.</p><p>Pro-active engagement with Yorkshire Water to undertake \u201cmeaningful\u201d work with a specific focus on reducing pollutants in waterways should be undertaken.</p><p>This should include joint development of a detailed work schedule outlining key actions and time frames to see improvements, recommended the scrutiny councillors.</p><p>Coun Patient said Yorkshire Water had willingly participated in that scrutiny process.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url

Powered by solar energy, this zero-energy train cabin features interactive displays, hands-on exhibits and workshops co-created with Just Keep Thinking (JKT), Singapore's largest science and sustainability social media platform. Designed to spark environmental awareness among children and youths, the CDL EcoTrain is a creative approach to community engagement and climate education.</p><p><br/><br/>The CDL EcoTrain, part of the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) upcycling initiative which repurposes decommissioned SMRT cabins, is the first public-facing repurposed train located at a retail mall.<br/><br/>Adjacent to the CDL EcoTrain, the CDL MicroForest represents a bold step in leveraging nature-based solutions to combat climate challenges in dense urban environments. The CDL MicroForest is a 2,800 square feet (sq ft) regenerative tropical microforest, developed in collaboration with experts in ecology and biological sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and with inputs from the National Parks Board (NParks). This pioneering nature-based solution for cooling through greening aims to combat urban heat and biodiversity loss in high-density urban landscapes, serving as a living laboratory to study how microforests can lower temperatures, boost biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.<br/><br/>The creation of the MicroForest is an extension of CDL's long-standing commitment to sustainability and integrating nature in the built environment. Since 2010, CDL has also been voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessments (BIAs) on greenfield sites located within or adjacent to natural habitats before construction. Environmental mitigation measures are also undertaken where necessary.<br/><br/>The launch was graced by Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a tree-planting ceremony alongside representatives from CDL, NParks, NUS, as well as young eco-champions. This symbolic event underscores the strength of the 3P (Public, Private and People) partnership model in advancing urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL's Group Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Climate action thrives on the power of 3P collaboration and innovation. We created the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest as sustainable showcases to complement our ongoing revamp of City Square Mall. Since its opening in 2009, City Square Mall has established itself as Singapore's first eco-mall, home to innovative community spaces for sustainability events and education, such as the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The timely launch of the EcoTrain and MicroForest enhances the Mall's unique position as a family-friendly eco-hub with exciting programmes to nurture future eco-champions and promote sustainable living.\"<br/><br/>Scaling Impact: A Blueprint for Sustainable Cities<br/><br/>As cities worldwide grapple with the effects of climate change, CDL's EcoTrain and MicroForest present scalable, high-impact solutions that can be adapted across urban landscapes. By demonstrating how decommissioned infrastructure can be repurposed for sustainability education and how regenerative tropical microforests can contribute to climate resilience, these projects set a new benchmark for integrating ESG principles into real estate development.<br/><br/>With urban populations expected to continue rising, the need for innovative, nature-based interventions has never been greater. Through these initiatives, CDL showcases how the built environment can harmonise with nature, creating sustainable, livable cities that benefit both people and the planet.<br/><br/>Projects like the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest highlight the power of cross-sector collaboration in driving urban transformation. By investing in climate education and biodiversity restoration, CDL continues to pave the way for a more resilient and environmentally conscious future.       </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC9-P4D3-RWC9-905F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"705\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 19, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

However, evaluating their efficacy in delivering flood risk reduction ecosystem service (FRR-ESS) is usually limited by reliance on qualitative, expert-based \u201cquick-scan\u201d scoring methods. While already challenging for present-day evaluations, this limitation becomes even more significant when addressing future climate scenarios, introducing deep uncertainties in the evaluation. The present study introduces a model-based framework to quantify FRR-ESS provided by coastal NbS, which integrates expert-based assessments with quantitative results from an eco-hydro-morphodynamic numerical model. The model enables a comparative evaluation of individual and combined effects of NbS following a Building Blocks approach. </p><p>By integrating habitat map change prediction in the evaluation, NbS flood reduction response to present and future storm scenarios (i.e. wave climate and sea level rise) are investigated. The methodology is applied to a Mediterranean coastal lagoon in Sicily (Italy), and can be easily adapted to diverse coastal ecosystems. Our findings underscore the significant role of coastal habitats in reducing flood risk and highlight the importance of integrating physically-based modelling into FRR-ESS evaluation. This approach provides a robust and flexible tool for policymakers and stakeholders to make informed decisions that support both ecological sustainability and disaster risk reduction.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Coastal habitats are widely recognized for their contribution to coastal protection against flood hazard. Sand dunes act as natural barriers against rising sea levels1 , 2 , 3 , 4 \u20135 , seagrass meadows effectively dissipate wave energy and entrap cross-shore transported sediment6 , 7 , 8 \u20139  and saltmarsh help attenuate impacts of storm surge and flash floods10 , 11 , 12 \u201313 . Notwithstanding their importance, these habitats are currently experiencing an unprecedented, global-scale decline in both spatial extent and ecological value, driven both by anthropogenic and climatic stressors14 , 15 \u201316 . This decline is expected to be further exacerbated by climate change, which will intensify coastal erosion through sea level rise and more frequent and intense storms. This degradation trend not only implies a loss of the biodiversity these habitats host, but also undermines the stream of benefits they provide to humankind17 .</p><p>In this regard, Nature-based Solutions (NbS) are rising as effective ecosystem-based measures to mitigate flood risk and adapt to climate change18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 23 \u201324 . Findings increasingly support the idea that these solutions may offer benefits that surpass their associated costs and, in certain instances, can be more cost-effective than traditional hard engineering solutions25 , 26 \u201327 . Moreover, NbS are acknowledged as equitable solutions that ensure that the benefits of enhanced resilience are accessible to all communities, including those that are economically disadvantaged or disproportionately vulnerable to climate impacts28 ,29 . Although some studies highlight potential, unintended disbenefits associated with their implementation30 ,31 , numerous cases worldwide confirm these advantages13 ,24 ,32 ,33 .</p><p>Evaluation of flood risk reduction of NbS is traditionally pursued through cost-benefit analyses or more in general monetary-based assessment34 . However, these type of assessments inherently overlook the non-monetary benefits that NbS provide38 ,39 . Ecosystem Service (ESS)-based frameworks address this limitation by encouraging an equitable treatment of both monetary and non-monetary ecosystem values, placing budgetable benefits (e.g., damage reduction) and non-budgetable benefits (e.g., human well-being, cultural, recreational values) on the same scale17 . Such perspectives support decision-making processes that are more inclusive of ecological and societal needs, fostering planning that is more holistic, just, resilient, and sustainable37 , 38 , 39 , 40 \u201341 .</p><p>Since the ESS concept was made popular by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment42 , the demand for robust and applicable methodologies for ESS assessments has increased. A popular and well-established method is the ESS-matrix approach43 ,44 . This allows to evaluate and quantify the delivery of ecosystem services across different land cover or habitat types. It involves creating a matrix where habitat types are paired with ecosystem services, and scores are assigned to reflect the capacity of each habitat to provide specific benefits. The approach is flexible and can be adapted to various scales and contexts, making it valuable for land use planning, conservation, environmental impact assessments, and policy development45 . By visualizing the relationships between habitats and ecosystem services, the method helps identify trade-offs and synergies, guiding sustainable management decisions. However, existing ESS-matrix approaches are mostly based on qualitative scoring, that relies on expert-based ESS assessments or, more often than not, on direct literature transfer of non site-specific scores from previous studies. In this regard, physically-based evaluations, in which scores are based on metrics from field- or model-based data are rather scarce46 . Unless limited to an initial \u201cquick-scan\u201d assessment, qualitative expert-based approaches introduce deep uncertainties due to inherent subjectivity of the input data. This is particularly true when considering future climate scenarios, which already involve considerable unknowns related to the uncertain prediction of future changes in relevant variables and propagation of errors47 ,48 .</p><p>The present study addresses this gap by developing a model-based approach to assess the flood risk reduction ecosystem service (FRR-ESS) provided by NbS. We conduct a comparative assessment of individual and combined effects of various NbS on flood risk reduction under different climate change scenarios. NbS are evaluated singularly and combined as Building Blocks (BB) to assess their synergic efficacy. By utilizing eco-hydro-morphodynamic numerical modelling with detailed habitat maps, we simulate hydrodynamic processes, sediment transport, and flood inundation to quantify changes in FRR-ESS due to habitat and hydrodynamic conditions change. An FRR-ESS score is then quantified by means of a scorecard methodology.</p><p>This contribution aims to bridge the gap between qualitative ESS assessments and quantitative modelling, providing a more holistic approach to evaluate flood risk reduction. By integrating expert-based analyses with physically-based numerical models, the methodology encompasses both hydro-morphodynamic and eco-dynamic processes. In particular, the inclusion of eco-hydraulic integrated modelling of low-lying transitional areas allows for a more accurate representation of vegetation\u2019s role in dissipating wave energy and mitigating flood impacts, by explicitly accounting for site-specific plants\u2019 characteristics and spatial distribution. This enables the simulation of vegetation\u2019s direct influence on flow resistance, wave energy dissipation, and sediment transport under varying hydrodynamic conditions. This approach intends to enhance the reliability of ESS evaluations under current and future climate scenarios, offering policymakers and stakeholders a robust, flexible tool to support ecological sustainability and disaster risk reduction.</p><p>The work is structured as follows: first a description of the overall methodology, the numerical modelling and the ecosystem service assessment framework is presented; then, the outcomes of the model and the ESS evaluation methodology are illustrated and discussed; Finally, a conclusive section closes the work with some final remarks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Materials and methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Case study</emphasis></p><p>The \u201cPantani della Sicilia Sud-Orientale\u201d is a saline lagoon and wetland system located in the South-East of Sicily (Italy) (Fig. 1a), internationally protected under RAMSAR and Natura 2000 network49 .The Cuba-Longarini lagoons are the largest wetland area in the system, covering approximately 300 hectares, separated from the sea by a narrow coastal fringe composed of a dune strip and sandy beach. On the East side, the Cuba lagoon extends approximately for 80 ha, whereas on the West side, the Longarini lagoon extends for around 180 ha. These lagoons experience occasional connection to the sea through a small estuary channel, depending on the water level. They are generally shallow, less than one meter deep. The lagoons play a crucial role in biodiversity conservation, serving as a key habitat for endangered species and an important stopover for migratory birds50 .</p><p>The construction of the village of Granelli in the 1970s, on the narrow fringe between the sea and the lagoons, has reduced the hydraulic connectivity between the wetlands and the sea, while also degrading the coastal dune belt over which the urbanized area is located, increasing flood risk and weakening the area\u2019s natural defenses against coastal hazards (Fig. 1b). Since 1955, the Granelli coastline has experienced severe erosion, with the beach narrowing from 99 meters to just 11 meters51 , particularly along a 2 km central stretch (Fig. 1c). Moreover, the area is increasingly vulnerable to climate-related hazards, with more frequent and intense wave storms causing damage, and a risk of permanent flooding due to projected sea level rise by 210052 ,53 . The characteristics of this area are representative of many Mediterranean coastal zones, where intense urbanization and land use changes have squeezed wetlands, reducing their potential to provide protection from natural disasters54 ,55 .Fig. 1</p><p>Satellite image and overview of the test site, with bathimetries and wave rose (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), aerial view of inundation in the residential area of Granelli due to Helios storm (11th February 2023) (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), coastal erosion in front of the Granelli village (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>).

Specifically:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dune revegetation (DR)</emphasis> This measure seeks to enhance the system\u2019s wave dissipation capacity while restoring the dune habitat. The endemic species <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ammophila arenaria</emphasis>, already present in the area, was selected for the revegetation process. The proposed intervention involves expanding the dune habitat across approximately 4.3 hectares, stretching 3.3 km along the coastline with an average width of 13 metres.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reconstruction of the</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Posidonia oceanica </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">seagrass meadow (SR)</emphasis> This protected marine plant plays a critical role in reducing storm-induced coastal erosion and dissipating wave energy. Currently spanning 76.8 hectares, the meadow is planned to expand to 180.52 hectares, representing an increase of 103.72 hectares compared to its current coverage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Beach nourishment (BN)</emphasis> This intervention addresses the severe erosion affecting the Granelli coastline, where the beach width has significantly decreased from 99 metres in 1955 to 11 metres along the central 2 km section. The restoration measure involves re-establishing 20 metres of beach width along a 3.3 km stretch by depositing 120,000 m3 of sand sourced from an offshore deposit. The design prioritizes natural restoration and avoids hard traditional coastal protection structures.</p><p>In addition, the proposed NbS were combined within a Building Block approach56  in order to investigate their joint contribution in reducing storm-induced flooded areas. Specifically, the following combinations are considered: (i) reconstruction of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Posidonia oceanica</emphasis> meadow and dune revegetation (DR+SR); (ii) dune revegetation and beach nourishment (DR+BN); (iii) reconstruction of seagrass meadow and beach nourishment (BN+SR). A map of present habitat conditions and of the proposed restoration interventions is reported in Fig. 2.Fig. 2</p><p>Map showing the present habitat conditions at the test site and the proposed NbS-BB.

SWAN57  (Simulating Waves Nearshore) is a third-generation spectral model, capable of generating random wind-generated short-crested waves in coastal regions and inland waters. It allows to simulate processes related to the propagation of wind waves, i.e. generation, refraction, dissipation, shoaling and wave-interaction processes. Furthermore, SWAN provides one- and two-dimensional wave spectra at any number of positions and a spatial distribution of various parameters, including: significant wave height, wave period, wave direction and strength, and directional spread. In the context of our work, SWAN is used for hydrodynamic modelling of wave propagation from offshore to nearshore.</p><p>Within the SWAN grid, a nested eco-hydro-morphodynamic XBeach58  model is setup. XBeach (eXtreme Beach behavior) is a numerical model designed to simulate nearshore hydrodynamic and morphodynamic processes. It is a two-dimensional depth-averaged model, which solves coupled cross-shore and long-shore equations for wave propagation, flow, sediment transport and bottom level changes during storms.</p><p>Wave dissipation due to the presence of aquatic vegetation is modelled in XBeach using the approach of Mendez and Losada (2004)59 . It consists of an empirical model to predict wave height decay for both breaking and nonbreaking random waves propagating through a vegetation. The vegetation field is treated as a source of energy dissipation in the short-wave action balance equation, by representing vegetation elements as cylindrical obstacles that exert drag on the flow. The model calculates wave height attenuation by incrementally reducing wave energy across each computational step, with the drag contribution governed by vegetation characteristics (e.g., density, diameter, height) and the local wave conditions (e.g., water depth, wave height).</p><p>Howewer, representing vegetation elements as rigid cylinders is a simplifying assumption that does not account for complexities related to vegetation-induced turbulence, plant flexibility and reconfiguration under flow, or morphological heterogeneity60 , 61 \u201362 . More advanced modelling approaches do exist, which incorporate data-driven drag coefficient prediction63 , more advanced wave-resolving frameworks64 , complex vegetation morphologies63 , partially vegetated channel flows65  and vegetation-induced turbulence in the presence of flexible canopies66 . Notwithstanding these assumptions, the theoretical framework successfully represents wave height transformation over vegetated regions and captures the associated damping governed by the bulk drag coefficient with reasonable accuracy59 .</p><p>In the present application, we employed the vegetation empirical model version adapted by Suzuki et al. (2012)67  to consider vertically heterogeneous vegetation , i.e. to take into account different morphological and hydrodynamic characteristics along the vegetation vertical section. A dissipation term is calculated as the sum of the dissipation per vegetation layer and takes into account parameters specific to the vegetation: number of vertical sections (), vertical section height (), drag coefficient (), stem diameter (), vegetation density (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis>). Specifically, this term is calculated through the following equation:1where:  is the short wave energy dissipation due to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>-th vegetation layer <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>,  is the water density,  is the drag coefficient,  is the stem diameter, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">N</emphasis> is the stem density per m2, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> is the wave number, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">g</emphasis> is gravitational acceleration,  is angular frequency, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">h</emphasis> is the water level,  is the relative vegetation height (= ) for the vegetation layer <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>,  is the root-mean-square wave height.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data description and investigated scenarios</emphasis></p><p>In order to build the numerical grid for the modelling chain, bathimetric data from nautical charts68  and bathymetric data obtained through a multibeam survey conducted by the University of Catania in 2019 were combined with a 2x2 m digital elevation model obtained by a LIDAR flight carried out by the Sicilian Region69 . The coastline position was traced using satellite images derived from PlanetScope70 . For marine climate data, wave conditions were obtained from the MEDSEA MULTIYEAR WAV 006 012 reanalysis dataset71 , for the years 1993-2022 with hourly temporal resolution. For future wave conditions, hourly wave climate projections72  for the period 2041-2100 with two emission scenarios proposed by the IPCC AR5: the RCP 4.5 scenario that considers a moderate decrease in greenhouse gases beyond 2040; and the RCP 8.5 scenario, a pessimistic scenario in which emissions will continue to increase until 2100. Both wave reanalysis and projection datasets are openly accessible through the Copernicus service website71 ,72 .</p><p>For these present and future projection datasets, parameters were extracted, including: significant wave height (), peak period () and mean wave direction (). Since a prevalence of events from the western direction was observed, i.e. 255-270 N (see Fig. a), in terms both of significant wave height magnitude and frequency, we focus our analysis on that sector. An extreme event analysis was conducted to obtain  with return period  of 50 years, using a 30-year long timeseries for each scenario: 1993-2022 for the current scenario, 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 for the mid-term and long-term forecast scenarios, both for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5.</p><p>The local sea level rise projections, were based on the IPCC AR6 SSP (Socioeconomic Pathways) scenarios, and were obtained using the NASA Sea Level Change projection tool73 . These correspond to the last year of the annual windows examined, 2070 and 2100, for the periods 2041-2070 and 2071-2100 respectively. Since the only wave climate projections available for the Mediterranean originate from AR5, while the sea-level rise projections are based on AR6, it was deemed appropriate to combine the RCP and SSP scenarios corresponding to the same radiative forcing values to ensure consistency in the analysis. Therefore, the wave conditions for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios were combined with the sea-level rise projections for the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (radiative forcing of 4.5 W m-2 and 8.5 W m-2 respectively). By combining extreme wave climate parameters and sea level rise, five hydrodynamic scenarios were studied: a present scenario (SP) and four climate change projection scenarios: S4.5-2070, S4.5-2100, S8.5-2070 and S8.5-2100.

The SWAN computational domain, illustrated in Fig. 3b, covers 2068 km2, including approximately 90 km of coastline. The grid consists of 17,141 nodes with variable resolution based on bathymetry: for depths greater than 100 m, elements have a 1 km side; for depths between 100 m and 30 m, the size gradually decreases from 1 km to 400 m; and for depths less than 30 m, the mesh size is a constant 400 m. A finer 100 m grid is applied near the XBeach domain.</p><p>The XBeach computational domain, shown in Fig. 3c, is located within the SWAN domain and spans 3.36 km cross-shore and 3.69 km long-shore, covering a total area of 10.95 km2. It includes the Cuba-Longarini lagoon system, the town of Granelli, and its beach. The structured grid has variable cell sizes: 2.5-10 m cross-shore and 5-10 m long-shore, with 1,150 cross-shore and 544 long-shore cells. Each cell is assigned an elevation value based on topographic data.Fig. 3</p><p>Modelling chain applied to our case study (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>): domain and grid of the SWAN model (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), domain and grid of the XBeach model (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), vegetation map for the No-NbS scenario (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>).</p><p>In order to take into account the vegetation within the study area, a representative vegetation species was assigned for the different habitats on the basis of a cross-comparison between EUNIS habitat mapping and field surveys. In particular, four representative species were considered for the four habitats: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ammophila arenaria</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phragmites australis</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Posidonia oceanica</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spartina alterniflora</emphasis>. The respective values of their characteristics and their spatial distribution, implemented in the model, are reported in the table in the Supplementary materials. The Fig. 3d shows the distribution map of vegetation for the No-NbS scenario.</p><p>Both SWAN and XBeach models were validated to assess their hydrodynamic and morphodynamic accuracy. A real storm event, occurring from April 21, 2022, at 06:00 UTC+1 to April 22, 2022, at 07:00 UTC+1, was selected for validation. This 25-hour storm reached a peak significant wave height of 4.19 m, measured by a wave buoy installed by the University of Catania offshore of the Granelli Beach (latitude 36.63320, longitude 14.9348). The pre-storm shoreline from April 19, 2022, was used as the initial condition. The storm was simulated using the SWAN and XBeach modelling chain, and the post-storm shoreline was compared to satellite imagery from May 4, 2022. No other significant storm events occurred in the interim. Hourly wave data from April 20 to April 25, 2022, were extracted from the MEDSEA MULTIYEAR WAV 006 012 reanalysis dataset at the grid point closest to the SWAN offshore boundary. Each hourly sea state was simulated, totaling 120 SWAN simulations. The model\u2019s performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Bias (B), and the Willmott Skill Score75 , which resulted in values of 0.37 m, 0.02 m, and 0.95, respectively, indicating strong agreement between the model and observed wave conditions. For morphodynamic validation, the modeled post-storm shoreline was compared with the observed shoreline from satellite imagery. Measurements were taken along 30 transects orthogonal to the pre-storm shoreline, assessing the distance between observed and modeled shoreline retreat. The Bias was 0.93 m (6.4% of the observed average retreat of 14.42 m), while the RMSE was 3.30 m. The Brier Skill Score76 , a widely used coastal morphodynamic validation metric, was computed, resulting in a value of 0.95, confirming the model\u2019s strong predictive skill in shoreline change. Further details on the validation of the proposed modelling chain can be found in Marino et al. (2025)77 .</p><p>Regarding vegetation modelling, we relied on literature-derived values; however, an accurate estimation would ideally require calibration using pre- and post-storm beach profiles. To assess the sensitivity of the model, we varied the drag coefficient for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Posidonia oceanica</emphasis> between 0.7 and 1.3, centered around a reference value of 1.0. The results indicated that increasing the drag coefficient to 1.3 led to a 10% reduction in the flooded area, while decreasing it to 0.7 resulted in a 6% reduction. Analogously, a sensitivity analysis was performed on the stem density of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Posidonia oceanica</emphasis>, varying around the reference value of 300\u00b1100 stems/m2. The results show that increasing or decreasing the density by 100 stems has a limited impact on flooding, with the flooded area ranging from 0.065 km2 to 0.056 km2 and mitigation effectiveness varying from -6.5% to +7.5%, showing a limited sensitivity of the model to this parameter.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Flooding risk reduction ESS assessment methodology</emphasis></p><p>In order to evaluate the change in flooding risk reduction (FRR) ecosystem service, the following methodology is employed. First, a benchmark habitat map is built, showing the habitat distribution at the current state, i.e. present scenario (SP) without any NbS-BB implemented (NN). For each habitat in the benchmark habitat map, FRR-ESS rank scores are obtained by means of a local expert-based survey approach. These scores provide a qualitative representation of the flood reduction ecosystem service provision for each habitat. The scores were assigned by a team of 10 experts with different expertise and backgrounds (hydraulic engineering, geology, botanics, biology and ecology). Each member of the team individually compiled a questionnaire assigning a score ranging from 0 to 5 for each habitat about their contribution to FRR-ESS. A mean score rounded to the nearest integer was calculated for each habitat to obtain the benchmark ESS rank score, or  (Table 2 ).</p><p>Subsequently, habitat change due to sea level rise is evaluated for the 4 investigated climate change scenarios, thus generating 4 maps for each of SLR scenarios. Given the inherent complexity and uncertainties associated with habitat transitions under future sea-level rise scenarios, our approach employs a simplified framework based on key environmental drivers, i.e. salinity changes, hydraulic connectivity and elevation thresholds. While the model does not explicitly simulate intermediate processes (e.g. gradual shifts in salinity regimes) these factors are indirectly captured through clear, ecologically grounded transition criteria.</p><p>Three main habitat change criteria were considered applied in this framework: (i) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saline coastal lagoons</emphasis> transition to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mediterranean infralittoral sand</emphasis> when a permanent connection to the sea is established, driven by the loss of seasonal water level fluctuations and the influence of marine salinity, which favors nearshore ecotopes and reduce the natural capabilities of the lagoon to retain rainflood water; (ii) <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reedbeds without free-standing water</emphasis> shift to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mediterranean littoral biogenic habitats</emphasis>, as increasing salinity levels inhibit freshwater species like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Phragmites australis</emphasis>, allowing more salt-tolerant halophytic communities to dominate; (iii) a generic habitat transition to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Mediterranean infralittoral sand</emphasis> when the local elevation falls below the projected mean sea level, following a traditional \u201cbathtub\u201d approach that reflects the inundation-driven loss of terrestrial habitats. This approach, though simplified, offers a robust means of assessing habitat shifts within the study\u2019s spatial and data limitations, allowing for a meaningful evaluation of NbS effectiveness under evolving environmental conditions.Table 2</p><p>FRR-ESS rank score  for each habitat obtained by expert-based approach.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"496\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"24\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">EUNIS code</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Habitat name</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\"/></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">D5.1-2012</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Reedbeds normally without free-standing water</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">J1-2012</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Building of cities, towns and villages</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">J2.43-2012</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Greenhouses</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MA1515</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mediterranean <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sarcocornia perennis</emphasis> mats</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MA25</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mediterranean littoral biogenic habitat</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MB252</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Biocenosis of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P. oceanica</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MB55</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mediterranean infralittoral sand</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">N12</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mediterranean and Black Sea sand beach</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">N14</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mediterranean and Black Sea shifting coastal dune</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">R1E</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mediterranean tall perennial dry grassland</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">V13</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Arable land with unmixed crops</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">V61</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Broadleaved fruit and nut tree orchards</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">X02</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Saline coastal lagoons</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>EUNIS codeHabitat nameD5.1-2012Reedbeds normally without free-standing water4J1-2012Building of cities, towns and villages0J2.43-2012Greenhouses0MA1515Mediterranean <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sarcocornia perennis</emphasis> mats4MA25Mediterranean littoral biogenic habitat3MB252Biocenosis of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">P. oceanica</emphasis>2MB55Mediterranean infralittoral sand1N12Mediterranean and Black Sea sand beach4N14Mediterranean and Black Sea shifting coastal dune4R1EMediterranean tall perennial dry grassland3V13Arable land with unmixed crops1V61Broadleaved fruit and nut tree orchards2X02Saline coastal lagoons4</p><p>The scores range from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates low or no habitat flood reduction potential and 5 indicates high flood reduction potential. These scores are considered our benchmark, i.e. they represent the contribution of each habitat to FRR-ESS at the current state, without any NbS-BB implemented. In scenarios where NbS-BB are implemented, the  may change based on the FRR-ESS efficacy indicator . This term is computed by the following:2where  is the relative flooding reduction due to an NbS on a certain investigated scenario, whereas  is the relative change of the habitat for that specific NbS-BB. The  is computed by:3where  is the flooded city area in the case of no-NbS compared with the flooded city area in the presence of a NbS-BB, , for a certain hydrodynamic scenario; whereas the relative change of habitat  is computed as:4where  is the habitat surface that changed in the NbS intervention scenario, compared with the pre-NbS habitat surface  for a specific hydrodynamic scenario. Thus,  is the ratio between the reduction of flooded area determined by the NbS-BB to the habitat restored surface. For instance, an  = 1 means that 1 m2 restored correspond to 1 m2 flooded area reduction.</p><p>This indicator is used to adjust the  of each restored habitat, reflecting variations in flood risk reduction efficacy provided by the NbS. Specifically, the rank score increases linearly by 1 point for every increase in  by a factor , up to a maximum score of 5. Beyond this limit, further improvements in  do not increase the score. The methodology also considers scenarios where the NbS-BB leads to a decline in FRR-ESS. In such cases, the rank score decreases linearly by 1 point for each decrease in  by a factor . However, the minimum attainable score is 0, and further reductions in  will not lower the rank score below this value. This correction allows to obtain the actual ESS rank score, or , which follows this formulation:5Figure 4a illustrates three examples of  computations due to NbS-BB interventions, corresponding to habitats with low/null FRR-ESS (red continuous line, benchmark rank score ), intermediate FRR-ESS (orange dashed line, bench mark rank score ), and high FRR-ESS (green dotted line, benchmark rank score ).</p><p>These scores correction are computed in scenarios in which only one habitat is restored (the NbS-BB) and then used for the combined NbS-BB scenarios within the same hydrodynamic scenarios.Fig. 4</p><p>Methodology to correct variation of FRR-ESS rank scores  due to NbS-BB implementation based on NbS efficacy  (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>); computation of the ESS sigma score  depending on the relative ESS score  (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>).</p><p>Afterwards, the total ecosystem service score  is computed by calculating the weighted contribution of each habitat to FRR:6where  is the number of habitats,  is the surface of each habitat <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis> and  is the ESS rank score of the ecosystem service for EUNIS habitat <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">i</emphasis>. This score represent the total contribution of the whole site to the FRR-ESS in a given scenario. Any variation in the surface area of habitats due to a new condition (e.g. sea level rise or implementation of an NbS-BB) results in a change in the . This change is quantified as a relative difference:7where  is the relative change in the ESS total score at time 2 with respect to time 1, where time 1 is always the benchmark condition (SP, NN) and time 2 is a future condition, either with/out implementation of NbS-BB or future climate scenario. In this context,  is the ESS total score at the time 1 and  is the ESS total score at the time 2.</p><p>The relative change in the ESS score ranges from -1 to +1, reflecting the degree of improvement (+) or decline (-) in the provision of the ecosystem service. To address the issue of comparing small changes (a few percent) with large changes (tens of percent) in total ESS scores, a transfer function is applied. This function uses a sigmoid curve that outputs values between -5 and +5, corresponding to relative changes between -1 and +1.8here,  is the sigma-score (ranging from -5 to 5) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> is the logistic function shape parameter. An optimal value of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">k</emphasis> = 10 was determined by sensitivity analysis. The sigma-scores are then grouped into eleven categories (as shown in Fig. 4b) to express the relative change in ESS in a consistent, uniform metric for both gains and losses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p>By combining 5 hydrodynamic scenarios (1 present, 4 future projections) with 7 NbS-BB scenarios (1 no-NbS scenario, 3 with single NbS-BB, 3 with combined NbS-BB), a total of 35 simulations were conducted to assess the efficacy of NbS-BB in mitigating coastal flooding due to a 50 years return period storm.</p><p>Figure 5 shows flooding maps related to S4.5-2100 hydrodynamic scenario ( = 7.21 m,  = 11.16 s, SLR = 0.57 m) for no-NbS (NN, Fig. 5a), seagrass meadow reconstruction (SR, Fig. 5b) and combination of seagrass reconstruction with beach nourishment (SR+BN, Fig. 5c). In the NN case, a significant extent of the flooded city area is observed, amounting to 0.061 km2. The SR intervention allows to reduce the flooded area to 0.028 km2, with a corresponding flooding reduction efficacy  = 53%. Figure 5c illustrates a combination of seagrass reconstruction and beach nourishment (SR+BN). The advancement of the shoreline allows for a further reduction in comparison with the SR case, with a flooded city area of 0.017 km2, corresponding to  = 72%.</p><p>The bar plots in Fig. 5d shows the city flooded surfaces , whereas Fig. 5e reports the flooding reduction efficacy , for all hydrodynamic scenarios (in shades of blue) and for each proposed NbS solution (along the x-axis).</p><p>The NN case results show that for the present scenario (SP) no flooding is observed, whereas significant flooded areas for future scenarios, with the most severe being the S8.5-2100 with a city flooded surface  = 0.113 km2 (36% of the total city area 0.40 km2). The DR intervention generally resulted the less efficient among all the proposed solutions, with city flooded surface between 0.021 and 0.113 km2 ( = 1724%). The SR intervention generally outperformed DR, with  between 0.024 km2 and 0.064 km2 (corresponding to  = 44  55%); while the beach nourishment intervention (BN) brings the values of  down to 0.012 km2 and 0.042 km2. The BN outperforms DR and SR across all scenarios, with city flooded surfaces between 0.010 and 0.031 km2, and  ranging between 67 to 74%. The combination of DR+SR slightly increases performance of the seagrass meadow reconstruction alone, with flooded surfaces in the range 0.015 to 0.057 km2, corresponding to  between 50 and 64%. Combining DR with the BN generally give very slight improvements, with city flooded surface from 0.009 km2 and 0.037 and efficacy  ranging from 67 to 75%. Finally, BN+SR combination provides the greater performance, with flooded areas ranging from 0.010 and 0.0312, corresponding to flooding reduction efficacy of 61 to 78%.Fig. 5</p><p>Inundation maps for the hydrodynamic scenario S4.5-2100, with  = 7.21 m,  = 11.16 s, SLR = 0.57 m and  = 262.5N, for three different NbS-BB scenarios: no-NbS, NN (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>); seagrass meadow reconstruction, SR (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>); combination of seagrass meadow reconstruction and beach nourishment, SR+BN (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>).

The proposed methodology was applied to evaluate FRR-ESS relative changes for each scenario, quantifying improvements or declines in ESS provisioning for each habitat.</p><p>Figure 6 shows the habitat maps obtained through the expert-based approach for SP (Fig. 6a), S4.5-2070 (Fig. 6b), and S8.5-2100 (Fig. 6c). All habitat maps represent scenarios without NbS implementation (NN).</p><p>The comparison between SP and S4.5-2070 habitat maps reveals that the projected sea-level rise (SLR = 0.37 m) leads to a narrowing of the already thin beach strip. Additionally, the sea-level increase causes the opening of a channel in the estuarine region of the Longarini lagoon, creating a permanent connection with the sea. This connection equalizes salinity levels between the sea and the lagoon, alters water levels, and transitions the habitat from saline lagoon (EUNIS code X02) to Mediterranean infralittoral sand (MB55), with part of the \u201cMediterranean littoral biogenic habitat\u201d (MA25) permanently submerged. Saline lagoon habitat reduces by 63% (from 1.76 to 0.65 km2), while Mediterranean infralittoral sand increases by 53% (from 3.55 to 5.44 km2). These changes impair the lagoon\u2019s natural flood mitigation capacity, as it can no longer function as an expansion reservoir, leading to a reduction in the flood risk reduction score from 4 to 1. Reedbeds habitat (D5.1-2012) is particularly affected, decreasing by 84% (from 0.54 to 0.09 km2) due to increased salinity, favoring coastal saltmarsh habitat, which itself decreases by 14% due to partial submersion. Beach retreat further reduces its habitat from 0.10 to 0.06 km2 (40%). As a result, the total contribution of all habitats to FRR-ESS ( score) decreases by 33%, from 2.16  to 1.43 .</p><p>Figure 6c depicts the habitat map for the S8.5-2100 scenario (SLR = 0.77 m). In this extreme case, the sea inundates the Cuba lagoon entirely, eliminating the coastal lagoon habitat, and extends into urban areas. Mediterranean infralittoral sand habitat increases by 97% compared to SP, while reedbeds are completely suppressed (100% reduction). Coastal saltmarsh habitat initially expands due to reedbed retreat but ultimately declines by 60% (from 1.13 to 0.45 km2) due to permanent submersion. Consequently,  decreases by 51%, from 2.16  to 1.05 .</p><p>Figure 6d presents the sigma-scores  for all investigated scenarios. The left column shows  values based on relative ESS changes () when comparing SP with future scenarios without NbS implementation (NN). These results highlight substantial reductions in lagoon, beach, and saltmarsh habitat areas due to SLR, leading to a consistent  decrease of -5 across all hydrodynamic scenarios.</p><p>The central and right columns in Fig. 6d display the  for NbS-BB scenarios, calculated by comparing NN and NbS within the same hydrodynamic context. Across all scenarios, SR consistently outperforms other interventions in terms of , with scores ranging from 3 to 5. This indicates that SR effectively offsets FRR-ESS losses caused by SLR. In contrast, BN achieves moderate  scores, ranging from 2 to 3, while DR exhibits the lowest performance, maintaining a score of 1 in most scenarios. However, DR\u2019s effectiveness improves to 3 when combined with BN, demonstrating the added benefits of combining interventions.</p><p>The SR+BN combination achieves the highest performance across all scenarios, with  ranging from 4 in SP to 5 in all future scenarios. This result underscores the synergistic benefits of integrating NbS-BB measures, particularly under extreme climate conditions. These findings emphasize the potential of combining interventions to enhance FRR-ESS provisioning and address the challenges posed by SLR and intensified wave climates.Fig. 6</p><p>Habitat map for present state (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), S4.5-2070 SLR scenario (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) and S8.5-2100 scenario (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), corresponding ESS total scores; overview of sigma-scores  for all investigated scenarios.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Our study demonstrated the individual and combined efficacy of NbS in mitigating flooding under present and future wave climate and sea level rise. Among individual interventions, beach nourishment (BN) stands out as the most effective measure in reducing the flooded city area. When building block combinations are considered, the synergistic effect of integrating multiple interventions slightly enhances flood reduction. Combinations including BN maintain high levels of effectiveness even under extreme conditions, such as the worst-case scenario (S8.5-2100). SR+BN achieves the best overall performance, reducing the flooded city area up to 78%.</p><p>Interestingly, despite BN achieving higher absolute flood reduction compared to SR, the sigma-ESS scores reveal that SR outperforms BN in relative terms. This seemingly counterintuitive result is explained by the differences in habitat expansion. BN expands the beach habitat by 2.2 times, whereas SR extends the seagrass meadow by only 1.55. While BN achieves greater flood reduction, this performance is partly due to the significantly larger increase in habitat area, highlighting the need to account for the relative scale of interventions when assessing their ecosystem service contributions. This nuanced perspective is an important advantage of the sigma-ESS indicator, as it allows for a more balanced evaluation that considers both the effectiveness and proportional habitat impact of each intervention.</p><p>Our methodology provides a simple approach to correcting expert-based scores for flood risk reduction ecosystem services (FRR-ESS) using physically-based model results. This approach offers a rapid and customizable framework that not only improves the accuracy of ESS evaluation but also allows for the integration of multiple ecosystem services, such as erosion control or water quality, by incorporating additional model outputs. The approach was tested on a coastal case study in the Mediterranean, but with tailored modifications to the formulation or the modelling framework, it can be modified to account for different environments, e.g. cohesive sediments78 , macrotidal environments79 , gravel beaches80 .</p><p>While this study provides a robust framework for linking hydro-morphodynamic modelling with habitat transitions to assess flood risk reduction ecosystem services, certain methodological simplifications were necessary. Habitat shifts were estimated using a suitability-based approach rather than process-based modelling, as detailed predictions of salinity dynamics, nutrient influx, and long-term morphological evolution are difficult to include in the model without deep uncertainties. The employed methodology relies instead on simple rules based on elevation and connection with the sea to evaluate habitat shifts due to sea level rise, providing a practical yet simplified approach to account for environmental changes. These approximations, while reasonable given the study scale, data availability and aim of the work, should be considered when interpreting the results.</p><p>Another assumption to acknowledge is that our approach assesses the response of Nature-based Solutions under the assumption of full functionality, meaning that each intervention is analyzed as if it has reached its intended effectiveness before the storm occurs. This was necessary to isolate and quantify the maximum potential flood risk reduction benefits of NbS without the additional complexity of modelling transitional dynamics. However, we recognize that this approach does not capture important factors such as the slow growth rates and uncertain success of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Posidonia oceanica</emphasis> transplantation, which requires specific environmental conditions and can take decades to fully establish. Similarly, while sand nourishment provides immediate protective benefits upon placement, its longevity is influenced by dynamic sediment redistribution processes, which require careful monitoring and periodic re-nourishment to maintain effectiveness. Given these recurrent maintenance needs, a robust cost-benefit analysis may be warranted in some contexts to ensure that such interventions remain both economically viable and effective over time. Generally, the expenses required to sustain beach ecosystems in optimal condition typically represent only a small proportion compared to the tourism-derived revenue and broader socioeconomic benefits they generate81 . In contrast, dune revegetation using <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ammophila arenaria</emphasis> presents a more realistic assumption of full functionality due to the species\u2019 rapid growth, resilience to sand burial, and proven capacity to stabilize and enhance existing dunes over relatively short timescales. To overcome these limitations, future studies could incorporate transitional scenarios, modelling the progressive evolution of NbS over time. For seagrass restoration, this could involve simulating gradual patch expansion based on survival rates or habitat suitability modelling82  under varying environmental conditions. For sand nourishment, models better suited for accretive processes than XBeach83 , 84 \u201385 , could offer more accurate predictions of long-term sediment redistribution and beach profile changes.</p><p>Our approach relies on single-point extractions from extreme value analyses; however, we acknowledge that this simplification does not fully capture the range of uncertainties associated with wave statistics, storm surge interactions, and future morphological changes. One source of uncertainty arises from the Med-MFC reanalysis dataset69  used as input for SWAN, which, despite slight underestimations at low and intermediate wave heights, shows good agreement for higher waves, particularly during winter months when variability tends to be lower. For our study area in the Ionian region, the dataset reports a minimal bias of -0.018 m and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.200 m, suggesting limited impact on the morphodynamic outcomes for the wave heights considered (5.61-8.36 m). Additional uncertainty stems from sea-level rise projections, where likely ranges are influenced by both emission scenario variability and uncertainties in physical sea-level drivers86 . In our analysis, we focused on the 50th percentile projections, acknowledging that higher uncertainties arise over longer time horizons, potentially influencing flood risk reduction outcomes. Although we did not explicitly assess uncertainty propagation within our modelling framework, the significant differences observed between NbS and no-NbS scenarios across all projections suggest that our qualitative conclusions regarding solution effectiveness remain robust. Future work will aim to incorporate a more comprehensive uncertainty analysis to enhance the robustness of our findings and better reflect the complexity of coastal processes.</p><p>Overall, this methodology represents a step forward in ecosystem service evaluation by bridging physically-based modelling with expert-based assessments, enabling a more accurate, scalable, and context-specific analysis. The ability to incorporate additional ecosystem services and adapt the model inputs to different scenarios positions this approach as a valuable tool for designing and optimizing NbS interventions that balance flood risk reduction with ecological sustainability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>This study presented a framework for quantifying flood risk reduction ecosystem services provided by coastal Nature-based Solutions, combining expert-based assessments with physically-based numerical modelling. Applied to a Mediterranean coastal lagoon in Sicily, the methodology demonstrates the potential of NbS, both individually and in combination, to mitigate storm-induced flooding under present and future climate scenarios. The results highlight the enhanced performance of combined NbS measures through a Building Block approach, emphasizing the importance of integrating diverse strategies for robust flood risk reduction.</p><p>By incorporating habitat maps and eco-hydro-morphodynamic modelling, this framework provides a more accurate and adaptable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of NbS across different environmental contexts. The findings reinforce the critical role of coastal habitats in disaster risk reduction and offer a scalable approach for policymakers and stakeholders to align flood mitigation efforts with ecological sustainability, fostering resilience in the face of climate change.</p><p>Future developments of this framework could integrate more advanced habitat modelling techniques87 ,88  to refine predictions of ecosystem transitions under changing environmental conditions. Additionally, increasing spatial resolution and incorporating more detailed ecological and physical processes could further enhance the applicability of the approach across diverse coastal settings. Expanding its use to other geographic contexts and coupling it with adaptive management strategies would provide actionable insights for policymakers and practitioners seeking to optimize Nature-based Solutions for coastal resilience.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was funded by the projects: REST-COAST - Large scale RESToration of COASTal ecosystems through rivers to sea connectivity (call: H2020-LC-GD-2020; Proposal no. 101037097); National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP), Mission 4 Component 2 Investment 1.3 - Call for tender No. 341 of 15/03/2022 of Italian Ministry of University and Research funded by the European Union - NextGenerationEU.

Powered by solar energy, this zero-energy train cabin features interactive displays, hands-on exhibits and workshops co-created with Just Keep Thinking (JKT), Singapore's largest science and sustainability social media platform. Designed to spark environmental awareness among children and youths, the CDL EcoTrain is a creative approach to community engagement and climate education.</p><p><br/><br/>The CDL EcoTrain, part of the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) upcycling initiative which repurposes decommissioned SMRT cabins, is the first public-facing repurposed train located at a retail mall.<br/><br/>Adjacent to the CDL EcoTrain, the CDL MicroForest represents a bold step in leveraging nature-based solutions to combat climate challenges in dense urban environments. The CDL MicroForest is a 2,800 square feet (sq ft) regenerative tropical microforest, developed in collaboration with experts in ecology and biological sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and with inputs from the National Parks Board (NParks). This pioneering nature-based solution for cooling through greening aims to combat urban heat and biodiversity loss in high-density urban landscapes, serving as a living laboratory to study how microforests can lower temperatures, boost biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.<br/><br/>The creation of the MicroForest is an extension of CDL's long-standing commitment to sustainability and integrating nature in the built environment. Since 2010, CDL has also been voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessments (BIAs) on greenfield sites located within or adjacent to natural habitats before construction. Environmental mitigation measures are also undertaken where necessary.<br/><br/>The launch was graced by Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a tree-planting ceremony alongside representatives from CDL, NParks, NUS, as well as young eco-champions. This symbolic event underscores the strength of the 3P (Public, Private and People) partnership model in advancing urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL's Group Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Climate action thrives on the power of 3P collaboration and innovation. We created the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest as sustainable showcases to complement our ongoing revamp of City Square Mall. Since its opening in 2009, City Square Mall has established itself as Singapore's first eco-mall, home to innovative community spaces for sustainability events and education, such as the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The timely launch of the EcoTrain and MicroForest enhances the Mall's unique position as a family-friendly eco-hub with exciting programmes to nurture future eco-champions and promote sustainable living.\"<br/><br/>Scaling Impact: A Blueprint for Sustainable Cities<br/><br/>As cities worldwide grapple with the effects of climate change, CDL's EcoTrain and MicroForest present scalable, high-impact solutions that can be adapted across urban landscapes. By demonstrating how decommissioned infrastructure can be repurposed for sustainability education and how regenerative tropical microforests can contribute to climate resilience, these projects set a new benchmark for integrating ESG principles into real estate development.<br/><br/>With urban populations expected to continue rising, the need for innovative, nature-based interventions has never been greater. Through these initiatives, CDL showcases how the built environment can harmonise with nature, creating sustainable, livable cities that benefit both people and the planet.<br/><br/>Projects like the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest highlight the power of cross-sector collaboration in driving urban transformation. By investing in climate education and biodiversity restoration, CDL continues to pave the way for a more resilient and environmentally conscious future.<br/><br/>Media Contact:<br/><br/>Priscilla Tan, Sustainability Manager<br/><br/>Read More<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.co.uk\">www.m2.co.uk</url>))   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVEST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVEST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC9-1RW3-SJ6G-C0KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Investrend Communications, Inc.

Powered by solar energy, this zero-energy train cabin features interactive displays, hands-on exhibits and workshops co-created with Just Keep Thinking (JKT), Singapore's largest science and sustainability social media platform. Designed to spark environmental awareness among children and youths, the CDL EcoTrain is a creative approach to community engagement and climate education.</p><p><br/><br/>The CDL EcoTrain, part of the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) upcycling initiative which repurposes decommissioned SMRT cabins, is the first public-facing repurposed train located at a retail mall.<br/><br/>Adjacent to the CDL EcoTrain, the CDL MicroForest represents a bold step in leveraging nature-based solutions to combat climate challenges in dense urban environments. The CDL MicroForest is a 2,800 square feet (sq ft) regenerative tropical microforest, developed in collaboration with experts in ecology and biological sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and with inputs from the National Parks Board (NParks). This pioneering nature-based solution for cooling through greening aims to combat urban heat and biodiversity loss in high-density urban landscapes, serving as a living laboratory to study how microforests can lower temperatures, boost biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.<br/><br/>The creation of the MicroForest is an extension of CDL's long-standing commitment to sustainability and integrating nature in the built environment. Since 2010, CDL has also been voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessments (BIAs) on greenfield sites located within or adjacent to natural habitats before construction. Environmental mitigation measures are also undertaken where necessary.<br/><br/>The launch was graced by Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a tree-planting ceremony alongside representatives from CDL, NParks, NUS, as well as young eco-champions. This symbolic event underscores the strength of the 3P (Public, Private and People) partnership model in advancing urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL's Group Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Climate action thrives on the power of 3P collaboration and innovation. We created the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest as sustainable showcases to complement our ongoing revamp of City Square Mall. Since its opening in 2009, City Square Mall has established itself as Singapore's first eco-mall, home to innovative community spaces for sustainability events and education, such as the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The timely launch of the EcoTrain and MicroForest enhances the Mall's unique position as a family-friendly eco-hub with exciting programmes to nurture future eco-champions and promote sustainable living.\"<br/><br/>Scaling Impact: A Blueprint for Sustainable Cities<br/><br/>As cities worldwide grapple with the effects of climate change, CDL's EcoTrain and MicroForest present scalable, high-impact solutions that can be adapted across urban landscapes.

Powered by solar energy, this zero-energy train cabin features interactive displays, hands-on exhibits and workshops co-created with Just Keep Thinking (JKT), Singapore's largest science and sustainability social media platform. Designed to spark environmental awareness among children and youths, the CDL EcoTrain is a creative approach to community engagement and climate education.</p><p><br/><br/>The CDL EcoTrain, part of the Land Transport Authority's (LTA) upcycling initiative which repurposes decommissioned SMRT cabins, is the first public-facing repurposed train located at a retail mall.<br/><br/>Adjacent to the CDL EcoTrain, the CDL MicroForest represents a bold step in leveraging nature-based solutions to combat climate challenges in dense urban environments. The CDL MicroForest is a 2,800 square feet (sq ft) regenerative tropical microforest, developed in collaboration with experts in ecology and biological sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and with inputs from the National Parks Board (NParks). This pioneering nature-based solution for cooling through greening aims to combat urban heat and biodiversity loss in high-density urban landscapes, serving as a living laboratory to study how microforests can lower temperatures, boost biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.<br/><br/>The creation of the MicroForest is an extension of CDL's long-standing commitment to sustainability and integrating nature in the built environment. Since 2010, CDL has also been voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessments (BIAs) on greenfield sites located within or adjacent to natural habitats before construction. Environmental mitigation measures are also undertaken where necessary.<br/><br/>The launch was graced by Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a tree-planting ceremony alongside representatives from CDL, NParks, NUS, as well as young eco-champions. This symbolic event underscores the strength of the 3P (Public, Private and People) partnership model in advancing urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL's Group Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Climate action thrives on the power of 3P collaboration and innovation. We created the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest as sustainable showcases to complement our ongoing revamp of City Square Mall. Since its opening in 2009, City Square Mall has established itself as Singapore's first eco-mall, home to innovative community spaces for sustainability events and education, such as the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The timely launch of the EcoTrain and MicroForest enhances the Mall's unique position as a family-friendly eco-hub with exciting programmes to nurture future eco-champions and promote sustainable living.\"<br/><br/>Scaling Impact: A Blueprint for Sustainable Cities<br/><br/>As cities worldwide grapple with the effects of climate change, CDL's EcoTrain and MicroForest present scalable, high-impact solutions that can be adapted across urban landscapes. By demonstrating how decommissioned infrastructure can be repurposed for sustainability education and how regenerative tropical microforests can contribute to climate resilience, these projects set a new benchmark for integrating ESG principles into real estate development.<br/><br/>With urban populations expected to continue rising, the need for innovative, nature-based interventions has never been greater. Through these initiatives, CDL showcases how the built environment can harmonise with nature, creating sustainable, livable cities that benefit both people and the planet.<br/><br/>Projects like the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest highlight the power of cross-sector collaboration in driving urban transformation. By investing in climate education and biodiversity restoration, CDL continues to pave the way for a more resilient and environmentally conscious future.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(Distributed by M2 Communications (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.m2.co.uk\">www.m2.co.uk</url>))   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">INVEST-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">INVEST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FC9-P4D3-RWC9-907R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">276313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Investrend Communications, Inc.

The study, commissioned by the Centre of Expertise for Waters, modelled how these habitats absorb wave energy.</p><p>The results showed kelp beds were especially effective, potentially cutting wave height by up to 70% in some areas.</p><p>The researchers focused on Sanday in Orkney and Uist in the Outer Hebrides as they are highly exposed to storms and rising sea levels. They predict that, in Sanday, the presence of kelp could reduce wave heights by up to 25% during severe conditions. In Uist, potential reductions reached up to 70%.</p><p>Professor Qingping Zou, of Heriot-Watt's Lyell Centre, said: \"While hard infrastructure like sea walls is one option, this shows the potential of nature-based solutions for flood risk management.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABERPJ-87524148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABERPJ2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GG6-T1S3-RS00-927T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">340011</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"207\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Aberdeen Press and Journal</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 11, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>North East</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp; HABITATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D76Q</classCode><className>MARINE BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000647</classCode><className>EROSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001538</classCode><className>SEAWEED &amp; ALGAE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSY2</classCode><className>DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It recommends legislative reform to embed SuDS more widely in drainage planning and calls for stronger coordination between developers, planners and water companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This aligns with recent changes to legislation: under the Water (Special Measures) Act, in force since 23 June, water companies in England and Wales are now legally required to consider nature-based solutions within their statutory Drainage and Wastewater Management Plans. They must explain if and how they are using SuDS and other interventions to reduce pressure on the sewer network and mitigate surface water flooding.</p><p>In parallel, the government has released new standards for SuDS in England - the first update to national standards in a decade. Aimed at designers, property developers, local authorities and other interested parties, the non-statutory guidance advises on design of SuDS for new developments.</p><p>SuDS deliver benefits far beyond just managing drainage. They enhance biodiversity, improve water quality and create healthier, more attractive, resilient places to live. Crucially for water companies, they can help reduce storm overflow spills by diverting stormwater away from sewer networks. Many types - such as engineered rain gardens or planters - also offer resilience to drought by storing rainwater for use in dry periods.</p><p>New legislation and national standards signal a positive trend toward broader adoption of SuDS.\u00a0 As a supplier of the SuDSPlanter systems, we work closely with the water sector - as well as local authorities, businesses and developers - to incorporate sustainable drainage into their operations and community settings.</p><p>Many water companies are already realising the benefits, having begun to invest in SuDS during AMP7 and earlier. Our planter systems are operating in all-but-one water company catchment in the UK - including in more than 300 schools.</p><p>Most recently, we partnered with Yorkshire Water to install 49 planter systems across 15 primary schools and one farm in areas vulnerable to surface water flooding, capturing up to 18,700l of rainwater, helping to reduce pressure on the sewer system during storms.</p><p>Under the new legislation, performance data like this, established through instant drainage modelling, will be essential for water companies writing their drainage plans - which must now consider sustainable drainage.\u00a0\u00a0The modelling, carried out by an independent civil engineer and hydraulics specialist, simulates how our planter systems of varying sizes, against varying roof areas, behave under a range of wet and dry weather conditions.</p><p>The analysis tells us how quickly the storage will fill, how long it would take to drain down and what impact each scenario would have on downstream drainage. This data can be used alongside results from the real-time monitoring we undertake of our planters in situ, to assess their hydraulic efficiency in attenuating and controlling roof runoff.</p><p>For developers specifiers and designers, such calculations can support planning applications by demonstrating how any SuDS within their designs can reduce the risk of flooding downstream.</p><p>Crucially, there is also the biodiversity net gain by creating and enhancing habitats within developments. Our planter systems, designed to ensure maximum plant health, can demonstrate a measurable increase in biodiversity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maintenance </emphasis></p><p>It is good to see a section on maintenance in the new national standards - poorly maintained SuDS can fail to deliver their intended benefits. We would certainly advise, those managing SuDS installation projects - particularly on third party land - consider maintenance agreements. These should include confirmation of who will be responsible for maintaining the asset in the future.</p><p>Of course, SuDS are only part of wider strategy for sustainable management of wastewater - they do not address domestic waste or grey water, which require separate solutions - but the increasing prominence of SuDS, through these policies, is a positive step forward in creating climate resilience communities. We look forward to supporting more organisations on this journey.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Alex Stephenson is director at SuDSPlanter</emphasis></p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcivilengineer.com/opinion/suds-growing-role-under-new-water-rules-15-08-2025/\">SuDS' growing role under new water rules</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcivilengineer.com\">New Civil Engineer</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NCIVEN-httpswwwnewcivilengineercomopinionsudsgrowingroleundernewwaterrules15082025</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NCIVEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GH4-1F13-RY86-4419-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">355074</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"743\"/><timeReceived>8:45 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Emap Ltd  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Civil Engineer</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63297\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 15, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe, Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001454</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N541330GM</classCode><className>CIVIL ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CR</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT PROCEDURE &amp;

and climate resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Lothian Esk Catchment Partnership (LECP) aims to restore nature and address climate change in the Lothian Esk river catchment area, which spans across East Lothian and Midlothian.</p><p>The partnership brings together Forth Rivers Trust, East Lothian Council, Midlothian Council, NatureScot, SEPA and Scottish Water to pool expertise and resources.</p><p>A spokesman for the LECP said: \"We are incredibly thankful to NatureScot for providing the funding to kickstart our ambitions for landscape-scale restoration in the Lothian Esk catchment.</p><p>\"Working closely with landowners and partners is key to its success.</p><p>\"We-re here to offer support and guidance on sustainable practices that can benefit both the environment and those who live and work in the catchment.</p><p>\"We encourage any landowners or stakeholders interested in exploring nature-based solutions to contact the partnership through Forth Rivers Trust and become part of this exciting initiative.\"</p><p>The North Esk begins in the Pentland Hills and the South Esk in the Moorfoot Hills, converging in Dalkeith Country Park before flowing into the Firth of Forth at Musselburgh.</p><p>The catchment faces ongoing challenges, including invasive non-native species, water pollution, flooding and historical modifications such as river straightening.</p><p>In late 2024, the partnership secured 91,000 from the Scottish Government-s Nature Restoration Fund to develop a catchment route map.</p><p>This funding, supported by East Lothian Council, Midlothian Council and SEPA, will help identify and prioritise future restoration actions.</p><p>Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council-s cabinet spokesman for environment, economic development, and tourism, said: \"We are very excited about the formation of the partnership and its potential to deliver nature-based solutions and improvement.</p><p>\"In 2023, East Lothian Council declared a nature emergency which recognised the decline in biodiversity and the impact of climate change on wildlife and the natural world.</p><p>\"We are committed to tackling this crisis through a range of strategies and projects, working alongside partner agencies, community groups and volunteers, and the work of the LECP will further contribute towards that vital objective.\"</p><p>The partnership will use tools such as drone surveys, biodiversity recording and flood modelling to identify opportunities for nature-based solutions.</p><p>A key focus will be working with landowners to promote nature-friendly farming practices and sustainable land management.</p><p>Potential actions include wetlands creation, leaky dams and agroforestry to reduce flooding, improve water quality and support biodiversity.</p><p>These measures could also provide alternative income streams for land managers while building resilience to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Vycarb is a Brooklyn-based carbon technology company founded in 2022.<br/>Chaired by the Carbon Business Council and the World Ocean Council, the Coalition will provide a platform for knowledge and collaboration on research around marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR). While members have already been meeting for two years, the formal launch allows for additional meetings and expanded membership as the coalition grows.</p><p><br/>Current members of the Coalition include Puro.earth, Banyu Carbon, Equatic, SeaO2, Vesta and Vycarb.<br/>They are being supported by observers, including Carbon Removal Canada, Cascade Climate, C-Worthy, Institute for Responsible Carbon Removal at American University, Ocean Visions and Carbon180.<br/>Toby Bryce, policy advisor to the Carbon Business Council, has been selected to chair the mCDR Coalition.<br/>The Coalition is one element of , each fostering collaboration and improving sectoral strength around carbon removal. The Council is also interested in carbon removals involving land, air and rocks.<br/>The mCDR Coalition is the first of its kind for the specific field, serving as a key part of the World Ocean Council's role in the EU Strategies for the Evaluation and Assessment of Ocean-Based Carbon Dioxide Removal project, which aims to increase awareness, engagement, and participation in the sector.<br/>While policymakers take cautious and early interest in mCDR, innovators and investors are forging ahead.<br/>CDR: The key statistics<br/>Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, ocean and from fuels. CDR is allegedly essential to limiting global temperatures in line with the Paris Agreement, with .<br/>Nature-based solutions account for 99% of all carbon removal credits on the global voluntary carbon markets today. Nonetheless, businesses and investors are increasingly supporting removal projects using man-made technologies.<br/>Jill Storey, Marine CDR Advisor to the World Ocean Council, said: \"Net-zero is now regarded as impossible without carbon removal. Covering 71% of the Earth's surface, the ocean offers the scale and potential needed to achieve climate goals. The mCDR Coalition is working to responsibly advance this emerging and vital maritime sector while raising its profile globally.\"<br/>Related article:<br/>Published 21st August 2025<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NLAEDT-httpswwwedienetnewcoalitionlaunchedtoscalemarineco2removal</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NLAEDT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GJC-BBC3-S0YF-01VC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">487993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"384\"/><timeReceived>12:01 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Faversham House Ltd  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Edie.net</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"63415\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 21, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Canada</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Americas, Northern America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe, Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001235</classCode><className>OCEANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRES</classCode><className>OCEAN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000624</classCode><className>ENTERPRISE GLOBALIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008YYT</classCode><className>GEOLOGY &amp;
