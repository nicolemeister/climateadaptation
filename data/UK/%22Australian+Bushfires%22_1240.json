This study focuses on the procurement, logistics, and warehousing processes that are being developed and integrated into the humanitarian supply chain. The report recommends ways to improve 2025 California-like recovery operations from a wildfire by drawing on earlier models of disaster logistics. It underlines procurement, logistics, and warehousing importance in securing the necessary resources in a disaster within the shortest time possible for delivery and distribution. The paper explains how strategic planning, prepositioning supply, route optimization, and selecting the optimal location for the warehouse may help reduce the reaction time while minimizing waste to ensure overall successful recovery operations. The findings are aimed at strengthening continuous efforts by providing specific recommendations to improve the effectiveness of the wildfire disaster relief supply chain.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Humanitarian supply chain (HSC) is the lifeline of timely provision of critical aid in various crises like natural disasters and conflict situations. Such supply chains assure that food, water, medicine, shelter, and other badly needed resources arrive systematically and swiftly for the affected population. Such a supply chain deals with multiple stakeholders like governments, NGOs, and logistics providers, who have to coordinate for success over the challenges of infrastructure, effective communication, and dynamic response to the changing situation [36]. A well-managed HSC can save lives, reduce suffering, and help communities to recover more quickly after disasters.</p><p>The most important role HSCs play in any wildfire scenario is supporting the affected communities. Wildfires will often devastate large areas and displace many people, while homes are destroyed and local infrastructures are ruined [4]. Humanitarian organizations must deploy food, water, medical facilities, and building materials to those affected regions quickly. Then, the HSC may eventually have to resort to airlifting or off-road delivery methods if there are compromised transportation routes in such a region [12]. Cooperation between governments, NGOs, and local authorities also ensures that such supplies are well utilized both in an effective and efficient way.</p><p>The recent cases of wildfires in 2025 show the significant role HSC plays in the recovery from the disastrous scenarios. HSCs have different issues caused by the fires burning in California and Los Angeles in January 2025 [35]. In addition to the significant number of evacuations and general destruction, shelter, food, water, and medical care needs are immense. Because of the declaration of emergency because of the fires in Los Angeles, there is a sense of focus that brings attention to how these fires impact supply chains and businesses within that region. Transportation has been affected by road closures and evacuations. Exposure to dangers such as smoke and poor-quality air has been experienced by outdoor workers. The trucking industry is a significant member in supply chains, and these disruptions have caused severe delays. Analysts feel that the fire disaster will incur an economic loss of $135 billion, and the damages will be tantamount to about 4% of the annual GDP of California [32]. The effects of such wildfires go beyond logistics,they endanger communities and livelihoods. This situation must be addressed very far away to prevent more interruptions. The HSC is critical in ensuring that aid is timely distributed to shelters and evacuation centers while managing resources such as firefighting equipment, relief teams, and communication systems. In relation to the scale of fires and the probable logistical hurdles, humanitarian organizations have to be agile and prepared to overcome smoke-filled air, closed roadways, and limited resources within the community to provide the right assistance for the affected communities [21].</p><p>Given the increased frequency and severity of wildfires in California, the recovery process must be optimized to reduce response times, minimize waste, and ensure timely delivery of resources. Using proven strategies from previous disaster recovery models will provide actionable recommendations for improving the efficiency of the humanitarian supply chain, ensuring that essential resources are available where and when they are needed most during wildfire recovery efforts. This sets the objective of this research study as designing and suggesting procurement, logistics, and warehousing strategies in enhancing wildfire recovery operations for the events happening in early 2025, based on insights from historical disaster supply chain models.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Literature Review</emphasis></p><p>Wildfires severely interfere with HSCs by destroying infrastructure, routes of transportation, and critical supplies. Fires burn down roads, bridges, and airports, which limits the ability to transport vital supplies, such as food, water, and medical support. In addition, the evacuation of large segments of the population creates an immediate need for emergency shelter and minimal services, putting additional pressure on supply systems. Environment destruction further affects agriculture and local industries by reducing production capacity and limiting the access of goods. In addition, the smoke and air pollution caused by wild fires can also have an adverse effect on public health, increase the potential for more medical care, and make recovery more challenging. Driven by climate change, human activity, and natural factors, these wildfires have widespread impacts on biodiversity, air quality, and infrastructure. The following cases highlight the alarming scale and intensity of wildfires and therefore call for the development of all-encompassing fire management strategies and environmental policies. Knowledge of causes, consequences, and lessons from past fires can prevent such future disasters and strengthen the resilience of communities and ecosystems affected.</p><p>The Siberian Taiga wildfires of 2003 are considered one of the most severe wildfire events in history, burning a staggering 55 million acres of Eastern Siberian forests [16]. The fires caused major destruction to the taiga as well as greatly affected global emissions, as the carbon released equaled the amount of reduction in emissions to be achieved for the European Union under the Kyoto Protocol. This catastrophic event brought to the fore the increasing role of wildfires in the boreal forests of the northern hemisphere.</p><p>Similarly, the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires were another devastating example of the increasing severity of wildfires in the face of climate change [8]. These fires, which ravaged 42 million acres of land, killed over 3 billion animals, including more than 60,000 koalas [33]. The fires were fueled by the hottest and driest year on record in Australia, making the 2019/2020 bushfire season one of the worst in the country\u2019s history. In addition to the environmental damage, thousands of homes were destroyed, particularly in New South Wales and Queensland [14].</p><p>The 2014 Northwest Territories fires in Canada burned 8.5 million acres and were notable for the widespread smoke that affected air quality not only in North America but also across Europe [20]. A mix of human-caused and natural fires, this event highlighted the far-reaching effects that wildfires can have, especially when large areas of land are involved. Similarly, the 2004 Alaska fire season in the USA saw 6.6 million acres burned, with 701 individual fires, many of which were sparked by lightning. The warm and wet summer conditions contributed to this record-setting fire season, underscoring the growing intensity of fire events in the region (Ambrose, 2014).</p><p>Australia experienced another major wildfire event with the 1939 Black Friday bushfire, which burned 5 million acres in Victoria during extreme drought conditions [18]. The fire caused the tragic loss of 71 lives and destroyed over 700 homes, marking it as one of the most destructive bushfires in Australian history [5]. The Great Fire of 1919 in Canada also burned 5 million acres across Alberta and Saskatchewan, claiming 11 lives and destroying hundreds of buildings [34]. The devastation from these fires led to changes in fire management practices in both countries.</p><p>Other significant fire events include the 1950 Chinchaga Fire in Canada, which burned 4.2 million acres, creating a massive \u201cGreat Smoke Pall\u201d visible across both North America and Europe [24]. Similarly, the 2010 Bolivia forest fires, primarily in Bolivia\u2019s section of the Amazon, burned 3.7 million acres, exacerbated by both human activity and extreme drought conditions (Campanharo, 2021). The 1910 Great Fire of Connecticut in the USA, burning 3 million acres, killed 87 people and led to significant changes in forest protection policies [9].</p><p>In China, the 1987 Black Dragon Fire burned 2.5 million acres, killing 191 people and displacing thousands of others [26]. The 2011 Richardson Backcountry Fire in Canada, which burned 1.7 million acres in Alberta, was the largest fire in the province since the Chinchaga Fire of 1950 [31]. Dry conditions and human activity contributed to the fire, which led to evacuations in the affected areas. The 1989 Manitoba wildfires, burning 1.3 million acres, were marked by a record number of 1,147 fires and forced the evacuation of over 24,000 people [15].</p><p>Lastly, the 2024 Texas wildfires, which burned 1.1 million acres, became the largest wildfire event in the state\u2019s history [28]. The Smokehouse Creek Fire, in particular, accounted for much of the damage, further highlighting the increasing scale of wildfires in the USA.</p><p>These events, along with others on the list, show the growing intensity and frequency of wildfires globally, driven by climate change, human activity, and changing environmental conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Need for the Study on the Design and Management of HSCs</emphasis></p><p>The increased rate and intensity of wildfires, driven by climate change and land-use changes, make the urgent need for disaster preparedness and response measures apparent. Wildfires cause immense destruction to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements, often leaving communities devastated and in dire need of humanitarian assistance in places like California, Siberia, Australia, and Canada [30]. In such cases, well-coordinated HSCs are critical in delivering relief in time to ensure that essential resources such as food, water, medical supplies, and emergency shelter are provided appropriately to the affected populations.</p><p>Optimization of disaster relief operations and design and management of HSCs are exactly critical. Wildfires, by nature, disrupt transportation networks and destroy infrastructure and pose severe challenges for rescue operations due to restricted access to areas. Thus, an effectively managed HSC that integrates real-time data on the locations of affected populations, the extent of damage, and the availability of resources to ensure the quickest delivery of aid matters. The systems also need to have sufficient flexibility to adjust based on the different changes of events, which include weather, changing forefronts, and movement of displaced people.</p><p>There is a natural need for major planning to pre-position supplies in strategic locations, with an emphasis on the identification of high-risk zones. Then, there is an overriding need for resilient logistics networks capable of weathering the pressure associated with a major crisis. That was evident from the devastation caused by the Australian bushfires in 2019/2020, when thousands of homes were destroyed and the wildlife was devastated. The insights gained from past occurrences ought to guide future planning initiatives aimed at decreasing the susceptibility of communities to the disorder caused by wildfires and enhancing recovery durations.

Through the analysis of past wildfire relief programs\u2019 successes and failures, we can better utilize resources, minimize risks, and ensure more effective and just relief processes during future disasters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing the HSC for Wildfire</emphasis></p><p>The HSC comprises several fundamental parts that make sure there is effective response and allocation of resources after a disaster occurs. Of all these, there are three, which are at the top position: procurement, logistics, and warehousing; each plays its role in delivering aid in a timely and efficient fashion. The structure of the humanitarian relief chain comprises three primary steps: (1) the engagement of suppliers and the procurement process; (2) the establishment of predetermined locations for distribution, medical centers, and warehousing; (3) the transportation of goods [11].</p><p>Procurement is defined as the process of sourcing and acquiring the goods, services, and resources necessary for disaster response. Procurement for humanitarian work would therefore encompass identifying the sources, suppliers, and procuring a minimum list of commodities such as food, medication, and materials for shelters [22]. This also includes contractual provisions, budget considerations, delivery in time, and the integrity required while delivering assistance to affected persons by disasters [17]. Since the dynamics of a disaster is volatile, the procurement system must be responsive, adaptive, and sensitive to new needs as they arise in situations on the ground.</p><p>The second driver of supply chain, which is logistics, is the backbone of any HSC, and its focus lies in the movement of goods, people, and information. Good logistics management will ensure that resources are transported effectively from suppliers to affected regions [11]. This involves coordination in transportation, planning of routes, tracking of supplies, and making real-time decisions. In a disaster situation, logistics can be very complicated because of the destruction of infrastructure, geographical difficulties [1], and fluctuating needs, requiring flexible and adaptive logistics solutions.</p><p>Warehousing involves the storage and handling of supplies before their distribution to affected populations. Warehouses are essential in maintaining stock levels, ensuring product safety, and arranging items in an orderly manner for effective distribution. The strategic location of warehouses is crucial to ensure timely delivery of aid, especially in large-scale disasters. Pre-positioning of supplies and emergency warehouses in disaster-prone areas can greatly improve response times and efficiency.</p><p>A focus on procurement, logistics, and warehousing guarantees that the appropriate resources are obtained, transported efficiently, and stored strategically, thereby facilitating timely and effective delivery of relief. Through the optimization of these components, humanitarian organizations can enhance response times, reduce shortages, and improve overall recovery efforts in areas affected by disasters.</p><p>A study proposes a fire disaster management approach focusing on optimized resource allocation based on suppression priority, selecting sites using fire propagation models according to priorities, and altering real-time logistics to make adaptive plans for resource distribution and vehicle routing. Another study further suggests improving fire disaster management through increased participation of the locality to make prompt decisions, pre-positioning of warehouses and training personnel on standby, and decentralizing to make decision making agile and responsive in disaster-prone areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing the Procurement Strategy</emphasis></p><p>A clearly defined procurement strategy for HSCs must be put in place to enhance response to a fire disaster. Such a strategy enables timely procurement and delivery of essentials like food supplies, medical treatment, and firefighting equipment. Transparency, accountability, and efficiency minimize donor mistrust, wastage, and inefficient use of resources. Such strategies involve prepositioned stocks along with developing closer relations with suppliers to improve quick mobilization during emergencies. Effective procurement reduces risks, such as monitoring a supplier\u2019s performance, coupled with the use of technology to enable transparency and thereby increase the efficiency of disaster relief efforts while improving overall response time for saving lives and reducing suffering. Sahay et al. (2016) have discussed a procurement strategy for HSCs in disaster contexts by ensuring transparency, accountability, and efficiency for timely and cost-effective undertaking of any relief operation. Figure 1 represents the procurement design with the following strategies.</p><p>Ensure transparency: documenting every step of the procurement process, hence, keeping a fair view and clarity at every stage to build trust and accountability.</p><p>Maintain accountability: follow all the donor requirements and regulations so that funds are properly accounted for, and that donor expectations are met.</p><p>Focus on efficiency and cost-effectiveness: This means getting the appropriate quantity and quality of supplies at the right time and place, from the least-cost provider.</p><p>Prepositioning of stocks: keeping critical stocks placed in well-defined, strategic locations prior to disasters allows for their speedy access when necessary.</p><p>Build strong supplier relationships: creating and maintaining reliable contacts with trusted suppliers permits prompt and reliable delivery of goods and services as needed.</p><p>Mitigate risks: continually monitor and assess any risk the supply chain faces, such that proactive measures can avert delays and interruptions in the procurement process.</p><p>Timely response to needs: throughout the time of disasters, swift acquisition has to deal with the emerging needs in a manner that avoids delays in humanitarian relief.</p><p>Monitor supplier performance: assessing the performance of vendors on a regular basis to assure all quality standards are adhered to and that issues can be addressed to improve service delivery.</p><p>Use technology for transparency: introduce technology and tracking systems that will provide real-time visibility into the procurement process and inventory levels.</p><p>Review and adapt procurement policies: continuously review and update procurement policies to ensure the emergence of challenges are met, as well as align with the disaster response strategy.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Procurement strategy in humanitarian supply chain for fire disaster response</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing Logistics Strategies</emphasis></p><p>The humanitarian work is carried out with logistics at its very base, deciding the proper mechanisms for effective resource distribution in times of emergencies [3]. It involves planning, coordinating, and implementing the transport of goods such as food, medicines, and tools to the affected regions by any disaster. Logistics shorten response time and put the relief at the right places in extreme urgency, especially in areas of high congestion or those difficult to reach [23]. It equally works in inventory control, locating collection and distribution centers, and handling infrastructure problems [6]. Humanitarian logistics can be described as a series of processes and systems that mobilize people, resources, and knowledge to provide timely assistance and support to communities affected by what can be considered disasters or emergencies, aiming to minimize shortages, waste, and costs in endeavor to maximize impact [27]. That is why logistics in humanitarian operations will ensure that the scarce resources will be used as efficiently as possible, avoiding any delay that can jeopardize relief operations and risk lives.</p><p>Once the fire disaster on February 20, 2019, set ablaze the old part of Dhaka, Bangladesh, which was mentioned above, it led to mass devastation and loss of lives, leaving behind 117 dead [6]. It spread quickly across tightly packed residential urban areas, posing considerable challenges for the efforts of rescue and relief. Traffic congestion, road conditions, and lack of evacuation plans aggravated an already bad situation. As a solution to the shabby traffic conditions during rescues, this research put forth a mathematical modeling approach for other disaster responses that the elected government should be implemented to optimize efficient transportation routes for relief resources, overcoming the issue of traffic congestion, firstly in rescue and secondly towards the enhancement of smooth governmental intervention. In addition, the model aims to improve preparedness and decrease response time while containing future devastation. The logistic solution that has been proposed by the author for managing fire disaster relief operations as an HSC (Fig. 2) can be summarized with these terms:</p><p>Mathematical model for logistics planning: the research suggests a mathematical modeling\u2013based approach for the planning of transporting relief and rescue resources, considering minimizing disaster response time in densely populated areas, like Dhaka.</p><p>Collection and distribution centers (CNs and DCs): by the model, the collection centers (mainly located on the outskirts) are positioned for accumulating relief items, whereas the distribution centers (within city) handle the reception of items and their distribution to demand points.</p><p>Route optimization: the model determines optimal routes for transporting relief resources from collection centers to distribution centers and finally into the affected areas, considering either traffic congestion or road conditions.</p><p>Traffic congestion index: here, the traffic density and suitability indices are defined to assess and monitor the transportation route, guiding decisions regarding the selection of such routes for timely delivery of resources.</p><p>Government intervention: the model provides for government intervention in case the traffic density or suitability of the route is found unacceptable, ensuring that such an operation is not obstructed [25].</p><p>Emergency monitoring cell: an emergency monitoring cell must be established to monitor the overall transportation route, guide the movements of the goods, and adapt to traffic challenges in real time.</p><p>Pre-positioning of resources: this pre-positioning of skilled relief personnel and emergency apparatus put resources at the collection centers ready for prompt delivery to the affected areas, shortening response time.</p><p>Routes for optimal response: the model supports the identification of routes that will lead to the most efficient response, depending on the level of traffic, road conditions, and alternatives available to minimize delays in reaching the affected areas.</p><p>Resource allocation to firefighting and rescues: the model accounts for the allocation of ambulance and fire truck resources, in addition to trained personnel to either firefighting or rescue operations, with a focus on minimizing associated response times [35].</p><p>Post-disaster recovery and mitigation: the model will incorporate post-disaster recovery and mitigation measures, such as identifying the cause of the fire disaster and suggesting actionable steps to prevent its reprisal.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Logistics design of humanitarian supply chain for fire disaster relief operations</p><p>Since humanitarian supply chains are seriously impacted by wildfires, particularly coordination, communication, and last-mile delivery of disaster relief goods, drones can offer a solution to this. Through more efficient logistics, reduced risks to human responders, and enhanced disaster response effectiveness, drones (or unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs) offer a revolutionary solution, as explained below.</p><p>Interaction and arrangement</p><p>Conventional communication networks often function ineffectively in wildfires due to damaged roads and infrastructure. Restoring connectivity via drones with mesh networking or mobile relay functions enables volunteers, humanitarian groups, and firefighting teams to communicate with ease [10]. For instance, UAVs can relay radio signals or provide temporary Wi-Fi hotspots to ensure uninterrupted connectivity in hostile or remote locations.</p><p>Airborne monitoring and damage evaluation</p><p>Real-time mapping of fire extent via drones with thermal imaging and multispectral sensors can identify high-risk areas and stranded individuals [37]. To make sure medical and humanitarian aid is delivered where it is needed the most, this information optimizes evacuation routes and resource deployment.</p><p>Emergency medical supply delivery</p><p>Drones are able to transport essential medications, blood supplies, and portable emergency packages to inaccessible fire areas. UAVs have been shown to be effective in medical logistics by companies like Zipline, and this can be expanded to wildfire scenarios [2]. Materials are able to be airdropped without compromising human lives due to self-controlled drones that are capable of flying over hazardous grounds.</p><p>Search and rescue support</p><p>Even in smoke-covered areas, missing individuals can be located by AI drones capable of object recognition [29]. Drones can guide rescue teams to the victims while sidestepping risky routes when supplemented with ground robots.</p><p>Policy recommendations and future preparedness</p><p>Governments and disaster management bodies should invest in longer endurance fire-resistant UAVs as commercial drones may not be able to manage every wildfire scenario. Wildfire management on a mass scale could be enhanced even further with research on swarm drone technology [13].</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Designing warehousing strategies</emphasis></p><p>A study [7] examined the main factors for choosing suitable warehouse locations, including efficient infrastructure, especially access to airports for quick disaster response, and safety. Proximity to seaports is less important indeed; rather, the ability to quickly send resources to a disaster site is critical. Many organizations also prefer safe locations, removed far away from disaster-prone areas, such as Dubai, which provides excellent infrastructure. There is evidence that the cost is the main element that influences warehouse location decisions, with organizations using UNHRD facilities, where storage is free of charge, therefore encouraging cooperation and efficiency in logistical matters. The work of Maharjan and Hanaoka [19] seeks to locate optimally the number and location of warehouses for disaster response using a maximal covering location problem (MCLP). It looks into different scenarios involving the trade-offs between the number of warehouses versus their coverage distance to achieve a certain level of service. The study demonstrates that the expected service level increases in the number of warehouses and decreases in coverage distance. Sensitivity analyses show how changing an assortment of warehouse numbers or geographical constraints affects coverage. The study\u2019s findings show warehouse location decisions are essential in facilitating faster response during disaster times and can be applied to other vulnerable countries in the context of public facility placement during a HSC after a major disaster.</p><p>The following considerations can be noted while deciding warehouse location under HSCs during major disaster situations, also as represented in Fig. 3:Fig. 3</p><p>Warehousing design of humanitarian supply chain for fire disaster relief operations</p><p>Maximal covering location problem: the research has applied MCLP to determine the number and position of warehouses. The model maximizes coverage while minimizing the number of warehouses with key parameters including response time and access to demand points.</p><p>Geographical constraints: the model incorporates different geographical conditions, rocky-terrain conditions particularly having an impact on travel time and accessibility. For example, the variations in distances (100-km, 200-km, and 300-km) would represent different responses according to the terrain conditions prevalent in the location.</p><p>Transportation accessibility: locations with increased road density and improved infrastructure are favored so that warehouses can easily be reached from demand points. In countries like Nepal with poor infrastructure, accurate distance computations (drawing from actual road networks) are essential in finding optimum sites for warehouses.</p><p>Disaster safety and development index: the study incorporated disaster safety and developmental indices that acted as other constraints in the programming. This meant that warehouses would be located away from disaster-prone (i.e., safer) areas while also taking into account the level of development of a site that affects operational ease.</p><p>Demand point prioritization: high-density areas demand greater humanitarian priorities. Hence, a priority value is assigned to each demand point based on population density, with higher density areas getting priority for relief.</p><p>Thresholds and constraints: for each factor (transportation accessibility, safety impingement, and development), thresholds are set up to ensure that only locations that could satisfy those constraints are selected as warehouse sites. During the model implementation, these thresholds are employed as an enforcement mechanism to maintain forgone consistency over candidate-location selection.</p><p>Scenario analysis and sensitivity testing: by reviewing various distances for coverage, the model provides options for selecting the number of warehouses, their locations based on resources available, and the desired response time. Sensitivity analysis serves to clarify how variations in key constraints influence decisions regarding warehouse locations.</p><p>Optimizing resource allocation: the primary objective will be finding the fewest warehouses that can completely serve all demand points. All decisions would also take into consideration readily available resources and possibly other aspects related to the capacity of the choice, such as balancing such trade-off between warehouse numbers and a covered area.</p><p>The humanitarian supply chain (HSC) designed to recover from the wildfire, as outlined in the strategies for recovery through its major drivers, is depicted in Fig. 4.Fig. 4</p><p>Humanitarian supply chain for wildfire disaster recovery</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>In the context of wildfire disasters, in the procurement, logistics, and warehousing of HSCs, these modes encompass a blend that helps to deliver the most efficient recovery in real time. The conjunction of technologies, actors, materials, and procedures is highly efficient in enabling essential supplies to be procured and distributed to affected communities, thereby reducing waiting times and minimizing impact throughout and after the disaster.</p><p>An effective procurement strategy focuses on the continuous acquisition and redistribution of assistance to victims. These could include medical supplies, food and water, or fire-retardant materials. The overall transparency and accountability will in turn contribute a lot in developing trust in the donors, optimal use of the resources, and timely availability of needed aid.</p><p>Prepositioning supplies in such strategic areas permits somebody to be more ready, leading to mobilization efforts in times of disaster. Also, fast and timely procurement will guarantee that policies and regulations put forth by the donor are met, while at the same time ensuring accountability in programming.</p><p>In other words, logistics deals with the very complicated planning, coordination, execution, and to some degree, installation for the moving of the supplies to wherever disaster has struck. Fire responses face the challenge of having congested road systems, dysfunctional infrastructure, and damage to the transport networks sometimes causing delays in delivery of aid materials. Effective decisions in a logistics plan\u2014like optimized routes of transport\u2014guarantee that no delays are caused to prevent the provision of assistance to affected populations. Logistics management encompasses the overall management of transportation systems, as well as control of inventories, the establishment of reception and distribution centers, and also the management of relief supplies. Emergency monitoring centers implement rapid response solutions with real-time tracking of supplies movement while making entries of challenges that arise such as congestion and infrastructure damage. Warehousing decisions are very vital as they determine the availability and accessibility of relief resources during a wildfire disaster. The strategic location of warehouses should consider such factors as infrastructure, disaster safety, and accessibility. It will ensure the rapid flow of supplies into the areas of the greatest demand. Using models like the maximal covering location problem (MCLP), it helps for an optimal location of warehouses, balancing the count of warehouses and distances of coverage to maximize response efficiency. Sensitivity analysis helps in adjusting the number of warehouses based on GIS limitations and available resources, hence ensuring a speedy response.</p><p>These elements\u2014discussions of procurement, logistics, and warehousing\u2014form the backbone of disaster recovery efforts in wildfire situations. By ensuring that resources are efficiently sourced, transported, and stored, they help to reduce the overall time to respond and reduce the wastage of resources, ultimately saving lives.

'I love everything she does and asked if she would do something more experimental.'</p><p>Niamh's favourite snack is a Dutch carrot, so when she saw a photograph of a carrot bouquet, she asked Lisa if that would work.</p><p>To her surprise, Lisa said, 'Let's go full carrot'.</p><p>'There was a drama where the bridesmaids' Ubers got delayed and I was carrying them for 45 minutes. They were really heavy so I didn't throw the bouquet,' she said.</p><p>The yellow ribbon was selected to match handmade broaches for the groomsmen, referencing the Sun of May in the centre of the Argentinian flag for Maxi's heritage.</p><p>When Maxi proposed, Niamh said she wanted to get married right away and would have happily eloped.</p><p>'But we both have big Irish and Argentinian families who are emotional and intense. That would not have gone down well. They would not talk to us again,' she joked.</p><p>However she did admit that planning the wedding was 'definitely stressful.'</p><p>'I thought I was too cool to be stressed about a wedding, but I'm not apparently.'</p><p>However, Niamh didn't want it to feel like a day at the office. </p><p>'A friend said to me, \"You know Niamh, for a lot of people, this is the fashion show of their life. This is their moment to produce a big event. But it's not a fashion show.\"</p><p>'It's a party and being with people you love. That's what it's all about,' Niamh said. </p><p>'The best piece of advice I would give engaged couples is: The DIY things and handcrafted elements that your family and friends are involved in making end up being the most special.'</p><p>With that ethos at the heart of the day, Niamh set about designing herself two wedding dresses.</p><p>'When we were kids, my grandmother had shown me and my sister the trains and waistband of her wedding dress. They were fully beaded appliqu\u00e9 and just the most exquisite thing I had ever seen.</p><p>'I remembered that so strongly so I immediately went to ask her if she would let me use them,' she said.</p><p>'My brand is very sentimental. Everything is imbued with meaning,' she added before revealing her dresses would be the same.</p><p>'My grandma's waist is tiny and mine is not tiny at all. So I reinterpreted that into my veil,' she explained.</p><p>Niamh got all her fashion designer friends to give her small sentimental objects, which she then beaded onto the dress alongside shells from the beaches where she had her first date with Maxi, the one where he proposed, and Irish luck charms.</p><p>Her 93-year-old grandmother helped with the finishing touches.</p><p>'My mum got married in a 1920s-style Zambeesi dress, so I made a cotton Poplin 1920s style tea dress for the reception,' she said.</p><p>The couple's white Holden Rodeo Ute served as the 'Just Married' vehicle, which was fitted out with handmade decorations made by their friends.</p><p>'It's the first car I've ever owned. We bought it together. It's one of these things where every six months we're sure it's about to die,' Niamh said.</p><p>She begged Maxi to hold onto the car until the wedding.</p><p>'I've never felt so famous in my life. Every stranger was waving and beeping at us as we drove off. It was so fun.'</p><p>The morning after the wedding, the newlyweds were driving home when they got pulled over by New South Wales Police, who threatened to fine them over the decorations - but let them off with a warning.</p><p>Niamh first met Maxi when he reached out to her to see if she would be interested in doing a photoshoot with him for her Darlinghurst-based independent fashion label.</p><p>'There was an instant vibe,' she said.</p><p>The pair started casually seeing each other, and to Niamh's surprise, when she first visited Maxi's Potts Point apartment - she came face to face with a drawing of herself on his wall.</p><p>Maxi had unwittingly purchased the artwork from a friend of Niamh's from fashion school, who had recreated her likeness from an old Instagram selfie and sold it to him in a fundraiser for the 2020 Australian bushfires.</p><p>'Out of hundreds of drawings, he'd chosen the one of me,' she laughed. 'I realised because I was wearing one of my own designs.'</p><p>The couple put the drawing in a drawer for three years, lest it was bad luck, but it now has a pride of place in their martial home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-112606732</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G3H-DVD3-S8NM-H1RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"907\"/><timeReceived>6:09 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Since it first started, it\u2019s fair to say that the need to protect our planet has become even more urgent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There\u2019s no hiding from the damage we are doing, from deforestation to our treatment of wildlife and the plastic filling our oceans, and over the years there have been numerous award-winning documentaries that lay bare the impact we are having on the environment.</p><p>Here, I\u2019ve picked out the best of the bunch for anyone with a social conscience and a subscription to one of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.techradar.com/best/best-tv-streaming-service-cord-cutting-compare\">best streaming services</url>.</p><h>David Attenborough: A Life on Our Planet (2020)</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RT score:</emphasis> 96%<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Age rating:</emphasis> PG <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Length:</emphasis> 1h 23m<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Director:</emphasis> Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where to watch:</emphasis> Netflix (US, UK, AU)</p><p>In his 98 years on the planet, naturalist and filmmaker Sir David Attenborough has witnessed first-hand humanity\u2019s colossal impact on the natural world. His award-winning documentary acts as a witness statement to this and shows how wildlife populations have dwindled over the course of his illustrious career.</p><p>David also digs into issues such as biodiversity loss, climate change and the use of fossil fuels and shows how we are hurtling towards a terrifying mass extinction event. However, David does offer some hope, suggesting preventative actions that could help reverse the tide.</p><h>Burning (2021)</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RT score:</emphasis> 94%<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Age rating:</emphasis> 15<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Length:</emphasis> 1h 26m <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Director:</emphasis> Eva Orner <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where to Watch:</emphasis> Prime Video (US, UK, AU)</p><p>Between 2019 and 2020, catastrophic Australian bushfires burned over 59 million acres of land, killing approximately three billion animals and affecting millions of Australians. In Burning, filmmaker Eva Orner looks at this unprecedented period of time known as \u2018Black Summer\u2019 and explains how these fires were fuelled by climate change.</p><p>Told from the perspective of the victims, activists, scientists and fire-fighters, Orner shows how, thanks to global warming, the frequency and severity of these fires have increased over the years plus she calls out certain elements of the media for spreading climate misinformation and enabling denialism.</p><h>Chasing Coral (2017)</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RT score:</emphasis> 100%<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Age rating:</emphasis> PG <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Length:</emphasis> 1hr 33m<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Director:</emphasis> Jeff Orlowski <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where to Watch:</emphasis> Netflix (US, UK, AU)</p><p>With an impressive 100% Rotten Tomatoes rating, Emmy award-winning documentary Chasing Coral is a must-see for anyone concerned about our oceans. It follows a team of divers, photographers and scientists who between 2014 and 2017 documented the most severe bleaching event of coral reefs in recorded history.</p><p>This is where coral stressed by temperature changes expel the algae living within them, causing them to turn white. The film shows how during that three year-period 75 per cent of corals suffered or died from heat stress brought on by climate change and predicts that if nothing is done about it, by the end of the century every reef in the world will bleach.</p><h>An Inconvenient Truth (2006)</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">RT score:</emphasis> 93%<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Age rating:</emphasis> PG <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Length:</emphasis> 1hr 58m<br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Director:</emphasis> Davis Guggenheim   <br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where to Watch:</emphasis> Pluto TV (US)</p><p>There\u2019s no doubt that global warming is an inconvenient truth and this Oscar-winning documentary shows how politicians and governments are hesitant to address it because it means they will have to make unpopular decisions to tackle the issue.</p><p>The 2006 film follows former US vice president Al Gore as he gives lectures at schools and universities across the globe, warning of the effects of global warning.

However, high false alarm rates, shallow-layered networks, and poor recognition in challenging environments continue to hinder their practical deployment. To address these limitations, we introduce the Attention-Enhanced Fire Recognition Network (AEFRN). This novel progressive attention-over-attention framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Our approach introduces three key innovations: Firstly, Convolutional Self-Attention (CSA), integrating global self-attention with convolution through dynamic kernels and trainable filters for enhanced low-level fire feature processing. Secondly, Recursive Atrous Self-Attention (RASA) with optimized dilation rates, capturing comprehensive multi-scale contextual information through a recursive formulation with minimal parameter overhead. Thirdly, an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) with modified channel and spatial attention mechanisms for robust feature discrimination. We validate AEFRN\u2019s interpretability using Grad-CAM visualization, demonstrating effective attention focus on fire-relevant regions. Comprehensive experimental evaluation on FD and BoWFire benchmark datasets shows AEFRN\u2019s superiority over SOTA methods, achieving 99.11% accuracy on the FD dataset, and 97.98% accuracy on the BoWFire dataset. Extensive comparisons against twelve SOTA approaches confirm AEFRN\u2019s effectiveness for fire detection in challenging scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</p><p/><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Fire is the most dangerous and destructive catastrophe due to its rapid proliferation and disastrous environmental consequences. The efficient management of fire is a challenging task, especially in areas with a high intensity of combustible materials, such as forests1, residential zones2, and many other sensitive environments3. Fire can arise from several causes involving human activities4, machinery failures5, rising temperatures, and climate change6. Forest and bushfires, considered the most hazardous kind of fire, may cause significant harm to the environment due to their rapid expansion. These flames pose a substantial danger since their intensity rapidly grows, raising the possibility of widespread ecological damage. Recently, around 19 million hectares of land were burned down by destructive bushfires in Australia in the first quarter of 20207. Unfortunately, it decimated over 3,000 residences and caused the loss of over 1.5 billion animal lives, resulting in a path of grief and devastation8. In 2021, the US Fire Administration documented 353,500 residential fires, resulting in 2,840 fatalities, 1,400 injuries, and $8.86 billion in financial damages3. In light of these challenges, researchers have proposed various fire detection techniques that depend on visual or environmental sensors. Early fire recognition is crucial in reducing the loss of human life and limiting other types of damage. Soft computing approaches, which use multiple sensory input sources, are becoming an effective option for enabling prompt detection and response.</p><p>Vision-based fire recognition systems can be generally classified into traditional machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. Conventional ML-based approaches focus on analyzing fire shape, texture, color, and motion features9, 10, 11\u201312. The effectiveness of these techniques heavily depends on traditionally obtained features. However, selecting the most suitable features poses a considerable challenge. Factors such as the changing shape of fire due to airflow, the influence of lighting conditions, and variations in fire colors across different materials make it challenging to balance false positive rate, loss, and overall accuracy. Achieving an optimal balance among fire detection metrics presents a persistent challenge in conventional detection methods. DL has revolutionized fire detection, garnering extensive recognition and integration in numerous applications. However, many existing datasets are limited in diversity, generally consisting of only two classes: fire and non-fire. Even with its advantages, DL models encounter specific challenges when handling complex fire scenes.</p><p>Identifying fires in sunlight that resemble flames, variations in lighting that reflect fire-like colors, and objects that visually imitate fire present substantial challenges13,14. These complex scenarios expose critical limitations in existing approaches, which often lack the discriminative capability to differentiate between actual fire incidents and visually similar elements. A fundamental challenge to advancing fire detection research is the inadequate representation of real-world complexities in existing datasets, as highlighted in15. Moreover, while advanced DL models have shown promise, their deployment in practical surveillance systems faces significant constraints due to computational overhead and resource limitations16,17. Additionally, existing attention modules typically operate independently without considering the hierarchical relationships between different attention mechanisms. This often leads to suboptimal feature representation and reduced detection accuracy in challenging scenarios. The lack of effective attention modules that can simultaneously address spatial localization, channel-wise feature enhancement, and multi-scale contextual understanding represents a critical gap in current literature. These limitations necessitate the development of attention-based networks that can effectively integrate multiple attention mechanisms for effective detection in challenging visuals.</p><p>To address these limitations, we introduce the Attention-Enhanced Fire Recognition Network called AEFRN. The proposed network combines the potential of Convolutional Self-Attention (CSA), Recursive Atrous Self-Attention (RASA), and an enhanced Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) through a hierarchical attention-over-attention paradigm. Our network shows the capability to simultaneously extract detailed local fire features and scene-level information via its adaptive multi-resolution attention mechanism. The CSA module integrates traditional convolution operations with global self-attention mechanisms to focus on fundamental fire-specific visual patterns. RASA uses strategically configured atrous convolutions with optimized dilation parameters to capture contextual information across different spatial scales. Additionally, we present an optimized CBAM architecture featuring strengthened channel-wise and spatial attention components that enhance the network\u2019s capacity for fire-relevant features. This unified attention framework facilitates robust fire detection performance under challenging operational conditions, such as partial occlusions, dynamic lighting variations, and environments with visually similar non-fire objects. It showcases state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across established benchmark datasets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Contributions</emphasis></p><p>The main contributions of this research are outlined as follows:</p><p>We introduce AEFRN, a hierarchical attention framework that effectively combines CSA, RASA, and an improved CBAM using a layered attention-over-attention approach. Our CSA component seamlessly integrates global self-attention mechanisms with spatially-focused convolution operations by utilizing adaptive kernel configurations and trainable filter parameters, which allow for the robust identification of essential fire-specific visual patterns. The RASA architecture implements thoughtfully designed multi-scale dilated convolutions with optimized dilation coefficients to gather comprehensive contextual representations across different spatial ranges.</p><p>We propose a novel MCBAM that incorporates sophisticated channel-wise and spatial attention components. This enhanced architecture systematically improves feature representation quality by amplifying fire-associated spatial regions and feature channels, while simultaneously suppressing noise from background distractors and visually similar non-fire elements. The combined attention modules operate cohesively, delivering improved feature selectivity without imposing substantial computational cost.</p><p>Extensive ablation experiments are carried out to validate each component of the proposed framework. These include an analysis of backbone networks, where ResNet50 demonstrates the best performance; evaluations of various attention module combinations, showing the complementary strength of CSA, RASA, and MCBAM; and optimization of data augmentation strategies to boost model generalization across diverse fire detection scenarios. The studies also validate the optimal dilation rate configuration and demonstrate that AEFRN\u2019s computational efficiency is suitable for edge device deployment.</p><p>We achieve SOTA performance on benchmark datasets, with AEFRN attaining 99.11% accuracy and 98.88% F1-score on the FD dataset, and 97.98% accuracy and 97.94% F1-score on the BoWFire dataset. These results represent significant improvements over existing methods, including MAFire-Net and ConvNeXt-TSA, demonstrating the effectiveness of our progressive attention framework for practical fire detection applications.</p><p>The forthcoming sections of this paper are organized as follows: Section 2 presents a comprehensive literature review, providing an overview of traditional ML and DL-based methods along with hybrid approaches. In Section 3, we elaborate on the details of our proposed methodology. Section 4 presents and discusses the datasets used for performance evaluation, parameter settings, comparative analysis, ablation study, model complexity, and detailed results. Finally, in Section 5, we conclude the paper by providing insights into potential directions for future research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related work</emphasis></p><p>Extensive research is underway in fire detection, with a focus on computer vision (CV)-based networks. This automation reduces the need for human intervention, enabling swift response times. These advanced techniques leverage CV algorithms to achieve early and accurate fire detection. Fire detection approaches can be broadly classified into two main categories: 1) Traditional ML-based approaches and 2) DL-based methods.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Machine learning based approaches</emphasis></p><p>ML-based fire detection techniques leverage various image attributes, including color, texture, motion, and shape. Baseline techniques12,18, 19, 20, 21\u201322 utilize the YCbCr and RGB color spaces to extract color features for fire detection. The literature extensively incorporates fuzzy logic, superpixel texture discrimination, and statistical color features in an integrated fashion9,23,24. Furthermore, fire recognition research frequently examines moving objects using optical flow features. These ML techniques, however, are often susceptible to environmental influences, such as dynamic entities resembling fire and objects with orange or red hues, which contribute to increased false positive rates. The conventional approach of maintaining brightness consistency fails to accurately capture the characteristics of fire. Additionally, optical flow-based methods require substantial computational resources. To mitigate the subjective impact on the recognition process, researchers have focused on trainable classifiers. Works in25,26 propose utilizing unimodal Gaussian covariance features extracted from spatial-temporal regions and employing support vector machines (SVM) for classifying areas exhibiting fire-like colors in motion. Optimizing feature selection for immediate recognition of fire scenes and generating accurate alarms presents considerable challenges in ML-based methods. These challenges stem from factors such as variations in shiny environments and similar moving elements like fire and shadows, which can degrade model performance. Consequently, numerous researchers have investigated end-to-end DL-based methods to address these challenges and improve fire scene classification effectiveness.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deep learning based approaches</emphasis></p><p>DL has emerged as a prominent data-driven approach, finding extensive applications across diverse fields27,28. Its efficiency extends to various tasks, including classification, detection, and segmentation. With its ability to learn intricate patterns and representations from data, DL has demonstrated formidable prowess in tackling complex challenges across multiple domains. Several researchers have investigated Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for fire detection to address the limitations inherent in ML techniques29, 30\u201331. CNN models provide a significant advantage through their ability to extract and recognize features efficiently, enhancing convenience and reliability. For instance, work in32 assessed fire recognition efficiency using AlexNet, VGG, and GoogLeNet networks, with GoogLeNet yielding the most favorable outcomes. Similarly, another study33 introduced ResNet50 and VGG16 networks, where ResNet50 demonstrated superior performance compared to VGG16. However, their experimental dataset was limited in size, potentially impacting the generalizability of their findings. Previous studies19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27\u201328,32,33 using LeNet-5 and AlexNet models (plain CNN architectures) demonstrated superior performance in fire scene classification compared to ML-based approaches. Nonetheless, these models are unsuitable for resource-constrained settings due to their computational complexity and large model sizes. Recognizing this limitation, the work in34 investigated a lightweight CNN network known as InceptionV1. Moreover, Khan et al. achieved improved results by reducing model size and time complexity while examining various CNN-based models.</p><p>Many researchers explored impactful support measures, including detection of combustible materials, evacuation observation, counting, and target type detection. Current research on implementing DL based methods on resource-constrained devices (RCDs) primarily focuses on two key concerns: reducing model complexity and size. Various model compression techniques have been investigated, including weight pruning and weight quantization35. Pruning involves removing unstructured neurons, filters, and weights from the network. This can be achieved through salience ranking (either in a single step or through multiple refinement iterations) and by utilizing sacrificial norms36,37. Conversely, quantization encompasses a broader research scope involving low-precision weights and activation functions during network training38,39. These techniques also leverage specialized hardware to enhance real-time inferencing capabilities40. Through model compression methods and hardware optimizations, researchers aim to overcome the challenges associated with implementing DL-based approaches in real-time on edge devices while simultaneously reducing model complexity and size. Furthermore, researchers have attempted to combine ML with CNNs to achieve effective fire scene recognition. The work in41 combined SVM with CNN for fire detection, utilizing an AdaBoost cascade with Haar features to extract regions of interest. They implemented a shallow CNN containing four straightforward network layers for feature extraction and an SVM for fire recognition. Authors in42 combined CNN with motion detection to analyze irregularities for smoke and fire recognition. Another study43 proposed a real-time method merging local binary patterns and AdaBoost for extracting regions of interest, employing CNN for feature extraction from the extracted regions, followed by classification. The work in44 proposed spatial and temporal feature-assisted networks for fire recognition in complex environments. Additionally, attention-based mechanisms have been integrated with CNN architectures across various domains to enhance model performance45,46. These mechanisms offer promising results by selecting optimal features before classification, encouraging their utilization for accurate fire view recognition15,47, 48\u201349. However, the literature demonstrates that there remains room for exploration in developing robust and accurate fire scene classification and localization models. Moreover, the robustness of proposed models is typically analyzed on limited datasets. Therefore, this study explores a computationally efficient network that effectively addresses fire scene recognition challenges when trained on diverse datasets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed methodology</emphasis></p><p>The proposed network comprises a systematic five-stage architecture for effective fire detection as illustrated in Fig. 1, following the pipeline: ResNet50  CSA  CBAM  RASA  MCBAM  Classification. The architecture begins with a ResNet50 backbone processing  input images to extract  semantic features from conv5_x output, which serve as the foundation for subsequent attention-based processing. The CSA module then utilizes  depthwise convolutions followed by multi-head self-attention to integrate local feature enhancement with global context modeling across the 64 spatial locations. Following CSA, a modified CBAM applies channel and spatial attention mechanisms, with the key innovation of replacing traditional  convolutions with efficient sequential  and  convolutions in the spatial attention component, culminating with Global Average Pooling for comprehensive feature refinement. The RASA module then combines Atrous Self-Attention with recursive formulation, utilizing atrous convolutions with dilation rates  to capture multiscale context within self-attention calculations, where the recursive depth is limited to two iterations for computational efficiency. Finally, Modified CBAM (MCBAM) operates on the multi-scale enhanced features from RASA, maintaining the same  +  architectural improvements to perform final feature optimization and prioritize the most significant regions for accurate fire detection. This progressive attention-over-attention framework creates a comprehensive feature enhancement pipeline where each stage builds upon the previous outputs, resulting in increasingly refined and contextually aware representations optimized for challenging fire detection scenarios.Fig. 1</p><p>Proposed fire detection network architecture showing the complete pipeline: ResNet50 backbone extracts semantic features from input images, followed by sequential processing through CSA for local-global context modeling, CBAM for spatial and channel-wise attention refinement, RASA for multi-scale feature enhancement, and MCBAM for final feature optimization, demonstrating the progressive attention-over-attention framework for effective fire detection.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Deep features extraction</emphasis></p><p>Recent studies have emphasized the significance of integrating effective intermediate features from earlier convolutional stages50,51. They maintain essential spatial and structural details that are critical for improving downstream tasks. To achieve strong feature representation, we utilize ResNet50 as our backbone network for extracting high-level semantic features from input images. With its deep residual architecture, ResNet50 has shown remarkable effectiveness in capturing hierarchical visual representations across a range of computer vision tasks. The ResNet50 backbone processes input images of size  through a series of convolutional blocks with residual connections. The network architecture consists of an initial convolutional layer followed by four main residual blocks (conv2_x, conv3_x, conv4_x, and conv5_x), each containing multiple bottleneck residual units. The residual connections in ResNet50 enable effective training of deep networks by mitigating the vanishing gradient problem and facilitating information flow across layers. We utilize the output from the final convolutional block (conv5_x) of ResNet50, which produces feature maps of dimensions . This choice is motivated by several factors: (i) the  spatial resolution provides a manageable number of spatial locations (64 tokens) for efficient attention computation; (ii) the 2048-dimensional feature vectors contain rich semantic representations learned through the deep hierarchical structure; and (iii) the features at this level capture high-level semantic information while maintaining spatial locality, making them ideal for subsequent attention-based processing.</p><p>The mathematical formulation for ResNet50 feature extraction can be expressed as:1where  represents the input batch of images and  denotes the extracted deep features.Fig. 2</p><p>Architecture of the CSA module showing the sequential processing of ResNet50 features for enhanced feature representation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Convolutional self-attention (CSA) module</emphasis></p><p>Building upon the deep features extracted by ResNet50, we proposed a novel CSA module that effectively combines local feature enhancement with global context modeling. The CSA module is utilize the high-dimensional semantic features () generated by ResNet50. It improves their representational power through attention mechanisms while ensuring computational efficiency. Unlike conventional self-attention that directly processes input features, our CSA module first conducts local convolutions to identify spatial patterns, subsequently calculating attention weights. This approach yields more robust and contextually informed feature representations. By leveraging the rich semantic information inherent in ResNet50 features, it also enhances their capacity for modeling long-range dependencies. As shown in Fig. 2, the CSA module comprises six key components that collaboratively enhance the feature representations of ResNet50.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Local Context Extraction:</emphasis> The ResNet50-extracted feature map  first passes through a depthwise separable convolution layer:2This operation employs grouped convolutions, allowing each of the 2048 ResNet50 feature channels to be processed independently while preserving local spatial patterns in a  neighborhood. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Query, Key, Value Generation:</emphasis> Following the local context extraction, three parallel  convolutions generate the query (Q), key (K), and value (V) matrices:345<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Multi-Head Attention Computation:</emphasis> The Q, K, V tensors are reshaped to enable multi-head attention processing with heads=4, resulting in head_dim = 512 and spatial tokens :6<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Output Projection and Residual Connection:</emphasis> The attention output is reshaped back to spatial dimensions [<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B</emphasis>, 2048, 8, 8] and processed through a final  convolution before adding the residual connection:7The CSA module produces enhanced features  that serve as input to the subsequent CBAM module for further refinement.Fig. 3</p><p>Conceptual Illustration of the Modified Dual Attention Module (MCBAM) showing the decomposition of  convolution into sequential  and  convolutions in the spatial attention component.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attention over attention</emphasis></p><p>Attention mechanisms have been widely studied in visual intelligence, demonstrating significant effectiveness in improving feature representation by selectively concentrating on the most informative spatial and channel-wise cues52. We introduce the concept of attention over attention to further enhance the features through the strategic deployment of attention mechanisms at multiple stages. This approach involves the implementation of CBAM and its modified version (MCBAM) at two key positions within the network, significantly enhancing adaptability and performance. The first application of CBAM is positioned immediately after the CSA module, taking  as input. This placement optimizes spatial and channel-wise attention post-CSA, enabling the network to make nuanced refinements by weighing the significance of features within both local and global contexts. The second instance involves MCBAM integrated following the RASA module, which further amplifies the network\u2019s capabilities by refining multi-scale features.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modified channel attention</emphasis></p><p>The Channel Attention (CA) module captures relationships between features across different channels, where each feature map acts as a feature detector. Taking input from the CSA outputs (), the CA module comprises average pooling (Avg-P), maximum pooling (Max-P), and fully connected (FC) layers, as illustrated in Fig. 3. During training, not all convolution feature maps within a channel equally represent an object. Some channels excel at visualizing specific patterns while others excel differently. Our CA module incorporates both Max-P and Avg-P strategies, where Max-P sharpens focus on distinctive features while Avg-P offers a broader understanding. We apply these pooling strategies to the feature map spatial dimensions, resulting in:89Subsequently, we employ a single FC layer for each pooled feature, with shared parameters, followed by ReLU activation:101112The channel attention map is obtained through element-wise multiplication:13</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modified spatial attention</emphasis></p><p>The Spatial Attention (SA) module exploits spatial patterns to identify the most salient regions. Taking the channel attention output  as input, SA performs pooling operations across the channel dimension:1415In our modified version, we replace the traditional  convolution with two sequential convolutions: a  convolution followed by a  convolution, as shown in Fig. 3. This modification reduces computational complexity while preserving essential spatial features:16The complete CBAM output is obtained as:17</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recursive atrous self-attention (RASA)</emphasis></p><p>Following the CBAM module, the enhanced features  are processed through our proposed RASA module. RASA combines multi-scale context modeling with recursive processing for lightweight yet effective feature enhancement as shown in Fig. 4.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Atrous self-attention (ASA)</emphasis></p><p>Multi-scale features are crucial for effective object detection and segmentation. Our ASA module integrates multi-scale information through atrous convolutions with different dilation rates. The query calculation is enhanced by transitioning from standard  convolution to:18where the initial projection is:19and SiLU activation is defined as:20</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recursive formulation</emphasis></p><p>RASA extends ASA through recursive processing, following the recurrent network pipeline:212223where <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">m</emphasis> represents the recursion step and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">H</emphasis> denotes the hidden state. The function  with empirically optimal values  and . The recursion depth is limited to two to control computational costs, producing the final RASA output .Fig. 4</p><p>Overview of the RASA Module showing the recursive atrous self-attention mechanism with multi-scale context integration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modified CBAM (MCBAM)</emphasis></p><p>Following the RASA module, we apply a MCBAM that incorporates the same architectural improvements as the first CBAM but operates on the multi-scale enhanced features from RASA. The MCBAM follows the same channel and spatial attention formulations but with the key modification of replacing  convolutions with sequential  and  convolutions for improved efficiency. The MCBAM takes  as input and produces the final enhanced features , which are then fed to the classification head for fire detection. This dual deployment of attention mechanisms (CBAM and MCBAM) at strategic positions creates a powerful attention-over-attention framework that progressively refines features from local context through global attention to multi-scale processing and final feature enhancement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experimental results</emphasis></p><p>This section provides an overview of the experimental setup, including descriptions of datasets, evaluation metrics, and training procedures.

DL frameworks. The evaluation was conducted on two datasets, FD48 and BoWFire24, with results presented in Table 1. Throughout both datasets and across all evaluation metrics, AEFRN consistently showed greater performance. On the FD, the network achieved an overall accuracy of 99.11%. On the BoWFire dataset, AEFRN maintained similarly high performance, with precision reaching 97.88%, recall at 98.24%, F1-score at 97.94%, and accuracy of 98.11%. When compared to traditional ML-based models, AEFRN offers significant improvements. These gains highlight the model\u2019s effectiveness and robustness in large-scale detection tasks. In the context of the BoWFire, AEFRN achieved an accuracy of 97.98 %, significantly outperforming other approaches. This illustrates AEFRN\u2019s robust generalization ability across datasets and its significant advantage over traditional methods that depend on handcrafted features. When evaluated on the FD, AEFRN exhibits enhanced performance with a 0.27 % gain in precision, 0.14 % improvement in recall, 0.20 % increase in F1-score, and 0.11 % advancement in accuracy relative to MAFire-Net. For the BoWFire benchmark, AEFRN demonstrates superior results compared to MAFire-Net, achieving a 0.83 % precision enhancement, 0.09 % recall improvement, 0.17 % F1-score increase, and 0.29 % accuracy gain. These experimental outcomes confirm that our model\u2019s hierarchical attention-over-attention methodology successfully integrates detailed local feature extraction with comprehensive contextual analysis, facilitating dependable fire detection performance in challenging operational environments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualitative comparisons</emphasis></p><p>As demonstrated in Fig. 6, our network exhibits remarkable proficiency in identifying and precisely localizing fire regions within complex environmental contexts. The visual examination employs attention visualization maps generated through AEFRN\u2019s hierarchical attention framework, which highlight the most discriminative spatial regions. Qualitative analysis demonstrates the model\u2019s superior interpretability and accurate localization across diverse scenarios. Particularly noteworthy is the network\u2019s ability to maintain accurate fire detection in scenarios with heavy smoke, varied flame intensities, and cluttered backgrounds where traditional color-based or motion-based approaches often fail. The attention visualizations reveal that AEFRN\u2019s progressive attention mechanism successfully captures both local fire characteristics (flame textures, color patterns) and global contextual information (environmental context, spatial relationships). The consistent quality of attention maps across diverse scenarios validates the effectiveness of our attention-over-attention framework in learning discriminative fire representations that generalize effectively to unseen environments and fire conditions.Fig. 6</p><p>Visual interpretation of AEFRN through Grad-CAM analysis on challenging fire detection cases.

augmentation analysis</emphasis></p><p>Data augmentation plays a crucial role in enhancing model robustness and generalization, particularly when working with limited and imbalanced datasets. To investigate its impact, we conducted a series of experiments using diverse augmentation techniques for fire detection. Table 4 summarizes the performance of AEFRN across two benchmark datasets (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FD</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">BoWFire</emphasis>) using several augmentation strategies. Without augmentation, the AEFRN model already delivers strong performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.78% and 95.23% on the FD and BoWFire datasets, respectively. However, we observe that applying augmentation leads to consistent improvements across all metrics\u2014accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 Score. Among individual techniques, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">color jittering</emphasis> proved most effective, improving the F1-score from 96.45% to 97.89% on the FD dataset and from 95.01% to 96.78% on BoWFire. This suggests that simulating variations in fire color and brightness enhances the model\u2019s ability to distinguish between real flames and fire-like patterns in complex backgrounds. Furthermore, combining multiple augmentations yields even more pronounced gains. The trio of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">random flip</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">random crop</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">color jittering</emphasis> leads to a significant performance boost, achieving 98.34% F1-score on FD and 97.25% on BoWFire. These results indicate that the combined effect of spatial and photometric variations enables the model to learn more discriminative and invariant features. Our proposed augmentation strategy, which selectively integrates all augmentation techniques using fire-specific parameter tuning and a strategically optimized order, yields the best results across both datasets. Specifically, it achieves an accuracy of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">99.11%</emphasis> on FD and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">97.98%</emphasis> on BoWFire, along with leading scores in precision, recall, and F1.Table 4</p><p>Effect of different data augmentation techniques on AEFRN Performance.

RASA</emphasis></p><p>To evaluate efficacy and establish the optimal dilation parameter configuration, we examined multiple dilation arrangements. Table 5 presents the comparative results across four essential evaluation criteria. Employing a singular dilation rate , equivalent to conventional convolution operations, produces comparatively modest performance levels, achieving F1-scores of 97.42% and 96.48% on FD and BoWFire datasets, respectively. Extending to a dual-parameter configuration {1, 3} enhances performance, achieving F1-scores of 98.18% and 97.56%. Our recommended configuration  achieves superior overall performance with F1-scores of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">98.88%</emphasis> on FD and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">97.94%</emphasis> on BoWFire. Incorporating an extended dilation arrangement  yields marginal improvements on FD while providing negligible enhancement on BoWFire, indicating diminishing performance benefits beyond optimal dilation coverage. Conversely, omitting the minimal dilation parameter in configuration  moderately degrades performance.

The network\u2019s effectiveness originates from strategic design choices that address limitations in existing literature, particularly in complex scenarios. The proposed multi-layered attention mechanism represents a significant departure from conventional single-scale approaches by establishing a hierarchical processing pipeline. Through the effective combination of CSA, RASA, and the enhanced CBAM, AEFRN makes a progressive feature refinement process that adaptively focuses on fire-relevant spatial regions. The hierarchical design proves particularly valuable in scenarios with cluttered backgrounds or visually similar non-fire elements. The RASA component\u2019s multi-scale dilated convolution strategy allows for effective contextual analysis across different spatial resolutions. This capability is essential due to the diverse nature of fire phenomena, which range from small ignition points to large flame structures. AEFRN\u2019s consistent performance and testing conditions showcase strong generalization capabilities. The comprehensive data augmentation strategy, along with the attention-driven modules, facilitates the extraction of invariant fire properties that stay stable across diverse environmental conditions. Despite these achievements, several limitations warrant consideration. Extreme environmental conditions involving severe illumination variations or significant occlusion may impact the localization accuracy. The current emphasis on analyzing static images neglects the importance of maintaining temporal consistency in video sequences, which remains unexplored. Furthermore, the network\u2019s ability to detect atypical or synthetic fire scenarios warrants additional research. Although the model demonstrates promising computational efficiency for edge applications, empirical testing on severely resource-limited IoT platforms is essential to verify real-time operational feasibility.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion and future work</emphasis></p><p>This research presents the Attention-Enhanced Fire Recognition Network (AEFRN), an innovative visual attention-based architecture for fire detection that demonstrates superior performance through sophisticated attention methodologies. Our proposed framework integrates Convolutional Self-Attention (CSA) to synthesize global and local feature representations, implements Recursive Atrous Self-Attention (RASA) with strategically configured dilation parameters for multi-resolution contextual extraction, and incorporates an enhanced CBAM to strengthen feature discrimination capabilities. Comprehensive experimental validation across the FD and BoWFire benchmark collections establishes substantial performance advantages relative to contemporary methodologies. Detailed ablation studies affirm our architectural decisions, confirming that ResNet50 is the ideal backbone while highlighting the synergistic advantages of the overall configuration. The proposed data augmentation strategy and three-level dilation configuration further enhance detection robustness across diverse fire scenarios. AEFRN\u2019s balanced design ensures computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained environments while maintaining exceptional accuracy, making it highly applicable for real-world fire detection systems. In the future, we aim to focus on extending AEFRN for aerial fire monitoring applications, developing lightweight variants for IoT deployment, and integrating temporal modeling for video-based detection. We also plan to explore federated learning approaches for distributed fire detection networks and multi-class fire classification capabilities to enhance emergency response systems.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Urza, AK.

With climate change intensifying the frequency and severity of such events, there is a pressing need for advanced, real-time wildfire detection systems. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) integrated with remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) offer a promising solution for early detection and continuous monitoring. This paper introduces ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire, a novel deep learning framework tailored for UAV-based forest fire detection, combining Residual-Capsule Networks, Threshold Convolution, and Attention Mechanisms. Residual-Capsule Networks enhance the capture of spatial hierarchies and inter-feature relationships, improving robustness to diverse fire characteristics, while Threshold Convolution filters irrelevant features to boost generalization and efficiency. </p><p>The Attention Mechanism prioritizes critical fire-related regions, ensuring precise detection. Evaluated on a comprehensive UAV-sourced dataset of 14,140 images, ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire achieves an impressive 99.78% accuracy, 99.7% precision, and 99.8% recall, surpassing existing methods like YOLOv3 (85.2%), ABi-LSTM (96.2%), and Enhanced YOLOv8n (99.0%). With early detection (3.2\u00a0s faster than YOLOv3), a 0.1% false alarm rate, and fire intensity estimation (MAE 0.15), this model demonstrates its potential as a reliable, real-time solution for wildfire mitigation, despite challenges like higher computational cost (12\u00a0s inference, 15W power), paving the way for future optimizations and broader deployment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Forests are one of the vital natural resources in the world. With air purification by providing Oxygen (O2) and reducing the amount of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), forests are considered as the lungs of the planet1. Also, the forests play several crucial roles in our lives providing many resources, for example, materials and minerals which are used in production, preventing sandstorms, maintaining balance in ecological system, is the house for numerous organisms, and water conservation2. More, the forests provide an important number of jobs through sale the wood, hunting and guarding, what increase the incomes of the countries, thus, improving their economy3. In recent years, our planet has seen a record of wildfire; a lot of forests and wildlands have been burned and destroyed. 4 suggest that wildfires could get six times as bad as they currently are within this century. The authors in5 say there is very well documented scientific evidence that climate change is considered the most important element to increasing the length of the fire season and the number of wildfires on the planet. Strong and devastating wildfires have a long history in several nations. For more than half a year, starting before July 2019 and lasting until March 2020, Australia was hit with 15,000 separate fires. They called it Black Summer. The fires have killed at least 29 people. Witnessed the destruction of over 5900 buildings including over 2800 homes6. More, 143 million mammals, 180 million birds, 51 million frogs and a staggering 2.5 billion reptiles were affected. Other wildfires had occurred, such as the 2024s\u2019 California fire and Amazon rainforest fire in 2019, which burnt millions of acres of land7.</p><p>Early wildfire detection is crucial for reducing risks and losses, as it enables firefighters to control fires before they escalate. The time between fire ignition and alerting authorities is a critical factor in minimizing wildfire damage8. Currently, various terrestrial and satellite-based technologies assist in early fire detection and localization, but they have significant limitations. Watchtowers, while traditionally used, have a limited field of view, high construction costs, and are vulnerable to fire damage, leading to additional expenses. Satellites, though capable of covering vast areas, face challenges such as high costs, limited flexibility, and constraints in spatial and temporal resolution, making timely fire detection difficult9. To overcome these challenges, there is an urgent need to develop more advanced wildfire monitoring tools and enhance fire control strategies. Leveraging emerging technologies can provide more efficient, cost-effective solutions for protecting forests and ecosystems10.</p><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) networks have become increasingly important across various domains due to their agility and versatility11. They are widely used in applications such as agricultural plant protection, environmental and natural disaster monitoring, and goods delivery12. In wildfire management, UAVs emerge as an indispensable tool, offering significant advantages over traditional methods, which often face limitations in cost, efficiency, and safety. Instead of deploying ground crews into hazardous environments or relying on conventional firefighting techniques, UAVs equipped with visual remote sensing technologies provide a rapid and effective alternative for wildfire detection and monitoring13. They can be quickly deployed, navigate challenging terrain, map fire-prone areas, and transmit real-time data to relevant authorities. Additionally, their ability to hover, capture images from complex angles, and operate in difficult conditions enhances their effectiveness in fire surveillance and response. These advantages position UAVs as a crucial component in modern wildfire detection and prevention strategies, offering greater efficiency, accuracy, and safety in firefighting operations14.</p><p>To tackle the pressing challenges of wildfire detection and monitoring, advanced technologies like Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are increasingly being integrated into fire management systems. Detecting wildfires in remote, densely forested areas poses significant difficulties due to limited visibility caused by complex terrain, background interference from visually similar patterns such as fog, clouds, or dust, and the challenge of identifying early-stage fires with low intensity and minimal coverage, which are often missed by traditional ground-based and satellite systems due to spatial, temporal, or environmental constraints like cloud cover. UAVs provide a promising solution by delivering high-resolution, real-time imagery across vast and hard-to-access regions, while AI and Machine Learning (ML) techniques enhance the accuracy and robustness of detecting fire-related features in these images, enabling a more effective forest fire monitoring system with improved early detection, faster response times, and better overall fire management strategies. In this paper, we propose ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire, a novel deep learning model designed for high-accuracy wildfire detection using UAV-captured imagery, combining Residual-Capsule Networks (ResCaps), Threshold Convolution (TC), and Attention Mechanisms (Attn) to address the aforementioned challenges while ensuring real-time performance and generalization across diverse environments. At the core of ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire are Capsule Networks, which excel at modeling spatial hierarchies and capturing directional relationships between features by representing them as vectors rather than scalars, significantly enhancing robustness in detecting complex fire patterns, such as variations in intensity, shape, and movement trajectory, that traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) often struggle to interpret. The novel Threshold Convolution (TC) mechanism further improves performance by applying a threshold function during convolution to filter out irrelevant or noisy features, reducing background distractions like fog or clouds and emphasizing critical fire signals such as heat spots and smoke, while also boosting computational efficiency by minimizing unnecessary computations for real-time scalability. Additionally, an Attention Mechanism (Attn) refines the model focus by dynamically assigning higher weights to fire-related regions, enabling accurate detection of small or emerging fires and improving generalization across varied environmental conditions. We evaluated ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire through extensive experiments on a large-scale, diverse dataset of UAV-captured images from various forested regions, including both fire and non-fire scenarios, with results showing that our model significantly outperforms existing wildfire detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall, and inference speed, particularly excelling in early-stage fire detection where traditional approaches falter. The major contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>We propose ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire, a novel deep learning architecture combining residual capsule networks, threshold convolution, and attention mechanisms for enhanced fire detection performance.</p><p>We introduce a Threshold Convolution (TC) module that improves both detection accuracy and computational efficiency by filtering out irrelevant features during convolution.</p><p>We integrate an Attention Mechanism (Attn) to enhance the model ability to prioritize fire-related regions in UAV images, enabling reliable detection of small or emerging fires.</p><p>We conduct extensive experiments on a large-scale UAV-based wildfire dataset, demonstrating the superiority of our model over existing approaches in accuracy, robustness, and real-time applicability.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: \u201cRelated works\u201d section reviews related works, providing an overview of existing research in the field. \u201cProposed ResCaps-TC-Attn-fire system\u201d section introduces the proposed ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire system, detailing its architecture and key components. \u201cMaterials and methods\u201d section describes the materials and methods used in our study. \u201cResults and discussions\u201d section presents experimental results and discussions, analyzing the system performance.

This was followed by the design of a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) based on YOLOv3, specifically adapted to the computational constraints of the onboard hardware, ensuring efficient processing in resource-limited environments. Experimental results demonstrate that the system delivers commendable accuracy and processing speed, underscoring the efficacy and practical utility of the integrated UAV platform and deep learning approach for fire detection, with a recognition rate of approximately 83% achieved during testing. Advantages of this approach include its ability to operate effectively on UAVs with limited computational power, rapid deployment potential due to the pre-trained YOLOv3 framework, and suitability for real-time monitoring in dynamic forest environments. Limitations encompass the relatively modest accuracy of 83%, which may miss subtle fire instances, a lack of scalability for diverse fire conditions due to the tailored CNN design, and potential overfitting to the specific aerial dataset, restricting generalization across varied terrains or lighting conditions.</p><p>Under the SFEDA project (Forest Monitoring System for Early Fire Detection and Assessment in the Balkan-Med Area), Diyana et al. in16 developed an advanced platform tailored for early forest fire detection, integrating a dual-UAV system comprising fixed-wing and rotary-wing drones. The fixed-wing drones, operating at medium altitudes between 350 and 5500 m, are equipped with optical, thermal, or hybrid cameras and perform continuous patrols to surveil the terrain, identifying potential fire hotspots. Upon detecting a suspected fire, these drones transmit an alert with precise GPS coordinates to the rotary-wing drones, which operate at lower altitudes (10 to 350 m) and conduct detailed inspections using their onboard camera systems to confirm fire presence. Once confirmed, the rotary-wing drones activate an additional alarm to alert ground personnel and firefighting teams, facilitating rapid response. The authors employed the ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco model for this system, achieving a notable accuracy of 94%. Advantages of this approach include its multi-layered detection strategy leveraging complementary UAV types, enhanced coverage and precision through altitude-specific operations, and the lightweight ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco model efficiency for onboard processing, enabling real-time fire confirmation. Limitations include potential delays in coordination between fixed-wing and rotary-wing drones, dependency on clear line-of-sight and weather conditions for effective camera operation, and the 94% accuracy, which may still allow false negatives in complex fire scenarios, necessitating further refinement for robustness across diverse environments.</p><p>In17, Alireza et al. presented the innovative FLAME (Fire Luminosity Airborne-based Machine learning Evaluation) dataset, a comprehensive collection of fire-related videos and images captured by drones in Northern Arizona, utilizing two drones equipped with both standard and thermal cameras to acquire aerial footage across four distinct color palettes: normal, Fusion, WhiteHot, and GreenHot, thereby capturing a wide range of fire signatures under varying conditions. The authors developed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for frame-based fire classification, attaining a classification accuracy of 76%, while employing segmentation techniques to precisely delineate fire boundaries, achieving a precision of 92% and a recall of 84%, which collectively underscore the solution robust performance in fire detection. Advantages of this approach include the diverse and richly annotated FLAME dataset, which supports multi-modal analysis, the high precision (92%) in boundary identification, and the adaptability of thermal imaging for night or smoky conditions, enhancing detection reliability. Limitations encompass the relatively low classification accuracy (76%), potentially due to the ANN simplicity in handling complex fire patterns, limited generalization across different geographic regions due to the Northern Arizona focus, and the computational demand of segmentation, which may hinder real-time applicability on resource-constrained UAVs.</p><p>In18, Panagiotis et al. unveiled an advanced early fire detection system that leverages a UAV equipped with a 360-degree aerial camera, providing an unrestricted field-of-view for comprehensive image capture, with the optical camera mounted on the unmanned aerial vehicle to enable panoramic surveillance. The methodology commences with the transformation of equirectangular projection format images into stereographic images to facilitate analysis, followed by the application of two DeepLab V3 + networks to independently segment flame and smoke regions, which are subsequently merged and validated within the environmental context of the captured test image for enhanced accuracy. To support this system, the authors developed the Fire Detection 360-degree dataset, consisting of 150 equirectangular 360-degree images, tailored to the system requirements. The proposed approach achieved an impressive F-score of 94.6% for fire detection, highlighting its efficacy in identifying early fire signs. Advantages include the 360-degree camera extensive coverage, reducing blind spots in wildfire monitoring, the dual DeepLab V3 + segmentation for precise flame and smoke identification, and the high F-score (94.6%), which supports reliable early detection across varied terrains. Limitations encompass the small dataset size (150 images), which may limit generalization to diverse fire scenarios, the computational intensity of processing 360-degree images and dual networks, potentially restricting real-time performance on UAVs, and the dependency on accurate environmental context validation, which could falter in complex or obscured conditions.</p><p>In reference19, the authors introduced an innovative Attention-enhanced Bidirectional LSTM Network (ABi-LSTM) for forest fire smoke recognition, structured around three core components: the Spatial Features Extraction Network, the Bidirectional LSTM Network, and the Temporal Attention Subnetwork, designed to process video data effectively. The process begins with the extraction of spatial features from candidate patches using the ViBe background subtraction method, which are then fed into the Spatial Features Extraction Network to capture relevant visual cues; these features are subsequently processed by the Bidirectional LSTM Network to learn long-term temporal dependencies associated with smoke patterns, while the Temporal Attention Subnetwork employs a soft attention mechanism to adaptively prioritize the most discriminative frames within the sequence, enhancing focus on critical smoke-related information. The dataset comprises high-resolution videos (1920 \u00d7 1080 pixels) from a forest fire monitoring system, providing a rich temporal context for analysis. The ABi-LSTM model achieves an impressive accuracy of 97.8%, a 4.4% improvement over traditional image-based deep learning models, underscoring its superior capability in forest fire smoke recognition. Advantages include the model ability to leverage temporal dynamics for improved detection, the attention mechanism focus on key frames, reducing noise from irrelevant data, and its high accuracy, making it reliable for early smoke detection. Limitations include the risk of overfitting due to the model complexity and the specific dataset, potentially limiting generalization across diverse environments, as well as the computational intensity of processing high-resolution video sequences, which may challenge real-time deployment in resource-constrained settings.</p><p>In20, Yifan et al. introduced Light-YOLOv4, a lightweight detector optimized for real-time flame and smoke detection, advancing the YOLOv4 framework through three strategic enhancements: substituting the original backbone with a more efficient lightweight alternative, implementing bidirectional cross-scale connections to improve feature fusion across scales, and decomposing standard convolutions to independently process channel and spatial regions, thereby streamlining computational demands. Experimental results reveal that Light-YOLOv4 achieves a flame detection accuracy of 86.43%, a smoke detection accuracy of 84.86%, a mean average precision (mAP) of 85.64%, an mAP@0.5 of 70.88%, and an impressive frame rate of 71 FPS, demonstrating its efficiency and suitability for real-time fire and smoke detection applications. Advantages of Light-YOLOv4 include its high frame rate (71 FPS), enabling seamless real-time performance on resource-constrained devices, the balanced detection accuracy for both flame and smoke, and enhanced feature fusion, which improves detection across varying fire sizes and conditions. Limitations encompass the moderate accuracies (86.43% for flame, 84.86% for smoke), which may lead to missed detections in complex scenarios, potential challenges in generalizing to diverse datasets due to the lightweight design, and a trade-off in precision (mAP@0.5 of 70.88%), indicating room for improvement in fine-grained detection tasks.</p><p>In reference21, Ali Khan et al. introduced DeepFire, a novel dataset and deep transfer learning benchmark for forest fire detection using UAVs, where upon fire detection, a UAV determines the precise fire location and relays this information to neighboring UAVs, while simultaneously transmitting data to a remote Forest Fire Disaster Control Center (FDMC), enabling continuous monitoring and rapid deployment of heavy equipment like fire engines or helicopters for real-time fire suppression. The DeepFire dataset consists of 1900 colored images, balanced with 950 images each for fire and no-fire classes, providing a robust foundation for training. The authors utilized a VGG19-based transfer learning approach to improve prediction accuracy, with simulation results showcasing the method effectiveness, achieving a mean accuracy of 95%, precision of 95.7%, and recall of 94.2%, highlighting its strong performance in fire detection and classification. Advantages include the balanced DeepFire dataset, which ensures equitable representation of fire and no-fire scenarios, the high precision and recall, indicating reliable detection, and the integrated UAV-FDMC communication system, facilitating swift and coordinated fire response. Limitations encompass the dataset relatively small size (1900 images), which may limit generalization across diverse forest environments, the computational intensity of VGG19, potentially hindering real-time application on UAVs with limited resources, and the 95% accuracy, which, while strong, leaves room for improvement in detecting smaller or less distinct fires.</p><p>In the research in22, the authors introduce an advanced UAV forest fire detection model built upon the YOLOv8 framework, tackling issues such as small targets, occlusions, and image blurriness in UAV-acquired wildfire imagery through innovative enhancements. These include the integration of SPDConv to improve small object detection, C2f-PConv to optimize computational efficiency, Mixed Local Channel Attention (MLCA) to enhance classification accuracy, and W-IoU loss to bolster the detection of small and obscured targets. Evaluated on the FLAME dataset, comprising 3253 images, the model delivers a precision of 87.5%, recall of 87.5%, and mAP@0.5 of 89.3%, reflecting gains of 2.17%, 5.5%, and 1.9% over the baseline YOLOv8s, while reducing parameters by 43.8% to 5.96 M, model size by 43.3% to 12.19 MB, and GFLOPs by 36.7% to 18.1, showcasing its lightweight design and effectiveness. Generalization tests on the FireSense and Furg-Fire-Dataset datasets further validate its robustness, with mAP@0.5 improvements of 3.4% and 1.2%, respectively. Advantages of this model include its superior accuracy and recall for detecting small fires, a substantial decrease in computational demands suitable for UAV deployment, and robust performance across diverse datasets, rendering it highly applicable for real-time wildfire surveillance. Limitations include the potential computational overhead of MLCA, which may challenge resource-limited UAVs despite optimization, C2f-PConv reliance on data integrity that could impair performance with significant data loss, SPDConv diminished efficacy for high-resolution or large targets, and the complex calculations of W-IoU, which may prolong training and necessitate precise tuning to prevent negative effects on model performance.</p><p>The paper in23 introduces FFYOLO: a lightweight forest fire detection model based on YOLOv8, designed to address the limitations of traditional machine learning and high-computational-cost deep learning methods in detecting fire and smoke in complex forest environments. The model incorporates a Channel Prior Dilatation Attention (CPDA) module for enhanced feature extraction, a Mixed-Classification Detection Head (MCDH) to balance accuracy and speed, MPDIoU loss to improve regression and classification accuracy, a lightweight GSConv module to reduce parameters, and a knowledge distillation strategy to boost generalization and minimize false detections. Evaluated on a custom dataset of 10,099 images (D-Fires and internet-sourced data, split 7:2:1), FFYOLO achieves an mAP@0.5 of 88.8%, a 3.4% improvement over the baseline YOLOv8, with a 25.3% reduction in parameters and a 9.3% increase in FPS. The model demonstrates robust performance across scenarios involving misclassification, distance variations, and foggy conditions, outperforming models like YOLOv5, YOLOv8, and RetinaNet, with a significantly smaller weight file (17.0 MB vs. 97.7 MB for Faster-RCNN). Advantages include its high accuracy and improved FPS for real-time detection, reduced computational complexity and parameter count suitable for low-power devices, enhanced robustness in complex scenes, and effective use of knowledge distillation to mitigate overfitting and false alarms. Limitations encompass its reliance on RGB images, which may struggle with bright scenes, obscured fires, or distant targets where features are less discernible, the potential need for careful tuning of MCDH and MPDIoU parameters, and the current lack of integration with multi-source sensor data (e.g., infrared or multispectral), limiting its adaptability in diverse real-world conditions despite planned future enhancements.</p><p>In the study referenced as24, the authors propose WCA-VFnet, a specialized deep learning model for detecting small-scale, low-resolution forest fire smoke in complex scenes, utilizing the T-SMOKE dataset, which was specifically curated for this purpose. The model introduces the Weld C-A component, a method that combines shared convolution and fusion attention to enhance feature extraction, addressing the limitations of state-of-the-art models like YoloX, Deformable DETR, and VarifocalNet in handling small smoke and flame targets in multi-scene, multi-environment, multi-temporal, and multi-angle forest fire scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that WCA-VFnet achieves a significant improvement, with an average precision (AP) increase of approximately 35% for small flame targets compared to Deformable DETR, highlighting its enhanced generalizability across diverse and intricate fire detection scenarios. However, the model faces challenges, including inaccurate detections in certain scenarios, which may lead to false positives or missed detections, and delays in real-time analysis that could hinder its effectiveness for immediate fire response applications. These limitations suggest that while WCA-VFnet advances early warning capabilities, further optimization is needed for practical deployment in time-sensitive forest fire monitoring.</p><p>This research paperin25 presents a comprehensive enhancement of the YOLOv8n architecture specifically tailored for forest fire detection, addressing two critical challenges: computational efficiency for edge deployment and improved accuracy in detecting small, obscured fires. The proposed modifications systematically optimize the network through several key innovations: (1) For lightweighting, the authors replace standard convolutions with Ghost Convolution (GhostConv) in the C2f bottleneck modules and employ Depthwise Separable Convolutions (DSConv) in the detection head, reducing model parameters by 41% (from 3.01 to 1.78 M) and computational load by 54% (from 8.2 to 3.8 GFLOPs) while preserving detection performance. (2) To enhance feature extraction for challenging fire scenarios, the model integrates Coordinate Attention (CA) before critical C2f blocks to better capture spatial relationships, Omni-Dimensional Dynamic Convolution (ODConv) to adaptively adjust kernel weights based on input features, and Dynamic UpSampling (DySample) to minimize distortion when fusing multi-scale features. (3) The Distance-IoU (DIoU) loss function further refines bounding box regression, particularly benefiting small fire detection. Experimental validation on the FLAME dataset (augmented to 5376 images) demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 99.0% mAP@0.5 (matching baseline YOLOv8) and 87.1% mAP@0.5:0.95 (surpassing YOLOv8 86.1%). The model excels in detecting small and partially occluded fires where traditional methods fail, as evidenced by comparative visualizations of feature maps and detection results. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of each component: for instance, DySample improves recall for small fires over nearest-neighbor upsampling, while CA outperforms other attention mechanisms (e.g., CBAM) with minimal computational overhead. The model also generalizes well to an extended dataset (2898 images), maintaining 99.4% mAP@0.5 and 96.2% mAP@0.5:0.95, underscoring its robustness. However, limitations persist: (1) False positives occur in complex backgrounds (e.g., sun glare or dense smoke), and (2) missed detections arise for extremely small or heavily obscured fires.</p><p>The paper in26 introduces IOFireNet, a federated learning (FL)-based fire detection system that leverages MobileNet for efficient local processing and Super Pixel-based Adaptive Clustering (SPAC) for precise fire segmentation, achieving 98.65% accuracy in detection and 97.14% mean IoU in segmentation. The system employs a Bilateral Filter (BF) for noise reduction while preserving critical edge details in fire images, followed by SPAC, an adaptive clustering technique that integrates color, texture, and spatial features to accurately segment fire regions, outperforming traditional methods like graph-cut and CRF by 2.45%. Using depthwise separable convolutions, the lightweight MobileNet backbone ensures efficient processing on edge devices, while the FL framework aggregates parameters from distributed local models to enhance generalization without centralized data sharing, making it privacy-preserving and scalable across diverse environments (indoor, outdoor, forest, day/night). The model not only detects fires but also predicts their spread, intensity, and affected areas, supporting proactive early warnings. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance over benchmarks like VGG-19 (by 10.02%), ResNet-50 (4.20%), and Fire-Net (1.3%), with particular strengths in handling noisy or low-resolution images. However, limitations include reduced accuracy in complex terrains (e.g., hill fires at 97.53% vs. forest fires at 99.53%) and dependency on image quality. Future work aims to integrate multi-modal sensors (thermal/IR) and deploy on UAVs for real-time wildfire monitoring, further optimized via knowledge distillation. The system balance of accuracy, privacy, and computational efficiency makes it a promising solution for large-scale fire detection in resource-constrained settings.</p><p>The analysis of prior forest fire detection studies reveals critical gaps, including limited generalization across diverse scenarios due to region-specific datasets (e.g.,15,17,21), insufficient accuracy for small or obscured fires (e.g.,15,20,22,25), high computational complexity hindering real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAVs (e.g.,18,19,21,22), dependency on specific data types or conditions (e.g.,16,23,26), frequent false positives and missed detections in complex environments (e.g.,17,20,24,25), lack of multi-modal integration (e.g.,15,19,20,23), and delays in real-time processing (e.g.,16,19,24). ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire addresses these shortcomings by leveraging a capsule network-based architecture with temporal-context attention (ResCaps-TC-Attn), offering enhanced generalization across varied terrains and conditions, superior accuracy for small and obscured fires surpassing models like20 and22, a lightweight design optimized for edge devices outperforming18 and19, multi-modal integration (e.g., RGB, thermal, infrared) to overcome23 limitations, reduced errors in complex backgrounds compared to25 and24, and real-time capability exceeding24 delays, positioning it as a comprehensive, state-of-the-art solution for robust and timely forest fire detection in challenging environments.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed ResCaps-TC-Attn-fire system</emphasis></p><p>ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire is a cutting-edge deep learning framework developed for real-time wildfire detection through high-resolution UAV imagery, synergistically combining Residual-Capsule Networks (ResCaps), Threshold Convolution (TC)27, and Attention Mechanisms (Attn)28 to deliver exceptional accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability. The TC layer employs convolution with dynamic thresholding to eliminate noise and irrelevant details, emphasizing critical fire signatures like heat anomalies, smoke patterns, and flame edges for enhanced detection precision. ResCaps, the model backbone, integrates residual connections to address vanishing gradients and leverages capsule networks to effectively capture spatial hierarchies and transformations of fire features, ensuring robust recognition of intricate fire patterns across varying scales and orientations. Complementing this, the Attention Mechanism dynamically focuses on salient image regions, adeptly detecting early-stage or subtle fire indicators while adapting to diverse fire intensities and environmental dynamics, further supported by a multi-scale attention strategy that ensures consistent performance across fire progression stages and challenging conditions. The model is optimized with a tailored loss function that balances classification accuracy, feature reconstruction, and KL divergence, utilizing softmax activation29 for reliable class predictions, which enhances its generalization capabilities.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce an innovative surveillance system that harnesses the capabilities of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to provide continuous, year-round forest monitoring under national and sustainable environmental programs. These UAVs can be deployed flexibly, operating annually, seasonally (e.g., during dry summer months), or at predefined intervals based on specific regional fire risk assessments, ensuring comprehensive oversight tailored to local ecological and climatic conditions. The system features a coordinated fleet of Follower-UAVs, each assigned specialized roles in fire detection, assessment, and communication. These Follower-UAVs autonomously patrol designated forest zones, equipped with high-resolution cameras (e.g., RaspiCamV2) and thermal sensors to capture real-time imagery and temperature data across diverse terrains and conditions, such as dense forests, mountainous regions, or areas prone to fog and smoke. Utilizing advanced deep learning algorithms, including the ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model, they detect early fire indicators such as smoke plumes, heat anomalies, and subtle flame edges with high precision, continuing surveillance until a fire is confirmed. Upon detection, each Follower-UAV generates a detailed fire profile and transmitted in real time to the Fire Prevention Regional Unit via secure wireless networks. This integration of autonomous UAV coordination, real-time data acquisition, and sophisticated analysis enhances early fire detection, accelerates emergency response coordination, and significantly reduces the ecological and economic devastation caused by wildfires, as depicted in the conceptual framework outlined in Fig. 2.Fig. 2</p><p>UAV-based forest fire fighting system model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Data acquisition</emphasis></p><p>UAV-based forest fire detection systems consist of two main components: the hardware related to the UAV and the software for fire detection. The proposed system architecture includes an S500 quadrotor UAV equipped with various components such as a RaspiCamV2 camera, Xbee Telemetry board, Pixhawk flight controller, radio link module, Raspberry Pi 4, and additional tools like a battery and voltage converter. Table 8 provides details on the UAV used to data collection process, while Fig. 3 shows the UAV configuration. The Raspberry Pi serves as the central storage unit, systematically saving images after each flight. Upon activating the UAV and connecting the battery, a script on the Raspberry Pi initiates image capture at three frames per second. Another script ensures that each image is individually archived to prevent overwriting. The Raspberry Pi Camera V2 (RaspiCamV2), mounted on the UAV frame with a downward tilt of -180\u00b0, is used for imaging. Table 9 details the camera specifications, highlighting its ability to adjust brightness and contrast, which helps in capturing clear information about surface obstacles. Images are captured at altitudes ranging from 5 to 25 m to provide diverse perspectives and enrich the dataset. The UAV operates at a steady average speed of 1 m/s during the image acquisition process.Table 8</p><p>S500 quadrotor UAV properties.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"392\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Property</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Specification</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Frame model</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">S500 quadcopter frame</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Motor mounting</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Supports 22xx to 35xx brushless motors</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Flight time</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">10?30 min</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Onboard flight computer</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Raspberry Pi 4</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Flight controller</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Pixhawk</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Camera</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">RaspiCamV2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">GPS</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Pixhawk 4 GPS Module</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Battery</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4S LiPo, 4200 mAh</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Flight altitude</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5?25 m</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Flight velocity</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Average 1 m/s</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>PropertySpecificationFrame modelS500 quadcopter frameMotor mountingSupports 22xx to 35xx brushless motorsFlight time10\u201330 minOnboard flight computerRaspberry Pi 4Flight controllerPixhawkCameraRaspiCamV2GPSPixhawk 4 GPS ModuleBattery4S LiPo, 4200 mAhFlight altitude5\u201325 mFlight velocityAverage 1 m/sFig. 3</p><p>The S500 quadrotor with its components.</p><p>Table 9</p><p>RaspiCamV2 characteristics.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Property</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Specification</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Model</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sensor</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Sony IMX219 8-megapixel sensor</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Resolution</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3280 \u00d7 2464 pixels</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Video modes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1640 \u00d7 1232 and 640 \u00d7 480</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum frame rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30 Frame/sec</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Pixel size</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.12 ?m \u00d7 1.12 ?m</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Focal length</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.04 mm</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Horizontal field of view</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">62.2 degrees</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Vertical field of view (FoV)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48.8 degrees</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Size</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 9 mm</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>PropertySpecificationModelRaspberry Pi Camera Module V2SensorSony IMX219 8-megapixel sensorResolution3280 \u00d7 2464 pixelsVideo modes1640 \u00d7 1232 and 640 \u00d7 480Maximum frame rate30 Frame/secPixel size1.12 \u03bcm \u00d7 1.12 \u03bcmFocal length3.04 mmHorizontal field of view62.2 degreesVertical field of view (FoV)48.8 degreesSize25 \u00d7 24 \u00d7 9 mm</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dataset</emphasis></p><p>The dataset was collected using our UAV equipped with a high-resolution RaspiCamV2 camera to ensure high-quality image acquisition for forest fire detection.

To ensure robustness, images were acquired under a range of environmental conditions, including clear skies, foggy, smoky, and cloudy settings. The UAV cameras recorded images from top-down, oblique, and horizontal perspectives to account for different viewing angles encountered in drone-based monitoring. The dataset was categorized into two time-based classes to study fire behavior under varying lighting conditions: Pre-Evening (Daylight Fire Incidents), captured between 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM under natural daylight, consisting of 1550 images (1250 Fire, 300 Non-Fire); and Evening (Twilight &amp; Early Night Fire Incidents), captured between 5:30 PM and 3:30 AM under low-light conditions, comprising 1480 images (1100 Fire, 380 Non-Fire). In total, the original dataset includes 3030 images, with details summarized in Table 10 and class distribution outlined in Table 11.

All images were resized to a fixed resolution of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels to ensure uniformity and compatibility with the model architecture. Pixel values were normalized to the range [0,1] by dividing by 255, stabilizing the training process and ensuring consistent numerical input. Data augmentation techniques, such as random rotation (\u2212 30\u00b0 to 30\u00b0), flipping (horizontal and vertical), cropping, brightness adjustment, and Gaussian noise injection, were employed to increase dataset diversity and simulate real-world variations in UAV imagery. These steps not only improve the model ability to handle diverse fire scenarios but also reduce overfitting, ensuring better generalization and detection accuracy across different environmental conditions.

The dataset is divided into 80% for training, 10% for validation, and 10% for testing (see Table 14). Training is conducted using the Adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 0.001, adjusted adaptively to enhance convergence and stability. A batch size of 32 is chosen to balance computational efficiency and model performance.

The section begins with a thorough Results Analysis. Next, Ablation Experiments systematically dissect the contribution of each component, demonstrating the critical role of the Threshold Convolution (TC), Residual-Capsule Networks (ResCaps), and Attention Mechanism (Attn) in achieving state-of-the-art performance. The Comparison with Existing Research benchmarks the proposed model against traditional and deep learning-based methods, showcasing its superiority in terms of detection accuracy and real-time applicability. Finally, the Discussions and Limitations subsection critically examines the model constraints, such as performance in extreme conditions, and outlines future research directions, including lightweight deployment and multi-modal data integration.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results analysis</emphasis></p><p>Table 16 highlights the exceptional performance and efficiency of the ResCaps-TC-Attn model. The ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model demonstrates exceptional performance and operational viability for real-time wildfire detection using UAV-based high-resolution imagery, as comprehensively detailed in Table 16. Evaluated on a standardized dataset comprising 14,140 images (split into 80% training with 11,312 images, 10% validation with 1414 images, and 10% testing with 1,414 images), the model achieves a training accuracy of 99.85%, a validation accuracy of 99.78%, and a test accuracy of 99.78%, reflecting remarkable consistency and robustness across all phases of development and evaluation. This minimal variance of 0.07% between training and validation/test accuracies underscores the model strong generalization capability, ensuring its reliability in diverse wildfire scenarios. The loss value, recorded at 0.02 after training over 50 epochs, highlights the model effectiveness in minimizing prediction errors, a testament to the efficacy of its custom loss function, which integrates classification accuracy, feature reconstruction (with a mean squared error of 0.012), and routing consistency (with a KL divergence of 0.08). This low loss value indicates a highly optimized training process that enhances the model ability to accurately identify fire-related patterns. Further enhancing its performance, the model achieves a recall of 99.80%, ensuring a near-perfect detection rate for fire instances, which is critical for early intervention in wildfire management. The F1-score, reaching 99.80%, reflects an excellent balance between precision and recall, affirming the model capability to maintain high accuracy while minimizing false positives. The false alarm rate, a key metric for operational reliability, stands at an impressively low 0.1%, indicating that the model rarely misclassifies non-fire scenes as fire, thus reducing unnecessary resource deployment in real-world applications. These metrics were validated through a fivefold cross-validation experiment, yielding a mean accuracy of 99.65% with a standard deviation of \u00b1 0.12%, and an external validation on an unseen dataset of 500 images (250 Fire, 250 Non-Fire), achieving 99.5% accuracy, further confirming the model generalizability and robustness across different environmental conditions. From a computational perspective, the model was trained on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU, completing 50 epochs in 2.5 h, equating to approximately 180 s per epoch. This training duration reflects efficient resource utilization given the model complexity, driven by its 35 million parameters, and supports rapid development cycles for iterative improvements. The prediction time, measured at 12 s per image at a resolution of 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, translates to a frames-per-second (FPS) rate of 0.083, which, while not instantaneous, remains practical for strategic wildfire monitoring scenarios where timely detection is prioritized over ultra-high-speed processing. To explore its adaptability, inference times were also assessed at lower resolutions: 6.5 s (0.154 FPS) at 384 \u00d7 384 pixels with 99.2% accuracy, and 4 s (0.25 FPS) at 256 \u00d7 256 pixels with 98.5% accuracy, demonstrating a trade-off between speed and detection precision that can be tailored to specific operational needs. The model parameter count of 35 million translates to a disk size of approximately 140 MB (calculated using 32-bit floating-point weights), a manageable footprint for modern UAV storage systems (e.g., 16 GB on DJI Matrice 300 RTK), despite being relatively large compared to simpler models. This size supports deployment on edge devices, with the model estimated power consumption of 15W enabling a 10-min flight duration at 512 \u00d7 512 resolution on a 300Wh battery, extendable to 20 min at 256 \u00d7 256, aligning with practical UAV endurance requirements for extended monitoring missions.Table 16</p><p>The overall result of the ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_16\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"448\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Metric</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Value</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Training accuracy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.85%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Validation accuracy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.78%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Test accuracy</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.78%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.02</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Recall</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.80%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">F1-score</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.80%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">False alarm rate</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.1%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Training time</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.5 h (50 epochs, ~ 180s/epoch)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Prediction time</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12s (512 \u00d7 512), 6.5s (384 \u00d7 384), 4s (256 \u00d7 256)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of parameters</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">35 million</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Model size</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">140 MB</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Power consumption</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15W</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cross-validation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.65% \u00b1 0.12% (fivefold)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">External validation</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.5% (500 unseen images)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>MetricValueTraining accuracy99.85%Validation accuracy99.78%Test accuracy99.78%Loss0.02Recall99.80%F1-score99.80%False alarm rate0.1%Training time2.5 h (50 epochs, ~ 180s/epoch)Prediction time12s (512 \u00d7 512), 6.5s (384 \u00d7 384), 4s (256 \u00d7 256)Number of parameters35 millionModel size140 MBPower consumption15WCross-validation99.65% \u00b1 0.12% (fivefold)External validation99.5% (500 unseen images)</p><p>The model performance was evaluated using key metrics such as loss and accuracy over the course of 50 epochs. Figures 5 and 6 shows the Training and validation loss and accuracy of the proposed system. Initially, in the first five epochs, the training loss dropped significantly from approximately 0.80 to 0.20, while accuracy improved sharply from around 65% to over 95%. The validation loss mirrored this trend, indicating effective learning and generalization. As training progressed, both training and validation losses continued to decline, stabilizing at 0.02 and 0.025, respectively, by the final epoch. The model achieved a training accuracy of 99.85% and maintained a validation accuracy of 99.78%, demonstrating minimal overfitting. The consistent convergence of loss values and high accuracy levels highlight the model ability to optimize its parameters effectively while maintaining robust generalization. These results underscore the ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model superior performance and reliability for fire detection tasks.Fig. 5</p><p>Training and validation loss of the ResCaps-TC-Attn-fire model.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Training and validation accuracy of ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ablation experiments</emphasis></p><p>To thoroughly assess the contribution of each architectural component within the ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model and validate its effectiveness for real-time wildfire detection using UAV imagery, we conducted a detailed ablation study. This experiment systematically removed individual key elements, Capsule Layers, Attention Mechanism, Fire Modules, and Temporal Convolution Layers, while retaining the remaining components, and evaluated their impact on critical performance metrics using a standardized dataset of 14,140 images (80-10-10 split). The results, presented in Table 17, provide a comprehensive analysis of how each component enhances the model accuracy, false alarm rate, early detection capability, and fire intensity estimation, underscoring the synergistic design of the full ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire configuration. The baseline performance of the complete ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model sets a high standard, achieving an accuracy of 99.78%, a low false alarm rate of 0.1%, early detection within 3.2 s of fire onset, and fire intensity estimation with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.15. This performance reflects the integrated strengths of its components: Threshold Convolution for noise filtering, Residual-Capsule Networks for spatial hierarchy modeling, Attention Mechanisms for region prioritization, Fire Modules for feature extraction, and Temporal Convolution for sequential pattern recognition. Removing the Capsule Layers, which are pivotal for capturing spatial relationships and transformations of fire features across varying scales and orientations, resulted in a significant accuracy drop to 94.32%, a high false alarm rate (estimated at 4.5% due to increased misclassifications), and the loss of early detection and intensity estimation capabilities. This 5.46% accuracy reduction highlights the critical role of capsules in preserving the structural integrity of fire patterns, a capability diminished when relying solely on standard convolutional layers. Excluding the Attention Mechanism, which dynamically focuses on fire-relevant regions such as heat spots and smoke plumes, led to an accuracy of 96.15%, a medium false alarm rate (approximately 2.0%), and the inability to estimate fire intensity, though early detection was retained. This 3.63% accuracy decline and increased false positives underscore the mechanism importance in refining detection precision, particularly for subtle or early-stage fire signals across diverse environmental conditions (e.g., fog, low-light). The removal of Fire Modules, designed for efficient feature extraction and optimized for computational efficiency, caused a more pronounced accuracy drop to 92.87% and a high false alarm rate (around 5.0%), with the loss of early detection and intensity estimation. This 6.91% decrease emphasizes their role in distilling critical fire-related features, a process disrupted when standard convolution replaces these specialized modules. Finally, omitting Temporal Convolution Layers, which model temporal dependencies in sequential UAV imagery (captured between 10:00 AM and 3:30 AM), resulted in an accuracy of 95.41%, a medium false alarm rate (about 2.5%), and the loss of early detection capability, indicating a 4.37% accuracy reduction. This suggests that temporal modeling is essential for anticipating fire progression, a feature compromised without this component. These ablation results collectively validate the indispensable contribution of each architectural element to the ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model overall performance. The full configuration leverages the complementary strengths of Threshold Convolution (noise reduction), Capsule Layers (spatial robustness), Attention Mechanisms (region focus), Fire Modules (feature efficiency), and Temporal Convolution (temporal awareness), achieving a harmonious balance that maximizes accuracy, minimizes false alarms, and enables early detection and intensity estimation. The observed performance degradation, ranging from 3.63 to 6.91% in accuracy and increased false alarm rates, when any component is removed, reinforces the necessity of this integrated design.Table 17</p><p>Experimental results of ablation study.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_17\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Model variant</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Accuracy (%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">False alarm rate</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Early detection</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Fire intensity estimation</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Full ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire Model</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">99.78</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Low</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Yes</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Yes</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Without capsule layers</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">94.32</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">High</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">No</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">No</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Without attention mechanism</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">96.15</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Medium</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Yes</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">No</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Without fire modules</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">92.87</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">High</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">No</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">No</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Without temporal convolution</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">95.41</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Medium</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">No</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">No</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Model variantAccuracy (%)False alarm rateEarly detectionFire intensity estimationFull ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire Model99.78LowYesYesWithout capsule layers94.32HighNoNoWithout attention mechanism96.15MediumYesNoWithout fire modules92.87HighNoNoWithout temporal convolution95.41MediumNoNo</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frames-per-second (FPS) analysis</emphasis></p><p>The real-time feasibility of the ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model is a critical factor for its deployment on UAVs, where power and endurance constraints demand rapid image processing. Initially, the model reported prediction time of 12 s per image at a 512 \u00d7 512-pixel resolution, evaluated on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU using the standardized dataset of 14,140 augmented UAV-captured images (normalized to [0,1], 80-10-10 train-validation-test split), translates to a baseline FPS of approximately 0.083 (1/12 s). This latency is insufficient for real-time wildfire monitoring, where FPS rates of 5 or higher are typically required to match UAV flight speeds and ensure timely detection, as demonstrated by the 2024 California wildfires, where delays exacerbated damages exceeding USD 12.1 billion. To address this, we conducted a detailed FPS analysis by experimenting with reduced input resolutions, 256 \u00d7 256 and 384 \u00d7 384 pixels, while re-evaluating the model performance on the same dataset, aiming to balance processing speed with detection accuracy.</p><p>The experimental setup involved retraining and testing ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire at each resolution, maintaining uniform preprocessing (e.g., data augmentation as per Table 12) and evaluation metrics (accuracy, recall, F1-score, false alarm rate). At 512 \u00d7 512 pixels, the model achieved an accuracy of 99.78%, recall of 99.80%, and F1-score of 99.80%, with a prediction time of 12 s, yielding the aforementioned 0.083 FPS. Reducing the resolution to 384 \u00d7 384 pixels decreased the prediction time to 6.5 s per image, improving the FPS to 0.154, while maintaining a high accuracy of 99.2%, recall of 99.5%, and F1-score of 99.5%, with a false alarm rate of 0.2%. Further reduction to 256 \u00d7 256 pixels reduced the prediction time to 4 s per image, achieving an FPS of 0.25, with an accuracy of 98.5%, recall of 98.7%, and F1-score of 98.6%, and a slightly elevated false alarm rate of 0.5%. These results indicate a promising trade-off: the 256 \u00d7 256 resolution offers a fourfold increase in FPS (0.25 vs. 0.083) with a modest accuracy drop of 1.28%, making it viable for real-time applications, while the 384 \u00d7 384 resolution provides a balanced compromise with minimal performance loss. The trade-offs are demonstrated in Table 18, which summarizes the results across resolutions. Lower resolutions reduce the model ability to detect fine-grained fire details (e.g., small flames &lt; 50 pixels), potentially affecting intensity estimation accuracy by up to 5% at 256 \u00d7 256, as validated by a subset of 500 test images with varied fire sizes. However, the increased FPS enhances UAV endurance, allowing continuous monitoring for up to 20 min on a typical 300Wh battery, compared to 10 min at 512 \u00d7 512. Limitations include potential overfitting at lower resolutions due to reduced feature richness and hardware-specific performance variations. Future work will focus on optimizing the architecture through dynamic pruning or quantization to boost FPS to 1.0 at 512 \u00d7 512 without resolution reduction, and integrating multi-modal data (e.g., thermal imagery) to enhance robustness, ensuring ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire meets the stringent demands of real-time wildfire detection.Table 18</p><p>FPS analysis and performance trade-offs for ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"8\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_18\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Resolution (pixels)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Prediction time (s/image)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">FPS</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Accuracy (%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col5\">Recall (%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col6\">F1-score (%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col7\">False alarm rate (%)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col8\">Intensity estimation error (%)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">512 \u00d7 512</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.083</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">99.78</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">99.80</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">99.80</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.1</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">2.0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">384 \u00d7 384</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">6.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.154</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">99.2</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">99.5</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">99.5</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.2</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">2.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">256 \u00d7 256</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.25</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">98.5</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">98.7</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">98.6</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.5</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">5.0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Resolution (pixels)Prediction time (s/image)FPSAccuracy (%)Recall (%)F1-score (%)False alarm rate (%)Intensity estimation error (%)512 \u00d7 512120.08399.7899.8099.800.12.0384 \u00d7 3846.50.15499.299.599.50.22.5256 \u00d7 25640.2598.598.798.60.55.0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison with existing research</emphasis></p><p>For the comparative evaluation, we used the original authors\u2019 implementations for YOLOv315, SSD-MobileNetV116, DeepLab V3+18, Light-YOLOv420, VGG1921, Enhanced YOLOv822, FFYOLO23, and Enhanced YOLOv8n25, sourced from public repositories as cited in the respective papers, and Xception17 from PyTorch torchvision library. For ABi-LSTM19, WCA-VFnet24, and IOFireNet26, where implementations were unavailable, we reimplemented the models following the architectural and training details provided in the original papers. All models were fine-tuned on our collected dataset with consistent preprocessing and evaluation protocols to ensure a fair comparison. The comparison focuses on both original and re-evaluated metrics, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, alongside operational aspects like false alarm rate, early detection, fire intensity estimation, and estimated power consumption. Table 19 presents these metrics, highlighting ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire superior performance and its advancements over existing models. ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire leverages three innovative components: Threshold Convolution (TC), achieving a 23.4% improvement in noise suppression over standard convolutions to mitigate background interference issues noted in SSD-MobileNetV116, Enhanced YOLOv822, and Enhanced YOLOv8n25; Residual Capsule Networks with hierarchical dynamic routing, providing an 18.7% enhancement in spatial relationship modeling compared to traditional CNNs, addressing limitations in YOLOv315, ABi-LSTM19, and VGG1921; and multi-scale attention fusion, delivering a 15.2% boost in small-fire detection to overcome challenges in Light-YOLOv420, Enhanced YOLOv822, and WCA-VFnet24. These components enable ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire to achieve an exceptional 99.78% accuracy, 99.7% precision, 99.8% recall, and 99.75% F1-score on the standardized dataset, surpassing all benchmarked models. For instance, YOLOv315 achieves 83% original accuracy (85.2% re-evaluated, 84.5% precision, 86.0% recall, 85.24% F1-score), limited by rigid anchor boxes that fail to adapt to dynamic fire shapes. ABi-LSTM19 records 97.8% original accuracy (96.2% re-evaluated, 96.0% precision, 96.5% recall, 96.25% F1-score), constrained by sequential processing that misses 2D fire spread patterns. DeepLab V3 +18 shows 77.1% original accuracy (79.3% re-evaluated, 78.5% precision, 80.0% recall, 79.24% F1-score), lacking precision in fire boundary detection due to its segmentation focus. The TC layer dynamically adjusts thresholds per spatial location, ensuring robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., smoke, fog, low-light), where IOFireNet26 (98.65% original, 96.2% re-evaluated, 96.0% precision, 96.5% recall, 96.25% F1-score) lags due to image quality dependency. Capsule routing (4 iterations, 32D pose parameters) preserves spatial hierarchies lost in VGG1921 (95% original, 93.5% re-evaluated, 93.0% precision, 94.0% recall, 93.49% F1-score) due to aggressive max-pooling, while multi-scale attention fusion enhances fire-relevant features across 5 scales, addressing SSD-MobileNetV116 limited receptive field (94% original, 92.5% re-evaluated, 92.0% precision, 93.0% recall, 92.49% F1-score), Light-YOLOv420 small-fire detection weaknesses (95.24% original, 94.8% re-evaluated, 94.5% precision, 95.0% recall, 94.75% F1-score), and WCA-VFnet24 inaccurate detections (90.1% adjusted AP, 89.5% precision, 90.8% recall, 90.14% F1-score). ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire also excels operationally, with early detection (3.2 s faster than YOLOv315 in controlled burns), an 87% reduction in false alarms compared to ABi-LSTM19, and fire intensity estimation (MAE 0.15) through a composite loss function optimizing classification, feature reconstruction (MSE 0.012 vs. DeepLab V3 +18 0.043), and routing consistency (KL divergence 0.08 vs. capsule baselines\u2019 0.21). Compared to Enhanced YOLOv822 (89.3% mAP@0.5, 88.8% precision, 89.8% recall, 89.29% F1-score), FFYOLO23 (88.8% mAP@0.5, 88.5% precision, 89.2% recall, 88.84% F1-score), and Enhanced YOLOv8n25 (99.0% mAP@0.5, 98.8% precision, 99.2% recall, 99.00% F1-score), ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire leads in all metrics, while IOFireNet26 lacks comprehensive intensity estimation despite spread prediction

limitations</emphasis></p><p>The ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model marks a significant leap in forest fire detection using UAV imagery, achieving exceptional performance with 99.78% accuracy, 99.7% precision, 99.8% recall, and 99.75% F1-score on a standardized 14,140-image dataset (80-10-10 split), driven by its innovative Threshold Convolution (23.4% noise suppression improvement), Residual Capsule Networks (18.7% spatial modeling enhancement), and multi-scale attention fusion (15.2% small-fire detection boost), outperforming models like YOLOv315 (85.2%), ABi-LSTM19 (96.2%), and IOFireNet26 (96.2%) with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05, Table 18) and validated by fivefold cross-validation (99.65% \u00b1 0.12%) and external testing (99.5% on 500 unseen images). It excels operationally with early detection (3.2 s faster than15), a 0.1% false alarm rate (87% lower than19), and fire intensity estimation (MAE 0.15), addressing gaps in competitors, though its 35 M parameters, 140 MB memory, 12 s inference time (0.083 FPS at 512 \u00d7 512), and 15W power consumption on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU lag behind lightweight models like FFYOLO23 (2W, 0.011 s) and Enhanced YOLOv8n25 (1.5W, 0.01 s), reducing UAV endurance (10 min at 512 \u00d7 512 vs. 20 at 256 \u00d7 256 on a 300Wh battery) and introducing a 5% intensity error at lower resolutions. The Fire-heavy dataset reflects high-risk scenarios but may not generalize to Non-Fire-dominated contexts, while untested extreme conditions (e.g., heavy rain, diverse terrains) limit robustness, a challenge also noted in24 and26. Future work will optimize the TC layer (pruning 58% parameters to &lt; 10 M, targeting 1 s inference, 5W, 30-min endurance), expand the dataset with a 10:1 Non-Fire-to-Fire ratio and multi-sensor inputs (thermal, gas) for 99.9% recall in low-visibility scenarios, adapt for edge devices (2W, 0.5 s at 256 \u00d7 256) with federated learning, and validate in real-world deployments post-patent approval (pending U.S. Patent and Trademark Office), aiming for 95% early detection within 2 s and MAE &lt; 0.10.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion and future work</emphasis></p><p>The ResCaps-TC-Attn-Fire model establishes a groundbreaking approach to wildfire detection using UAV imagery, seamlessly integrating Threshold Convolution (TC) for a 23.4% improvement in noise suppression, Residual-Capsule Networks (ResCaps) for an 18.7% enhancement in spatial relationship modeling, and a multi-scale attention mechanism for a 15.2% boost in small-fire detection, achieving an exceptional 99.78% accuracy, 99.7% precision, 99.8% recall, and 99.75% F1-score on a standardized dataset of 14,140 images (80-10-10 split). Supported by a composite loss function optimizing classification, feature reconstruction (MSE 0.012), and routing consistency (KL divergence 0.08), the model outperforms competitors like YOLOv315 (85.2%), ABi-LSTM19 (96.2%), and IOFireNet26 (96.2%) with statistical significance (p &lt; 0.05), validated by fivefold cross-validation (99.65% \u00b1 0.12%) and external testing (99.5% on 500 unseen images). Its operational strengths, early detection (3.2 s faster than15), a 0.1% false alarm rate (87% lower than19), and fire intensity estimation (MAE 0.15), position it as a pioneering end-to-end solution for real-time wildfire prevention and management, despite challenges like a 12 s inference time, 35 M parameters, and 15W power consumption on an NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. These limitations, alongside a Fire-heavy dataset (2,350 vs. 680 Non-Fire pre-augmentation) and untested extreme conditions, highlight areas for refinement, yet the model robustness is evident in its ability to handle diverse scenarios (e.g., fog, smoke, low-light) captured between 10:00 AM\u20133:30 AM. Future work will focus on addressing these limitations and expanding the model capabilities. First, we will integrate satellite data (e.g., MODIS, VIIRS) with UAV imagery to enhance wide-area monitoring, aiming for a 99.9% recall in early detection across regions. Second, optimization for edge deployment on devices like NVIDIA Jetson Nano will target reducing inference time to 1 s (1 FPS) and power consumption to 5W through TC layer pruning (reducing 58% of parameters to &lt; 10 M), extending UAV endurance to 30 min on a 300Wh battery. Third, multi-modal data fusion will incorporate thermal imaging and gas sensors (e.g., CO2) to improve performance in dense smoke or rain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was supported by the Deanship of Scientific Research, Vice Presidency for Graduate Studies and Scientific Research, King Faisal University, Saudi Arabia [Grant No. KFU252403]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Luo, Z.

The pair had been cosying up amid speculation Musk could donate tens of millions of pounds to Farage's party. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trouble in paradise started when Farage refused to back Musk's call to free Tommy Robinson from prison, where he is serving an 18-month sentence after admitting to repeating false accusations about a Syrian refugee. The Twitter/X owner suggested hardline far-right MP Rupert Lowe should take the helm of Reform.</p><p>Musk wrote on X: \"I have not met Rupert Lowe, but his statements online that I have read so far make a lot of sense.\" The Tesla owner's affection appears to have blossomed after Lowe praised Tommy Robinson, real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, on Sunday, before adding he was \"not right\" for Reform.</p><p>                     1. Climate change denial                   </p><p>The relatively unknown MP for Great Yarmouth started his political life as a failed candidate for the Eurosceptic Referendum in the 1997 general election when he was a year into his tenure as chairman of Southampton FC. Two decades later he won a seat in the European Parliament for the Brexit Party in 2019. </p><p>During his time in Brussels, he dubbed climate change a \"cult\" just after the devastating 2019-2020 Australian bushfires. He said at the time: \"The cult of climate change marches on with no definitive evidence to support or deny the factual accuracy of their assertions. </p><p>\"It\u2019s disappointing that climate change has been blamed as the primary cause of these devastating bushfires by both our Parliament and other so-called climate experts.</p><p>\"Logic suggests that climate change has little to do with this natural catastrophe.\" Lowe holds a hardline view on immigration and recently claimed that \"open borders \"put British women in danger\".</p><p>                     2. Hardline immigration views                   </p><p>Lowe is also known for his hardline views on immigration. He wrote last week: \"We must stop harbouring foreign nationals who viscerally hate Britain, who commit serious crimes, who rape our children. </p><p>\"If that means being insulted as 'racist' Then so be it, the word has lost all real meaning. It should be in no way controversial to deport these people.\"</p><p>In relation to Musk's intervention into UK politics on grooming gangs, he posted: \"Musk is not the story. The thousands and thousands of vulnerable white working class girls mass raped by Pakistani men are the story.\"</p><p>On Saturday he wrote: \"There should be no doubt that multiculturalism has failed Britain. If foreign nationals want to live in our country -they need to live by our laws, speak our language, and integrate into our society. The days of tolerating the intolerable in the name of diversity are over.\"</p><p>                     3. Southampton FC chairman                   </p><p>The 67-year-old MP was also a controversial chairman of Southampton FC. He served from 1996 to 2006 and then again from 2008 to 2009. He left the club when its holding company went into administration at the end of his second stint. </p><p>Lowe saw eight different managers come and go through the club during his tenure. He stood down in 2006 after Southampton was relegated when they were eyeing up a promotion to the Premier League. </p><p>Describing the abuse he received from fans, he <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/article/2024/jul/22/from-southampton-fc-to-parliament-reform-mp-rupert-lowe-divides-opinion\">told The Guardian</url> : \u201cUnderstandably, having thousands of people chanting such offensive language is not a pleasant position to be in, but we live in a country with free speech and we must respect that. It did put pressure on my health, I won\u2019t deny it.\"</p><p>                     4. Reform leader                   </p><p>Mr Lowe made it clear he would not challenge Farage for leadership of Reform. He said: \"I thank Elon for his kind comments. I just want to do what is right for my constituency and my country -that is my only interest.\"</p><p>He went on: \"Nigel is leader of Reform. He made Brexit happen, and for that I will always be grateful. I look forward to working with Nigel and the entire team to continue to hold this incompetent Labour Party to account, democratise our own party, win the next election and form a Reform Government.\"</p><p>                     For the latest breaking news and stories from across the globe from the Daily Star, sign up for our newsletters.                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DSTONL-108141658</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DSTONL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DV0-FBC3-RRT9-R105-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408508</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"725\"/><timeReceived>3:34 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Northern and Shell Media Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Star Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 6, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

It\u2019ll recover if that\u2019s the only year that it happens, but not if it keeps happening.</p><p>\u201cThe question in my mind is: is the man-made chlorine going to get \u2026 diluted and destroyed out of the atmosphere faster than global climate change is going to increase the frequency and intensity of this kind of fire? I think it\u2019s going to be a race.\u201d</p><p>Dr Martin Jucker, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales who was not involved in the research, agreed that the ozone hole might recover more slowly than expected as the result of more bushfires in future.</p><p>\u201cOf particular interest for Australia is the extension of the ozone hole further equatorward, which means that the ozone layer can become thinner much closer to where millions of Australians live,\u201d he said.</p><p>Dr Laura Revell, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, said: \u201cEarly signs of Antarctic ozone recovery have been visible since approximately the mid-2010s. In the absence of any major changes, we expect that stratospheric chlorine concentrations will gradually decrease this century and that the ozone hole will get smaller year by year.</p><p>\u201cOf concern is that while the ozone hole usually forms over Antarctica because of the cold temperatures there, wildfire aerosols appear to be capable of promoting ozone losses at the relatively warmer temperatures present at mid-latitudes which are heavily populated.\u201d</p><p>Solomon and her colleagues identified that the ozone-destruction process was triggered by hydrochloric acid in the stratosphere dissolving in the smoke aerosols.</p><p>Hydrochloric acid dissolved about a thousand times more readily in the smoke aerosols than in the \u201cthe normal sulphuric acid and water stratospheric particles\u201d, Solomon said.</p><p>\u201cFrom a scientific point of view, it\u2019s very exciting to see this brand new effect,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom a planetary point of view \u2026 it would be just tragic to have mankind screw up solving the ozone hole by deciding that we\u2019re going to [allow] a lot more of these fires if we don\u2019t mitigate climate change.\u201d</p><p>Solomon added that it was important to determine whether the smoke from fires in Australia \u2013 where native forests are dominated by eucalypts \u2013 differed in composition from fires in other areas. \u201cI don\u2019t really see a chemical reason why that would be so, but it needs to be looked at.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-91437969</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67R4-0KV1-JBNF-W1PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"661\"/><timeReceived>4:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

idea of a walk with her friends.</p><p>\"She originally suggested an idea of a bake off but knew it wouldn't raise much money so agreed on a walk from Barrow to Ulverston.\"</p><p>Mrs Eathorne said the group is hoping to raise \u00a3500 for the bushfires.</p><p>She said: \"Summer is doing really well with her sponsors so we're hoping to raise a good amount for the cause.\"</p><p>The walk is estimated to take three hours, starting at the Abbey House Hotel.</p><p>Mrs Eathorne said she is 'very proud' of her daughter for taking on the task.</p><p>\"She's very caring, and just absolutely

Mines in Australia and Colombia changed focus to produce higher-quality products, reducing their production quantity. In December, dust and smoke from Australian bushfires reduced air quality, further reducing production. BHP said in its report: \"We are monitoring the situation and if air quality continues to deteriorate then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year.\" </p><p>Copper production in Q4 increased by 9% compared to a year before with 455 kilotons produced. The company is focussing its mineral exploration efforts on finding copper in Chile, Ecuador, Peru, South Australia, Canada, and the south-western USA. It also expects the third phase of a South Australian mine to come online in Q2 2020. Iron ore production remained consistent. In October, a Brazilian iron ore mine received a licence needed to resume operation after it was flooded in 2015. The company paid $44m to enable work at the mine to resume and will be fully operational again when safety requirements are met. BHP said in the review: \"As at the date of this Operational Review... we are not in a position to provide an update on the ongoing potential financial impacts on BHP Brasil of the Samarco dam failure.\" Zinc production in the latter half of 2019 decreased by 22% compared to 2018 as head grades in a Peruvian mine decreased as expected. Nickel refineries and smelters in Australia underwent maintenance, meaning nickel production in Q4 2019 was down by 37% compared to Q3. The company's only oil exploration well drilled during the last quarter, off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago, was found to be dry. BHP's CEO Mike Henry said: \"We delivered solid operational performances across the portfolio in the first half of the 2020 financial year, offsetting the expected impacts of planned maintenance and natural field decline. \"Production and cost guidance is unchanged, and we remain on track to deliver slightly higher production than last year. Our six major development projects are progressing well, and we continue to advance our exploration programs in petroleum and copper.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DTMNWF-02405229667A4C5CB4806CBE0FC6E0A3</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DTMNWF2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1T-TBF1-DYG0-72J0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">278899</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"367\"/><timeReceived>3:37 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MarketLine All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>MarketLine NewsWire (Formerly Datamonitor)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24102\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

I felt this need to do something. Everyone else was doing things in their own way and I had to do something in my way,' Warne told media in January 2020 about his decision to sell the cap.<br/><br/>Shane Warne was amazed when his Baggy Green eventually sold at auction for just over $ 1 million - all of which was donated to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund.<br/>The cap was bought by Commonwealth Bank's chief executive, Matt Comyn, on behalf of the bank.<br/><br/>Mr Comyn said he was delighted the bank had secured the cherished Baggy Green and commended Shane Warne for putting his cap up for auction.<br/><br/>'He has demonstrated the same Aussie spirit we are seeing across the country with acts of generosity and dedication throughout this disaster as communities rally to support each other,' Mr Comyn said in January 2020.<br/><br/>After acquiring the Baggy Green, the bank took the cap on a fundraising tour across the country before retiring it as a permanent exhibit at the Bowral-based Bradman Museum in August 2020.<br/><br/>Over a period of six months, the baggy green visited schools, cricket clubs, and community centres. It even made an appearance at the Australian Women's Cricket Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on International Women's Day in 2020.<br/><br/>On 27 August, Sir Donald Bradman's Birthday, the cap joined a collection of thirty baggy greens dating back to the 1800's to present day at the Bradman Museum.<br/><br/>After officially handing Warnie's Baggy Green to the Bradman Museum at their opening ceremony, CBA Chief Executive Officer, Matt Comyn, said: 'Once again we see the power of the Baggy Green to inspire and lift our nation.<br/><br/>'Even though our tour of the cap was cut short due to coronavirus, through the Bank's contributions to disaster relief and the support of our customers, we contributed close to $ 20 million to support the community over the past financial year.'<br/><br/>In addition to the purchase of Shane Warne's Baggy Green cap, throughout 2020 the bank delivered 213 grants to organisations across Australia that were adversely impacted by the bushfires through its Bushfire Recovery Grants program.<br/><br/>The bank and its customers also donated in excess of $ 4 million to the Australian Red Cross, and raised over $ 350,000 via the 'Fiver4Fires' National Staff Fundraising Day.<br/><br/>Commonwealth Bank's Head of Community Investment, Nathan Barker, said the bank was proud to be able to help organisations and communities impacted by the 2019/2020 bushfires.<br/><br/>'2020 was a tough for year for so many Australians in more ways than one, and we wanted to do whatever we could to ensure 2021 is a brighter and better year,' he said.<br/><br/>To commemorate 12 months following Australia's devastating bushfires, over the coming weeks and months CBA Newsroom will share some of the stories of hope and optimism that the bank was privy to through our Bushfire Recovery Grants program.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61PT-NJN1-JD3Y-Y2C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"617\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 8, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The strict sulfur regulation on shipping fuel implemented in 2020 (IMO2020) presents an opportunity to assess the potential impacts of such emission regulations and the detectability of deliberate aerosol perturbations for climate intervention. Here we employ machine learning to capture cloud natural variability and estimate a radiative forcing of +0.074 \u00b10.005 W m\u22122 related to IMO2020 associated with changes in shortwave cloud radiative effect over three low-cloud regions where shipping routes prevail. We find low detectability of the cloud radiative effect of this event, attributed to strong natural variability in cloud albedo and cloud cover. Regionally, detectability is higher for the southeastern Atlantic stratocumulus deck. These results raise concerns that future reductions in aerosol emissions will accelerate warming and that proposed deliberate aerosol perturbations such as marine cloud brightening will need to be substantial in order to overcome the low detectability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Reductions in aerosol cooling as a result of shipping fuel regulations implemented in 2020 led to substantial positive radiative forcing globally, but this change is difficult to detect against a background of high natural variability,according to neural-network based analyses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Marine low-level, warm clouds exert a strong net cooling effect on the climate. As a result of their responses to increases in aerosol over the twentieth century, these climate-cooling clouds have been a key player in mitigating the rate at which the Earth warms in response to increasing greenhouse gases (GHG) through aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). Although future aerosol mitigation policies will have important health benefits, they may exacerbate global warming as a result of the unmasking of GHG warming due to reduced aerosol radiative forcing, \u2013. An increase in aerosol loading leads to an increase in the population of smaller cloud droplets, all else equal, by ramping up available cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). This increases the total surface area of the droplets that scatters sunlight, resulting in more reflective clouds. Knock-on effects such as precipitation suppression, enhanced entrainment-evaporation, or shortwave heating might augment or offset this brightening, , , \u2013. Ship tracks\u2014bright, linear features found over subtropical shipping corridors where marine low clouds prevail,\u2014are a visible manifestation of these aerosol effects on clouds.</p><p>At the beginning of 2020, the world's maritime shipping sector implemented the International Maritime Organization(IMO) Marine Environment Protection Committee (MEPC) fuel regulation that limits the maximum fuel sulfur mass concentration in ships from 3.5% to 0.5% or requires an equivalent sulfur oxide reduction in the exhaust using gas cleaning systems. This regulation is hereafter abbreviated as IMO2020. The combustion of sulfur-containing fuel produces sulfate aerosol\u2014an effective source of CCN for marine boundary layer clouds\u2014as a byproduct or via oxidation of the emitted gaseous sulfur dioxide. This regulation leads to a reduction in sulfate aerosol production over global oceans, resulting in lower cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) that have been detected regionally, \u2013. Since IMO2020, a pronounced reduction in ship track occurrence has been shown globally,, adding to documented impacts from earlier fuel regulations designated for specific emission zones near the Californian and European coasts. Furthermore, in the southeast Atlantic shipping corridor, recent studies present robust evidence for a reduction in cloud microphysical perturbations inside the shipping lane, along with a weakened although less robust cloud brightening.</p><p>In spite of the routine nature of shipping traffic, the occurrence of visible ship tracks is only a few percent at the global scale,, in part because of variable meteorological conditions and in part because of changes in the background aerosol. Therefore, whether IMO2020 exerts a detectable perturbation to the cloud radiative effect after 3 years, taking into account the co-varying meteorological conditions that also modify the cloud field, is an open question and remains to be assessed. Previous studies suggest that (i) at least 5 to 6 years of observations are needed to derive significant signals in both Nd and cloud albedo changes from the shipping lane over the southeast Atlantic, and (ii) in a hypothetical geoengineering setting, substantial, sustained increases in shortwave (SW) cloud albedo are required to surpass the detection limit (or noise) set by the natural variability in cloud albedo. While these studies establish foundations for the topic of ACI detectability in the climate system (a signal-to-noise ratio problem), they each focus on one side of the problem, i.e., signal and noise, respectively. When the detectability of a real-world event, such as IMO2020, is assessed, one needs to connect both sides.</p><p>In this study, we aim to assess (i) signal significance\u2014the strength of the IMO2020 signal, due to aerosol changes alone, all else equal, by comparing the observed cloud field against a counterfactual cloud field constructed by an ensemble of neural networks, and (ii) signal detection relative to natural variability\u2014whether the post-perturbation observational record stands out above the variability in the cloud radiative effect. The latter evaluation includes all drivers of cloud variability, not only anthropogenic but also natural, by comparing the observational records before and after IMO2020. The combination of the two assessments informs us about the general detectability of the IMO2020 event and has implications for the detectability of marine cloud brightening (MCB), which if adopted, would deliberately inject aerosol into clouds, \u2013.</p><p>Here, we focus on the relative cloud radiative effect (rCRE) of low clouds, a quantity of high relevance to radiative forcing, that incorporates both cloud brightness (cloud albedo) and areal coverage (cloud fraction; see Methods). We use a data-driven approach to quantify the radiative forcing of IMO2020 due to changes in the SW cloud radiative effect from the three main marine low-cloud regions where shipping prevails, at a spatiotemporal scale beyond that of individual ship tracks. This approach utilizes an ensemble of neural networks, trained to capture the climatological relationship between large-scale meteorological conditions and cloud properties, to construct counterfactual cloud fields as if IMO2020 were not implemented (i.e., business-as-usual). The ensemble approach not only boosts the robustness of the forcing estimate, but also enables uncertainty and significance evaluations. Despite an estimated radiative forcing of +0.074 \u00b10.005 W m\u22122, we find low detectability of the cloud radiative effect of this event, attributed to strong cloud natural variability.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A data-driven approach to perturbation assessment</emphasis></p><p>It has been shown that cloud properties and their radiative effect can be robustly predicted by combinations of large-scale meteorological variables (or cloud controlling factors) using data-driven approaches, , , , \u2013. In particular, the ability of data-driven approaches to capture the climatological, non-linear relationship among meteorology, aerosol conditions, and cloud macrophysical properties is central to this work,, enabling a counterfactual continuation of this climatological, non-linear relationship after 2020 under the assumption that it can be used to represent the business-as-usual emission scenario. We train Neural Network Ensembles (NNEs) to map 8 large-scale meteorological conditions to low-cloud properties, including rCRE and Nd, on a gridded (1\u00b0) and monthly scale using satellite observations and reanalysis datasets (see Methods). In this work, the three major stratocumulus decks, namely the Northeastern Pacific (NEP), the Southeastern Pacific (SEP), and the Southeastern Atlantic (SEA) stratocumulus decks that coincide with major shipping corridors are investigated for 3 years since IMO2020 (2020\u20132022, inclusive).</p><p>The task we assign to the Neural Network (NN) is to learn and capture the complex, non-linear co-variability among large-scale meteorological conditions, aerosol conditions, and low-cloud properties from the climatological data record (2003\u20132018) for the stratocumulus regime. Applying such climatological co-variability to the IMO2020 impacted years (2020\u20132022) is equivalent to intentionally ignoring the implementation of IMO2020\u2014an abrupt change in the aerosol field, while keeping everything else the same, especially the large-scale meteorological conditions. This creates a counterfactual scenario from which the impact of IMO2020 and its detectability can be assessed.</p><p>Inevitably for any machine-learning (ML) approach, constraining uncertainty within the ML-prediction is a challenge\u2014in our case to provide a robust radiative forcing estimate. The skill of the NN and the robustness of the predictions are central. To this end, we train an ensemble of NN instead of a single NN to be able to assess the uncertainty associated with our particular NN framework. The performance of these NNEs for the 4 target variables, namely rCRE, Nd, low-cloud fraction (LCF), and low-cloud albedo (Ac), is well above community standards (Supplementary Fig. ), and is not subject to overfitting (Supplementary Fig. ). Furthermore, a linear correction to the NN model is applied to account for cases where high spatial correlations in cloud responses to the aerosol perturbation from ships are evident, e.g., a shipping lane (see Methods). This step is particularly important for robustly predicting the Nd field over the SEA, where meteorological factors alone are less skilled at capturing the sharp gradient in the climatological Nd distribution across a spatially narrow lane because the main shipping route is aligned with the prevailing boundary layer winds. Another issue that NN-predictions are known to be prone to is extrapolation. We examine the ranges of the 8 meteorological conditions during 2020-2022 relative to the ranges of the training dataset (2003\u20132018) and conclude that the probability of extrapolation in our case is minimal, based on the overlapping distributions of the predictors between the training and the predicting datasets (Supplementary Fig. ). Known expected responses, if they do exist, can serve as a sanity check for the behavior of the NN. Among all the shipping corridors, the one in the southeastern Atlantic presents such an opportunity, given the aligned wind direction and the shipping route. This makes cloud micro- and macro-properties within the shipping lane easily distinguishable from the surrounding areas,. A lane-shaped decrease in Nd due to IMO2020 is indeed evident in the SEA region of this study, aligning well with the main shipping lane (Fig. 1a), providing assurance of the skill of our approach to assess the IMO2020 perturbation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IMO2020 perturbations of cloud properties.</emphasis></p><p>3-year mean change in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) relative cloud radiative effect (rCRE) during 2020\u20132022 for the three stratocumulus decks. rCRE climatology (2003-2018 mean) is indicated by gray contours.

The fraction of significant (fsig) grids is indicated in white labels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Substantial radiative forcing from changes in cloudiness and cloud brightness</emphasis></p><p>Changes in Nd (\u0394Nd, the difference between observed and counterfactual values, see Methods) during 2020\u20132022 are negative for most parts of the three stratocumulus decks (Fig. 1); these are more pronounced near the coasts, consistent with the strong reduction in fuel sulfur content since IMO2020 and the dense shipping traffic in coastal regions,. Most of the decreases in Nd are statistically significant at the grid level against the NNE-predicted counterfactual values (black dots in Fig. 1; based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at 95% confidence interval, see Methods). Over the SEA, a band of stronger negative \u0394Nd that is easily discernible from the neighboring grids aligns well with the main shipping lane therein. The fact that Nd decreases both inside and adjacent to the shipping lane are statistically significant suggests a dilution of the shipping emission at the monthly timescale. Regionally, the NEP (SEP) has the most (least) substantial decrease in Nd (Fig. 1a, white labels), consistent with the fact that the NEP (SEP) region has the highest (lowest) sulfur dioxide emission from ships and the most frequent occurrence of ship tracks. The SEA presents the most discernible spatial pattern in Nd changes, including not only the linear feature of a shipping lane but also the significant increases in Nd closer to the equator, which can be attributed, in part, to the 2019\u20132020 Australian bushfires (positive \u0394Nd near the equator diminishes when 2020\u20132021 are excluded from the analysis; not shown). Although, in the mean (spatiotemporally), regional decreases in Nd are less than 5 cm\u22123 (Fig. 2b), the percentage decrease can be as large as ~6% (e.g., over the NEP; Supplementary Fig. ) and local decreases can reach as high as ~30 cm\u22123 near the coast (Figs. 1a, 2b).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IMO2020 radiative forcings.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis> Global shortwave radiative forcings based on the 3 stratocumulus decks due to changes in low-cloud fraction (LCF), low-cloud albedo (Ac), and low-cloud rCRE (including LCF and Ac adjustments).

Mean values are shown in symbols with uncertainty ranges indicated by vertical bars.</p><p>Decreases in rCRE, corresponding to more incoming solar radiation reaching the surface (i.e., a warming effect), are observed for most parts of the stratocumulus regime (Fig. 1b). Substantial and significant warming is concentrated in the northwestern part of the NEP stratocumulus deck. Over the SEP, significant warming is mostly concentrated downwind of the main stratocumulus deck, despite little change in Nd, suggesting a strong cloud susceptibility to aerosol perturbations. This occurs in the broken cumulus regime and is likely related to the precipitation-suppression mechanism. The lane-shaped feature observed in the spatial pattern of \u0394Nd is evident in \u0394rCRE over the SEA, although to a lesser extent, but nevertheless indicates a persistent warming along the main shipping lane since IMO2020. The general marine boundary layer flow over these low-cloud regions, i.e., from cooler to warmer waters, dictates a typical transition from stratocumulus clouds (more cloudiness) to cumulus clouds (less cloudiness), which would otherwise be delayed under elevated aerosol loading (through drizzle suppression), consistent with the pronounced changes in the cloud radiative effect, especially via changes in LCF downwind of this transition in each deck (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. ). The fact that the spatial pattern of \u0394rCRE does not match exactly that of \u0394Nd also suggests (i) a spatially varying cloud susceptibility to aerosol perturbations and (ii) a strong dependence of ACI-induced radiative forcing on the temporal co-variation between background aerosol and meteorological conditions that is regionally distinct. On average, our method suggests a positive susceptibility of cloud radiative effect to Nd perturbations of ~0.25 for the stratocumulus regime (see Methods and Supplementary Fig. ), mostly attributed to an albedo susceptibility of similar magnitude, which is in line with a previous satellite-based assessment. In contrast, the regional LCF susceptibility is weak (medians near zero) due to an offsetting between grids with positive versus negative susceptibilities.</p><p>We estimate a global radiative forcing (RF) of +0.074 \u00b10.005 W m\u22122 (in shortwave radiation at the top-of-atmosphere, \u0394SWTOA; see Methods) from the changes in low-cloud shortwave rCRE over the three stratocumulus regions during 2020\u20132022, scaled by their areal coverage of the globe (Fig. 2). This is equivalent to the effective RF due to ACI (ERFACI),, including instantaneous RF and cloud adjustments. Although within the range provided by existing model-facilitated assessments of the RF of this event (between +0.027 and +0.179 W m\u22122 in the mean; Fig. 2c),, , , , , , , \u2013, we note that our estimate only includes contributions from the three main marine low-cloud regions (where shipping routes are prevalent) and does not account for the longwave cloud radiative effect or the direct aerosol radiative effect (which tend to be negligible when low-cloud fraction is high). The small uncertainty range reported here represents the spread of the global mean RF estimates (i.e., after spatial averaging) among the NN ensemble members; this uncertainty is specific to the particular NN framework employed in this work. There are, actually, pronounced spatial variations in our RF estimates, ranging from ~+0.1 W m\u22122 over the NEP and the SEA to +0.03 W m\u22122 over the SEP. The +0.1 W m\u22122 warming over the SEA is in line with the estimate from a recent study that focuses on the shipping corridor in that region, consistent with the fact that shipping emissions are strongly constrained within a narrow band in that basin. Variations in \u0394Nd alone between basins are not enough to explain the variations in the basin-specific radiative forcing (e.g., the difference between SEP and SEA; Fig. 2), underscoring the importance of accounting for spatiotemporal co-variations between \u0394Nd and cloud susceptibilities, particularly those corresponding to cloud adjustments. On average, changes in Ac contribute two-thirds to our RF estimate, and changes in LCF contribute about one-third (Fig. 2a).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natural variability masks detectability of the IMO2020-perturbation</emphasis></p><p>A key question in this study is whether the significant IMO2020-perturbations to cloud microphysics (\u0394Nd) and radiative effect (\u0394rCRE) due to only aerosol are detectable when compared to an a priori observational record, taking into account all natural drivers of cloud variability. Now that we have established the significance of the aerosol-induced signal, we evaluate it against the noise, set by the natural variability in cloud properties, to assess the detectability of this event. Note that the \u0394 in this study always denotes changes that are attributed to IMO2020 emission changes, all else equal (i.e., the difference between observed and counterfactual values during 2020\u20132022, see Methods).</p><p>Using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, we evaluate (i) if the observational records before and after IMO2020 are significantly different from each other\u2014whether a change in the observational record is detected (or signal detection against natural variability), and (ii) if the changes in cloud properties due to aerosol emission changes are statistically significant, based on the counterfactual cloud fields constructed by the NNE\u2014significance of the signal (see Methods and Fig. 3). In addition to the detection of significant IMO2020 perturbations, this framework allows us to identify cases where an insignificant IMO2020 perturbation due to emission changes is detected post-2020 in the observational record owing to meteorologically driven changes in the cloud field (i.e., false detection). On the other hand, significant IMO2020 perturbations can be masked by overwhelmingly large natural variability in cloud properties, post-2020, in the observational record (i.e., missed detection). Both these scenarios underscore an important confounding effect of natural variability on the detectability of natural or deliberate perturbations to the aerosol field, with the latter being a critical checkpoint for the viability of marine cloud brightening,.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Definition of IMO2020 detectability.</emphasis></p><p>A table showing how detectability of the IMO2020 event is characterized in this study. OBSIMO denotes the observational record post-IMO2020, OBSpre-IMO denotes the observational record pre-IMO2020, and NNEIMO denotes the NNE-predicted counterfactual cloud fields based on the 2020\u20132022 meteorological conditions, representing the business-as-usual scenario, with all else equal except for the aerosol. Color scheme mimics that in Fig. 4.</p><p>Using the 3-year immediately proceeding 2020 as the reference observational record, we find the true detection rate (PTD, the percentage of significant IMO2020 perturbations being detected in the observational record) for Nd ranges from 12% over the SEP to 79% over the SEA (Fig. 4a). While only 12% of the significant IMO2020 Nd-perturbation is detected over the SEP, mostly in the shipping corridor, the false detection rate (PFD, the percentage of insignificant IMO2020 perturbations being detected) is the lowest (2%) therein. The high PTD over the SEA is consistent with the fact that shipping aerosol emissions are narrowly constrained in space by the general boundary layer flow of the region. Over the NEP and SEP regions, more than half of the significant \u0394Nd are undetected (missed detection, gray shading overlaid with blue dots) owing to the large natural variability at these grids. The overall false detection rate for Nd-perturbation is less than 15% for all three decks, indicating that the climatological meteorology-Nd relationship is less likely to cause a significant departure in the observational record of Nd.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maps of IMO2020 detectability.</emphasis></p><p>Detectability of (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Nd and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) rCRE for the IMO2020 event, when using the 2017\u20132019 observational record as OBSpre-IMO, based on the Wilcoxon signed-rank test at 95% confidence interval (see Methods and Fig. 3). Grids where observational records before (OBSpre-IMO) and after (OBSIMO) IMO2020 are statistically different are shaded in yellow, including true detection (magenta dots on yellow) and false detection (crossings on yellow). Grids where OBSIMO is indifferent from OBSpre-IMO are shaded in gray, including missed detection (blue dots on gray) and no detection (gray). Inserts indicate the areal fraction of the four detection-scenarios for each region. The fraction of significant IMO2020 (aerosol-induced) perturbation being detected (PTD) and the fraction of insignificant IMO2020 (aerosol-induced) perturbation being detected (PFD) are labeled in white. rCRE climatology (2003\u20132018 mean) are overlaid with white contours.</p><p>The detectability of \u0394rCRE is much lower than that of \u0394Nd (Fig. 4b). This is evident in the halving of PTD and the doubling of PFD for all decks, except for the SEP where PTD slightly increases while PFD increases 20-fold (a degrading of detectability, see discussion of Fig. 5). This comes as no surprise given the detection limit of shortwave scene-albedo changes is about 0.04\u20130.05 (at the grid level) for the NEP and the SEP regions, whereas our assessment indicates that \u0394rCRE due to IMO2020 does not exceed 0.03 for these two regions (Fig. 1). The lack of a spatially coherent distribution of true detections (yellow shading overlaid with magenta dots), compared to that of Nd, reflects the complex, non-linear nature of aerosol-cloud interactions, particularly the meteorology-dependent, spatiotemporally varying cloud susceptibility to aerosol perturbations,. This suggests that detecting a shift in the spatial pattern of rCRE is similarly difficult. The 20-fold increase in the false detection rate of rCRE from that of Nd over the SEP indicates a dominating role of the large-scale meteorological conditions in driving the natural variability in cloud radiative effect, especially over higher latitudes where synoptic variability overwhelms anthropogenic perturbations (Fig. 4b).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Detectability of each deck as ROC curves.</emphasis></p><p>Regional (Sc deck-level) detectability illustration for (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Nd and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) rCRE in terms of true and false detection rates. Shades of colors indicate the number of years that goes into the construction of OBSpre-IMO with light colors denoting more years (see Methods). Open circles highlight the results shown in Fig. 4 where the 3-year period immediately proceeding 2020 is used as OBSpre-IMO. Perfect detectability lies at the upper-left corner (0,1) of the diagram, and a random detectability lies on the 1-to-1 line. Detectability increases from bottom-right to upper-left.</p><p>On a regional level, moving up-scale from grid level detection, we find that the rCRE-detectability is in general worse than that of a random binary-classifier (Fig. 5b), with the SEA region being the best among the three decks. When more years prior to 2020 are used to construct the pre-IMO2020 observational record (shades of the colors in Fig. 5, see Methods), we do not see an improvement in the rCRE-detectability, as points are moving along the bottom-left to upper-right diagonal, meaning that the true detection rate and false detection rate increase at the same time. Similarly low detectabilities are found in LCF and Ac as well, except that the Ac-detectability is higher over the SEA (Supplementary Fig. ). In contrast, Nd-detectabilities for all three decks are better than a random binary-classifier (Fig. 5a), and they improve with increasing the number of years that go into the pre-IMO2020 observational record. Again, the SEA region has the highest Nd-detectability, which does not improve further when increasing the number of years in the pre-IMO2020 observational record, representing a saturated detectability. This is expected given the climatologically persistent, narrowly constrained shipping emissions in the SEA shipping lane.</p><p>Using the IMO2020 event as a test, we find low detectability in cloud radiative effect at both grid and regional levels, attributed to the strong masking effect of its natural variability, driven by the variability in large-scale meteorological conditions. In general, cloud microphysical changes (e.g., Nd) in response to aerosol perturbations have a higher chance of being detected, due to the relatively weak variability in the climatological relationship between meteorology and Nd and without the added layer of complexity from cloud adjustments. Among the three marine low-cloud regions, the SEA presents the highest detectability in cloud micro- and macro-properties. This suggests that deliberate aerosol seeding proposals for marine cloud brightening may need to be ambitious in terms of the increase in aerosol loading, compared to that of IMO2020, which is already substantial.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Variations in the cloud radiative effect derive from natural variability, long term, and transient perturbations. Physical process understanding, existing modeling, and observational evidence suggest that the first is predictable from given meteorological conditions, the second is somewhat predictable given a long enough observational record, while third is rather unpredictable due to the unpredictable nature of socioeconomic activities (e.g. policy changes, global pandemics, etc.) and of transient natural events (e.g., volcanic eruptions and wildfires). In this study, we take advantage of the predictable nature of natural variability and task a data-driven computer-learning program to represent it. This method, by design, helps to remove natural variability from the observed variations, attributing the remaining variability to transient events such as the IMO2020.</p><p>Complications of this type of attribution arise from, first, any long-term trend in the aerosol field that co-exists with its natural variability, such as the change in the long-term anthropogenic aerosol trend due to global clean-air efforts and previous IMO regulations on shipping emission of different magnitudes at different spatial scales. These non-meteorological changes and trends in the background aerosol field complicate the relationship between meteorological fields and cloud properties that the NN is tasked to learn, but given their magnitudes, abruptness, and scales, compared to the IMO2020 event, their effect is small. Moreover, dissecting our training datasets to address the impact of individual trends and all previous IMO regulations would greatly limit our sample size for training and degrade the skill of the NN model. Therefore, we choose the longest observational record available to train the NN model, acknowledging the existence of weak, non-meteorological influences in the climatological relationship between meteorological conditions and low-cloud properties. This causes our NN model to essentially extract the mean relationship when given a long-term trend.</p><p>Second, transient events that have occurred during approximately the same time period, but possibly of different duration, also complicate the attribution to IMO2020. In our case, this includes the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2019-20 Australian bushfires. Although the most severe fires peaked between December 2019 to January 2020 during the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, Earth System Model simulations have shown that the emitted aerosol traveled around the southern Hemisphere, carried by the atmospheric circulation, and caused radiative perturbations through direct and indirect (via clouds) effects for at least three months at the beginning of 2020. We tested the impact of the 2019\u20132020 Australian bushfires, to the best of our ability, by repeating the analysis excluding the first four months of 2020. This did not change any of our qualitative conclusions or the spatial patterns in Nd and rCRE perturbations. It only led to a slight difference of \u22123 mW m\u22122 in the global radiative forcing estimate (more warming when the first four months are left out of the analysis). This result suggests that the IMO2020 perturbation overwhelmed perturbations from the shorter-duration wildfires. Large-scale simulations are warranted for further assessment of the degree of complexity added by the 2019\u20132020 Australian bushfires to the impact of IMO2020. Unfortunately, for an observation-based study, it is not possible to disentangle the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic from that of IMO2020 on the observed changes in Nd and rCRE because of the similar spatial scales of the two events. However, a number of modeling and observational studies suggest that the impact of COVID-19 on global and regional cloud properties, surface temperature and precipitation is limited and undetectable (smaller than natural variability), in part due to the offsetting between the weakening in both aerosol cooling and GHG warming, , \u2013. Nonetheless, if COVID-19 had not coincided with IMO2020, our estimate might be seen as an upper limit on forcing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>In this work, we devise a data-driven approach to assess the radiative forcing and its detectability of the IMO2020 event, by training an ensemble of neural networks to capture the natural variability in the cloud radiative effect, which is subsequently removed from the 2020-2022 observational record of the cloud field to reveal a substantial warming of 0.074 \u00b10.005 W m\u22122 as a result of the implementation of the strict shipping fuel regulations in 2020. Although only accounting for the contributions from changes in SW cloud radiative effect from three marine low-cloud regions, our estimate is in line with recent assessments taking different observational and modeling approaches (Fig. 2),, , , , , , , \u2013. We extend the focus beyond individual shipping lanes or shipping corridors and find regionally distinct patterns of warming, with a lane-shaped pattern evident in the SEA region that aligns well with the main shipping lane (Fig. 1), providing confidence in the robustness of the data-driven approach. Strong spatial variations in the forcing point to the importance of accounting for co-variations between aerosol perturbations and cloud susceptibility when scaling up radiative forcing from ACI,.</p><p>Our radiative forcing estimate represents area-weighted contributions from changes in only the low clouds over the three stratocumulus regions where shipping routes prevail, suggesting that an even stronger warming effect due to IMO2020 is plausible, e.g., with contributions from the lessening of aerosol scattering of sunlight and the adjustments in the trade cumulus regime. This positions our study to suggest that substantial warming from IMO2020 might have contributed to 2023 being the warmest year on record, adding to the existing lines of evidence supporting the postulation of accelerated GHG warming in the coming decades if aggressive aerosol emission regulations are pursued,,.</p><p>An important finding of this work is the strong masking effect of natural variability on the detectability of the radiative impact from IMO2020. By comparing the observational record of cloud properties since 2020 with the NNE-constructed counterfactual cloud fields (signal significance) and the observational records before and after 2020 (signal detection against natural variability), we have demonstrated an overall low detectability in cloud radiative effect of the IMO2020 event, manifested as concurrent changes in true detection rate and false detection rate, despite the substantial decreases in Nd, which has a higher chance of being detected (Figs. 4 and 5). This has important implications for the detectability of large-scale radiative perturbations of both negative and positive sign. For example, if marine cloud brightening were to be attempted our findings imply a strong, regionally-dependent masking of MCB detectability by the natural variability in cloud radiative effect, and that an ambitious seeding strategy might be required. Regionally, the higher detectability for the southeastern Atlantic stratocumulus deck speaks to the benefit of seeding a concentrated area, instead of a widespread area to boost signal detection. The low detectability of the radiative perturbation from IMO2020 at scales larger than ship track or shipping lane speaks to the substantial challenge in validating the viability of MCB at regional-to-global scales,.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Training data</emphasis></p><p>We use 8 cloud controlling factors (CCFs) and low cloud properties, including relative cloud radiative effect (rCRE), low-cloud fraction (LCF), low-cloud albedo (Ac) and liquid cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) to train the Neural Network (NN). The 8-CCF consists of 8 large-scale meteorological variables (MVs) acquired from the ERA5 reanalysis, \u2013 every hour at 0.25\u00b0 resolution, which are then averaged to monthly gridded (1\u00b0) values. These MVs are: pressure velocity at 500 hPa (), relative humidity (RH) at 850 hPa and 925 hPa (RH850, RH925), potential temperature () at 1000 hPa, 850 hPa and 700 hPa (, , ), column water vapor (CWV), and latent heat flux (LHF). Simply including all available MVs in the training process does not lead to a higher predictive skill but increases the risk of overfitting. Therefore, we select MVs based on the best-performing combination of the 8-MV sets in predicting monthly gridded low-cloud properties by testing all possible combinations of 14 MVs using an ensemble-NN approach. By doing this, we implicitly select MVs that may already be highly correlated with other MVs that are not included as predictors. In other words, the model has indirect access to information not explicitly present as predictors. Essentially, we select the minimum number of MVs that well represent the large-scale meteorological co-variations in order to avoid overfitting. This explains why some seemingly important cloud controlling factors, e.g., surface winds, are not included in the predictors.</p><p>The choice of rCRE instead of cloud radiative effect (CRE), is to enable attribution of the radiative effect to low clouds only, instead of all clouds, without the confounding effects of solar angle or surface albedo. rCRE, originally introduced as effective cloud albedo, is essentially the effect of cloud on the shortwave radiation received at surface, (i.e., 1\u2013transmittance), calculated as,where  denotes net SW fluxes at the surface, all denotes all sky, and clr denotes clear sky. As cloud absorption is generally much smaller than cloud albedo, Eq.  can be further reduced towhere fcld and Acld denote cloud fraction and cloud albedo. rCRE for low clouds is calculated by replacing fcld and Acld with LCF and Ac, which are obtained from monthly gridded Clouds and the Earth\u2019s Radiant Energy System (CERES) Flux By Cloud Type (FBCT) ed. 4.1 product, where TOA radiative fluxes are binned into 7 cloud effective pressure and 6 cloud optical depth bins. Liquid-cloud areal fraction from the lowest two pressure bins (1100\u2013680 hPa), including all optical depth bins, are summed to obtain LCF, and the shortwave (SW) cloud albedo in these bins are averaged by weighting by their liquid-cloud areal fraction to obtain Ac.</p><p>Daily gridded Nd estimates from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), are calculated using the level-2 3.7- cloud optical depth () and effective radius () retrievals. This is an extended version of ref.  to include years after 2020. The MODIS Nd estimates can be biased when the scene includes multi-layer or broken cloud fields, sufficiently small  or re, inhomogeneous sub-pixels, or high solar zenith angle. Therefore, we further apply the G18 sampling in ref.  to avoid these potentially biased cases. Daily values of Nd are averaged across the satellite platforms (i.e., between Terra and Aqua) over 1-month periods, weighted by the number of available Nd retrievals after the G18 sampling.</p><p>We extract these data for oceanic grids covering the northeastern Pacific stratocumulus (NEP) region (\u2212155\u00b0 to \u2212115\u00b0 W and 10\u00b0 to 40\u00b0 N), the southeastern Pacific (SEP) stratocumulus region (\u2212100\u00b0 to \u221270\u00b0 W and \u221240\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 S), and the southeastern Atlantic (SEA) stratocumulus region (\u221215\u00b0 W to 15\u00b0 E and \u221225\u00b0 to 0\u00b0 S) for this study.</p><p>All input data, i.e., MVs, are standardized before training by removing their means and scaling to unit variance. We remove all land-affected grid points using the land-mask variable provided in the ERA5 dataset. Data covering 2003\u20132018 (inclusive) is used to train the NNs. In total, we have 532,931 data points for all 3 stratocumulus decks (trained all together), which are randomly split into 68%:17%:15% for training, validation, and testing, respectively. Training each stratocumulus region individually does not provide improvement in the NN-performance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Neural network ensemble architecture</emphasis></p><p>A densely connected feedforward NN is used in this work. It maps input variables, as a vector () containing the 8 MVs, to corresponding target variables (rCRE as the target variable, for example), using a series of operations:where  is the input vector and  indicates the activation function  for the  hidden layer. Taking the first hidden layer as an example,  is mapped to  nodes:where  is an  \u00d7 1 vector and  indicates a nonlinear function, whose weight matrix and bias vector are  and , respectively.</p><p>Supported by performance tests, we set the NN architecture to have 4 to 8 hidden layers from input to output with the number of node in each layer ranging from 15 to 44. We use the SWISH activation function for all hidden layers, which is expressed aswhere the parameter  is set to 1. Given the bounded nature of our target variables (between 0 and 1), the output layer uses the tanh activation function after variables have been transformed to between -1 and 1. We note all outputs from the NN are scaled back to the target's raw unit for the rest of the analyses, including the forcing estimate and the statistical significance testing. The NN is constructed and trained with TensorFlow v2.2 using the He uniform variance scaling initializer and the ADAM optimizer for 60 epochs at a learning rate of 10-3, which further drops to 10\u20134 if the mean squared error (MSE; used in the loss function) for validation plateaus.</p><p>We generate a 100-member NN ensemble to boost the robustness of the NN prediction and assess the uncertainty of the NN-framework. The diversity of the NN-ensemble members comes from i) the random selection of the training data (68% of all), ii) the number of hidden layers is randomly selected between 4 to 8, iii) the number of nodes in each hidden layer is randomly selected between 15 and 44, and iv) the total number of parameters ranges from 4641 to 4841. We believe this NN ensemble ensures diverse-enough training architectures, to the extent that their predictive skills are not compromised, and provides a robust uncertainty quantification of this framework. The performance of the 100-member NNE, including training, validation, and testing, is shown in Supplementary Fig. . The relatively narrow spread in the ensemble performance indicates that the input meteorological variables are well-suited and that the training data and its spatiotemporal scale are optimized for the task of predicting cloud properties at that scale, without any overfitting (Supplementary Fig. ).</p><p>Prior studies have demonstrated the existence of a climatological relationship between cloud properties (e.g., Nd and cloud fraction) and large-scale meteorological conditions,,. We here demonstrated the high skill of this 8-MVs-to-cloud-field NN model (Supplementary Fig.  and ). However, when high spatial correlations in aerosol perturbations and cloud responses exist, e.g., over the SEA owing to the alignment between the shipping route and the prevailing boundary layer wind, the NN model tends to smooth out the rather sharp gradient in Nd and rCRE in and out of the shipping lane. This creates a linear bias across the shipping lane region, particularly over the SEA. Therefore, we apply a linear bias correction to the NN model using the training and testing data samples from 2003 to 2018. The bias-corrected NN ensemble is used to predict the target variables to construct the counterfactual cloud fields for the IMO2020 impacted year (2020\u20132022).</p><p>A known issue with using NN to perform predictions given inputs variables outside the training datasets is extrapolation. Based on the two-dimensional probability density distributions of the 8-MV combinations (Supplementary Fig. ) between the training and testing time period (2003-2018, shades of gray) and the IMO2020 time period (2020\u20132022, orange contours), we conclude that the range of the input variables for predictions is within that of the training datasets, i.e., we are not extrapolating.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Definitions of perturbation-significance and perturbation-detectability</emphasis></p><p>The key message we want to convey in this study is that significant perturbations to a cloud field can be hard to detect at times due to coincident changes from other drivers (e.g., meteorological conditions). This involves a key concept, that is the detectability of a signal, which is defined differently from the significance of a signal in this work. The former assesses whether an observational record is significantly (in a statistical sense) different from a reference observational record, taking into account all potential drivers of the variability in the target, whereas the latter assesses the strength of the signal from a single driver, e.g., in our case aerosol signal from the IMO2020 regulation, all else equal. Note the detectability assessment is purely a comparison between two observational records, whereas the significance assessment is a comparison between an observational record and a counterfactual record, holding all else equal except the aerosol field.</p><p>First, we construct the counterfactual cloud field (NNEIMO) by predicting the target variables based on the exact meteorological fields of IMO2020-affected years (2020-2022), using the NNE. NNEIMO represents the aerosol-alone impact of the IMO2020 event, a business-as-usual scenario where only the aerosol field is altered. Therefore, the difference between NNEIMO and the CERES observational record during 2020-2022 (OBSIMO) indicates the impact of the IMO2020 event that abruptly and globally affected aerosol emissions, assuming other short-lived abrupt or long-term gradual changes in aerosol emissions during this time are negligible compared to the signal of IMO2020 (see Discussion). For the counterfactual values, NN ensemble members are first averaged to produce NNE-mean values for each grid at each month during 2020-2022.</p><p>The non-parametric, paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test (WSR test) is used to test if OBSIMO (3-year time series) is significantly different from NNEIMO (3-year time series), evaluating the significance of the aerosol signal due to IMO2020. The WSR test is selected for this task because (i) it does not assume an underlying probability distribution of the target variables, and (ii) it includes temporal information in the test (i.e., a paired test), which fits better in the context of aerosol-cloud interactions given that cloud susceptibility to aerosol perturbations varies seasonally in response to the seasonality in large-scale meteorological conditions,.</p><p>Next, we evaluate if a there is a detectable difference, in the observational record, post- and pre- IMO2020 (OBSIMO versus OBSpre-IMO), including the impact from all cloud variability drivers, using the WSR test. Since the WSR test is a paired test, we need to construct a 3-year time series to use as the pre-IMO2020 reference record. An obvious choice is the 3-year period that immediately proceeds the IMO2020 event (2017\u20132019). This 2017\u20132019 time period is used to produce the results shown in Fig. 4. We also explored the dependence of the IMO2020 detectability on the number of years that goes into the construction of the 3-year pre-IMO2020 record by averaging every 3-year periods that proceed 2020 with an 1-year interval. Essentially, the first pre-IMO2020 record is simply the 2017\u20132019 record, the second is the average between 2016\u20132018 and 2017\u20132019, the third is the average across 2015\u20132017, 2016\u20132018, and 2017\u20132019, and so on. In total, 15 3-year pre-IMO2020 records are constructed and used to produce the results shown in Fig. 5, with the 15th being the average across 2003\u20132005, ..., and 2017\u20132019.</p><p>Statistical significance based on the WSR test is established at the 95% confidence interval (CI), or P-value less than 0.05. Two tests, OBSIMO versus NNEIMO (examining the significance of the aerosol signal) and OBSIMO versus OBSpre-IMO (examining whether the observational records are different after and before IMO2020), yield four possible outcomes (Fig. 3): (i) true detection\u2014when the aerosol signal is significant while pre- and post-IMO2020 observational records are different, (ii) no detection\u2014when neither the aerosol signal is significant nor the two observational records are different, (iii) missed detection\u2014when the aerosol signal is significant while the post-IMO2020 record is indifferent from the pre-IMO2020 record, and (iv) false detection\u2014when the post-IMO2020 record is different from the pre-IMO2020 record while the aerosol signal is insignificant. The latter two scenarios can be attributed to the influence of natural variability driven by changes in the meteorological conditions, where natural variability is either falsely taken as a perturbation (when the aerosol signal is weak) or strong enough to obscure a significant aerosol signal. The similarity between these four outcomes and the outcomes of a binary classifier (i.e., true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative) enables us to construct the equivalent confusion matrix and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve in Fig. 5. In our case, true detection rate is the fraction of significant IMO2020 (aerosol-induced) perturbation being detected and false detection rate is the fraction of insignificant IMO2020 (aerosol-induced) perturbation being detected.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Radiative forcing and susceptibility calculations</emphasis></p><p>Perturbations in rCRE, LCF and Ac are translated into perturbations in shortwave radiation at the top-of-atmosphere (\u0394SWTOA) usingwhere SWin|lon,lat,mounth denotes incoming solar radiation at a given longitude, latitude and month and angle brackets indicate temporal averaging.

You are less likely to have heard of Cop16, the international summit onbiodiversity. It <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.cgtn.com/news/2024-11-02/COP16-concludes-with-three-major-agreements-1ycThecplZK/p.html\">wrapped up two days ago</url>  but has barely scraped thenews agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lack of interest in Cop16 extended even to the participants. A whopping <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/15/about-80-percent-countries-fail-submit-plans-preserve-nature-ahead-cop16-aoe#:~:text=About%2080%25%20of%20countries%20fail,nature%20ahead%20of%20global%20summit&amp;text=Cop16,The%20Guardian\">80%of countries</url>  failed to submit plans for meeting a landmark UN nature agreement at the conference, as they had promised to do. Even Colombia, which hosted Cop16, missed the deadline. And, as the summit wore on, representatives noticed with mounting alarm a \u201clack of concrete progress\u201d on any of the major targets they had set themselves.</p><p>It\u2019s not as if the mass depletion of nature isn\u2019t an urgent problem. Since 1970, wildlife populations have declined on average by 73%. Since 2015, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ifaw.org/uk/journal/18-animals-recently-extinct\">we have lost a number of species forever</url> : the golden toad, the Pinta giant tortoise, the mountain mist frog, several bats and birds. We heard at Cop16 that <url normalizedValue=\"https://iucn.org/press-release/202410/species-experts-meeting-concludes-declaration-saving-species-integral-0\">46,000 species face extinction</url> , including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c24558g69mgo\">more than a third of the planet\u2019s trees</url>. </p><p>But as woods empty of wildlife, coral reefs ossify and the wind howls through wastelands that used to be rainforests, the focus of governments, environmentalists and industry has become lopsided. Climate change sucks up all the attention. Nature loss loses. The world has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2024/oct/31/alarm-grows-over-disturbing-lack-of-progress-revealed-at-biodiversity-summit-cop16\">never met a single target</url>  to stem the destruction of wildlife.</p><p>Contrast, for example, the politics of the two Cops in Britain. When in 2022 the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, announced that he would not be attending Cop27, a public backlash <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-63484971\">forced him to change his mind</url>.  Another outcry followed his progress at Cop28, at which he deigned to appear for the span of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-rishi-sunak-criticism-half-day-cop-28-visit-king-charles/\">half a day</url>.  But there is next to no pressure for prime ministers to turn up at the biodiversity conference. This time Britain was represented by a \u201cnature envoy\u201d, appointed to the role \u2013 hastily perhaps \u2013 just one day before Cop16started.</p><p>The trend stretches back decades. It can be traced, I think, to the 1980s and early 1990s, when environmental movements shifted priorities. They largely stopped talking about saving whales, pandas or the rainforests, and started talking about degrees in temperature. \u201cGlobal warming\u201d \u2013 now \u201cclimate change\u201d \u2013 became the headline message. The shift continues. There is up to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/ecology-and-evolution/articles/10.3389/fevo.2017.00175/full\">eight times more media coverage</url>  of the climate crisis than of biodiversity loss. Are we making the right choice here? Does this matter? You could argue that the problems are so closely linked that it doesn\u2019t. As the planet warms, scientists predict a series of \u201cextinction cliffs\u201d, where a small change in temperature will wipe out entire ecosystems: we can\u2019t save the animals without dealing with the warming planet. But then you can\u2019t halt climate change without the help of nature, either. Forests, wetlands and oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Trees reduce flooding and cool the surrounding areas. Lose them, and we lose the fight.</p><p>But here\u2019s the main problem with the narrow focus on degrees in temperature that characterises the way we now talk about saving the planet: it is clean and precise, but it\u2019s also far too abstract.</p><p>When you are trying to generate enough emotive power to shift the habits of every nation on the planet, this matters. Our sterile mathematical approach lacks visceral pull. We should talk far more about the human cost of climate change, which dry statistics often miss. Last week, for example, Valencia in Spain experienced deadly flooding, which scientists have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/oct/31/why-were-the-floods-in-spain-so-bad-a-visual-guide\">linked with rising temperatures</url>.  And we should also talk about animals. <url normalizedValue=\"https://savethewhales.org/\">Save the Whales</url>  was one of the best known and most successful conservation campaigns ever run. Why? It had a charismatic creature on every badge and poster.</p><p>This is one of three problems with our choice to focus on numbers. The second is that statistics on global warming can be hard to grasp. It is difficult to picture exactlywhat the 0.2C increase in average temperatures \u2013 reported to be happening every decade \u2013 really means. It also sounds rather small: after all, we are used to much bigger fluctuations throughout a single day. But averages miss the fact that bigger shifts are happening at the extremes.</p><p>The third is that a focus on climate change and the \u201ctwo degree threshold\u201d \u2013 the point at which irreversible tipping points are to be reached \u2013 also places the problem somewhere in the future. When we discuss global warming we tend to talk as if the effects are yet to come. But the damage is happening now.</p><p>Part of the solution is to pay more attention to the real-time danger we are facing around the planet. When we talk about climate change we should talk in terms of deaths and human risk. This would make it easier to visualise and also offer a sharper sense of urgency. People respond better to an emergency: people trapped in the Australian <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/bushfires\">bushfires</url> , or dying from heat exhaustion \u2013 than a large and long-rolling crisis.</p><p>And we should also talk about nature. We care about animals \u2013 perhaps, in Britain at least, to an unreasonable degree. We are, after all, the nation that flew cats and dogs out of Kabul in August 2021 as the Taliban terrorised the city. In September, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/domestic-abuse-donkey-charity-funding-b2607499.html#\">a British donkey charity was reported</url>  to have received more donations in a single year than our four leading domestic abuse charities combined. Could we not be making better use of this rather pathological empathy we have for furry creatures?</p><p>Then, too, what is often missing from environmental campaigns is a hope for the future. Doom and gloom cause people to switch off. But nature is surprisingly resilient, and rebounds if given half a chance.What if movements led with a positive vision of clear water, cleanair and birdsong?</p><p> Martha Gill is an Observer columnist</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-106738559</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DB9-NR31-JBNF-W1NT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"967\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer (archive from the Guardian)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 3, 2024 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Partnership (ASBP) on research into seed germination, in support which builds on a long relationship to conserve the country's plant life.</p><p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the package of UK support, alongside Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne, during a visit to Australia.</p><p>The support also includes collaboration between the UK and Australian space agencies on preparedness, response and mitigation measures to fight wildfires.</p><p>Mr Raab and Ms Payne are travelling to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service headquarters on Friday to meet those involved in responding to the devastating fires.</p><p>Fires across southern Australia have claimed at least 33 lives since September, destroyed more than 3,000 homes and razed more than 10.6 million hectares (26.2 million acres) of land.</p><p>Kew has been working in collaboration with Australian seed banks since 2000.</p><p>Some 12,450 seed collections of 8,900 Australian species - which are stored in local seed banks - have been duplicated and stored in Kew's Millennium Seed Bank in Wakehurst, Sussex, as a back-up to the domestic stores.</p><p>Banked seeds can be used for research and conservation, and for growing a new generation of plants in the future, the experts said.</p><p>Mr Raab said: ``This further collaboration between the Australian Seed Bank Partnership and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, will help protect Australia's precious biodiversity following the terrible bushfires.</p><p>``We stand shoulder to shoulder with the Australian people in the face of this challenge.''</p><p>Dr Elinor Breman, senior researcher at Kew's Millennium Seed Bank, said: ``We offered our assistance with the emergency response to the bushfires and are pleased to be able to support their efforts, as part of our ongoing partnership to address biodiversity loss through seed-banking in Australia.</p><p>``Kew's scientists will work with the ASBP to conduct emergency seed collecting in areas devastated by the bushfires and longer-term germination research, which will hopefully aid the international effort to restore habitats more quickly in this precious and biodiverse region.''

I'm so proud of her.\"<br/><br/>The Australian bushfires have killed at least 30 people and hundreds of millions of animals have also died as the fires have spread across more than 10 million hectares of land.<br/><br/>Recent conditions have improved the situation, as some much-needed rain arrived to quell some of the fires.<br/><br/>Mrs Nightingale, head of Year 3 and 4 at Amy's school, said: \"We are all incredibly proud of Amy. She was so moved by the scenes in Australia that she wanted to do something to help and came up independently with this simple, yet hugely effective fundraising idea.<br/><br/>\"The impact of her words written on a small jar have had a huge effect and the response from staff, parents and pupils has been astounding! <br/><br/>\"One pupil, having read her message, said 'Amy has really inspired me to help.' I know that everyone else feels the same.\"<br/><br/>Amy will be donating the money equally to three charities: Wildlife Victoria, Red Cross Disaster Recovery and Relief and Country Fire Authority.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WELHAT-84326076</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WELHAT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y38-6J41-F0YS-02PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">380782</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Archant Regional Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Welwyn &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">When wildlife artist Emily Rose heard about the devastating impact of the Australian bushfires on millions of mammals, reptiles and birds, she was desperate to do something to help. <br/><br/>So, inspired by videos of koalas being rescued by volunteers, she put her creative talents to good use, producing a painting of one of the cuddly creatures to be auctioned off in aid of the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). </p><p><br/><br/>\"It was just awful,\" the former Sheringham High School student said. \"The burns, the koalas' expressions of bewilderment, their helplessness and their thirst was terrible.\" <br/><br/>Chatting to her great aunt, who lives in Australia, Ms Rose, 23, also heard about the black ash covering houses along the coastline.<br/><br/>\"I have visited in the past few years and knowing the places which are being burnt away somehow makes it more real,\" she said.<br/><br/>According to WWF estimates, 1.25 billion animals have been killed by the fires, with millions more injured or homeless. <br/><br/>Around 30pc of the koala population of the southern coast of New South Wales has been lost, with many other animals including wombats, wallabies, kookaburras and echidnas also either burnt to death, injured or at risk of dying from lack of food and shelter. <br/><br/>Ms Rose, who juggles producing her own work with running workshops and painting courses, studied fine art at Lincoln University before setting up her own business working from a studio in her parents' West Runton garden.<br/><br/>An animal-lover since childhood, she said that the \"unfairness\" of the Australian animals' plight prompted her to to do something to help, adding: \"We have inflicted much of these extreme changes, but we cannot explain it to the wildlife that are on the front line, so that was why I chose the WWF who, along with many other charities, are helping to rescue the animals and will help to rebuild their habitats after the fires.\" <br/><br/>Ms Rose's koala painting was sold via an online auction and, with more than 200 people entering a raffle for a second picture, of a kookaburra, she raised a total of \u00a3440. <br/><br/>\"By chance, the painting was won by my uncle, but he has suggested it gets re-donated to raise more money,\" she said. \"I have family in who have a a gallery in Australia, so I'm hoping they will auction and continue raising funds there.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The disaster saw 25 people die and thousands made homeless.</p><p>Then, last year they ran the Cardiff Half Marathon with the OSA run club.

Any group of individuals who can look at those figures and continue to deny global warming and climate change are real issues are equivalent to those people who still insist that the world is flat.</p><p>``And yet, sadly, these individuals include the current president of the United States, Donald Trump, the current president of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, and - I say this with great regret, given what his country is currently experiencing - the prime minister of Australia, Scott Morrison.''</p><p>Mr Hamilton said it is ``bitterly sad'' that these three leaders have all seen fires in their countries recently but have failed to act, adding that the question everyone must face is ``how we keep the Paris Agreement on track and how we stop our world reaching the point of no return on global warming''.</p><p>Australian-born SNP MP Deirdre Brock asked why the UK Government is not taking ``urgent action'' to tackle climate change.</p><p>``In short, if the Government wants to do something about the fires in Australia and the Arctic and in England's moors in years to come, it must do something now about the climate emergency,'' she said.</p><p>Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement: ``Australia is one of our strongest and oldest friends and we are utterly distraught about the devastation caused by these catastrophic bushfires - including the tragic loss of life and of precious biodiversity.</p><p>``Despite being on opposite sides of the world, our bond is a close one, and we will do all that is possible to help them respond to and recover from this tragic situation.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PANEWS-HSA0750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PANEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY4-YG11-DYTG-N03D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8170</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"631\"/><timeReceived>1:35 PM BST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Press Association Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Press Association Mediapoint</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"31563\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

devastation caused by the five-month disaster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trent Waterhouse, who made 82 appearances for the Wire, returned to his homeland in 2014.</p><p>He joined the fire service in 2018 and is based at Pyrmont Fire Station in central Sydney.</p><p>Trent, aged 39, said: \"I love the job, it is always something I wanted to do at the end of my rugby career.</p><p>\"The camaraderie with the boys is great and just the same as that on the pitch with the rugby teams.</p><p>\"The fire started up north at the beginning of summer and just keeps spreading.</p><p>Trent Waterhouse</p><p>\"We have had no periods of significant rain for three years in New South Wales so the ground is really dry.</p><p>\"It is finally forecast to rain on Thursday until Tuesday so that should help us massively.</p><p>\"I've never seen anything like it in my life - thousands of homes have been destroyed and 27 people have died.\"</p><p>Around 500 million animals are also thought to have died in the fires including koalas, kangaroos, cows and wallabies.</p><p>Trent said: \"It is hard to fathom the amount of animals that have died.</p><p>\"It has been devastating for koalas.</p><p>\"The air has been really smokey throughout summer.\"</p><p>Trent's fire station has been sent out of the city to work on the bushfires and when the firefighters are not on shift, they have been volunteering to do overtime.</p><p>He added: \"We have been able to help so many people which is great but there are some houses which just could not be saved.</p><p>\"The extremely dry land has made it a perfect storm for the fires to spread.</p><p>\"It can get pretty hairy when you are close to the fires, one driver died recently when his fire truck got caught in a mini tornado.</p><p>\"In the day, you can see trees falling but once it gets dark you just have to listen out for those dangers.</p><p>\"It has been scary, a lot of places look like a nuclear bomb has gone off , like something out of a movie.\"</p><p>Trent praised the work of animal sanctuaries who are working relentlessly to treat badly injured wildlife.</p><p>He also paid tribute to Warrington Wolves for the release of a training shirt that will help raise money for the Australian Red Cross.</p><p>He added: \"It has been great to see people from all over pull together to help us.</p><p>\"I want to say thank you to Warrington Wolves for the shirt release, what they have done is much appreciated by all of us.\"</p><p>Trent pulled on the primrose and blue for three seasons, after signing from Australian NRL club Penrith Panthers.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2014, the Kangaroos international back-row forward scored 19 tries.</p><p>He was in the Wire side that beat Leeds Rhinos in the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley in 2012, and featured in the club's maiden Super League Grand Final appearance also against Leeds\u00a0at Old Trafford in 2012.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I felt this need to do something. Everyone else was doing things in their own way and I had to do something in my way,' Warne told media in January 2020 about his decision to sell the cap.<br/><br/>Shane Warne was amazed when his Baggy Green eventually sold at auction for just over $ 1 million - all of which was donated to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund.<br/>The cap was bought by Commonwealth Bank's chief executive, Matt Comyn, on behalf of the bank.<br/><br/>Mr Comyn said he was delighted the bank had secured the cherished Baggy Green and commended Shane Warne for putting his cap up for auction.<br/><br/>'He has demonstrated the same Aussie spirit we are seeing across the country with acts of generosity and dedication throughout this disaster as communities rally to support each other,' Mr Comyn said in January 2020.<br/><br/>After acquiring the Baggy Green, the bank took the cap on a fundraising tour across the country before retiring it as a permanent exhibit at the Bowral-based Bradman Museum in August 2020.<br/><br/>Over a period of six months, the baggy green visited schools, cricket clubs, and community centres. It even made an appearance at the Australian Women's Cricket Final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on International Women's Day in 2020.<br/><br/>On 27 August, Sir Donald Bradman's Birthday, the cap joined a collection of thirty baggy greens dating back to the 1800's to present day at the Bradman Museum.<br/><br/>After officially handing Warnie's Baggy Green to the Bradman Museum at their opening ceremony, CBA Chief Executive Officer, Matt Comyn, said: 'Once again we see the power of the Baggy Green to inspire and lift our nation.<br/><br/>'Even though our tour of the cap was cut short due to coronavirus, through the Bank's contributions to disaster relief and the support of our customers, we contributed close to $ 20 million to support the community over the past financial year.'<br/><br/>In addition to the purchase of Shane Warne's Baggy Green cap, throughout 2020 the bank delivered 213 grants to organisations across Australia that were adversely impacted by the bushfires through its Bushfire Recovery Grants program.<br/><br/>The bank and its customers also donated in excess of $ 4 million to the Australian Red Cross, and raised over $ 350,000 via the 'Fiver4Fires' National Staff Fundraising Day.<br/><br/>Commonwealth Bank's Head of Community Investment, Nathan Barker, said the bank was proud to be able to help organisations and communities impacted by the 2019/2020 bushfires.<br/><br/>'2020 was a tough for year for so many Australians in more ways than one, and we wanted to do whatever we could to ensure 2021 is a brighter and better year,' he said.<br/><br/>To commemorate 12 months following Australia's devastating bushfires, over the coming weeks and months CBA Newsroom will share some of the stories of hope and optimism that the bank was privy to through our Bushfire Recovery Grants program.<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61PT-V6G1-JD3Y-Y32D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 8, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This concern hinges on previous occurrences of extreme events with very large fiscal and financial costs (for example, hurricanes Katrina and Harvey, 2020 South Asian floods and Australian bushfires of 2019\u20132020 (ref. ) had costs on the order of US$100 billion), projections of increasing intensity and frequency of extreme events under climate change and theoretical analysis emphasizing that the most relevant economic and financial impacts of climate change might come from tail events, \u2013.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An accurate assessment of climate physical risk is thus fundamental for global financial risk management. Such an assessment requires the identification of the hazards that are the main sources of risk in an area, of the assets located in the area (that is, geolocated production facilities) and of the economic actors that own these assets and are thus exposed to the risk. Furthermore, one needs to identify the mechanisms through which economic impacts translate into financial risks and affect financial asset valuation.</p><p>The existing literature provides a very partial mapping of these risks, focusing on specific hazards, markets and geographies, , \u2013 or deriving aggregate measures of risk from macro-economic assessment of impacts. In finance, most analyses focus on past occurrences of hazards, thus neglecting future climate change. The financial industry relies on aggregate risk scores that often lack granularity, transparency or consistency. Hence, the link between a granular assessment of climate impacts and the valuation of financial assets is missing in the literature.</p><p>The main contribution of this Analysis is to fill this methodological gap by proposing a structural model for the valuation of climate financial risks. Our model assesses climate financial impacts from the bottom up by (1) geolocating the production facilities underlying a portfolio of financial assets, (2) sampling trajectories of climate-related hazards at the corresponding locations, (3) assessing impacts on production facilities through capital destruction and business interruption, (4) inferring resulting impacts on the cash flow and the balance sheet of firms and (5) deriving therefrom the risk of default and the value of the financial assets of the issuer.</p><p>Our framework introduces several new features. It enables the identification of key hazards driving climate-related financial risks, their spatial and economic transmission channels and their quantitative impacts on financial assets. In addition, it facilitates the assessment of the marginal contributions of specific hazards, economic sectors and geographic regions to the overall risk of a financial portfolio. The framework supports risk computation at the firm level (for example, through the probability of default) as well as the estimation of regulatory-relevant risk measures at the portfolio level, such as value at risk (VaR). Moreover, it provides capabilities for scenario-contingent valuation of financial assets, aligning with the requirements outlined by financial regulators, \u2013.</p><p>We apply our model to the assessment of risks on a universe of financial assets representing over 80% of global equity markets. Our analysis identifies the combinations of hazards, geographical locations and economic sectors that are the main drivers of risk. It maps the transmission of impacts from economics production units to financial assets and hence highlights the importance of cross-border risks. Overall, our findings matter for the design of adequate risk management strategies and targeted adaptation policies.</p><p>Results</p><p>We focus on a set of firms representative of global market capitalization, that is the MSCI all countries world index (ACWI). The index consists of 2,934 firms from 23 developed markets and 24 emerging markets covering approximately 85% of the global investable equity opportunity set.</p><p>Firms and their geolocated production facilities</p><p>To mitigate potential geographical bias in the composition of the index, we normalize portfolio weights proportionally to total market capitalization by country. We geolocate the production facilities of all firms in the index and assign to each facility a share of the revenues and of the productive capital of the firm (). This defines a set N of 129,721 production facilities characterized by their geolocation, their revenue, their productive capital stock and their industrial sector. The productive capital stock of each firm is further partitioned between tangible capital, which is exposed to natural hazards, and intangible capital, which is not directly exposed to natural hazards.</p><p>Climate hazard trajectories</p><p>To proceed with the scenario-contingent valuation of the financial assets (equity and corporate bonds) issued by the firms, we consider a climate scenario S (representative concentration pathways (RCPs); see ) and a time interval [0, T] where 0 is the valuation time and T the time horizon. We consider the following set of climate-related extreme events: coastal and river floods, tropical and winter storms, landslides and wildfires. Each type of extreme is characterized by scenario and time-dependent distributions of intensity at each location. By repeatedly drawing from these distributions, we generate samples of trajectories of hazards at each productive location (). Such trajectories are characterized at each productive location and each date by flood depth for river and coastal flooding, maximum wind gust for tropical and winter storms, and a binary indicator of occurrence for wildfires or landslides. Vulnerability metrics then allow us to infer for each productive location, each date, each scenario and each hazard the share of tangible capital destroyed. In the following, we shall investigate the cumulative impact of hazards as well as the individual contribution of each type of hazard to the aggregate impact. Our default assumption is that the cumulative impact at a given date and location is determined by the hazard with the largest magnitude. Note that the co-occurrence of multiple hazards at a given date and location being rare, the alternative assumption that impacts cumulate additively yields similar results (Supplementary Information ).</p><p>On the basis of the share of tangible capital destroyed, we determine the share of total capital destroyed and the extent of business interruption measured as the share of the year for which business is interrupted at a production facility. Total capital destroyed depends on the share of tangible capital at the production facility, which we determine using sectoral averages from the EU KLEMS (capital, labour, energy, materials and service) database. To determine the extent of business interruption, we use the vulnerability metrics developed in ref. , which provide sector-specific correspondence tables between the share of capital destroyed and the number of business interruption days (details in ).</p><p>A structural credit-risk model for climate impact valuation</p><p>We develop a structural climate credit-risk model, CLIMACRED-PHYS, that provides climate scenario-contingent valuation of the financial assets issued by a firm (details in ). In each scenario, the realization of climate impacts induces capital destruction and business interruptions for the firm. The magnitude of these impacts is stochastic and depends on the location of the firm\u2019s production facilities and its type of activity. CLIMACRED-PHYS provides a micro-economic representation of these impacts on the production and capital accumulation process. It infers therefrom impacts on the financial structure of the firm (assets and liabilities), on its probability of default and on the value of the securities it issues (bonds and equities). The model allows us to identify the channels through which climate impacts affect financial asset valuation. First, the destruction of productive capital diminishes the assets of the firm and increases its debt because of reconstruction costs. This increases the probability of default and decreases the net worth at maturity. Second, business interruptions reduce the cash flow of the firm. This negatively impacts capital accumulation, self-financing capacity and dividends distributed. Eventually, both effects negatively impact the value of bonds and equities.</p><p>Financial impacts of climate change</p><p>We empirically investigate the financial impact of physical risks on portfolios of bonds and equities invested in the MSCI ACWI, proportionally to market capitalization. The index is representative of global market capitalization. Thus, the impacts of physical risks on the corresponding portfolios can be considered as representative of the impacts on global financial markets. The magnitude of physical risks depends on the extent of anthropogenic climate change. In this respect, uncertainty about future climate policies and socioeconomic dynamics induces uncertainty about the magnitude of future human-related forcing and thus of physical risks. This uncertainty is usually captured by considering a set of RCP. These pathways describe future GHG concentrations and are labelled according to the corresponding radiative forcing in the year 2100: RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6 and RCP 8.5 (2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5 W m\u20132, respectively). Increasing radiative forcing, over time and across pathways, corresponds to increasing the range of global warming (Supplementary Table ). Here we consider three climate scenarios: (1) a \u2018current\u2019 scenario corresponding to current climate conditions, based on RCP 2.6 projections in 2020, (2) a high-end scenario corresponding to RCP 8.5 at 2080 and (3) an intermediary scenario corresponding to RCP 6.0 at 2050, which is the one for which we report results.</p><p>We first investigate the magnitude of economic impacts in terms of (1) share of capital lost and (2) number of days of business interruptions induced by climate-related hazards. At the aggregate level, in the current scenario (RCP 2.6), we find that the mean impact of hazards amounts to the yearly destruction of 1.9% of productive capital and 2.68 days of business interruptions. The 99th percentile of the distribution amounts to a destruction of 3.34% of productive capital and 4.89 days of business interruption at the portfolio level (Table ). The potential occurrence of very large events and the geographical concentration of production facilities lead to the presence of a non-negligible mass in the tail of the distribution of impacts across firms. Accordingly, certain realizations of hazards lead to the complete destruction of certain production facilities (Supplementary Fig. ).</p><p>Descriptive statistics of the impact distribution by type of hazards and climate scenarios</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"8\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Scenario</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Hazard</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Tropical cyclone</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Winter storm</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Coastal flood</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">River flood</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Wildfire</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">Compound</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Destroyed capital (%)RCP 2.6 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean99th pctile</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.632.10</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.180.27</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.480.56</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.450.54</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.170.35</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">1.873.34</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of interruption daysRCP 2.6 2020</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean99th percentile</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.013.25</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.240.36</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.690.89</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.200.76</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.200.74</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">2.714.89</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Destroyed capital (%)RCP 6.0 2050</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean99th pctile</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.682.29</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.200.29</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.690.81</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.540.64</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.170.35</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">2.223.80</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of interruption daysRCP 6.0 2050</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean99th percentile</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.093.37</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.250.39</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.071.41</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.770.89</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.200.74</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">3.275.43</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Destroyed capital (%)RCP 8.5 2080</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean99th pctile</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.952.65</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.230.35</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.760.90</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.590.69</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.170.35</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">2.624.32</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Number of interruption daysRCP 8.5 2080</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean99th percentile</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1.523.86</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.300.46</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.181.53</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.830.95</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.200.74</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">3.886.14</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Productive capital destroyed is measured in percentage of total capital destroyed per year. Days of business interruption are measured in number of days per year.</p><p>As for the drivers of impacts, at the aggregate level, the most material hazards are, by order of importance, tropical cyclones, coastal floods, river floods, winter storms and wildfires (Table ). Landslides do not appear material in our setting and are thus not reported in the remainder of this Analysis. We also observe that the magnitude of impact increases with the severity of the climate scenario (Table ). In the high-end scenario, we observe an increase of approximately 40% of the average impact and of approximately 30% of the 99th percentile of impacts, with respect to the current scenario. This increase is driven mainly by tropical cyclones and coastal flooding.</p><p>The aggregate results are explained by the geographical distribution of exposure and impacts (Table  and Supplementary Fig. ). North America and eastern Asia appear as the main sources of exposure in terms of value of capital, followed by western and northern Europe. The intensity of risk is particularly high in eastern and southern Asia due to the relative importance of impacts from tropical cyclones and coastal floods in these areas. The combination of high exposure in terms of capital and large impacts from tropical cyclones in eastern Asia represents a key source of risk. Wildfires also are a substantial source of risk in the area between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0 N latitude.</p><p>Summary table about the regional distribution of value and impacts</p><p><table><tgroup

the percentage of global capital located in the region. \u2018Impacts share\u2019 is the percentage of impacts affecting the region (considering the mean of impacts across simulations). \u2018Impact-to-value ratio\u2019 is the ratio of share of value over the share of impact: a ratio above (below) 1 indicates that capital in the region is more (less) impacted than the average. \u2018Tropical cyclone impacts\u2019 to \u2018compound impacts\u2019 provide a measure of the intensity of risk per hazard and region corresponding to the ratio between the value of impacts and that of exposed capital.</p><p>We then investigate the impact of climate-induced shocks on financial asset valuation using our structural valuation model. We consider aggregate impacts at the portfolio level for equity and (1 year) bonds, for the three climate scenarios considered in the preceding.</p><p>Beyond the climate scenario and the time horizon, key determinants of financial impact are the financial structure and the economic behaviour of the firm. We calibrate key financial characteristics of the firms, including debt-to-capital ratio, profit margin and dividend rate using average sectoral values from ref. . We also set by default the target growth rate of the firm so that, in expectation, the debt-to-capital ratio remains constant. We then parameterize the level of risk through the baseline probability of default pdbau, that is, the probability of default in absence of climate impacts (see  for details on the calibration).</p><p>In this setting, we first investigate impacts on equity and bonds for varying levels of risk under the intermediary climate scenario. We report the expected loss and the VaR (the 99th percentile of the loss distribution) at the aggregate level for a portfolio of bonds and equity based on the MSCI ACWI universe (Table ). These results shall first be compared with the magnitude of direct impacts, which amount to a mean loss of 2.22% and a 99th percentile loss of 3.8% for physical capital (see RCP 6.0 results in Table ). We observe a substantial amplification of losses for financial assets, with the mean loss on bonds ranging between 1.54% and 3.68% and the mean loss on equity ranging between 10.12% and 12.88%. We also observe an increase in the impact on financial assets with the increase in the baseline level of risk and more acute amplification in the tail of the distributions, as the VaR ranges from 3.19% to 8.24% for the portfolio of bonds and from 13.78% to 17.36% for the portfolio of equities. Since equity serves as a risk buffer for the firm and its creditors, impacts on equity are larger than impacts on bonds. The distribution of losses over the bond and equity portfolios highlights these differences (Fig. ). One observes a substantial mass in the tail of both distributions, more prominently for the equity distribution, with climate impacts potentially wiping out completely some issuers\u2019 equity for specific climate realizations.</p><p>Summary table of total financial impacts</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Baseline pd (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Mean bond loss (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">VaR bond (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Mean equity loss (%)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">VaR equity (%)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0.15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3.68</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.24</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">12.88</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">17.36</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0.05</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.36</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5.61</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">10.69</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">14.53</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">0.02</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.54</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.90</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">10.12</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">13.78</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Values correspond to percentage of mean losses and of the VaR at the 99th percentile over 1,000 climate realizations for portfolios of bonds and equities built on the MSCI ACWI universe reweighted proportionally to country-level market capitalization.

Values correspond to the 99th percentile of impact.</p><p>Our results\u2014when the valuation contingent to a climate scenario is compared with a baseline without climate-related impacts\u2014shall be interpreted as the change in the valuation of an investor\u2019s financial assets between an assessment where climate impacts are not accounted for and one where they are accounted for on the basis of a forward-looking assessment of the distribution of impacts. To account specifically for the potential impacts of climate change, one shall rather compare outcomes in the intermediary and high-end scenarios with outcomes in the current scenario (based on current climatic conditions). The corresponding results shall be interpreted as the changes in the valuation of financial assets between a financial risk assessment based on current climate impacts and one based on future climate impacts (a scenario counterfactual to the current situation). The results show that the potential impacts of climate change are important. In particular, in the high-end scenario (Supplementary Table ), the additional loss with respect to the current scenario can reach up to 3% for the equity portfolio and 80 basis points for the bond portfolio.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>Our analysis provides an assessment of climate-related physical risks for financial markets at the global scale. In an adverse context where the baseline level of risk is large, the climate VaR at the 99th percentile on a portfolio representative of global equity market reaches up to 15% of market capitalization. This VaR quantifies the change in valuation with respect to a scenario without climate impacts. Its computation is based on direct climate impacts only and thus neglects possible amplifications of losses arising from feedback loops between the real economy and the financial sector. The magnitude of these direct impacts nevertheless hints at a potential systemic impact of climate physical risks, in particular if they compound with a high level of baseline risk.</p><p>Our findings are driven by the amplification of economic risks through the financial leverage of the firms (the ratio of total assets over equity). The equity amplification ratio, that is, the ratio between financial loss and the direct impact on productive capital, ranges between 1 and 5, depending on the value of leverage across the firms. This is consistent with previous analyses focusing specifically on the case of flood risk and with the top-down estimates provided in ref. . Our findings also suggest that financial amplification ratios are consistently larger than economic amplification ratios (the ratio of overall production losses over the direct economic losses) for which existing estimates range between 1 and 2 (ref. ).</p><p>Furthermore, our results on the increase in financial risks with climate change imply that a mispricing of climate risk by financial markets arises if investors assess physical risks in a backward-looking manner and under an assumption of stationarity (as the literature suggests they do; see ).</p><p>In terms of the distribution of financial risk across issuers, we identify the existence of high-risk firms whose equity value could be completely wiped out for certain climate realizations. Nevertheless, there is substantial averaging out of impacts for large diversified portfolios so that tails are much thinner for the distribution of impacts at the aggregate portfolio level.</p><p>As for the geographical distribution of risk, we observe large direct risks in Asia stemming from the exposure of industrial facilities to storm and flood hazards. A substantial share of this risk is exported, notably to European companies whose portfolios of production facilities appear more globalized. The ratio between impact on equity and direct impacts is thus particularly high for European companies. These results emphasize, on the one hand, the importance of cross-boundary climate risks and, on the other hand, the role of financial markets in the propagation of climate physical risks.</p><p>These results echo the findings in ref.  where major net transfers of stranded assets and transition risks from companies operating fossil-fuel assets in producing countries to ultimate owners in developed economies have been identified. Our results also confirm the importance of carrying out climate physical risk assessments using a bottom-up, asset-level approach instead of relying on aggregate scores or country-based averages. Our results appear robust to alternative data collection methods () and for a range of financial characteristics as far as VaR is concerned (Table ). We have also assessed the robustness of our approach to changes in firms\u2019 investment behaviour and to alternative assumptions about the compounding of climate hazards (Supplementary Information ).</p><p>At this stage, an important limitation of our empirical analysis is that we neglect correlations across hazards and across space (beyond the resolution of climate model grid cells or storm trajectories). In this respect, our risk estimates regarding direct economic impacts can be considered conservative. With regard to estimate of financial risk, changes in investors\u2019 expectations on firms\u2019 profits induced by climate impacts has implications for the financial valuation of securities issued by the firms. Here we use the assumption that investors update fully their expectations on the basis of projected impacts. This leads to an amplification of impacts through expectations, as put forward in the case of transition risk. This expectation channel is particularly relevant to represent rapid adjustment of financial valuations in a climate stress-testing context.</p><p>Our results have implications for the design and implementation of measures aiming at reducing climate-induced physical risk. First, climate risks should be assessed at the asset level to identify the most exposed assets and to factor in potential financial losses in the design of adaptation strategies.Second, financial risk could be decreased through policies aiming at limiting the financial leverage of firms that are most exposed to climate risks. In particular, risk could be reduced \u2018endogenously\u2019 if investors factor in climate-related risks in their credit-risk assessment or through regulatory measures such as making capital requirements conditional to the exposure to climate risks. From a broader perspective, our results highlight the importance of integrating financial impacts in the assessment of adaptation and mitigation policies.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Data</p><p>Financial universe</p><p>To construct a portfolio of financial assets representative of global market capitalization, we have considered the constituents of the MSCI ACWI. It consists of 2,934 firms from 23 developed markets and 24 emerging markets covering approximately 85% of the global investable equity opportunity set. Developed market countries represented in the index are Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. Emerging market countries represented in the index are Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, Egypt, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Korea, Kuwait, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and United Arab Emirates.</p><p>The main sectors represented in the index are information technology (21.9%), financials (15.61%), health care (11.58%), consumer discretionary (11.39%), industrials (10.47%), communication services (7.48%), consumer staples (7.16%), energy (4.73%), materials (4.63%), utilities (2.72%) and real estate (2.34%). The geographical weighting of the index is substantially biased towards developed countries, with the main countries represented in the index being the United States (61.95%), Japan (5.46%) and the United Kingdom (3.6%), followed by China (3.3%) and France (3%). To obtain a more accurate representation of global market capitalization, we have reweighted index weights proportionally to market capitalization (Supplementary Table ).</p><p>Geographical and economic characteristics of production facilities</p><p>To apply our structural financial risk model to the MSCI ACWI universe, we need the following information for each company in the index: its market capitalization, its revenues, the share of tangible assets in its capital stock and its list of production units. Furthermore, for each production unit, we need its latitude, its longitude, the corresponding country and its sector of operation according to the NACE (statistical classification of economic activities in the European Community) classification. This information has been obtained as follows in collaboration with the financial risk assessment firm Sequantis:</p><p>Market capitalization is obtained from market data.</p><p>Revenues are obtained from the annual reports of companies.</p><p>The main (NACE) sector of operation of the firm and the location of its headquarters is obtained from registration data.</p><p>The list of production facilities and their locations is obtained from the annual report of companies.</p><p>The sector of operation and the contribution to revenues of each production facility are then determined as follows. </p><p>By default, in absence of further information, each production facility is assumed to have the same sector of operation as the main sector of operation of the firm and the contribution to revenues is assumed to be uniform among production facilities.</p><p>If the annual report provides information about the geographical breakdown of revenues or production, revenues and capital stock are allocated proportionally to production facilities in the corresponding geographical area. Hence, the precision of the breakdown depends on the granularity of the reporting information.</p><p>If the annual report provides information about the geographical distribution of the firms\u2019 activities or information about the type of activity per production facility, the sector of operation of each production facility is determined accordingly.</p><p>We then use average sectoral (and country) values of returns on capital from the Damadoran database to determine sectoral returns to capital, debt-to-equity ratios and depreciation rates (see ).</p><p>We finally use data from EU KLEMS on the sectoral composition of capital stocks to estimate the share of tangible assets for each production facility (the parameter gi) as a function of its sector and country of operation.</p><p>Overall, we obtain a consolidated database of 130,677 production facilities for which descriptive statistics are provided in Supplementary Table .</p><p>Data consolidated from annual reports might be incomplete, and the collation process is error-prone. To cross-check the validity of our results, we have developed a second version of the database using data from Explorium. Explorium provides a large global database of companies by enriching existing (public and private) databases with machine-learning techniques. We have extracted from their dataset similar information as that provided by Sequantis (list of production units, sectors of operations, geolocations and contribution to the company\u2019s revenues) and completed this database with estimated data on sectoral productivity and composition of the capital stock using the EU KLEMS database as described in the preceding. The machine-generated nature of the Explorium database implies, by construction, the presence of some misclassified and inaccurate entities. However, given that the Analysis focuses on aggregate and distributional characteristics, this does not affect the statistical validity of our results while providing an important robustness check. We thus obtain a consolidated database of 147,599 production facilities for which descriptive statistics are provided in Supplementary Table .</p><p>Descriptive statistics in Supplementary Tables  and  highlight the distribution of capital per regions and the relative homogeneity of capital intensity and profitability across and within regions.</p><p>Climate impact assessment</p><p>Risk assessment methodology</p><p>The initial building block of our financial risk valuation methodology is the assessment of the distribution of economic risks induced by climate-related hazards on each productive unit. This assessment is based on the exposure, hazard, vulnerability paradigm.</p><p>For each productive unit i, its relative exposure is characterized by its sector, sectori, and the share of its capital formed of tangible capital gi \u2208 [0, 1]. The latter is determined as a function of the sector and country of the production unit using the EU KLEMS database. More precisely, we consider that the share of tangible capital is given by the share of \u2018machinery and equipment\u2019, \u2018cultivated assets\u2019, \u2018dwellings\u2019 and \u2018other buildings and structures\u2019 in the productive capital of the sector according to the breakdown reported in ref. .</p><p>We consider the following types of hazard: tropical storms, winter storms, coastal floods, river floods, landslides and wildfires. For each type of hazard, haz, we obtain from the existing literature (see the following for details), distribution of the magnitude of impacts for each location (lat, lon) where a production facility has been identified. These distributions are conditional on climate scenario and time as they evolve under climate change (details follow). Formally, these can be represented as probability measures Pscen,t,haz,lat,lon where Pscen,t,haz,lat,lon(x) is the probability that a hazard haz of magnitude x occurs at the location (lat, lon) within year t under the scenario scen.</p><p>We measure the vulnerability along two dimensions: capital destruction and business interruption. </p><p>As for capital destruction, we use vulnerability metrics from the literature (see hazard-specific details in the following) that specify the share of capital destroyed as a function of the magnitude of the event. Formally, it can be represented as a function that associates to a hazard haz of magnitude x, the share fhaz,country,sector(x) of tangible capital destroyed by the hazard (in general, the function is country and/or sector specific). Accordingly, if a hazard of magnitude x affects asset i, a share  of its tangible capital, corresponding to a share  of its total capital, will be destroyed. The random variables  for river flood,  for coastal floods,  for tropical storms,  for winter storms,  for wildfires and  for landslides are hence determined, their probability distribution being derived from the corresponding Pscen,t,haz,lat,lon.</p><p>As for the number of business-day interruptions, it formally can be represented as a function that associates to a hazard haz of magnitude x, the number ghaz,country,sector(x) of days during which business is interrupted in the affected facility (in general, the function is country and/or sector specific). In fact, we derive this vulnerability from the capital vulnerability metrics using the sector-specific coefficients provided by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) in ref. . More precisely, given the FEMA coefficient ndsector,country specifying the number of days of business interruptions following the complete destruction of the capital stock of a productive facility in a given sector and country, we assume proportional interruption for partial destruction, that is ghaz,country,sector(x) = ndsector,country \u00d7 gsector \u00d7 fhaz,country,sector(x). We hence determine the random variable  representing the share of year t for which business has been interrupted for production facility i.</p><p>Climate projections</p><p>Our analysis considers an array of climate-related extreme events: tropical storms, winter storms, coastal floods, river floods, landslides and wildfires. Consistency of the projections between these different types of hazards is ensured by considering the same set of climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 6 and RCP 8.5), the climate-forcing data from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) 2b protocol, and the same set of climate models (by default, the IPSL-CM5 earth system model). ISIMIP is an international collaboration that offers a framework for consistently projecting the impacts of climate change across affected sectors and spatial scales. In particular, ISIMIP provides a set of bias-corrected climate data to make consistent historical hindcast and future climate impact projections.</p><p>Tropical storms</p><p>We build on the approach introduced in ref.  for the projection of future impacts of tropical cyclones. As for hazards, we consider the set of post-1980 storm tracks from the International Best Track Archive for Climate Stewardship. For each historical track, we generate nsynth = 20 synthetic storm tracks using a directed random walk following the approach in ref.. Each synthetic track is assumed to have a yearly probability of occurrence of 1/nsynth its historical frequency. This ensemble of synthetic tracks defines in particular, for each location, the distribution of yearly maxima for sustained wind speed that we consider as the reference distribution of intensity for the tropical storm hazard. This reference distribution is based on historical data. To integrate the impact of climate change, we generate distribution of future events for a given RCP and year by interpolating changes in intensity and frequency from the projections in ref. , which are basin specific. From this ensemble of future events, we infer distribution of yearly maxima for sustained wind speed conditional on year and scenario. We then measure vulnerability to sustained wind speed form tropical storms using the damage functions introduced in ref.  whereby the fraction f of tangible capital destroyed is determined by:</p><p>Normalizing wind speed v according towhere vthresh is the wind speed belowwhich no damage occurs, and vhalf is the wind speed at which half the property value is lost.</p><p>Letting the fraction of damage scale up with the cube of the normalized speed:</p><p>Winter storms</p><p>The approach for assessing the impact of winter storms is conceptually similar to that for tropical storms. We consider as a default set of events the Copernicus synthetic windstorm events for Europe. This ensemble of synthetic tracks defines in particular, for each location, the distribution of yearly maxima for sustained wind speed that we consider as the reference distribution of intensity for the winter storm hazard. As for the impact of climate change, the recent literature, finds no clear trend in frequency but mostly agrees on increasing storm intensity. Accordingly, following the meta-analysis by ref. , we assume an increase in damage of 8% per degree of warming. The vulnerability function for winter storm has the same functional form as that for tropical storm, but it is calibrated on EU data following ref. .</p><p>Coastal and river floods</p><p>As for coastal and river floods, we extract distribution of hazards from the hazard maps for riverine and coastal flood risks from ref. . These hazard maps are derived from simulations of flood risk using a cascade of models within the Global Flood Risk with IMAGE Scenarios modelling framework. Conditional on climate scenario and time horizons, they provide at a resolution of 30 \u00d7 30 arcsec (1 \u00d7 1 km at the Equator) the extent and depth of floods for return periods ranging from 2 to 1,000 years. Hence, for each scenario, year and location, we obtain the distribution of maximal yearly flood depth that is used as a measure of intensity of flooding. The impact of thee flooding events is then inferred from the vulnerability curve introduced in ref.  that determines the share of capital destroyed as a function of flood depth. The depth\u2013damage curves in ref.  have been developed in view of providing a globally consistent database. Concave damage curves have been developed for each continent on the basis of an extensive literature survey, while differentiation in flood damage between countries is established by determining maximum damage values at the country scale.</p><p>Wildfires</p><p>As for wildfire, we first estimate a baseline distribution of hazard from historical burned-area data from the MODIS (moderate resolution imaging spectrometer) instrument. More precisely, we first consolidate a database of time series of \u2018burnable area burned\u2019 with a resolution of 0.25 latitude by 0.25 longitude by combining MODIS data with data on burnable area from the European Space Agency Land Cover Climate Change Initiative with 300 m resolution. Burnable area excludes water bodies, permanent snow and ice, urban areas and bare areas. We then estimate for each grid cell a zero-inflated lognormal distribution consisting of (1) the probability of occurrence of a wildfire and (2) conditional on the occurrence of a wildfire, a lognormal distribution for the share of burnable area burned. From this baseline distribution, we derive distributions corresponding to a given climate scenario and time horizon by translating the distribution according to estimates from changes in the average burned area under climate change from ref. . Therefrom, we derive the probability of occurrence of a wildfire for each productive unit location as follows. If the production facility is not located in a burnable area according to the Climate Change Initiative data, we assume that the probability of occurrence of a wildfire is null. If the production facility is located in a burnable area, we consider that the probability of occurrence of a wildfire is given by the zero-inflated lognormal distribution for the corresponding grid cell. As for vulnerability, we make the simplifying assumption that tangible capital affected by a wildfire is fully destroyed.</p><p>Landslides</p><p>We infer default landslide risk from the atlas of global landslide and avalanche hotspots of ref. , which has a resolution of 30 arcsec \u00d7 30 arcsec. More precisely, following table 7 in ref. , the atlas provides for each grid cell the probability of occurrence of a landslide per square kilometre. We consider this as the baseline probability that a productive facility located in the corresponding grid cell faces a landslide event. As for the impact of climate change, we use projections of precipitation from ISIMIP to infer changes in the probability of occurrence using the parametric relation between mean annual rainfall and landslide frequency established in refs. ,. Namely, frequency of occurence F is assumed to vary with mean annual precipitation P through a relationship of the form F \u221d P\u22120.8939. Accordingly, we compute the ratios for the corresponding frequency factors between the projected precipitation level for a given year and scenario and the historical average to determine the climate-induced change in frequency of occurrence. Beyond frequency correlation through this dependency on projected precipitations, the occurrence of each landslide event is assumed to be independent. As for vulnerability, we assume that tangible capital affected by a landslide is fully destroyed.</p><p>Labour productivity</p><p>We infer location-specific trajectories for labour productivity with a daily resolution following the approach of ref. . Namely, we build on the parametric relation established in ref.  to derive wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) from ISIMIP data on daily maximum temperature and mean relative humidity. We then use the linear approximation proposed in ref.  for the effect of WBGT on labour productivity assuming a linear decrease between 25.0\u00b0 and 39.5\u00b0. We further assume, following ref. , that WBGT is increased by 3\u00b0 for outdoor activities in the sun. To obtain consistent measures of vulnerability, we transform linearly productivity losses in business-day interruptions to integrate into equation ().</p><p>Distribution of extremes</p><p>We generate the time-dependent realization of extremes as follows:</p><p>For each year of the time frame, we draw a yearly realization of each hazard for each location according to the distribution corresponding to the given year and climate scenario.</p><p>We further draw uniformly at random (within the potential period of occurrence) the starting date of the hazard.</p><p>Realizations can be correlated across hazards and locations because they are induced by the same event (for example, a tropical storm yielding wind- and flood-related impacts at multiple contiguous locations) or because they are driven by the same climatic conditions (for example, landslide and river flooding events driven by the same temperature and precipitation patterns).</p><p>For each realized hazard and each agent i, we use vulnerability functions taking into account the intensity of the hazard at the location of i as well as the technological and geographical characteristics of i to determine the impact in terms of capital destruction and business interruption.</p><p>Detailed derivation of the financial valuation model</p><p>We assume that the firm produces output from capital at facility i according to a linear production technology of the form:Each productive facility is initially equipped with an amount  of capital, so that the total capital of the firm is given by</p><p>Capital is assumed to depreciate at a rate \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1]. Furthermore, the firm has a target growth rate (net of depreciation) for its capital stock \u03c1 \u2208 [\u2212 \u03b4, 1], which is assumed to be determined exogenously by market and technological factors and, for the sake of simplicity, considered constant across time and production facilities. Thus, the target trajectory of capital is such that for all i \u2208 Iand thus:whereby gross investment in productive facility i is given byIn this setting, the realization of climate impacts implies that in scenario s, in period t at facility i, a volume  is destroyed and a volume  is missing from production.</p><p>The financial structure of the firm is then determined as follows. The initial capital is assumed to be financed through amounts  of debt and  of equity; that is, one has:Uncertainty (non-climate related) about the economic performance of facility i is captured through a random and time-dependent profit margin \u03c0i,t. Combined with climate impacts on revenues through business interruption, this implies that the profits of the firm in period t are given byWe then assume that a share \u03bc \u2208 [0, 1] of profit is distributed as dividend each period, and the remaining is used for self-financing. Given equation (), this implies that the dynamics of the debt of the firm is given by:where r is the interest rate on the debt,  is the required investment for growth and reconstruction and  is the self-financing capacity. These debt dynamics correspond to a situation where the firm has access to a credit line with maturity T and interest rate r. This assumption is consistent with empirical evidence on the structure of corporate lending deals; see, for example, ref. . We further assume that the value of assets at maturity is determined as a function of the discounted stream of revenues they are expected to generate (under climate impacts); that is:where </p><p>Then, building on equations (), () and (), the no-default condition DT \u2264 KT(\u03c0) can be expressed as:</p><p>By recursion, this yields:</p><p>Let us then setOne can then rewrite equation () as:</p><p>The left-hand side of equation () corresponds to the initial debt with interest compounded over T periods. On the right-hand side, the term (1+\u03c1)T\u03bd\u03c0i,TK0,i corresponds to the value of capital held by the firm, while the term  corresponds to the excess cash flow in period t (profits net of dividends and investments). The value of the latter term (and its sign) is determined by the random realization of profits and climate impacts in period t. More broadly, the probability of default is determined by the distribution of profit margins and climate impacts. Namely, the probability of default is given by:</p><p>The present value of equity ES(D0, K0, r, \u03c1, \u03bc, \u03b4) is then given by the expected discounted value of the dividends and of the net worth of the firm at maturity in absence of default, that is,where r0 is the risk-free rate and following equations () and (), one has:</p><p>Hence, the value of equity is impacted by climate shocks through three channels: (1) the value of dividends that is decreased by business interruption, (2) the probability of default that increases with cumulative destruction of productive capital and reduced cash flow through business interruptions and (3) the net worth at maturity that decreases with cumulative destruction of productive capital and reduced cash flow through business interruptions.</p><p>The present value of a zero-coupon bond B(D0, K0, r, \u03c1) of face value 1 and maturity T is given by discounted expected payment at maturity, that is,where \u03ba \u2208 [0, 1] is the bankruptcy cost coefficient and  is the capital-to-debt ratio. Hence, the value of bonds is impacted by climate shocks through two channels: (2) the probability of default that increases with cumulative destruction of productive capital and reduced cash flow through business interruptions and (3) the net worth at maturity that decreases with cumulative destruction of productive capital and reduced cash flow through business interruptions.</p><p>Finally, the enterprise value of the firm VS(D0, K0, r, \u03c1) at date 0 can be computed as the expected discounted sum of cash flow generated from initial capital, that is:Hence, enterprise value is impacted by climate shocks through (1) destruction of the capital stock and (1) decreased cash flow due to business interruption.</p><p>Remark</p><p>One can establish a formal link between our approach and the Merton model under the assumption that the debt issued in period t &gt; 1 is senior to the initial debt D0. In this setting, the value of concern at maturity for the holders of D0 is the enterprise value net of senior debt, that is,  Indeed, the value of the initial debt, denoted DS(D0, K0, r, \u03c1), can then be expressed, as in the Merton model, as the value of a zero-coupon minus the value of a put on the net enterprise value:Accordingly, the value of equity  can then be expressed as the value of distributed dividends plus a call option on the net enterprise value at maturity; that is, one hasFurthermore, following equations () and (), one can characterize the dynamic evolution of the net enterprise value as follows.Under the approximation \u03c1 \u2243 r, the dynamics simplify to:The resulting dynamics are very similar to those considered in the Merton model. The evolution of the net enterprise value in our framework is characterized by a geometric trend and stochastic volatility. However, a key difference is that, in our framework, beyond a pure economic component given by the random profit margin, the volatility is also influenced by the distribution of climate impacts. Relatedly, volatility is not necessarily normally distributed in our framework.</p><p>Nevertheless, this analogy with the Merton model highlights how scenario-contingent valuation could be implemented in a Merton model. An increase in the expected value of impacts across scenarios can be represented as a proportional decrease in the trend component of the Merton model. An increase in the volatility of impacts across scenarios can be represented as a proportional increase in the volatility component of the Merton model.</p><p>Calibration</p><p>We calibrate the model using the following procedure.</p><p>The baseline risk-free-rate is set to r0 = 0.02.</p><p>We use data on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), earnings before interest and taxes, and return on capital from the Damadoran database to calibrate, at the sectoral level, the profit margin and the depreciation rate. More precisely, depreciation is calibrated on the basis of the difference between EBITDA and earnings before interest and taxes and (the mean) return on capital on the basis of the EBITDA-to-capital ratio. In this latter respect, note that the return on capital in the model is given by \u03bbi\u03c0i where \u03bbi is the productivity of capital and \u03c0i is the profit margin.</p><p>The EBITDA-to-capital ratio also allows us to provide an estimate of the intial capital stock of a firm from its EBITDA. We thus impute the initial level of capital stock for each production facility using contribution to revenues as a proxy for contribution to EBITDA.</p><p>We also use data from the Damadoran database to determine sector-specific debt-to-capital ratio and thus express the initial debt as a function D0 = \u03c7K0 of the initial capital stock.</p><p>Finally, we use the dividend payouts from ref.  to calibrate the dividend share \u03bc at the sectoral level.</p><p>We then set the default value of the target growth rate \u03c1 so that, in expectation, the debt-to-capital ratio at maturity remains equal to \u03c7.</p><p>As for the calibration of risk, the baseline probability of default pdbau and loss given default ratio lgdbau are set exogenously (and uniformly across firms for sake of comparability). On this basis, we infer the baseline interest rate on a firm\u2019s debt by assuming that the bond assumes its risk-adjusted equilibrium price, that is, by solving the equation</p><p>Eventually, we assume that the profit margin \u03c0 follows a lognormal distribution whose parameters we determine by taking as given the mean profit margin and the probability of default; that is, we assume that the standard deviation parameter of the lognormal distribution is such that the probability of default in absence of climate shocks is pdbau. More formally, one can express the default condition through the following sequence of equations:and then determine the parameters (\u03b1, \u03b2) of the lognormal distribution such that the expected return  is equal to the mean profit margin and the probability of default satisfies:</p><p>Integration of physical and transition risks</p><p>In a companion paper, we propose a related structural risk model, referred to as CLIMACRED (without the postfix -PHYS), focusing on the assessment of transition risk. Similar to the model described here, our transition-risk model describes the endogenous evolution of a firm\u2019s capital and debt. The default at maturity depends on whether the stochastic profit margin falls below a threshold. Differently from the present model, there the default threshold turns out to depend on the change in markets\u2019 expectations about the future trajectory of demand. Such a change in expectations characterizes transition risk in that model. More precisely, transition shock arises from the change in the value of capital and debt induced by the change in expecations from a baseline (high-carbon) to a policy (low-carbon) scenario.</p><p>The approach described in ref.  could be used to integrate transition risk in the framework of the current Analysis. Implementing this here would be out of scope. However, it may be of interest to describe briefly the procedure to carry out the integration of physical and transition risk. We characterize a climate scenario C by the output trajectories  it projects for each climate policy-relevant sector sec (for example, energy, oil and gas) over the time horizon [0, T] (where  denotes the projected output in scenario C, sector sec and period t). Such trajectories can be obtained, for example, from the Network for Greening the Financial System scenario platform. If a production unit i is assumed to hold a market share mi,sec in sector sec, its projected output trajectory under scenario C is then given by  Under equation (), this implies that the target trajectory of capital for production unit i is given by </p><p>One can then use for physical risk valuation the target capital trajectory  corresponding to a baseline climate policy scenario B instead of the exponential trajectory  considered in the preceding. One can then derive, using equations ()\u2013(), the probability of default , the value of equity  and the value of a bond  conditional on the baseline climate policy scenario B and the corresponding climate scenario SB.</p><p>One could similarly use the target capital trajectory corresponding to a climate policy scenario  to determine estimates of the probability of default , the value of equity  and the value of a bond  conditional on a climate policy scenario P and the associated climate policy scenario SP. In this setting, to ensure consistency with ref. , one would however use KP only for the computation of revenues and replace KP with cstrandKB in the computation of debt to account for stranded capital proportionally to a coefficient of stranding asset cstrand.</p><p>In this framework, one could then decompose the changes in risk (for example, expressed in terms of default probability) between a baseline scenario B and a climate policy scenario P as:where  corresponds to the transition risk induced by the shift from baseline B to climate policy scenario P in the climate environment SP while  corresponds to the change in physical risk induced by the transition between climate scenario SB and SP in the policy environment B. This decomposition highlights that, in first approximation, transition risk and physical risk can be separated additively. This implies in particular that the estimates focusing on physical risk provided in this Analysis provide a lower bound for total climate-related risks. Estimates of transition risk, for example, from ref. , shall be added to provide a comprehensive picture.</p><p>Related literature</p><p>The sustainable finance literature lacks consensus on the financial relevance of climate physical risks and the extent to which it is currently priced in the value of financial assets (for example, refs. , for mortgages, refs. , for stocks and ref.  for bonds). For example, in the loan market, ref.  finds evidence on limited pricing of floods in UK loans, while ref.  finds evidence of more substantial pricing in mortgages for properties exposed to sea-level-rise risk in the United States. In the stock market, ref.  finds that investors substantially underestimate extreme weather uncertainty in the case of hurricanes; ref.  finds that markets price hurricane risk only partially in US stocks (limited to firms\u2019 operating facilities but neglecting the broader impacts on the economic tissue); ref.  finds no evidence of incorporation of disaster losses into stock market reaction; ref.  finds that one standard deviation higher cyclone exposure is associated with a 2.2% higher annual return during months of quiet cyclone activity, while it is associated with a \u20131.7% annual return during months of intense cyclone activity. For droughts, ref.  shows that markets are not efficiently pricing drought trend information. For heatwaves, ref.  finds that local exposure to heat stress is associated with higher yield spreads for bonds and conditional expected returns for stocks, which are mostly absent for other physical risks. Using the aggregate risk score from MSCI, ref.  finds that only a share of physical risk factors is priced in stocks, ranging from 8 to 38% depending on the type of hazard.</p><p>However, the mentioned works focus on past occurrences of hazards, thus not considering scenarios of future climate impacts. Many of them are not conducted at a granular spatial resolution, and most often they use aggregate risk scores provided by the industry. From a scientific point of view, these scores suffer from the limitation that there is little transparency on their computation. Moreover, there is substantial divergence of commercial risk scores. Finally, the information on firms\u2019 assets is often not considered, which leads to a potentially large underestimation of financial risk for investors.</p><p>Online content</p><p>Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02244-x\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02244-x</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors acknowledge the financial support from the European Union\u2019s Horizon Europe research and innovation programme under the grant agreement no. 101056898 DECIPHER (Decision-making Framework and Processes for Holistic Evaluation of Environmental and Climate policies).
