That early awareness would later shape her global impact, as she emerged as a pioneering figure in business sustainability and policy innovation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now recognised as a leading authority on Environmental, Social &amp; Corporate Governance (ESG), Caroline advises multinationals, investors, and policymakers on how to drive systemic change in the face of climate breakdown, economic inequality, and social unrest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With a background spanning international development, green economics, and corporate strategy, she brings a rare depth of insight into how organisations can lead with purpose while delivering long-term resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this exclusive interview with Champions Speakers Agency, Caroline offers a timely perspective on just transitions, sustainable markets, and the future of business in a rapidly changing world.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: Given Scotland\u2019s economic ambitions and climate targets, what would you say to business leaders who still view sustainability as a financial burden rather than an investment?</emphasis></p><p>Caroline Ashley: \u201cI would ask, what\u2019s the business case for your business in a world where huge swathes of population can\u2019t live where they\u2019re living, huge parts of our arable land are not arable anymore, basic ecosystem services such as pollination are breaking down?</p><p>\u201cBefore you reach those, you\u2019ll have societal disruption. So what does a business look like where societies are not working? I would ask, did COVID affect your business? Well, let\u2019s look at the data that\u2019s telling us that the impacts of climate change, and the societal disruption that goes with it, is going to be even greater than that.</p><p>\u201cI was just looking at data on heat stress, which has been in the news recently. Obviously, I have a colleague based in India, and he\u2019s telling me about how they have to stay inside in the air conditioning.</p><p>\u201cAs many people as went off work during COVID, half as many as that are already missing work due to heat stress\u2014and that\u2019s before we get to 1.5\u00b0 of climate change. So I would ask people to think about COVID, and think about it multiplied.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would finally say, does your business have insurance? They probably would say yes. And I\u2019d say, how will you operate when you get to the point where there are many things for which your business cannot get insurance?</p><p>\u201cAnd that\u2019s not, you know, science fiction. Insurance companies are really thinking about what happens when things are not insurable anymore.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: In your view, what is the single most transformative step that Scottish businesses\u2014large or small\u2014can take to drive meaningful environmental change?</emphasis></p><p>Caroline Ashley: \u201cThe businesses are all over the shop. We\u2019ve got some real leaders, and we\u2019ve got some real laggards. So it\u2019s hard to say one thing. But the one thing that I think is common across all of them, they all need, is to understand their role and their responsibility in driving change\u2014and their ambition.</p><p>\u201cAnd I would say that amounts to a few different things. One is to just say, we\u2019re doing better than we did last year. That\u2019s not enough. Is it actually what society needs? Is it actually what the planet needs? If it\u2019s not enough, it\u2019s still not good enough.</p><p>\u201cAnother is not to say, we\u2019re doing better than other people in our sector. Again, that\u2019s not enough. We can still go to hell in a handcart, to use a phrase, if we\u2019re doing it that way.</p><p>\u201cBut another really important one is to say, business has a role and a responsibility to be part of a bigger change. So I wouldn\u2019t just say, change your own business to look after yourself. I\u2019d say we\u2019re on a huge socio-economic transition here.</p><p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s about how business teams up with others, how they work. We call it system change\u2014changing everything from the narratives that underlie the surface, to the specific actions. Think about how you\u2019re part of a bigger process of change. Some businesses have done that.</p><p>\u201cBut if the leaders at the top are not really signed up to being part of the future, I don\u2019t think all these ESG targets and sustainability things on the website\u2014or even just dealing with your emissions, at least in your Scope 1/2\u2014I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be enough. You have to have that vision at the top.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: As the transition to a green economy accelerates, how can we ensure it\u2019s a just transition that includes rural communities and those historically left behind?</emphasis></p><p>Caroline Ashley: \u201cI think that\u2019s the key question that we are beginning to realise has not been addressed yet. Change is coming. And is it going to be a just transition? There are two reasons why we have to focus on whether it\u2019s going to be just. One is really practical.</p><p>\u201cYou might be an immoral or amoral person, but to be honest, any change we have\u2014it\u2019s not going to last, it\u2019s not going to be sustainable, it\u2019s going to be challenged socially or politically if it doesn\u2019t work for people.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen that in examples where people protest what are relatively small changes, compared to what we need. So, to be practical, it\u2019s got to be socially inclusive and fair.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s also the moral argument that this is our chance to change how we run the economy\u2014to solve these twin evils of biosphere breakdown and gross inequality.</p><p>\u201cDue to COVID, for the first time in many, many years, poverty\u2019s actually going back up. Inequality is incredibly deep. We need to address that at the same time we restructure our economy. We can do both now.</p><p>\u201cIt is interesting that just transition is coming on the agenda, and I\u2019m seeing more discussions about it. But it tends to be talked about in terms of: these are the costs and these are the benefits.</p><p>\u201cThese are the financial costs\u2014who\u2019s going to pay, like the tax for them, or pay for premium products? And these are the benefits\u2014the new jobs, who\u2019s going to get the jobs? Of course those are important, but it\u2019s not enough. Just talking about the financial costs and the jobs is not a just transition.</p><p>\u201cA just transition is where people can decide for themselves what their future locality looks like, which pathway they want, how land will be used differently, what kind of training and skills, and what the new workforce looks like.</p><p>\u201cSo it\u2019s about people\u2019s decisions and voice. It\u2019s not just about, you know, who gets retrained in AI.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: With the cost of living continuing to rise, is there a viable path toward making sustainably sourced goods accessible to all consumers\u2014not just the affluent? </emphasis></p><p>Caroline Ashley: \u201cNo, they\u2019re clearly not. You know, I\u2019m someone on a professional salary who can afford to be picky with what I buy, and I look at the price premium and I think\u2014gulp, do I really want to pay that?</p><p>\u201cOf course, they\u2019re not affordable for friends and family members who are on benefits or whatever. I know that. But I think that\u2019s used a bit too much as a hope. \u201cWe can\u2019t do this because it couldn\u2019t work for the masses.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIf we look at the subsidies that we put into the fossil fuel industry, to conventional agriculture, to all kinds of public infrastructure that enables our economy to work as it is\u2014whether that\u2019s roads or garbage or water\u2014there are huge subsidies going into our current economy.</p><p>\u201cSo we have to change the system so that we do produce things in the way that is sustainable, and then we deploy the subsidies so that people who need them can afford them. We just have to shift several billions so that we can do both: produce what we need sustainably, and make sure people can afford it.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q: Many individuals face tension between personal sustainability goals and real-world limitations. What advice would you give to people navigating this sense of contradiction or guilt?</emphasis></p><p>Caroline Ashley: \u201cThe last thing is the hardest of all. Extinction Rebellion have a set of really interesting principles. For those who think they\u2019re just about glue, they\u2019re actually really worth looking at\u2014very interesting principles.</p><p>\u201cAnd one of them is: talk about what you do in your life. And another is: don\u2019t be ashamed\u2014because we all have things. I took a flight earlier this year, post-COVID, that will have completely destroyed my carbon footprint this year.</p><p>\u201cAnd it almost stops me talking about all these other things I want to do. But XR\u2014Extinction Rebellion\u2014say: the system\u2019s got to change. It\u2019s not just about you as an individual. So don\u2019t be ashamed\u2014but do talk about it.</p><p>\u201cCertainly, I don\u2019t go talking about, you know, I inherited some shares and I\u2019m trying to query the climate impact of that\u2014because that\u2019s a grossly inappropriate conversation with a lot of people. But I am hearing that little voice in my head that\u2019s saying: talk about it more. So I\u2019m trying to do that.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">This exclusive interview with Caroline Ashley was conducted by Jack Hayes.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://imagestore.jpimedia.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmRjY2FkNjIyLTc1NWQtNDU0Yi04NDUwLWM4NDY0MDc0ZDY3YzpmY2ZjNzQ3ZS1iYTNhLTQzMDgtOGYyMS1jNDhmYTAwY2MyN2I=.jpg\">Caroline Ashley - Champions Speakers Agency / Sustainability Speakers Agency</url></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-onecms260373c93a0d43bb9c601ec0cc08d628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FX3-28M3-RRVS-B10Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 27, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

According to a statement issued by the government of India on July 14, this accomplishment highlights the country's growing commitment to climate action and sustainable development while demonstrating that the clean energy transition is accelerating.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Union Minister of New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi described the achievement as a proud moment for the nation, stating, \"In a world seeking climate solutions, India is showing the way. Achieving 50% non-fossil fuel capacity five years ahead of the 2030 target is a proud moment for every Indian.\"  </p><p>Policy and programme momentum</p><p>This milestone reflects India's strong policy direction, ambitious programmes, and focus on inclusive growth. Flagship initiatives such as PM-KUSUM, PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, solar park development and the National Wind-Solar Hybrid Policy have played a central role. The bioenergy sector has also emerged as a key contributor, supporting both rural livelihoods and clean energy supply, according to the government.  </p><p>PM-KUSUM has provided solar-powered pumps to millions of farmers, enhancing energy security and promoting sustainable agriculture. The scheme has opened up opportunities for agrovoltaics and feeder-level solarisation, supporting India's agricultural economy while reducing emissions. Meanwhile, the PM Surya Ghar scheme, launched in 2024, has driven a rooftop solar revolution, making solar energy accessible to one crore households and empowering citizens to become energy producers.  </p><p>Installed capacity data highlights the shift</p><p>As of June 30, 2025, India's total installed electricity capacity stood at 484.82 GW. Of this, thermal sources accounted for 242.04 GW, representing just under 50% (49.92%). Non-fossil fuel sources - including renewable energy (RE), large hydro, and nuclear - together reached 242.78 GW, crossing the halfway mark at 50.08%, as per the government data. When shown separately, renewable energy (excluding large hydro) contributed 184.62 GW (38.08%), large hydro added 49.38 GW (10.19%), and nuclear power provided 8.78 GW (1.81%). This detailed breakdown underscores the substantial growth of renewables and hydro in India's energy mix and confirms the country's progress in diversifying away from fossil fuels.  </p><p>Expanding renewables and creating co-benefits</p><p>Large-scale solar parks have enabled utility-scale renewable energy deployment at record-low tariffs. Wind energy, particularly in states like Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, continues to be a critical contributor, helping meet peak power demand in the evenings. The bioenergy sector has expanded rapidly, advancing circular economy goals and generating employment in rural regions.  </p><p>These developments have decarbonised the power sector while delivering additional benefits such as improved energy access, job creation, reduced air pollution, better public health and stronger rural incomes. India's energy transition demonstrates that climate action can be closely linked to inclusive growth and social development.  </p><p>A global example of climate leadership</p><p>India's progress is notable globally, especially considering its relatively low per capita emissions. The country remains among the few G20 members on track to meet or surpass their NDC commitments. On international platforms like the G20 and UN climate conferences, India has consistently advocated for climate equity, sustainable lifestyles, and development pathways that balance growth and environmental protection.  </p><p>By achieving the 50% non-fossil milestone well ahead of schedule, India reinforces its role as a clean energy leader, showing that economic growth and environmental responsibility can advance together, the government said.  </p><p>Looking ahead: focus on equity and resilience</p><p>This early achievement offers an opportunity to set higher goals and focus on equity, quality, and resilience in the next phase of India's energy transition. Doubling per capita clean electricity consumption, particularly in rural and underserved areas, is essential. This includes scaling up distributed renewable energy systems and promoting efficient appliances to ensure reliable, affordable access.  </p><p>Building a robust, digitally integrated grid capable of managing high renewable penetration, demand fluctuations and two-way power flows will be crucial. Developing battery energy storage systems (BESS) and pumped hydro storage will further support grid stability and 24x7 renewable supply.  </p><p>Promoting circularity in solar panels, wind turbine blades, and batteries will help ensure responsible resource use. Accelerating investment in green hydrogen as a future industrial fuel will also be vital to deepening decarbonisation across sectors. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASPOTD-391306</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASPOTD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G8W-C053-RYG5-C04M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">469846</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"822\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 NewsBase, an Emerging Markets Direct company All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia Power Monitor Today</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"16138\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 16, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>Utilities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Utilities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Electric Utilities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Electric Utilities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Independent Power Producers &amp;

This project is a significant step in enabling these four African countries to shape their sustainable futures with confidence and clarity,' said Prof Anthony Nyong, Director, Climate Change and Green Growth, African Development Bank.<br/><br/>The visions were developed through a highly inclusive and participatory process engaging over 175 stakeholders across government institutions, civil society, academia, and the private sector in each of the four countries. They align with national development plans while addressing critical sectors including energy, agriculture, forestry, transport, and waste management.<br/><br/>All four countries address cross-cutting themes such as gender equity, just transition, capacity building, and climate finance in their visions.<br/><br/>Key highlights of the four countries' Long-Term Visions:<br/><br/>Botswana's LTV its vast solar potential.<br/><br/>During the Document Validation Workshop in Botswana, Mr. Boatametse Modukanele, Botswana's Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Tourism, said, 'The Government of Botswana is proud to have developed a Long-Term Vision for a low-emission and climate-resilient future. It is an ambitious blueprint that will empower our nation's future through strategic climate action, sustainable development, and inclusive growth, positioning Botswana as a beacon of resilience, sustainability, and hope for generations to come.'<br/><br/>Lesotho's LTV harmonizes sustainable development with the country's mountainous ecosystems, prioritizing clean hydropower, sustainable water management, and inclusive development.<br/><br/>'The Government of Lesotho, through the Lesotho Meteorological Services under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and with support from the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, is proud to present the country's Long-Term Vision (LTV) on Climate Change,' said Maphakamile Xingwana, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forestry. 'This milestone, completed in 2024, reflects our firm commitment to a climate-resilient and low-emission future. Aligned with national policies and the Paris Agreement, the LTV sets the foundation for the development of our Long-Term Strategy (LTS) and provides strategic direction for the future revision of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), and the Technology Needs Assessment and Action Plan.'<br/><br/>In its Long-Term Vision, Gabon has emphasized its status as a global carbon sink, integrating sustainable forest management and low-carbon development within its economic diversification strategy. The strategic vision reflects strong national ownership and a commitment to innovative climate financing and governance, even amid periods of political transition.<br/><br/>Liberia's long-term vision focused on climate equity, green growth, and coastal resilience. The Long-Term Visioning process in Liberia involved extensive stakeholder engagement and aligned with national development plans, such as Liberia Rising Vision 2030, to create a comprehensive strategy for inclusive, climate-resilient development.<br/><br/>'This launch marks not an end, but a new beginning.

This project is a significant step in enabling these four African countries to shape their sustainable futures with confidence and clarity,' said Prof Anthony Nyong, Director, Climate Change and Green Growth, African Development Bank.<br/><br/>The visions were developed through a highly inclusive and participatory process engaging over 175 stakeholders across government institutions, civil society, academia, and the private sector in each of the four countries. They align with national development plans while addressing critical sectors including energy, agriculture, forestry, transport, and waste management.<br/><br/>All four countries address cross-cutting themes such as gender equity, just transition, capacity building, and climate finance in their visions.<br/><br/>Key highlights of the four countries' Long-Term Visions:<br/><br/>Botswana's LTV its vast solar potential.<br/><br/>During the Document Validation Workshop in Botswana, Mr. Boatametse Modukanele, Botswana's Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Tourism, said, 'The Government of Botswana is proud to have developed a Long-Term Vision for a low-emission and climate-resilient future. It is an ambitious blueprint that will empower our nation's future through strategic climate action, sustainable development, and inclusive growth, positioning Botswana as a beacon of resilience, sustainability, and hope for generations to come.'<br/><br/>Lesotho's LTV harmonizes sustainable development with the country's mountainous ecosystems, prioritizing clean hydropower, sustainable water management, and inclusive development.<br/><br/>'The Government of Lesotho, through the Lesotho Meteorological Services under the Ministry of Environment and Forestry and with support from the Ministry of Finance and Development Planning, is proud to present the country's Long-Term Vision (LTV) on Climate Change,' said Maphakamile Xingwana, Principal Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forestry. 'This milestone, completed in 2024, reflects our firm commitment to a climate-resilient and low-emission future. Aligned with national policies and the Paris Agreement, the LTV sets the foundation for the development of our Long-Term Strategy (LTS) and provides strategic direction for the future revision of our Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the National Adaptation Plan (NAP), and the Technology Needs Assessment and Action Plan.'<br/><br/>In its Long-Term Vision, Gabon has emphasized its status as a global carbon sink, integrating sustainable forest management and low-carbon development within its economic diversification strategy. The strategic vision reflects strong national ownership and a commitment to innovative climate financing and governance, even amid periods of political transition.<br/><br/>Liberia's long-term vision focused on climate equity, green growth, and coastal resilience. The Long-Term Visioning process in Liberia involved extensive stakeholder engagement and aligned with national development plans, such as Liberia Rising Vision 2030, to create a comprehensive strategy for inclusive, climate-resilient development.<br/><br/>'This launch marks not an end, but a new beginning. A long-term low-carbon and climate resilience vision is a vital tool to inform policy, mobilize resources, and guide the path towards resilient infrastructure development,' said Rita Effah, coordinator, ACCF.<br/><br/>Click here to access Gabon's long-term vision.<br/><br/>Click here to access Botswana's long-term vision.<br/><br/>Click here to access Lesotho's long-term vision.<br/><br/>Click here to access Liberia's long-term vision.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Media Contact: Sonia Borrini<br/><br/>Climate Change  Green Growth Department, email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@afdb.org\">media@afdb.org</email><br/><br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:NDC-HUB@AFDB.ORG\">NDC-HUB@AFDB.ORG</email>;

Investor members collectively oversee $80trn of assets under management.<br/>Read on for Ridwaan's answers to our questions.<br/>How I got to where I am now:<br/>\"I spent part of my childhood visiting family in the Horn of Africa, where conversations often centred on the harvest: whether rain would come, if the drought would last, or how crops were holding up. From a young age, I saw how climate shocks like droughts and floods were part of daily life, not distant risks, and how much they disrupted communities who relied on agriculture for both income and food security. It made me ask why this was happening. The more I learned about climate change, the clearer it became that those who contributed least were paying the highest price. That early understanding shaped how I see sustainability and why I chose to work in it.<br/>\"I joined FAIRR in 2024. At FAIRR, I work across climate, equity, and investment strategy to ensure sustainability transitions deliver for the people most affected by them. I help shape FAIRR's approach to a Just Transition, defining what it means for the global food system and demonstrating how it can add value across climate, nature, and social workstreams. The goal is to build a shared understanding internally and provide investors with practical ways to engage on transition risks and equity.<br/>\"Right now, I am helping update FAIRR's regenerative agriculture framework to reflect real-world complexity. That includes the financial realities farmers face, whether related to income stability, access to fair labour conditions, or resilience against economic shocks.<br/>\"The transition to a low-carbon food system is already underway. The question is whether it will be designed to include everyone.\"<br/>My biggest career achievement to date has been:<br/>\"Helping to drive a multi-stage project at FAIRR that culminated in a high-level roundtable at biodiversity COP16 in Cali, Colombia, last year. The aim was to explore how investors can finance a Just Transition to regenerative agriculture.<br/>\"We brought together global food companies, financial institutions, and civil society to discuss how capital can support farmer livelihoods while reducing environmental impact. I helped shape the research, stakeholder engagement, and design of the roundtable itself, which turned months of background work into meaningful action with global stakeholders.\"<br/>The biggest challenge I have encountered has been:<br/>\"Showing that a Just Transition isn't a 'nice-to-have' - it is essential for resilience and long-term value. Many companies prioritise decarbonisation but overlook how these shifts affect livelihoods, incomes, and communities. When transition plans exclude people, the result can be disruption, unrest and rising future costs.<br/>\"That's why my work focuses on grounding Just Transition in data, risk and materiality, not sentiment. It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about ensuring supply chains remain stable, business models remain viable, and transitions are delivered effectively.<br/>\"For this to happen, we need more than climate ambition. We need real financial flows, not just loans, and practical support for those delivering change on the ground.\"<br/>I would describe my generation as:<br/>\"Carrying the costs of inaction.\"<br/>For me, a successful 12 months ahead looks like:<br/>\"Laying the foundation for a Just Transition strategy at FAIRR that integrates across internal workstreams such as regenerative agriculture, antimicrobial resistance, and protein diversification.<br/>\"The goal is to ensure transition planning reflects both climate ambition and the real-world social and economic conditions facing farmers, workers, and Indigenous communities.<br/>\"I'll also contribute to the refresh of FAIRR's Four Labours of Regenerative Agriculture\u00a0report. My focus is on strengthening the social dimension by supporting the inclusion of Just Transition best practices and indicators, as part of a broader team effort.\"<br/>Outside of my day job, I enjoy:<br/>\"Helping to lead Somalis for Sustainability, an initiative that I co-founded. It focuses on elevating climate issues in the Horn of Africa and creating space for young professionals to engage with climate justice. We work on building community, raising awareness, and connecting local challenges to global climate discussions. A highlight has been working with partners to deliver Somalia's first Local Conference of Youth (LCOY), which contributed to the country's first-ever National Youth Statement feeding into YOUNGO's Global Statement for the UNFCCC.<br/>\"Alongside this, I've picked up running as a new hobby and, as a beginner, have set myself the goal of completing at least two half marathons this year. Unfortunately, they're a week apart! But running with friends makes training enjoyable.<br/>\"I've also fallen into the padel craze and am enjoying the challenge of learning something new. These outlets help me stay balanced and recharged.\"<br/>My 'Mission Possible' message to business leaders is:<br/>\"We must move beyond seeing sustainability as simply reducing harm. The opportunity is to build systems that restore ecosystems, improve lives, and create shared value for people, nature, and business.<br/>\"So, sustainability must be holistic. It is not just about carbon or nature. Social impact, including livelihoods, fair work, and community resilience, is inseparable from environmental goals. One without the other is not sustainability. Climate justice must be central, especially as the Global South has long shouldered the consequences of a crisis it contributed least to.<br/>\"The first movers will be the businesses that act now. Do not wait for perfect data or outside pressure. Choose to lead. The cost of inaction will outweigh the investment in a planned, inclusive, and just transition. This is the chance to shape a future that is regenerative, resilient, and rooted in shared prosperity for people, communities, and planet.\"<br/>My advice for young people entering the sustainability profession is:<br/>\"Start by finding your people. The sustainability world is complex, spanning climate, food systems, equity, and nature. It's all connected, and no one makes sense of it alone. It took me a while to realise how important community is, but having people who challenge and support you makes all the difference.<br/>\"Learn from your peers. Find a mentor. Reach out to someone whose work you admire and ask for advice. The best guidance often comes from a single honest conversation.<br/>\"And hold onto your 'why'. It's easy to get swept up in frameworks, company assessments, and constant updates. When things feel overwhelming, return to that purpose. That's your anchor.\"<br/>To stay in the loop for the next round of annual nominations for the 30 Under 30,\u00a0.

However, the electricity generation performance of wind turbines of all capacities is highly dependent on conditions at an installation site, which can vary widely even within the same municipal region. We assess the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) and energy payback time of a novel microturbine of 2.4-kW capacity with location-specific environmental data. Potential electricity generation was modeled in the areas surrounding two US cities with ambitious decarbonization efforts and abundant wind energy resources in different climates: Austin, Texas and Minneapolis, Minnesota. The effects of system lifetime and hub height on the potential electricity generation were investigated, which identified trade-offs in higher electricity generation for taller turbines yet higher LCGHGE from greater amounts of materials needed. The LCGHGE of micro wind modeled for Austin and Minneapolis range from 53 to 293\u00a0g CO2eq/kWh, which is higher than utility-scale wind energy but still lower than fossil fuel sources of electricity. This study highlights the variability in the LCGHGE and energy payback time of micro wind power across locations, demonstrating the value of geospatial analyses for life cycle climate change impact estimates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>New and existing low-carbon electricity sources will play a crucial role in efforts to drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE). In the United States, fossil fuel combustion generates the majority of electric and non-electric energy demand, despite plans that promise to decrease GHGE across all sectors by 80% or more during the next three decades1. Cities across the United States have pledged to reduce GHGE even beyond the national commitments set forth in accordance with the Paris Agreement, largely by switching from carbon intensive fossil fuels to renewable energy systems and offsetting remaining emissions. However, these goals of substantial reductions in GHGE in the energy sector of urban areas may not necessarily be reached through conversion to 100% renewable energy, especially if novel distributed energy sources with potentially higher life cycle GHGE than their utility-scale counterparts need to be implemented to meet large populations\u2019 electricity demands without adding long-distance transmission infrastructure and without contributing further to urban sprawl.</p><p>The life cycle GHGE (LCGHGE, also referred to as carbon footprint) associated with producing, maintaining, and decommissioning prospective energy systems must be considered for effective climate policy. Renewable energy systems require the use of materials and processes that generate GHGE, which may be non-negligible when divided by the electricity produced over the lifetime of the system, particularly for those that do not generate as much electricity as expected, either due to shortened lifespan of the system or unexpected inefficiencies. Furthermore, because the amount of electricity generated by most renewable energy systems varies greatly due to geographic and climatic factors, the life cycle impacts of a given device should be investigated through geospatial analysis to understand how the LCGHGE attributable to the electricity produced by a novel device differ by location.</p><p>Micro wind turbines, which do not have a standardized capacity range but are generally lower than 5 kW, are among the renewable energy solutions being considered for distributed electricity generation near cities2,3. Taking advantage of the nation\u2019s high potential for wind power generation, wind capacity has expanded rapidly over the past decade in the US, even briefly surpassing coal and nuclear as the second largest source of electricity generation for a single day in the spring of 20224. The technical feasibility of harnessing wind energy is well established, particularly for utility-scale wind farms5. Large wind turbines (&gt; 1 MW) that are properly sited in areas with high wind resources can generate electricity with minimal life cycle climate change impacts compared to other electricity resources, but there are some concerns over land use requirements, including appropriate spacing between structures, and audible or visual nuisances associated with utility-scale installations6. Integrated renewable energy technologies such as micro wind turbines can potentially be installed near urban centers and generate electricity without major land-use requirements. There are numerous designs for micro wind turbines, including horizontal and vertical axes, which can be installed at substantially lower heights than higher capacity turbines and therefore require less distance from buildings. This can provide new opportunities for situating future renewable electricity supply closer to consumers driving the demand, such as within cities, if this technology is determined to result in low LCGHGE.</p><p>Many previous life cycle assessments (LCAs) have been conducted to assess the LCGHGE of generating electricity from various wind turbines under different conditions, although some results are potentially becoming less relevant as many of these studies are now more than 10 years old and based on older climate datasets and turbine designs7. Recent studies are also available that address the variability of LCGHGE resultant from existing wind farms across locations8, 9, 10\u201311. Most wind turbines in operational wind farms are classified as large12, and wind energy LCAs tend to focus on existing installations. Khoie et al. (2021) focused on a 1.3 MW wind turbine located in the Texas Panhandle, and Alsaleh and Sattler (2019) studied a 2 MW turbine near Abilene, Texas10,11. Pilot-scale offshore wind farms have also been studied in the Mediterranean by Poujol et al. (2020)9. The results of these studies demonstrate a wide range of LCGHGE attributable to wind power, largely based on the amount of electricity produced over the lifetime of a device, which depends on both the technology and location. Dammeier et al. (2022) found a range of 4 to 56 g CO2/kWh across 26,821 wind farms installed as of 20198.</p><p>Reviewed reported LCGHGE for onshore wind power technologies range from 0.01 g CO2/kWh to over 2000 g CO2/kWh within the scientific literature13. Smaller wind turbines, however, are generally less efficient than larger turbines due to higher turbulence and more intermittent wind speeds at low altitude14,15. Very large turbines also use different transportation methods than smaller turbines, travel additional distances due to availability, and need different disposal methods11, thus separate assessments are required for smaller wind turbines. Additionally, these smaller wind turbines and wind farms with short lifetimes are likely to have higher impacts as less electricity is generated throughout their life cycle. One study found that there is generally a negative correlation between the carbon footprint and rotor diameter for wind technologies16. A geospatial life cycle assessment (LCA) of small wind turbines in Austria has demonstrated that their potential LCGHGE are greater than the maximum of 16 g CO2eq/kWh required to meet <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gr\u00fcner Strom</emphasis> label certification standards17. However, the LCGHGE of micro wind installed in most other locations are unknown, as very few studies have been carried out to date on the impacts of smaller wind turbines17.</p><p>Metropolitan areas with limited land resources for utility-scale wind farms but notable wind resources, comprehensive decarbonization targets, and increasing demands for electricity are promising regions for future installations of micro wind turbines. These areas serve as useful case studies for which to model the prospective LCGHGE of these novel systems with geographically specific data. Previous work examining the climate action plans and GHG inventorying practices of different US cities identified both Austin, Texas and Minneapolis, Minnesota as having particularly ambitious climate goals that prioritize life cycle thinking18. Minneapolis pledged in its 2013 climate action plan to reduce GHGE across all sectors by 80% by 2050 as compared to 2006 levels, and Austin committed to net-zero city-wide GHGE by 2040, followed by sustained negative emissions, in its 2021 climate equity plan19,20. The regions containing the cities of Austin, Texas and Minneapolis, Minnesota have high potential for implementing wind power systems; Texas and Minnesota rank first and eighth, respectively, in installed wind capacity among US states, with abundant wind resources and relatively flat landscapes21. Austin and Minneapolis decision-makers would need geospatial LCGHGE for micro wind in their regions to compare them to other electricity resources and guide energy planning with quantifiable reductions in GHGE in line with their climate action goals.</p><p>To determine the suitability of a novel, integrated renewable technology to help cities meet their GHG reduction commitments, LCA methods were used to calculate the carbon footprint of the electricity generation modeled for a 2.4 kW capacity micro wind turbine for different areas within Austin, TX and Minneapolis, MN based on geographically specific wind resource data. For each location, we investigated the effects of hub height and system lifetime on the life cycle impacts of the average 1 kWh of electricity generated by the device. The impacts were compared against the carbon footprint of alternative energy sources in these regions and used to determine the energy payback time for electricity generated in each location.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Turbine description and data collection</emphasis></p><p>The Skystream 3.7 turbine was chosen to represent an existing micro wind energy technology in this analysis as detailed technical specifications for this design were available online (Table 1)22, 23, 24\u201325, which were used to inform the baseline input parameter values and the life cycle processes modeled (Fig. 1). The Skystream is also one of many wind turbines included in the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) System Advisor Model (SAM), which provides annual electricity generation calculated from hourly weather data (air pressure, temperature, and wind speed and direction) for the years 2007 to 2014 at fine spatial resolution across the US26,27. The turbine has been tested for performance potential by the Small Wind Certification Council (SWCC), which aligns with ISO standards and is accredited by the American Association of Laboratory Accreditation, and by the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA), which provided the details on specific materials comprising the turbine elements as well as the basis for an additional high-performance scenario28, 29\u201330.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>Key materials and processes along the life cycle of a micro wind turbine.</p><p>Table 1</p><p>Input parameter values for each scenario analyzed.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"144\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Parameter</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Scenario(s)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Value per turbine</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">Source</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Volume of concrete base</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">All</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.3 m3</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">24</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mass of fiberglass composite</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">All</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">28 kg</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">22</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mass of permanent magnet</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">All</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20 kg</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Retail options</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Distance from the manufacturer to the installation site</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Austin</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2000 km</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Regional online sellers</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Minneapolis</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2600 km</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Turbine lifetime</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Baseline lifetime</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">20 years</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">23</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Extended lifetime</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">30 years</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Wiring length</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Minimum hub height</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">150 m</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">23</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum hub height</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">300 m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Mass of galvanized steel for the tower</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Minimum hub height</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">249.2 kg</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">24,28</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum hub height</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">747.6 kg</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table>ParameterScenario(s)Value per turbineSourceVolume of concrete baseAll3.3 m324Mass of fiberglass compositeAll28 kg22Mass of permanent magnetAll20 kgRetail optionsDistance from the manufacturer to the installation siteAustin2000 kmRegional online sellersMinneapolis2600 kmTurbine lifetimeBaseline lifetime20 years23Extended lifetime30 yearsWiring lengthMinimum hub height150 m23Maximum hub height300 mMass of galvanized steel for the towerMinimum hub height249.2 kg24,28Maximum hub height747.6 kg</p><p>The Skystream 3.7 consists of a three-blade, horizontal axis turbine with a tubular steel tower with galvanized finish, a permanent magnet brushless steel alternator estimated at 20 kg based on various retail options available, and water-resistant wiring. The fiberglass composite components, which include the nacelle and the three blades, are estimated at 28 kg in total mass. Small elements such as steel nuts and bolts for assembly have been excluded from the scope of this analysis, as has packaging, because these minor materials are assumed to cumulatively comprise less than 1% of the overall LCGHGE. The concrete base required to support the tower is 3.3 m3 in volume, but may change slightly based on soil type, climatic conditions, and tower height and mass in practice. We modeled the same volume of concrete support for both the minimum and maximum tower heights, assuming that the large volume recommended by the installation manual is capable of supporting either tower size24. The mass of the 30-meter tower (i.e., the maximum height supported by the device) is assumed to be three times the mass of the 10-meter tower (minimum tower height) in modeling the steel life cycle impacts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Geographic scenarios</emphasis></p><p>The geographic scenarios analyzed involved fifteen zip codes in Austin (78645, 78734, 78738, 78736, 78737, 78619, 78610, 78747, 78719, 78617, 78725, 78653, 78660, 78664, 78613) and 11 zip codes in Minneapolis (55412, 55411, 55405, 55410, 55419, 55417, 55406, 55414, 55413, 55418). These zip codes are directly against yet still within Minneapolis and Austin\u2019s city limits; they are thus within the jurisdiction of the cities\u2019 climate action plans. These peri-urban regions would potentially be the most suitable areas within the cities for micro wind turbine installation; more densely populated and highly developed neighborhoods would feature fewer opportunities for micro wind turbine installation as the turbine requires a lot size of 0.5 acres (0.2 hectares)25. It was outside of the scope of this study to consider the suitability of individual sites for installation, i.e., lot size and zoning requirements.</p><p>To develop the 26 geographically specific LCA scenarios, zip code level data on electricity generation over time by the Skystream 3.7 turbine was retrieved from NREL\u2019s System Advisory Model (SAM) V 12.2 (Fig. 2). SAM uses sub-hourly weather data including wind speed and direction, assuming a shear coefficient of 0.14, wake losses of 1.1%, availability losses of 5.5%. electrical losses of 2%, turbine performance losses of 4%, environmental losses of 2.4%, and curtailment losses of 2.8%27. Its high temporal resolution of 15 min for location-specific wind speeds enables precise calculations for electricity generation over time. The weather data for the years 2007 to 2014 was used to calculate the average annual electricity generation by the micro wind turbine for each zip code scenario, which was then applied to represent the turbine\u2019s electricity generation during its first year. Subsequently, this generation was decreased by a constant factor in calculating the electricity generated during each year of the turbine\u2019s lifetime. Although the degradation in efficiency is unknown for micro wind technology, it is assumed in this study to be 0.5%, approximately matching the performance degradation rate of utility-scale wind turbines in the US that were installed prior to the Production Tax Credit31.</p><p>In addition to the geographic scenarios, an LCA scenario was developed to represent the conditions expected by the manufacturer for the turbine lifetime and the Small Wind Certification Council\u2019s (SWCC) determination that the Skystream 3.7 turbine can theoretically generate 3420 kWh annually28. This SWCC scenario represents a high performance that is beyond the productivity achievable in the geographic scenarios assessed (Fig. 2), and it is roughly equivalent to placing the turbine in a location that experiences a constant wind speed of 5 m/s instead of the natural fluctuations that are modeled in the geographic scenarios28. Although this does not match the zip-code level amounts of electricity generated calculated in this study (Fig. 2), this total of 3420 kWh/year may be achievable if finer spatial resolution data for wind potential is used to site a turbine strategically within a zip code. For this SWCC scenario, a distance between the manufacturer and the installation site of 2000 km (the minimum distance of the geographic scenarios) and a turbine lifetime of 20 years were modeled.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>Average annual electricity generation by zip code for a micro wind turbine at: (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) the minimum hub height of 10 m in Austin, Texas, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) the maximum hub height of 30 m in Austin, Texas, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) the minimum hub height in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) the maximum hub height in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

This is useful for planning a rapid energy transition under resource constraints and can help avoid siting renewable energy systems in poorly performing locations. Ideally, the EPBT of a renewable energy system would be a small fraction of its lifetime; a system with an EPBT close to the lifetime of the system would not be appropriate to implement from a resource conservation standpoint. Results from EPBT studies can be used to compare across technologies and locations. The same system boundaries as the LCA were followed for the EPBT analyses, and the same inventories were selected from databases in SimaPro 9.2 for consistency, with the fossil fuel demand impact category assessed using EPA TRACI 2.1. The EPBT analysis was also performed in Mathematica as a looped set of equations by essentially dividing the total fossil fuel energy estimated to manufacture and install the device by the average amount of electricity it can generate in a year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results and discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Geographic scenario results for Austin and Minneapolis</emphasis></p><p>The life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) results for the micro wind turbine are strongly influenced by the wind generation potential at each location. The impacts are highest in areas with lower electricity production over time, as expected in LCAs of renewable energy systems. For the minimum hub height (10 m) scenarios across the 15 peripheral zip codes of Austin, Texas, the LCGHGE range from 77 to 276 g CO2eq/kWh. The range of results shifts to 91 to 236 g CO2eq/kWh in the same locations when the maximum hub height of 30 m is modelled instead, with only one of the zip codes showing a decrease in LCGHGE at maximum hub height. This suggests that even though increasing the hub height of the device generally increases the electricity production, it does not necessarily reduce the LCGHGE in all locations. Because of the high carbon intensity of steel production, there appears to be a limit to the benefits of increasing the hub height of the device (Fig. 3). The difference between minimum and maximum hub height results is even more apparent in Minneapolis, where the LCGHGE at the minimum hub height modelled range from 219 to 293 CO2eq/kWh, and from 176 to 239 g CO2eq/kWh at the maximum hub height. Unlike the Austin scenarios, all Minneapolis geospatial scenarios showed a decrease in LCGHGE at maximum hub height. According to the data retrieved, the electricity generation potential is much greater in Minneapolis at the higher hub height compared to the difference between hub heights in Austin. In every studied zip code across Minneapolis, electricity generation increased at least 100% at the 30-meter hub height relative to the minimum hub height, whereas only one zip code in Austin achieved the same magnitude of increase.</p><p>The entire range of LCGHGE of electricity generated by a micro wind turbine installed in the zip codes analyzed in Austin and Minneapolis is lower than the LCGHGE attributable to coal- or natural gas-fired electricity, the primary sources of fossil-based electricity in the US33,34. The micro wind LCGHGE results are also lower than regionalized emissions factors as calculated on a life cycle basis for the respective counties, and those reported by eGRID for the respective grid connections35,36. Austin is contained within Travis County, and Minneapolis within Hennepin County, where Chen &amp; Wemhoff (2021) determined grid electricity LCGHGE to be 430 and 549 g CO2eq/kWh, respectively35. The 2025 US EPA update to the eGRID Power Profiler reports direct combustion emissions factors of 336 g CO2eq/kWh for the ERCOT region consisting of most of Texas, including the Austin area, and 420 g CO2eq/kWh for the MROW region that includes Minneapolis, for the year 202137.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Average life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) by zip code for a micro wind turbine at: (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) the minimum hub height of 10 m in Austin, Texas, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) the maximum hub height of 30 m in Austin, Texas, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) the minimum hub height in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) the maximum hub height in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The incomplete value for the zip code 78,719 located in the Southeast of Austin is 133 g CO2eq/kWh.</p><p>Because the LCGHGE of a given renewable energy system are often highly dependent on the amount of electricity generated throughout the operational lifetime38,39, extending the lifetime of a system can decrease the LCGHGE, if the contribution of decreased efficiency with aging and more frequent or intensive maintenance or replacement of parts does not negate the benefits. We investigated the effect of extending the lifetime of the micro wind turbine from 20 to 30 years, assuming that the device would remain functional over this timespan without requiring replacement of major parts, as 30 years is within the estimated lifetime range of many utility-scale wind turbines40 and the actual lifetimes of micro wind systems are currently unknown. Increasing the lifetime of the device does substantially decrease the LCGHGE of an average kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by a micro wind turbine modeled for conditions in Austin and Minneapolis, by about 32% across the scenarios, as expected (Fig. 4).</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>Extended lifetime scenario results of average life cycle greenhouse gas emissions (LCGHGE) by zip code for a micro wind turbine at: (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) the minimum hub height of 10 m in Austin, Texas, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) the maximum hub height of 30 m in Austin, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) minimum hub height in Minneapolis, Minnesota, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) maximum hub height in Minneapolis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">SWCC scenario results</emphasis></p><p>The SWCC scenario results effectively represent the \u201cbest case\u201d scenario for the LCGHGE of the microturbine due to the higher estimated electricity generation28. Increasing the electricity generation to 3420 kWh per year for the full 20 years of operation reduces the impact to 56 g CO2eq/kWh in our model (Table 3). However, the zip-code level annual electricity output as calculated by the NREL System Advisor Model only surpassed a cumulative 3000 kWh/year at the 30-m (maximum) hub height, and only in a few zip codes in Austin. This suggests that, although the amount of electricity generated in this scenario is not technically impossible, it is unlikely that the device could meet this productivity in most of our studied regions. This is particularly less likely to occur longer into the lifetime of the turbine due to degrading performance. Still, this information could be useful for selecting optimal installation sites; locations that result in at least approximately 3420 kWh of annual generation under realistic calculations at high temporal resolution could be considered suitable for providing low-carbon electricity with micro wind turbines.</p><p>Table 3</p><p>Life cycle greenhouse gas emission (LCGHGE) results from all scenarios presented.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"136\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><thead><row><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\">Scenario location</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col2\">Lifetime (years)</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col3\">Hub height</entry><entry align=\"left\" colname=\"col4\">LCGHGE (g CO<sub>2</sub>eq/kWh)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Austin, TX</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Minimum</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">77?276</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">91?236</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">30</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Minimum</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">53?189</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">62?161</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Minneapolis, MN</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Minimum</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">219?293</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">176?239</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">30</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Minimum</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">149?200</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Maximum</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">120?163</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">SWCC (optimal) scenario</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Minimum</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">56</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Scenario locationLifetime (years)Hub heightLCGHGE (g CO2eq/kWh)Austin, TX20Minimum77\u2013276Maximum91\u201323630Minimum53\u2013189Maximum62\u2013161Minneapolis, MN20Minimum219\u2013293Maximum176\u201323930Minimum149\u2013200Maximum120\u2013163SWCC (optimal) scenario20Minimum56</p><p>The life cycle GHGE of generating electricity with this novel microturbine in the case study locations and even in the high-performance SWCC scenario are higher than most reported emissions for utility-scale wind electricity, although lower than those of grid electricity at 430 g CO2eq/kWh in Austin and 549 g CO2eq/kWh in Minneapolis8,35,41. Previous studies have demonstrated that smaller wind turbines generally have higher associated LCGHGE than utility-scale turbines due to higher material needs relative to their electricity output16,42. However, there are still benefits to smaller-scale systems such as their lower land-use requirements and their ability to be integrated into urban environments3. As in utility-scale wind turbine LCAs19, the raw material extraction and manufacturing phases contribute the majority of the life cycle GHG emissions for the micro wind turbine, and end-of-life management activities contribute the least (Fig. 5).</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>The LCGHGE of electricity produced by the Skystream under theoretical optimal conditions compared to the LCGHGE associated with the grid electricity35,37.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Energy payback time</emphasis></p><p>There is a relatively tight range of results for the energy payback time (EPBT) in both study locations. Across the zip codes assessed in Austin, the average EPBT ranges from 0.45 to 1.61 years under minimum hub height conditions and 0.5 to 1.3 years under maximum hub height conditions. These results are slightly higher across the studied zip codes in Minneapolis; the minimum hub height EPBT ranges from 1.3 to 1.7 years and the maximum hub height EPBT ranges from 1 to 1.3 years (Fig. 6). As with the LCA results, the lowest energy payback times correspond to areas of consistently high wind speeds. These results are more aligned with the EPBT of electricity from other wind turbines in the literature. A comparison of a 250 W and 4.5 MW turbine in France by Tremeac and Meunier (2009) determined that the smaller turbine had an EPBT of just over 2 years and the larger turbine showed an EPBT of 0.6 years43. Other studies have reported that the EPBT of wind turbines is generally less than one year, across various sizes of turbines44, 45\u201346. No degradation was modelled for the energy payback analysis, as the effect would be nonexistent or negligible in all scenarios as it was applied on an annual timestep.</p><p>Fig. 6</p><p>Average energy payback time (EPBT) for a micro wind turbine at: (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) minimum hub height across Austin, Texas, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) maximum hub height across Austin, (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) minimum hub height across Minneapolis, Minnesota, and (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) maximum hub height across Minneapolis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Upfront greenhouse gas burden</emphasis></p><p>Although one of the best ways to compare the LCGHGE of alternative sources of electricity is on the basis of a kWh delivered, this does not accurately reflect the temporal distribution of emissions associated with renewables compared to fossil fuel alternatives. In contrast to fossil fuel-sourced electricity, the vast majority of the climate change impacts resultant from renewable energy systems occur from manufacturing the devices. The upfront greenhouse gas burden was estimated using the same process equations, except landfilling, simply not scaled to any amount of electricity generation. Using our baseline parameters and 2,000 km for transportation distance, the upfront greenhouse gas burden was 3641 kg CO2eq/turbine. The upfront greenhouse gas burden is reduced to 3581 kg CO2eq/turbine when assessing on a cradle-to-gate scope without shipping impacts. This value can be used to estimate the geospatial carbon footprint for any location covered in the System Advisor Model by NREL by dividing the upfront burden by the amount of electricity the device can generate over its lifetime. This can also be used for GHG inventory purposes, for a more accurate understanding of the relatively high emissions resultant from the energy transition short-term to meet net-zero goals on a long-term basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Recommendations and future research</emphasis></p><p>Based on the results of this analysis, there may be ways to minimize the LCGHGE associated with producing electricity from micro wind in urban settings. Because the LCGHGE greatly depend on the amount of electricity generated over the lifetime of the device, increasing the lifetime or otherwise increasing the total generation ultimately decreases the associated GHGE per kWh delivered. Results suggest that increasing the lifetime by replacing and refurbishing parts as they age past the manufacturing guidelines may further decrease the life cycle carbon footprint, although we did not model the need for additional parts. Future research to assess the relative effects of replacing individual components on the lifetime and LCGHGE is needed. The mass of steel contributes significantly to the overall LCGHGE, especially for the maximum hub height scenarios, suggesting it is not always advantageous to install the maximum allowable tower at a given site. Both steel and concrete are currently active areas of research for decarbonization due to the high carbon intensity of their production processes47,48. Future research could investigate how technological advancements in cement and/or metals manufacturing affect the LCGHGE and EPBT of micro wind turbines.</p><p>The data used for this study, reflecting conditions from 2007 to 2014, may not be entirely representative of current or future wind resource availability, but was the best data fit given the hub height of this particular wind turbine, as more recent wind data is only available for higher hub heights. Additional research on the potential effects of climate change on wind speeds and consistency, as well as more recent data, could yield more relevant results for planning. Using data with a finer spatial resolution or point data within studied zip codes may help find the most suitable sites, in terms of both land requirements and minimizing LCGHGE.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate action policy implications</emphasis></p><p>Switching from coal and natural gas-fired electricity to renewable energy is one of the main ways cities plan to reduce GHG emissions in the coming decades. Climate action plans and GHG inventories that ignore the LCGHGE of renewably sourced electricity overestimate the net reduction in emissions achieved by switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems that still require some infrastructure and therefore have a measurable carbon footprint18. Many cities\u2019 GHG inventories, including Austin and Minneapolis, currently assume that electricity produced from any renewable energy system has zero associated emissions, but some cities have expressed interest in incorporating LCA results into their GHG inventories for more accurate estimates19,20. This work can be useful for policy-makers interested in including LCGHGE of renewable energy systems into their greenhouse gas inventories. Our results demonstrate that using LCA input data at a higher spatial resolution than municipal or regional scale and that assessing geographic scenarios delineated even at sub-city scales can help optimize the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy technologies, by ensuring that decision-makers have the necessary knowledge to choose the option with the lowest carbon footprint for a given location, or the site with the lowest resulting carbon footprint for a given technology. For our study locations, this specific technology does not appear to be suitable for generating electricity with the lowest possible emissions on a life cycle basis, especially compared to utility-scale renewable systems. Future research could investigate other options for novel, integrated renewables with lower life cycle emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusions</emphasis></p><p>This research contributes to the growing field of geospatial life cycle assessment for renewable energy systems, identifying geographic differences in the carbon footprint of micro wind power that exist even at the sub-municipal scale. Our results demonstrate that the carbon footprint of new technologies should be assessed at the finest spatial resolution feasible for the most accurate understanding of the renewable resource harnessed, in this case wind. We found that throughout Austin and Minneapolis, the LCGHGE and EPBT of electricity generated by a microturbine vary appreciably and are largely dependent on the local wind speeds over time. Furthermore, although a larger amount of electricity can be generated due to higher wind speeds at the maximum hub height of 30 m compared to the minimum hub height of 10 m, the LCGHGE associated with the increase in infrastructure materials can reduce the benefits to the overall LCGHGE of micro wind power.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors thank the National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (award #2139297) for funding Alyssa Pfadt-Trilling in this research.

The industry's annual CO2 emissions, contributing about 6-8% of the global total according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), must be tackled where textiles actually come to life: in manufacturing facilities across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The textile industry stands at a crossroads. The pressure to decarbonise is mounting as brands make bold commitments, regulations tighten, and consumers demand accountability. But the real work - implementing change - rests with suppliers who face unique operational and financial constraints that aren't always visible in sustainability discussions. </p><p>This shift isn't about installing solar panels or tweaking a process here and there. It's about rethinking how textiles are made, questioning outdated systems, and addressing practical on-ground realities. The challenge isn't that solutions don't exist, it's that scaling them is an uphill battle. The energy equation: who pays for decarbonisation?Most of the industry's energy consumption is said to occur in dyeing and finishing, yet access to renewable energy remains inconsistent across manufacturing regions. Some have the infrastructure to support large-scale adoption, while others are still locked into fossil fuel dependency. There's no debate that energy transition is necessary, but the approach raises questions: Who bears the cost? Should suppliers shoulder it alone? Why aren't brands investing more directly in supply chain decarbonisation beyond demanding emissions reductions? Meanwhile, suppliers operate on tight margins with limited access to capital for upgrades. According to McKinsey, most decarbonisation actions in fashion manufacturing can be implemented at a cost of less than $50 per tonne of CO2, with limited impact on production costs. This finding presents an opportunity for strategic investment across the value chain, but requires thoughtful cost sharing between brands and suppliers. Progressive manufacturers are making significant investments. Interloop Limited in Pakistan powers 51% of its energy through renewables, having phased out coal entirely. Pratibha Syntex in India, with support from Good Fashion Fund's $4.5m loan, is saving 50% in energy water, and materials. While financing options are emerging, navigating them remains a challenge. In Pakistan, the State Bank's green schemes and NAMA Support Project's low-interest loans for textile SMEs, remain insufficient for the scale of transformation needed. The funding landscape is fractured, creating uneven access that disadvantages suppliers working across multiple brand portfolios. Achieving net-zero industry-wide requires financing models that create equitable distribution of costs. What's missing is coordinated investment that matches the scale of our climate ambitions. Brands with decarbonisation funds tend to invest where they can book the maximum advantage for their product footprints. For multi-category suppliers working with several customers, this complicates funding access and slows progress. Credit: Interloop. Regulations: a compliance burden or an opportunity?The wave of climate regulations, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU's Fit for 55 package, the US Inflation Reduction Act, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), is designed to drive accountability. But for suppliers, it often translates into another layer of complexity they must navigate alone. Many operate in regions where regulatory frameworks are still evolving, making compliance both a logistical and financial challenge. Some might argue compliance is simply the cost of doing business today, but this overlooks major regional disparities in infrastructure, resources, and governmental support. While EU suppliers can access programmes like the Just Transition Fund to finance their green transition, manufacturers in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka often lack similar support mechanisms. A one-size-fits-all approach won't work. Proactive suppliers are aligning with science-based targets despite limited regional support - Interloop targets a 51% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 30% in Scope 3, investing in LEED-certified manufacturing, clean energy, and material traceability. DBL Group in Bangladesh has reduced emissions by 30% in 2023 compared to its 2020 baseline, showing progress in challenging conditions. Without broader policy incentives, like subsidies or tax breaks, even those leading the transition risk decarbonising themselves out of business. What's missing is a bridge: regulatory frameworks that recognise supply chain diversity and create viable transition pathways for different players. Without it, we'll see more compliance fatigue than real impact. The investment gap: from rhetoric to resourcesThe biggest roadblock to decarbonisation is misaligned incentives. Brands prioritising cost and speed make long-term sustainability investments difficult to justify, especially when the benefits, both environmental and financial, are realised downstream in the supply chain. Renewables, efficiency upgrades, and low-impact materials carry high upfront costs, yet funding remains largely inaccessible to end suppliers. Financial institutions cite high risks and uncertain returns, while limited green loans often come with rigid terms and high interest rates. Many suppliers turn to self-financing, which limits how quickly solutions can be implemented. The McKinsey \"Fashion on Climate\" report indicates that decarbonising the fashion industry requires approximately (EURO)50bn ($54bn) annual investment by 2030 in upstream production phases where suppliers operate. Even modest energy efficiency projects often require substantial capital that many manufacturers struggle to secure. The gap between global climate finance and factory-level implementation is stark: Green Climate Fund have allocated over $300m to Pakistan, yet these resources rarely reach textile manufacturers directly. While Proparco's collaboration with APTMA shows potential, manufacturers still face an immediate capital deficit for emissions reduction projects with proven ROI. Programmes such as the Apparel Impact Institute's Clean by Design highlight how brand-led investments can drive decarbonisation with an average 9% emissions reduction and approximately 14-month payback period, proving sustainability can be financially viable when properly structured. Interloop's partnership with Target through Clean by Design delivered tangible results, implementing 10 best practices to reduce emissions and water use in its hosiery plant, with plans to scale across other units. The pilot shows how direct brand-supplier collaboration creates shared value from efficiency gains and reduced environmental impact. Multi-stakeholder efforts like UNFCCC's Fashion Charter, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), and IFC's Partnership for Cleaner Textiles (PaCT) provide frameworks and funding mechanisms. However, participation remains uneven, and many small to mid-sized manufacturers struggle to access support. These initiatives must move beyond voluntary commitments to structured funding models. Credit: Interloop. Circularity: moving beyond pilot projectsRecycling production waste, designing for longevity, and tracking material flows -circularity is gaining traction, but it's still far from mainstream. Most supply chains weren't built with circularity in mind, which means retrofitting these practices takes time, investment, and buy-in from all stakeholders. Some manufacturers are pushing ahead. Interloop is closing the loop by turning textile waste into new yarns and reducing material loss through digital waste mapping. In Thailand, Indorama Ventures has committed to recycling 750,000 tonnes of post-consumer PET bottles into textile fibres annually by 2025. But without large-scale commitments from brands to source these materials, circularity remains fragmented rather than an industry-wide shift. It needs to move beyond pilot projects and become an integrated part of sourcing strategies. The emissions paradox: growth versus reduction targetsThe climate equity challenge facing the textile industry reflects broader global imbalances. Pakistan contributes less than 1% of global emissions but faces the same reduction targets as major industrial emitters. According to Our World in Data, per capita CO2 emissions in 2021 showed stark disparities: the average US citizen produced 14.9 tonnes, while Pakistan's per capita emissions were only 1.06 tonnes. The \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" principle from the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, acknowledges countries' varying capabilities and historical contributions to emissions. Yet textile decarbonisation frameworks rarely reflect this nuance, often applying uniform standards across different economic contexts. This creates a paradox where growing manufacturers in developing economies must simultaneously increase production while drastically cutting emissions, often without the technological or financial resources available to their counterparts in developed nations. Credit: Interloop. Collaboration in action: models that workDecarbonisation is not just about meeting sustainability targets, it's about long-term industry survival. Cross-border initiatives are catalysing promising change in Pakistan's textile sector. Through Bestseller's FWD &gt;&gt; ENV Programme, Interloop has identified pathways to reduce water use by 9% and carbon emissions by 10% across its hosiery plants. Simultaneously, the Sweden-Pakistan Sustainable Textile Platform, backed by the Swedish Embassy with IKEA and H&amp;M, is accelerating renewable energy adoption and circular economy models. What sets these initiatives apart is their combination of technical expertise, implementation support, and continuous performance tracking. H&amp;M Group invested SEK1.7bn ($170m) in 2024 on decarbonisation across their value chain, including co-investing in energy efficient projects with suppliers in Bangladesh. Similarly, VF Corporation's \"Green Bond\" sourcing programme gives preferential business allocation to suppliers demonstrating strong sustainability performance. Manufacturers are engaging with their own Scope 3 partners, such as farmers at the bottom of the value chain, by adopting traceability platforms like Looptrace to measure, report, and reduce their carbon footprint. Better Cotton has also been developing initiatives to improve traceability across the cotton supply chain. The only way forward is collective action, where decarbonisation is treated as a shared responsibility, not a competitive advantage. Instead of fragmented roadmaps for each customer, suppliers need consolidated baselines, preferential purchasing agreements, and financial incentives for those leading the transition. If decarbonisation efforts aren't uniformly adopted, cost imbalances will leave proactive suppliers at a disadvantage. A call for meaningful partnershipWe invite brands to join suppliers in accelerating the industry's transformation through: Establishing co-investment funds that directly support supplier decarbonisation with shared risk Implementing price premiums for verified low-carbon products Developing long-term purchasing agreements that provide financial security for sustainability investments Creating regional adjustment factors that recognise the diverse starting points of global suppliers Suppliers are taking steps, but they need more than expectations and compliance mandates. They need investment, technology transfer, and systemic shifts that acknowledge the complexities of manufacturing at scale. The shift from transactional relationships to strategic brand-supplier partnerships isn't just necessary, it's overdue. At Interloop, we have experienced first-hand how shared investment can accelerate progress. Our industry's decarbonisation depends on whether we can move beyond rhetoric to create financial mechanisms, implementation support, and fair value distribution across the supply chain.

The industry&amp;#8217;s annual CO2 emissions, contributing about 6-8% of the global total according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), must be tackled where textiles actually come to life: in manufacturing facilities across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The textile industry stands at a crossroads. The pressure to decarbonise is mounting as brands make bold commitments, regulations tighten, and consumers demand accountability. But the real work   implementing change   rests with suppliers who face unique operational and financial constraints that aren&amp;#8217;t always visible in sustainability discussions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This shift isn&amp;#8217;t about installing solar panels or tweaking a process here and there. It&amp;#8217;s about rethinking how textiles are made, questioning outdated systems, and addressing practical on-ground realities. The challenge isn&amp;#8217;t that solutions don&amp;#8217;t exist, it&amp;#8217;s that scaling them is an uphill battle.</p><p>The energy equation: who pays for decarbonisation?</p><p>Most of the industry&amp;#8217;s energy consumption is said to occur in dyeing and finishing, yet access to renewable energy remains inconsistent across manufacturing regions. Some have the infrastructure to support large-scale adoption, while others are still locked into fossil fuel dependency.</p><p>There&amp;#8217;s no debate that energy transition is necessary, but the approach raises questions: Who bears the cost? Should suppliers shoulder it alone? Why aren&amp;#8217;t brands investing more directly in supply chain decarbonisation beyond demanding emissions reductions? Meanwhile, suppliers operate on tight margins with limited access to capital for upgrades.</p><p>According to McKinsey, most decarbonisation actions in fashion manufacturing can be implemented at a cost of less than $50 per tonne of CO2, with limited impact on production costs. This finding presents an opportunity for strategic investment across the value chain, but requires thoughtful cost sharing between brands and suppliers.</p><p>Progressive manufacturers are making significant investments. Interloop Limited in Pakistan powers 51% of its energy through renewables, having phased out coal entirely. Pratibha Syntex in India, with support from Good Fashion Fund s $4.5m loan, is saving 50% in energy water, and materials.</p><p>While financing options are emerging, navigating them remains a challenge. In Pakistan, the State Bank&amp;#8217;s green schemes and NAMA Support Project&amp;#8217;s low-interest loans for textile SMEs, remain insufficient for the scale of transformation needed. The funding landscape is fractured, creating uneven access that disadvantages suppliers working across multiple brand portfolios.</p><p>Achieving net-zero industry-wide requires financing models that create equitable distribution of costs. What s missing is coordinated investment that matches the scale of our climate ambitions. Brands with decarbonisation funds tend to invest where they can book the maximum advantage for their product footprints. For multi-category suppliers working with several customers, this complicates funding access and slows progress.</p><p>Credit: Interloop.</p><p>Regulations: a compliance burden or an opportunity?</p><p>The wave of climate regulations, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU&amp;#8217;s Fit for 55 package, the US Inflation Reduction Act, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), is designed to drive accountability. But for suppliers, it often translates into another layer of complexity they must navigate alone. Many operate in regions where regulatory frameworks are still evolving, making compliance both a logistical and financial challenge.</p><p>Some might argue compliance is simply the cost of doing business today, but this overlooks major regional disparities in infrastructure, resources, and governmental support. While EU suppliers can access programmes like the Just Transition Fund to finance their green transition, manufacturers in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka often lack similar support mechanisms. A one-size-fits-all approach won&amp;#8217;t work.</p><p>Proactive suppliers are aligning with science-based targets despite limited regional support   Interloop targets a 51% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, 30% in Scope 3, investing in LEED-certified manufacturing, clean energy, and material traceability. DBL Group in Bangladesh has reduced emissions by 30% in 2023 compared to its 2020 baseline, showing progress in challenging conditions.</p><p>Without broader policy incentives, like subsidies or tax breaks, even those leading the transition risk decarbonising themselves out of business. What&amp;#8217;s missing is a bridge: regulatory frameworks that recognise supply chain diversity and create viable transition pathways for different players. Without it, we&amp;#8217;ll see more compliance fatigue than real impact.</p><p>The investment gap: from rhetoric to resources</p><p>The biggest roadblock to decarbonisation is misaligned incentives. Brands prioritising cost and speed make long-term sustainability investments difficult to justify, especially when the benefits, both environmental and financial, are realised downstream in the supply chain.</p><p>Renewables, efficiency upgrades, and low-impact materials carry high upfront costs, yet funding remains largely inaccessible to end suppliers. Financial institutions cite high risks and uncertain returns, while limited green loans often come with rigid terms and high interest rates. Many suppliers turn to self-financing, which limits how quickly solutions can be implemented.</p><p>The McKinsey &amp;#8220;Fashion on Climate&amp;#8221; report indicates that decarbonising the fashion industry requires approximately  50bn ($54bn) annual investment by 2030 in upstream production phases where suppliers operate. Even modest energy efficiency projects often require substantial capital that many manufacturers struggle to secure.</p><p>The gap between global climate finance and factory-level implementation is stark: Green Climate Fund have allocated over $300m to Pakistan, yet these resources rarely reach textile manufacturers directly. While Proparco&amp;#8217;s collaboration with APTMA shows potential, manufacturers still face an immediate capital deficit for emissions reduction projects with proven ROI.</p><p>Programmes such as the Apparel Impact Institute&amp;#8217;s Clean by Design highlight how brand-led investments can drive decarbonisation with an average 9% emissions reduction and approximately 14-month payback period, proving sustainability can be financially viable when properly structured.</p><p>Interloop s partnership with Target through Clean by Design delivered tangible results, implementing 10 best practices to reduce emissions and water use in its hosiery plant, with plans to scale across other units. The pilot shows how direct brand-supplier collaboration creates shared value from efficiency gains and reduced environmental impact.</p><p>Multi-stakeholder efforts like UNFCCC&amp;#8217;s Fashion Charter, the Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC), and IFC&amp;#8217;s Partnership for Cleaner Textiles (PaCT) provide frameworks and funding mechanisms. However, participation remains uneven, and many small to mid-sized manufacturers struggle to access support. These initiatives must move beyond voluntary commitments to structured funding models.</p><p>Credit: Interloop.</p><p>Circularity: moving beyond pilot projects</p><p>Recycling production waste, designing for longevity, and tracking material flows  circularity is gaining traction, but it&amp;#8217;s still far from mainstream. Most supply chains weren&amp;#8217;t built with circularity in mind, which means retrofitting these practices takes time, investment, and buy-in from all stakeholders.</p><p>Some manufacturers are pushing ahead. Interloop is closing the loop by turning textile waste into new yarns and reducing material loss through digital waste mapping. In Thailand, Indorama Ventures has committed to recycling 750,000 tonnes of post-consumer PET bottles into textile fibres annually by 2025.</p><p>But without large-scale commitments from brands to source these materials, circularity remains fragmented rather than an industry-wide shift. It needs to move beyond pilot projects and become an integrated part of sourcing strategies.</p><p>The emissions paradox: growth versus reduction targets</p><p>The climate equity challenge facing the textile industry reflects broader global imbalances. Pakistan contributes less than 1% of global emissions but faces the same reduction targets as major industrial emitters. According to Our World in Data, per capita CO2 emissions in 2021 showed stark disparities: the average US citizen produced 14.9 tonnes, while Pakistan&amp;#8217;s per capita emissions were only 1.06 tonnes.</p><p>The &amp;#8220;common but differentiated responsibilities&amp;#8221; principle from the 1992 UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and reaffirmed in the 2015 Paris Agreement, acknowledges countries  varying capabilities and historical contributions to emissions. Yet textile decarbonisation frameworks rarely reflect this nuance, often applying uniform standards across different economic contexts.</p><p>This creates a paradox where growing manufacturers in developing economies must simultaneously increase production while drastically cutting emissions, often without the technological or financial resources available to their counterparts in developed nations.</p><p>Credit: Interloop.</p><p>Collaboration in action: models that work</p><p>Decarbonisation is not just about meeting sustainability targets, it&amp;#8217;s about long-term industry survival. Cross-border initiatives are catalysing promising change in Pakistan&amp;#8217;s textile sector. Through Bestseller&amp;#8217;s FWD &gt;&gt; ENV Programme, Interloop has identified pathways to reduce water use by 9% and carbon emissions by 10% across its hosiery plants.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Sweden-Pakistan Sustainable Textile Platform, backed by the Swedish Embassy with IKEA and H&amp;M, is accelerating renewable energy adoption and circular economy models. What sets these initiatives apart is their combination of technical expertise, implementation support, and continuous performance tracking.</p><p>H&amp;M Group invested SEK1.7bn ($170m) in 2024 on decarbonisation across their value chain, including co-investing in energy efficient projects with suppliers in Bangladesh. Similarly, VF Corporation&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Green Bond&amp;#8221; sourcing programme gives preferential business allocation to suppliers demonstrating strong sustainability performance.</p><p>Manufacturers are engaging with their own Scope 3 partners, such as farmers at the bottom of the value chain, by adopting traceability platforms like Looptrace to measure, report, and reduce their carbon footprint. Better Cotton has also been developing initiatives to improve traceability across the cotton supply chain.</p><p>The only way forward is collective action, where decarbonisation is treated as a shared responsibility, not a competitive advantage. Instead of fragmented roadmaps for each customer, suppliers need consolidated baselines, preferential purchasing agreements, and financial incentives for those leading the transition.</p><p>If decarbonisation efforts aren&amp;#8217;t uniformly adopted, cost imbalances will leave proactive suppliers at a disadvantage.</p><p>A call for meaningful partnership</p><p>We invite brands to join suppliers in accelerating the industry&amp;#8217;s transformation through:</p><p> Establishing co-investment funds that directly support supplier decarbonisation with shared risk    Implementing price premiums for verified low-carbon products    Developing long-term purchasing agreements that provide financial security for sustainability investments    Creating regional adjustment factors that recognise the diverse starting points of global suppliers </p><p>Suppliers are taking steps, but they need more than expectations and compliance mandates. They need investment, technology transfer, and systemic shifts that acknowledge the complexities of manufacturing at scale. The shift from transactional relationships to strategic brand-supplier partnerships isn&amp;#8217;t just necessary, it&amp;#8217;s overdue.</p><p>At Interloop, we have experienced first-hand how shared investment can accelerate progress. Our industry s decarbonisation depends on whether we can move beyond rhetoric to create financial mechanisms, implementation support, and fair value distribution across the supply chain. The question isn t whether we can decarbonise, its whether we re willing to do it together.</p><p>About the author: </p><p>Noor Jehan Sadiq is Head of Marketing Communications at Interloop Limited, where she leads brand strategy and marketing for one of Pakistan s largest textile manufacturers.

Fair emissions allowances rely on effort-sharing formulas based on fairness principles, yielding diverse outcomes. These variations, shaped by normative decisions, complicate policymaking and legal assessments of climate targets. Here we provide up-to-date numbers, comprehensively accounting for three dimensions\u2014physical and social uncertainties, global strategies and equity\u2014and the relative impact of them on each country\u2019s emissions allowance. In the short run, normative considerations substantially impact fair emissions allowances\u2014directing current discussions to this debate\u2014while global discussions on temperature targets and non-CO2 emissions take over in the long run. We identify many countries with insufficient nationally determined contributions in light of fairness and discuss implications for increased domestic mitigation and financing emissions reductions abroad\u2014yielding a total international finance flux of $US0.5\u20137.4 trillion in 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fair climate targets aligned with the Paris Agreement can be calculated in multiple ways, yielding diverse outcomes. Researchers unpack how equity, global strategies and political and social uncertainties shape fair share allocations, using them to assess nationally determined contributions and guide global climate finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis></p><p>The recent Global Stocktake has shown that current combined action by countries is not enough to meet the Paris Agreement climate goals. With a remaining carbon budget (RCB) of roughly 5 (for 1.5 \u00b0C) to 25 (for 2.0 \u00b0C) times the annual emissions in 20241, 2\u20133, global emissions have to decrease rapidly to keep these global targets within reach. Both current unconditional nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and current policies are expected to limit warming by 2100 to between 2.5 and 3 \u00b0C (refs. 4, 5, 6, 7\u20138). There is no agreement on the required additional contribution of each country for closing the gap between agreed global temperature goals and current collective mitigation efforts.</p><p>With updated NDCs due in 2025, informing policymakers on fair Paris-aligned emissions targets is crucial. Effort sharing has received attention both inside9 and outside10, 11\u201312 academia, yielding a rich literature along a variety of fairness principles13, 14\u201315. Collectively, these studies result in large ranges of fair emissions targets9, 10, 11\u201312,16. However, this variability of the results\u2014stemming from both normative17 and non-normative factors\u2014remains underexplored. Many calculations are done from only a selection of perspectives and uncertainties, leading to confusion or cherry-picking when non-academics use this \u2018black box\u2019 on fair shares15,18,19 and want to assess what levers and considerations are affecting the results. Hence, a systematic study on determining fair emissions targets and the factors impacting them is missing. In this research, we provide three advances with respect to current literature, in addition to providing up-to-date fair targets. First, we compute these targets across a wide range of impacting factors and their uncertainties, creating a more comprehensive and transparent dataset20. Second, we identify the impact of each factor on the fair targets using Sobol decomposition analysis21. Third, implications for domestic mitigation and international finance are derived by comparing the targets to NDCs and cost-optimal emissions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Three dimensions that impact fair shares</emphasis></p><p>The extensive literature on fair emissions allocations (or \u2018fair shares\u2019) offers many computation approaches. This study focuses on fairness in the mitigation burden, acknowledging that climate equity extends beyond mitigation22. Using global peak temperature target as a constraint (that is, aside from, although engaging with discussions on overshoot23, feasibility24 or cost optimality25) four key fair share concepts13,24,26,27 emerge, discussed in Supplementary Fig. 2. Beyond these methodological concepts, there are many choices, assumptions and uncertainties that affect fair shares and are traditionally studied separately. We bring them together and sort them into three dimensions (Table 1) based on how they are decided.Table 1</p><p>Key dimensions of setting a fair national emissions target</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Physical + social uncertainties</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Global strategies</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Equity considerations</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Epistemic/scientific</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Political</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col3\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Normative</emphasis></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Climate sensitivity</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Temperature target and overshoot</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Allocation principle (responsibility, capability or equality)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">GDP projections</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Global timing of action</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Detailed normative parameters (for example, discounting of historical emissions)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Population projections</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Global negative emissions</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Global non-CO<sub>2</sub> reductions</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Physical + social uncertaintiesGlobal strategiesEquity considerations<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Epistemic/scientific</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Political</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Normative</emphasis>Climate sensitivityTemperature target and overshootAllocation principle (responsibility, capability or equality)GDP projectionsGlobal timing of actionDetailed normative parameters (for example, discounting of historical emissions)Population projectionsGlobal negative emissionsGlobal non-CO2 reductions</p><p>Note that elements could be argued to be part of various dimensions, but this partitioning is merely used for presentation purposes later in the paper.</p><p>The first dimension involves scientific uncertainties, both physical and social. Physical uncertainties are mainly associated with uncertainty in Earth\u2019s temperature response to emissions (expressed in probability percentiles of reaching targets or a percentile of climate sensitivity), which greatly impacts the RCB3,28, in turn affecting global and (therefore) national emissions trajectories. In many studies, a single probability percentage of reaching a certain climate target (that is, a single percentile of the climate sensitivity) is used to calculate the remaining carbon budget (for example, reaching 1.5 \u00b0C with 50% probability14), although this exact percentage differs among studies (for example, a 50 or 67% likelihood13,26). Social uncertainties linked to projections of gross domestic product (GDP) and population are captured in Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)29 and affect emissions allocations that are based on equality and capability considerations. Most existing literature only considers the \u2018middle-of-the-road\u2019 scenario SSP213 with some exceptions30.</p><p>The second dimension concerns global strategies for meeting the Paris Agreement goals, where we include temperature goals, mitigation timing and assumptions on negative and non-CO2 emissions. Most studies focus on 1.5 \u00b0C and (well below) 2.0 \u00b0C with either 50% or 67% probability, often omitting intermediate and overshoot options\u2014even though in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, working group III (IPCC WGIII) report31, a distinction is made between 1.5 \u00b0C scenarios with \u2018no or limited overshoot\u2019 (C1) and \u2018with overshoot\u2019 (C2), linked to varying carbon budgets. Near-term mitigation timing substantially affects global emissions31 but remains understudied in the context of effort sharing. Negative emissions, although scientifically uncertain, have a major political dimension32. Explicit reference to assumed non-CO2 trajectories is often missing, while it is proven28 to be highly variant and influential in determining the RCB, illustrated in recent updates2,3,31. Due to uncertainties in reduction potentials of non-CO2 emissions, they could also be regarded a physical and social uncertainty.</p><p>The third dimension focuses on normative considerations: how to equitably distribute the efforts to achieve the climate goals. Commonly this is studied using fairness principles13, 14, 15, 16\u201317,22,33, 34\u201335, three of which are (1) responsibility, that is, historical contribution to global warming, (2) capability, that is, having the means to reduce emissions and (3) equality, that is, each individual the same. In this Article, we focus on these three, motivated by chapter 6 of the Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of IPCC WGIII report and the Common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR) principle formalized in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreements. However, the choice of only these three is argued to be not value neutral and narrow scoped22: various extensions22 and subcategories35 of these concepts exist, including the right to development34, distributing welfare costs or damages (for example, prioritarianism)9 and bottom-up approaches15. In many studies only a selection of these principles is chosen15,27,34, making it difficult to indicate the exact implications of each equity consideration22.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emissions allocations and their uncertainty</emphasis></p><p>For the first time, we quantify fair emissions allocations in a unified framework across a wide variety of parameters and choices, spanning the three variability dimensions in Table 1. This requires global emissions pathways, which vary substantially\u2014for example, even \u2018Paris-aligned\u2019 is interpreted as different temperature targets13,15 and emissions pathway shapes26,36. We emulate greenhouse gas pathways including land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF; more complete but contentious being geographic based) and explicitly varied along all relevant uncertainties. Cumulative emissions are constrained by peak temperature targets and climate sensitivities (via RCB estimates1,3), and pathway shapes are affected by assumptions on near-term mitigation action levels, non-CO2 emissions trajectories28 and negative emissions levels (informed by scenarios from the IPCC WGIII AR6 database31,37). Uncertainty ranges in Fig. 1a illustrate how pathways differ in 2030 and 2040, even for the same temperature target. Unless stated otherwise, we use 1.6 \u00b0C (50% probability) as the default, representing a \u20181.5 \u00b0C allowing a limited overshoot\u2019 pathway, aligning with the average in IPCC WGIII C1 scenarios.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GHG emissions allocations across various fairness principles.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Global emissions trajectories for various temperature targets and historical and baseline emissions pathways (in Gt CO2-equivalents). 2030 reduction percentages with respect to 2021 are indicated (Supplementary Information D). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Principle that allocates most to the country (dots, sized by population) indicated in colours, with historical emissions per capita on the vertical and GDP per capita on the horizontal (logarithmic axes).

These allocation rules are commonly found in previous literature13 (Methods). For reference, cost-optimal pathways to climate targets and non-policy baseline (grey in Fig. 1) results from integrated assessment models (IAMs) are also computed, and Grandfathering (GF) is added in Table 2, which preserves current inequality and is therefore commonly regarded in literature as inconsistent with distributive justice9 and international law16. Grandfathering affects various rules that start at current emissions levels27.Table 2</p><p>Overview of allocation rules</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Name</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Equity principle</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Description</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col4\" namest=\"col1\">Main rules (results used throughout main paper)</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PCC</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Per capita convergence</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Equality</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Converge from GF allocations over time to PC allocations.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">ECPC</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Equal cumulative per capita</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Responsibility (and equality)</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Emissions allocations converge to fully spending a rightful remaining budget (or conversely, redeeming a debt) based on historical emissions and what the country had the right to emit based on contemporary population.

Countries such as China, South Africa and Brazil receive the highest allocations under AP (yellow), which favours nations with lower GDP per capita and high baseline (that is no climate policy) emissions. In the bottom left, poorer countries with low historical emissions (for example, India and Nigeria) receive the highest allocations under ECPC (purple).</p><p>Figure 1c,d compares allocations to NDC levels, showing that fairness-based allocations are typically lower than NDC projections (green), except for ECPC in India and all allocations for Nigeria. For countries such as China, Brazil, the European Union and the USA, none of the effort-sharing methods align with the country\u2019s current NDC, except within uncertainty margins. China\u2019s rapid rise in recent per capita emissions and GDP, along coupled with a decreasing global budget, show that unlike many low-income countries, it favours AP. However, under ECPC (purple, Fig. 1d), Chinese allocations show striking uncertainty: around 5\u201310 GtCO2e in 2030 under most conditions, but up to 30 GtCO2e if no historical emissions discounting is applied and emissions back to 1850 are considered. Nigeria, illustrative of many global south countries in this regard, receives high and increasing allocations for ECPC and AP due to its historically low emissions, current low emissions and low GDP. PCC provides Nigeria with moderately high allocations, aligning closely with its 2030 NDC targets.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effect of three dimensions on fair shares</emphasis></p><p>Table 1 groups uncertainty factors into three dimensions\u2014scientific (physical/social), political (global strategies) and normative (equity)\u2014and evaluates their impact on fair shares. Countries are affected differently by these dimensions. Allocation rules (Fig. 1c\u2013d) are expectedly heterogeneous, but the effect of non-equity factors such as socio-economic projections also yield diverse outcomes. Higher-order interactions exist, such as between allocation rule and socio-economic scenario. The impact of all dimensions is analysed using Sobol variance decomposition21 (common in sustainability research38, 39\u201340; Fig. 2).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Drivers of fair shares.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Relative importance of each of the three dimensions (Table 1), measured by fraction of variance explained, including first-order and higher-order variations. The proximity to any of the three corners marks the importance of any of these dimensions to the allocated emissions. This assessment is shown for each five-year increment between 2030 and 2100. Each individual country is represented by a grey line, and a few countries are highlighted (the colours are meaningless\u2014the legend only applies to <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>). <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>, Fraction of variance explained by each individual factor for the USA (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), China (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), India (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>) and Nigeria (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) over time. Red/yellow shades indicate factors belonging to the equity dimension, blue shades to the physical and social uncertainties dimension and green shades to the global strategies dimension\u2014as indicated in the legend at the bottom. Methods provide details on the decomposition.</p><p>The axes show the share of variance in emissions allocations explained by each factor: for example, the top corner of Fig. 2a indicates global considerations to be most important to a country\u2019s allocations. For most countries, equity considerations are the most impactful, particularly due to ECPC. Figure 2b\u2013e shows that equity parameters such as convergence year, historical start year (from which to start historical debt) and discount factor (red shades) influence allocations mainly in the short run. Over time, global strategies gain prominence. Physical and social uncertainties become substantial after 2050, whereas negative emissions and non-CO2 reductions have minimal near-term impact. Variation in the timing of action is excluded under constraints of 1.5 \u00b0C with limited overshoot.</p><p>For some countries such as China and the USA, near-term impact of equity considerations depends heavily on how allocation rules are parameterized (for example, how far back historical emissions are considered has a major impact on their historical debt; Fig. 1c). China\u2019s recent rise in emissions above its per capita share amplifies this. Mexico (blue in Fig. 2a) has little historical debt or remaining budget and emits close to its per capita share and capability share, making its fair share almost independent from equity discussions. India is allocated high fair shares according to the responsibility principle and much less so for other principles. This is reflected in the high importance of allocation rule choice (yellow) in Fig. 2d in the short run. Over time, however, when responsibility converges more closely to capability and equality, considerations on peak temperature, negative emissions and climate sensitivity take over. Equity considerations remain important for Nigerian allocations up to 2100, but for reasons opposite to China and the USA, as Nigeria receives substantial allocations from all fairness perspectives, differing only in magnitude. Across the board, convergence year for achieving fairness in the PCC and ECPC rules remains a crucial discussion, explaining 10\u201340% of the variance in 2050 (Fig. 2b\u2013e). Note that an \u2018immediate\u2019 convergence year could be considered more equitable in the short run\u2014yielding discontinuity27 from current emissions levels (Supplementary Fig. 2, concept 3), emphasizing the importance of this debate even further.</p><p>Summarized, whether equity or global consideration drive fair emissions targets greatly differs among countries. Both the wealthiest and poorest rely on equity considerations, whereas various middle-income economies depend relatively more on global considerations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robust assessments of NDCs and cost-optimal mitigation</emphasis></p><p>Fair emissions allocations has implications for domestic mitigation and international mitigation funding. The extent of these consequences requires comparison with current NDCs and cost-optimal results, which we analyse for two parameter sets in Fig. 3 (Methods). Figure 3a,c uses \u2018default settings\u2019 (medium-level parameters), whereas Fig. 3b,d uses \u2018maximum settings\u2019 (parameters leading to least-stringent targets, also including 2.0 \u00b0C under various climate sensitivities). At the country level, only the least-stringent allocation rule (AP, PCC or ECPC) is shown, collectively leading to a gap with the Paris goals15. Default settings yield a 2030 emissions gap of 13.9 GtCO2e in 2030 (Fig. 3; two times the gap of 1.5 \u00b0C with current policies41), whereas under maximum settings, this gap is 79.9 GtCO2e. Note that not all countries are even on track to meeting their NDCs42.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison of fair emissions allowances to NDCs and cost-optimal projections.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Comparison of country\u2019s fair shares (least-stringent allocation among rules AP, ECPC and PCC) to NDCs. Positive, red values indicate countries whose NDC is insufficient (that is, higher than allocation). Negative, blue values indicate countries whose NDC is sufficient (that is, lower than allocation). Gaps originating from choosing country-optimal settings, compared to the global pathway, are annotated at the top. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>, Similar, but compared to cost-optimal emissions projections in 2030. In the left panels, this is done on default allocation settings (1.6 \u00b0C, 50%; Supplementary Table 4); in the right panels, this is done on maximum allocation settings (the most favourable parameters and choices per country). Cost-optimal emissions are obtained from cost-optimal model runs in the IPCC AR6 scenario database37. Only scenarios that reach a maximum of 1.5 \u00b0C or have a slight temporal overshoot have been used (that is, C1 scenarios; Methods). Cost-optimal results for countries that are native model regions are shown when possible, otherwise downscaled R10 results are used (Methods). Countries with no NDC data are grey in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>.</p><p>Fig. 3a,b shows that many countries\u2014across many income levels\u2014have insufficient NDCs. Russia, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Argentina aim for over twice their fair share under default settings. Several countries in the global south set more ambitious NDCs than their least-stringent rule. Fig. 3c,d compares emissions projections from cost-optimal models, which generally do not specify financiers of mitigation31, making them appear inequitable25. The gap between cost-optimal emissions and fair allowances is indicative for international mitigation finance needed by a country to achieve its NDC and for Internationally Transferrable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs): a concept from Article 6 in the Paris Agreement27. Countries with fair targets exceeding cost-optimal reduction (brown) could buy emissions allowances, such as the USA (20%), Russia (60%) and Saudi Arabia (82%). The opposite is true for many global south countries such as Brazil, India and most African countries. Brazil\u2019s negative emissions potential (bio-energy and afforestation) and India\u2019s reliance on coal influence this. African countries\u2019 high fair allocations, not just mitigation potential, drive the difference with cost-optimal results in Fig. 3c,d. Under maximum allocation settings, no country is allocated less than cost optimal, mostly due to the lenience in the 2.0 \u00b0C fairness results (embraced in maximum settings), with respect to the 1.5 \u00b0C cost-optimal results.</p><p>Summarized, we find substantial gaps between fair allocations and pledges or cost-optimal results, particularly in the global north. These gaps not only incentivize countries to fund mitigation domestically and abroad, they also reflect the profound inequality of projected mitigation efforts should regional output of cost-optimal scenario modelling be used for domestic targets (for example, Figure 3.35 of the IPCC WGIII AR6 report31).</p><p>The gaps between current NDCs and fair or cost-optimal mitigation can be addressed by increasing domestically financed mitigation up to the lower of cost-optimal or fair levels, with international finance covering the remainder. Figure 4 illustrates this approach. Note that prioritizing domestic action, even beyond these levels, can be advantageous due to challenges in international funding (for example, emissions accounting, ensuring additionality, geopolitical issues) and wider benefits of a decarbonized economy (for example, energy independence, reduced air pollution). Using a 2030 carbon price of US$200 per tCO2 (based on IPCC WGIII Chapter 331, Figure 3.33, C1 scenarios), we estimate international climate finance contributions for each country. A total finance flux can be deduced of US$0.5\u20137.4 T in 2030. Because we show this for 2030 and on an inter-country level, this is in line with previous work43 that estimated US$0.25\u20131.6 T annually during 2020\u20132030 for aggregated regions. We complement previous work with a broader effort-sharing analysis, comparison of NDCs and a country resolution.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Consequences of fair targets for international mitigation finance.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">l</emphasis>, Fair emissions allowances in 2030 compared with NDC (black, average between conditional and unconditional) and cost-optimal (brown) results and their consequences as a combination of increased domestic mitigation ambition (grey) and ensuring additional mitigation through international finance (paying in red, receiving in blue) for the USA (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>), the European Union (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>), Japan (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>), Saudi Arabia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), Russian Federation (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>), Brazil (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>), South Africa (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">g</emphasis>), Indonesia (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">h</emphasis>), Mexico (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">i</emphasis>), China (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">j</emphasis>), India (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">k</emphasis>) and Nigeria (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">l</emphasis>). Fair emissions allowances are shown for ECPC (proxying responsibility; purple), AP (proxying capability; yellow) and PCC (proxying equality; dark blue) under default settings (minima and maxima across all global and allocation rule variables in whiskers, apart from temperature (1.6 \u00b0C), climate sensitivity (50%) and convergence year (2050\u20132080)). The top panel shows an example; the rest are individual countries as depicted on the left. Default settings for a 1.6 \u00b0C, 50% pathway are used here. Globally cost-optimal results are obtained as averaged from the IPCC AR6 WGIII scenario database, C1 category (Methods) with 10\u201390 quantiles across scenarios that project these regions in whiskers. To the right, the gaps (default settings) between fair allocations, cost-optimal emissions and NDC projections are given in GHG emissions (GtCO2e). In the text, we also provide a few estimates of how these emissions gaps could translate to financial flows.</p><p>For the USA and the European Union (Fig. 4a,b), fair reductions exceed cost-optimal levels, making international finance the cheapest way to close the gap with NDC reductions, amounting to 12.8 and 3.3 GtCO2e (US$2.6 T and US$0.7 T, ECPC in 2030), respectively. For Japan, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Indonesia and Mexico (Fig. 4c\u2013h), the gaps between NDC and fair targets are often substantial and a combination of funding domestic mitigation and paying for mitigation elsewhere. For China and Mexico (Fig. 4i,j), the results show almost full closing of the gap through additional domestic mitigation funding (up to US$1.3 T in China)\u2014relatively invariant across the rules (confirming Fig. 2). Outcomes for various countries vary, also qualitatively, by fairness principle: India (Fig. 4k), for instance, receives US$3.1 T under ECPC but funds up to US$0.4 T under PCC and AP domestically. Many global south countries such as Nigeria (Fig. 4l) have fair allowances exceeding NDCs and cost-optimal results, making it fair and cost effective to fund mitigation there (US$0.06\u20130.4 T in Nigeria).</p><p>Summarized, most 2030 NDCs are substantially insufficient\u2014except for the least-developed countries. Financial implications vary by allocation method but also by other factors (whiskers and Fig. 2). In addition, high fair shares do not justify avoiding mitigation but necessitate policies enabling decarbonization with international investment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion and implications</emphasis></p><p>This paper acts as a guide to the \u2018black box\u2019 of fair shares. There are three main merits of this work. The first merit is providing a comprehensive public emissions allowances database, including a large range of approaches and allocation rules, recent data on population, GDP, historical emissions, the remaining carbon budget3, negative emissions, influence of uncertainty on non-CO228 and global emissions pathways in general37. The global emissions pathway emulator created to make these computations has potential for other applications as well. The emissions allocations confirm previous estimates13,24, are updated with developments of the last decade, and the resulting stringent targets for many global north countries emphasize profound inequality. Additionally, we include resolutions and factors often excluded in previous work13,16,25 (for example, non-CO2 emissions reductions, socio-economic scenarios, country-level results even in baselines and cost-optimal output).</p><p>The second merit of this paper is showing the importance of each choice or uncertainty on fair targets, through explicitly decomposing ten unique factors. This is useful for policymaking because it yields understanding of consequences of certain viewpoints or global aims. The paper therefore complements other literature that relies on fair emissions computations by introducing this novel layer of impact factors\u2014for example, results on net-zero carbon debt23 or investment needs43 can now be re-interpreted from the point of view of what affects these results beyond only varying equity principles. We find that a large heterogeneity among countries in terms of how important equity considerations are for their fair allocations. For instance, China\u2019s historical debt is highly sensitive to exactly how it is computed and Indian allocations are high under the responsibility principle, but over time, are mostly impacted by global discussions on peak temperature, negative emissions and climate sensitivity.</p><p>The third merit of this paper is highlighting the implications of fair emissions allowances to NDCs and international mitigation funding together in one framework (complementing other work13,43 that focused on one or the other). These are major ingredients for the NDC revision round in 2025. We identify insufficient NDCs of many high- and low-income countries, notably the European Union, the USA, Russia, China and Saudi Arabia, even in light of least-stringent fairness principles. Cost-optimal results suggest that the European Union and the USA may need to fund mitigation abroad to meet fair targets. Other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Russia and China, can best implement a combination of increased domestic action and international finance to reach their fair targets. Achieving only the least-stringent targets leaves a substantial gap, necessitating further reductions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global emissions pathways</emphasis></p><p>Existing emissions pathways do not cover all parameter combinations in this analysis. To build a comprehensive database with such emissions pathways, we emulate pathways for different levels of peak temperature and climate sensitivity (or \u2018probability\u2019), based on existing information from different sources (Supplementary Table 4), through the following steps.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 1\u2014non-CO2 pathways</emphasis></p><p>The analysis starts with non-CO2 pathways, because these determine the CO2 budget, apart from other global settings. The IPCC AR6 WGIII database details temperature outcomes from each scenario. For each temperature level, a range of non-CO2 pathways exists. We utilize this information by varying a parameter in our framework (17\u201383%) that represents a quantile from the distribution in non-CO2 reduction levels by 2040 under a given temperature (and climate sensitivity), taken from the IPCC AR6 database. Note that non-CO2 projections from the AR6 scenario database have limitations of their own: not all models project all non-CO2 gases directly from all possible sources, for example. Therefore, we only focus on pathways of methane and nitrous oxide, being the two main anthropogenic non-CO2 greenhouse gases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 2\u2014remaining CO2 budget</emphasis></p><p>For each level of peak temperature, climate sensitivity and non-CO2 reduction percentile, the remaining CO2 budget can be derived by combining the budgets derived by Forster et al2. with recent insights in the effect of varying non-CO2 assumptions on CO2 budgets28. We first use a linear regression between the parameters of temperature and climate sensitivity and the CO2 budget (on default non-CO2 pathways that were assumed by Forster). For some combinations this means that there is a (small) regression error of the budgets as reported by Forster et al. (2023)\u2014Supplementary Information C. The regression is necessary to allow exploration of the full parameter space. Then, we deviate from these budgets based on varying non-CO2 peak warming quantiles: more warming implies a smaller budget. These quantiles are obtained from the (temperature-stratified) distribution in non-CO2 warmings at the century-peak temperature across scenario entries in the AR6 database, as computed by MAGICCv7.5.3 as part of the AR6 climate diagnostics, following related work3. Global warming potentials from IPCC AR6 are used.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Step 3\u2014pathways of CO2 and all greenhouse gases</emphasis></p><p>We derive CO2 pathway shapes by sampling from the AR6 database of IAM outputs, then adjust them to match the CO2 budget. We differentiate between pathways with immediate climate policy and those with delayed policy until 2030 (as per AR6 metadata). Whereas peak temperature and other factors constrain emissions before the peak, the pathway beyond that is more flexible and influenced by negative emissions. We incorporate this by sampling emissions pathways based on 2100 emissions quantiles in the AR6 scenarios as a proxy for the deployment of negative emissions technologies. The budget-corrected CO2 emissions pathways are added to the earlier derived non-CO2 pathways using GWP100 from AR6 (273 for N2O and 28.5 for CH4, which is the average of fossil and non-fossil sources) to obtain emissions pathways of all greenhouse gases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mathematical description of emissions pathways</emphasis></p><p>For clarity, in equation (1), we provide a summary of the above in mathematical terms. We use  here to indicate global emissions pathway, distinguishing from , which is used for emissions <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">allocations</emphasis> for country or region <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> later in the Methods.1</p><p>Here the global GHG emissions over time <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>, are split in a global CO2 part () and a global non-CO2 part (). The former is dependent on the RCB being the remaining carbon budget, depending on peak temperature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">T</emphasis>, climate sensitivity <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S</emphasis>, the non-CO2 quantile , the timing of mitigation action <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>mit and the negative emissions quantile <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Q</emphasis>neg. The peak temperature and climate sensitivity are also direct inputs to the CO2 pathways (not only via RCB) because they also determine the pathway shape\u2014that is, not only the cumulative CO2 emissions. The non-CO2 part is only dependent on peak temperature, climate sensitivity and the non-CO2 quantile.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methodological advances with respect to other work</emphasis></p><p>This study improves on previous methods across a number of considerations. First, it includes non-CO2 emissions and land-use emissions. Adding non-CO2 emissions provides insight into the trade-off between non-CO2 warming and CO2 budgets but also adds complexity and uncertainty. Other studies focus on CO2 only or add non-CO2 emissions exogenously13,46. However, that may obscure how non-CO2 impacts the remaining CO2 budget. Emissions from LULUCF are often excluded14,16,27,46 because of uncertain historical estimates and the debate47 on which emissions are regarded as anthropogenic. We acknowledge these issues, but for completeness and argued by the importance of mitigation in land use, we decided to include them building on the newest insights48. We also account for emissions from international aviation and marine transport in all global results49 but subtract these when allocating them to countries.</p><p>The second improvement we make is a broad variation of interpretations of the Paris Agreement targets. There is a strong dependence on the assumed peak temperature and climate sensitivity (or achieving probability) for all of these calculations. Studies deal with this differently and we intentionally vary various of these interpretations in the database. We provide results for all combinations of these (and more) global parameters and set \u2018default\u2019 paths on peak temperatures of 1.6 \u00b0C at 50% chance (associated with 1.5 \u00b0C with a small overshoot; close to the average of IPCC AR6 WGIII category C1) and 2.0 \u00b0C at 67% chance. Other studies, such as Fekete et al.26 and van den Berg et al.13, use different carbon budgets (for example, 1.5 \u00b0C at 67% probability). In a recent report on this topic, the European Scientific Advisory Board on Climate Change determined global pathways based on a selection of IPCC WGIII scenarios24.</p><p>A third consideration in global emissions pathways is the starting point for allocation. Some studies use the 2015 Paris Agreement24, whereas others use earlier years, such as 201013, 14\u201315. We chose 2021 for this study, the most recent possible given data availability, but acknowledge the effect of retaining emissions inequality for the historical period up to 2021. Starting later, near-term reduction targets become more lenient, but longer-term reduction targets become much more stringent due to a more depleted carbon budget over time. Depending on the context (for example, peak temperature), the \u2018turning\u2019 point on how the choice of starting year affects the reduction targets can be around 2030, 2035 or even later. The reverse is true for choosing a starting year earlier in the past.</p><p>A fourth improvement is the variety of results we provide\u2014for various years of interest and scopes. We list different fair share calculations in Supplementary Fig. 2, categorized into four concepts as outcomes of a decision tree. Typically, concepts lower in the chart require more assumptions but are more aligned with political realities. Concept 1 allocates the RCB directly each country with a cumulative CO2 emissions budget without any indication for specific years. This is useful as a general indicator for mitigation burdens13,24. When requiring allocations over time, one of the simplest assumptions is a linear spending of the fair budget (concept 2). This concept serves as an intuitive calculation for individual countries26 and suggests a net-zero CO2 year as a consequence. However, it lacks detail on post-net-zero CO2 (and negative emissions), non-CO2 allocations and does not align the total emissions of all countries with a global pathway. Concepts 3 and 4 address these gaps. Concept 3 assumes an immediate jump (dashed lines) from current emissions to fair levels, tackling fairness in the first year13,27. Concept 4 does this gradually by starting from current emissions, allowing climate action and finance to increase (rapidly) within any defined time frame. We include results across all concepts in our database20 but focus on concept 4 in the main results of this paper.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Allocating emissions to countries</emphasis></p><p>The allocation of emissions to countries can be done in many ways\u2014and not all are regarded fair. Supplementary Information (notably Supplementary Fig. 3) discusses a schematic framework guiding how the global emissions can be allocated to countries. Below, we describe how these allocations are computed. All potential values of parameters following in the equations below are listed in Supplementary Table 4.</p><p>The Grandfathering (GF) allocation method, based on continuity, gives all countries the same reduction rate, thus retaining current emissions inequality and ignoring differences in terms of responsibility, ability to reduce and expected growth. Hence this is argued to be not equitable in the case of climate policy22,50, although this method is often used as a refs. 13,14,46. Equation (2) shows how it is computed, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E(t, c)</emphasis> the allocated emissions in year <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> for country <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>w representing the world) and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>0 the analysis starting year (2021).  is the global emissions pathway, subject to all global parameters\u2014we drop all these parameters in the equations for simplicity; equation (1).2</p><p>The equality principle reflects the principle that every human being has equal rights to emissions allowances. This excludes any weights of other factors such as income, technology, differences in climate and economic structure. There are several allocation methods that quantify this principle. We include an immediate per capita rule (yellow), which takes into effect immediately (that is, 2022) and leads to a discontinuity between the historical emissions trend and the allocation (with the possibility of countries paying for this difference). It is computed as follows, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> representing population (which is independent of socio-economic scenario <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis> for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>0):3</p><p>Another rule associated with equality is the per capita convergence rule51,52 (PCC), which moves from grandfathering to a fully per capita allocation, providing a transition period, but also ensuring a longer-term equality among nations based on population53. Since, for the initial period, this approach is similar to equal relative reduction, the same critical observations apply22. An important consideration for these rules (Supplementary Table 4) is the year (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>conv) in which per capita convergence is fully converged to a per capita allocation.4where operator <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">M(x)</emphasis> equals 0 if <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> \u2264 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">0</emphasis>, x if 0 \u2264 x \u2264 1 and 1 if x \u2265 1, hence, the convergence is linear over time and after convergence to PC, it remains equal to that rule. On the basis of a combination of the equality and responsibility principles, the method equal cumulative per capita (ECPC) weights historic and future emissions based on population fractions per year. The results are substantially impacted by the year (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>hist) from which and on historical emissions are incorporated and the rate (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>d) of discounting them. In this work, we use values of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>hist the years 1850, 1950 and 1990 and discount rates of 0%, 1.6%, 2.0% and 2.8% (ref. 54). The reasoning for discounting is, in part, physical: the natural removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. The socio-economic scenario (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis>), which implicates future population growth, also impacts the results of this rule. The allocation is done in three steps. First, the cumulative (past and future) allocated GHG emissions <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B</emphasis>\u2032ECPC(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>hist, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">r</emphasis>d) of country <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> is computed based on the cumulative population share of country <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis> and is taken as fraction of the total (past and future) global emissions\u2014in which  represents the global (future) budget:5</p><p>Second, we compute what the country already historically emitted and subsequently subtract this from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">B</emphasis>ECPC to arrive at the (net) future ECPC emissions budget:6</p><p>This budget is negative for many developed countries, implying a historical debt (if negative; leftover if positive). Allocating this over time according to concept 4 in Supplementary Fig. 2 dictates starting at current emissions levels (which can still be positive for developed countries), and the definition of a convergence year (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>conv) by which the historical debts or leftovers are accounted for. After the convergence year, the ECPC allocation principle allocates purely on a per capita basis\u2014which does not add any new debt or leftover. Call the part of debt (or leftover) that is left at any moment in time <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D(t</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">)</emphasis>: being the total debt minus what is already repaid in terms of previous ECPC allocations, plus what at that year, the country is indebted to according to a per capita allocation:7</p><p>As this requires input of all previously allocated <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis>ECPC, the ECPC allocations themselves are an iterative function, involving a sine-deviation from PCC based on the responsibility\u2013inequality at time <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>:8</p><p>The dependency of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis> on previous ECPC allocations makes sure that as <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> approaches <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>conv, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis> approaches 0 and that early action is promoted over purely following the sine shape (which would in contrast maximize the responsibility effect exactly halfway to the convergence year). <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">D</emphasis> approaches zero with a small error of order 1% of original responsibility debt or leftover when reaching the convergence year. To capture the principle of capability\u2014that is, wealthy nations mitigate more of their emissions\u2014the ability to pay (AP)55 rule starts at a country\u2019s baseline emissions  (which are SSP dependent marked by variable <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">s</emphasis>) and computes a deviation from that based on GDP per capita. First, a fraction of country <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>\u2019s baseline emissions is determined, based on its GDP per capita. These are the first-order emissions to be subtracted from the baseline emissions: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">E</emphasis>sub(<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">c</emphasis>):9</p><p>The implicit assumption is that marginal abatement costs are quadratically increasing (following previous work13), which yields total abatement costs that are cubically increasing with emissions reduction. Hence the 1/3 exponent makes sure that this steep increase is counterbalanced and mitigation costs as fraction of GDP are equalized among countries. Because the reliance on GDP per capita does not fully scale linearly (that is, the sum of countries does not equal the total), we need a correction factor. Adding this yields the final equation of the ability to pay rule:10</p><p>Potentially, this rule could be combined by implementing an income level below which a country does not need to reduce its emissions56. The Greenhouse Development Rights (GDR) rule combines capability and historical responsibility in the responsibility\u2013capability index (RCI, controlled by a weighting factor <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">w</emphasis>RCI between the two principles), which emphasizes enabling countries to reach a decent level (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">l</emphasis>) of sustainable development57. Full GDR allocations are computed as follows:11</p><p>However, RCI is only defined up to 2030. Therefore, a convergence rule is implemented towards AP (similar to PCC):12</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Baseline emissions and downscaling</emphasis></p><p>Baseline emissions, required for the ability to pay (AP) and greenhouse development rights (GDR) allocation rules, are obtained from the IMAGE IAM58 for SSP1\u20133. Baseline emissions for SSP4 and SSP5 were not (up-to-date) available, but their future population and GDP projections were. IMAGE provides emissions projections for 26 regions, which we downscale to the country level using a procedure that closely follows the approach outlined in Van Vuuren et al. (2007)59. Using historical energy data from the International Energy Agency (IEA)60, it lets country-based primary energy per GDP converge at a constant growth rate from 2015 levels, such that it would reach regional average levels by 2150. Primary energy by carrier is distributed based on historical fractions for some involving convergence to regional fractions. We implement a harmonization step to ensure that the sum of each variable across all countries aligns with the regional total. CO2 emissions are computed from these projections along with emissions factors specific to each energy carrier, which is scaled to GHG emissions based on 2015 country-based ratios of CO2 to GHG emissions. The proportion of primary energy by carrier mitigated with CCS is assumed to be uniform across all countries.</p><p>We recognize that downscaling introduces additional uncertainties. Deployment of CCS may create heterogeneities among countries that are difficult to predict at this point, especially in the long run. Another key uncertainty is the translation of the downscaled CO2 emissions to GHG emissions. However, we estimate these uncertainties to play only a minor role in the main conclusions of this paper, as downscaling is only relevant for the AP rule (and GDR, which is not used in the main results) and not for major regions such as the USA, the European Union, China and India, which are native in IMAGE.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sobol analysis</emphasis></p><p>The Sobol analysis was conducted using the Python SALib package61,62. Random samples (size 1,024) were drawn for this analysis, varying all factors for every year increment between 2030 and 2100. For the results in Fig. 2, the total Sobol index (that is, including higher-order terms) was used. For the Sobol analysis, we used temperature levels between 1.5 and 2.0 degrees, with climate sensitivity percentiles, non-CO2 reduction and negative emissions quantiles of 33%, 50% and 67%, and SSP1\u2013SSP3. For more information on Sobol analysis, we refer to previous literature21,40,63. Convergence years of 2040, 2050 and 2080 are included for the ECPC and PCC allocation rules.</p><p>Note that the selection and range of factors to include in the Sobol analysis is subject to some freedom. For example, if one would add very (unfoundedly) high discount factors of historical emissions, this would add a source of variability that the Sobol analysis would attribute to the equity dimension. Therefore, this range and selection of factors is carefully chosen based on values found in literature and scenario projections in the IPCC WGIII AR6 database37 (Supplementary Table 4). Analogously, we chose to proxy the equality, responsibility and capability principles with PCC, ECPC and AP. Naturally, alternations to this choice may be a source of uncertainty for the Sobol analysis.</p><p>In the Sobol analysis results in Fig. 2, we also see individual parameters such as the convergence year of historical discounting. Those parameters sometimes only affect part but not all of the three rules (PCC, ECPC or AP). That naturally decreases the impact of these parameters on the total variance explained. For example, convergence year (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>conv) only affects PCC and ECPC results\u2014it is not a parameter in the equation for AP.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Harmonization steps</emphasis></p><p>Historical emissions data from Jones et al. (2024)48, mainly based on the PRIMAP database, serves as the reference for emissions. CO2 and non-CO2 pathways from the IPCC WGIII AR6 database are harmonized by aligning historical and projected emissions in 2021 and fully converging to their raw pathways by 2030, using a ramp function that linearly reduces the emissions gap. Population data are interpolated linearly between 2000 (end of UN data) and 2020 (start of SSP data).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cost-optimal scenarios</emphasis></p><p>For comparing fair emissions allocations with cost-optimal results (Figs. 3 and 4), we use cost-optimal scenarios from the IPCC WGIII37 C1 category: 1.5 \u00b0C peak temperatures and limited overshoot. These scenarios, produced by IAMs, project emissions under global cost optimality, using various socio-economic assumptions. Large countries such as the USA, China and India are model native, whereas for others, especially in the global south, we implemented a downscaling of cost-optimal results at R10-regional level to country-level based on current emissions fractions. Average cost-optimal projections are used (in Fig. 4, the uncertainty range is added).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online content</emphasis></p><p>Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02361-7\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02361-7</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This study benefited from the financial support of the European Union\u2019s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, via the European Climate and Energy Modelling Forum project (ECEMF, H2020 grant agreement number 101022622) and the Enabling and LEVeraging climate Action Towards net-zero Emissions project (ELEVATE, H2020 grant agreement number 101056873).

However, there is evidence that emerging climate adaptation actions in cities\u2014whether intentionally or unintentionally\u2014are contributing to widening socioeconomic inequalities. Scholars of climate urbanism have responded to this challenge by calling for efforts to tackle underlying injustices. Leveraging such insights, we provide an empirical assessment of 25 U.S. cities\u2019 plans to address distributional inequities through climate adaptation. Despite increasing scholarly attention, we find that, in practice, cities have relatively limited, but growing, engagements with distributive equity in their adaptation efforts. We find evidence that distributive strategies tend to coalesce across five key sectors: economic empowerment, food and health, housing and land use, urban greening, and water. We find that a focus on distributive climate justice\u2014as complementary to existing research on procedural equity\u2014is needed to advance broader, more comprehensive climate justice goals in cities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Cities are important arenas for mobilizing climate justice, particularly in the U.S. context where the federal government has frequently abdicated such responsibility to states and local governments. From 2021 through 2024, the U.S. federal government under President Biden\u2019s Administration advocated for a whole-of-government approach to climate action. This leadership provided an opportunity to rethink urban climate justice given the new flow of federal dollars from the Inflation Reduction Act (2022) and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (2022), through federal efforts such as the Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grants program and Carbon Pollution Reduction Grants program from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Resilience Hubs program, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s climate health equity work, and others. However, the reelection of former President Trump in November 2024 ushered in an administration openly hostile to efforts to further sustainability, climate action, and environmental justice, which has put more onus on frontline communities to address risks and adapt to uncertain climate impacts themselves.</p><p>Because many cities are already on the frontlines of extreme disaster impacts, there has been a lot of research on how cities can lead the way in reducing carbon emissions and other mitigation efforts (e.g.,1, 2\u20133). Adaptation is equally important as cities think through how to address risks in equitable and inclusive ways. Many of these efforts align with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) including SDG11 on sustainable cities and SD13 on climate action. However, even though some past federal efforts have focused on climate justice ideas (e.g., Executive Order 14008 in 2021), empirical examples are scarce with few illustrations of urban implementation.</p><p>Climate change will have differential impacts on communities, creating risks and exacerbating socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Climate justice research, which builds on environmental justice research, considers the importance of procedural, distributive, and recognitional equity and their linkages (e.g.,4, 5, 6, 7\u20138). Briefly, procedural equity refers to participation of residents, particularly those from marginalized communities. Distributive equity refers to the distribution of resources and services, while recognition refers to acknowledging and addressing specific concerns of those from marginalized communities (e.g.,9). Researchers of urban planning and climate adaptation have applied climate justice research to better understand how cities consider justice and equity in their decision-making10, 11\u201312. While most of the planning literature has focused on process, such as designing representative decision-making arrangements and public engagement/communication (mostly one-way) to advance procedural equity10,13, 14, 15\u201316, less attention has been paid to distributive equity actions.</p><p>Critical scholarship, such as that of climate urbanism (e.g.,17), call our attention to the necessity for considering distributional forms of justice that may lead to more just and equitable outcomes through adaptation planning. Scholars in this space have focused on the normative critiques of climate adaptation strategies that either exacerbate or maintain social inequality and climate vulnerability (e.g.,14,18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23\u201324).</p><p>This paper builds on such prior research by linking climate urbanism and climate justice research, specifically around what cities are doing to advance distributive equity in climate adaptation. Adaptation planning, which focuses on what actions cities are undertaking to prepare and respond to climate impacts, has been frequently understudied particularly in relation to climate mitigation, or strategies cities take to reduce drivers of climate change (e.g., greenhouse gas emissions)1, 2\u20133. While acknowledging procedural, distributive, and recognitional forms of equity are linked, here we focus on climate adaptation actions that seek to promote distributive equity given the dearth of research on what cities are trying to redistribute services to ameliorate inequalities their residents experience.</p><p>While climate urbanism offers a political economic diagnosis of the drivers of injustice across urban spaces, more nuanced interrogations of climate justice also suggests what can be done to rectify these inequalities. In bridging these literatures, we identify what cities are doing on the ground to advance equity, specifically around distributive efforts, through adaptation planning. We do this by examining the stand-alone adaptation planning documents\u2014where cities lay out their intentions to promote climate action - available as of the end of 2024, for the 25 largest U.S. cities. While many studies in this area tend to focus on a single city at a time (e.g.,12,25,) or a handful of cities (e.g.,10,14,), we have sought a larger sample of cities to better understand which actions cities are coalescing around and to identify exemplars of planned actions that seek to promote distributive equity. Doing so advances climate urbanism scholarship and adaptation research by documenting the specific ways that cities are implementing efforts to address the distribution of inequalities, thereby supplementing concurrent research on the procedural dimensions\u2014i.e., of inclusive, participatory, and community-driven approaches\u2014of adaptation planning15. It may also support ways to advance and implement broader, more comprehensive climate justice goals\u2014in response to SDGs 11 and 13 but also considering increasing federal policy uncertainties and hostilities towards both climate action and equity\u2014in U.S. cities.</p><p>There is an abundance of research showing how urban planning has at times created and exacerbated social and environmental inequality through discriminatory land use, housing, public health, and environmental decision-making26,27. Sustainable urban development, as captured in SDG 11, is key for fighting both the impacts and inequities attributed to climate change. Cities encapsulate the equity challenge among U.S. society as they are microcosms of social, economic, and political injustice as seen through many decades of unequal development, planning, and extractive development, especially arranged along racial lines and class divides. However, cities are also important sites of trialing more innovative, progressive efforts to planning14. U.S. cities and suburbs are home to a large proportion of the U.S. population\u2014~80%28\u2014making them a center of climate adaptation funding, infrastructure intervention, and policy attention. Cities are also hotspots of climate risks given the concentration of critical and expensive infrastructure and concentrated exposure of frontline communities29. As such, U.S. cities remain an important site for investigation of adaptation efforts.</p><p>Emerging through an interrogation of core theories across the fields of urban geography, critical social sciences, and the human dimensions of climate change, the literature on climate urbanism focuses on the uneven distribution of climate mitigation and adaptation investments and resulting unequal experience of climate risks by frontline communities30. Climate action, as outlined in SDG 13, is a necessary collection of strategies to develop sustainable societies, generally, and cities, specifically. Across many contexts, recent investments to support climate change action has redirected resources into technological and low-carbon infrastructure to mitigate or adapt to climate change25,30, 31\u201332. Yet most of these investments enable neoliberal regimes of capital production and accumulation, reinforcing existing forms of social exclusion, including those based on race, gender, and class30,33, 34\u201335. The result of which is continued or widening socioeconomic inequalities as climate change impacts are increasingly felt. This literature seeks to engage with the larger capitalist market systems that promote extractive, revenue-driven services, which (re)produce climate risks and inequalities, in an attempt to transform urban places in ways that prioritize justice and redefine what urban services exist and who they should serve17,20,25,36. (Although these studies offer a compelling critique of climate adaptation efforts, what adaptation actions should look like on the ground to achieve equity remains relatively undefined.</p><p>Given such critiques of the shifting and emergent neoliberal drivers of climate adaption, researchers are increasingly investigating what plans are proposing that is constructively supporting more equitable approaches to adaptation11,19,21,22,37. Recent scholarship highlights how some adaptation planning strategies have resulted in climate risks for marginalized and vulnerable communities21,38, 39\u201340. In response to such calls, there has been an uptick in scholarship developing and implementing justice and equity criteria in these efforts (see refs. 10,11). For example, Amorim-Maia et al.37 find in their case study of Barcelona, Spain that city planners with community partners engaged different tactics - disruptive planning, working across city agencies, centering care in their planning approaches, and leveraging place-based strategies for the most vulnerable residents -to advance equity and justice in adaptation strategies. Brousseau et al.41 found in their study of 101 adaptation plans and related documents in the U.S. that more recent plans tended to engage with procedural, distributive, and recognitional justice more frequently than older plans, with communities experiencing poverty more likely to seek means of addressing distributive injustice.</p><p>Despite recent advances in urban climate justice research, we see two persistent gaps in knowledge. First, though many acknowledge procedural, distributive, and recognitional equity are linked (e.g.,11,41), most adaptation research has focused predominantly on assessing procedural equity and engagement with frontline communities through workshops, consultations, participatory forums, and stakeholder committees10,14,15. For example, Fitzgerald\u2019s14 study of five climate action plans and the planners that developed them found that trust building is essential to increase procedural equity in adaptation planning. While procedural equity has been a focus of research, distributive equity has been comparatively less studied. Second, studies that have investigated questions of climate justice have tended to be theoretical (e.g.,30) or single case studies (e.g.,12,25). To fill this gap, our work assesses what multiple cities plan to do on the ground to advance distributive equity through adaptation planning.</p><p>In response to these two knowledge gaps, this paper identifies whether U.S. cities are addressing distributive equity in their adaptation planning through an analysis of local plans for the 25 largest U.S. cities. While climate urbanism offers a framework for diagnosing the drivers of urban inequality under climate change, it asserts that capitalist and speculative pathways that underline climate action leads to widening inequalities25,30. Climate justice is a framework that seeks to shed light on potential solutions to these problems of inequality. Our paper bridges these two fields by exploring how cities can focus on redistribution to tackle these drivers of inequality. To do this, we examine the kinds of strategies cities are employing in adaptation planning to address distributive equity, while identifying exemplars of what such action looks like on the ground.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p>The results of our analysis of adaptation plans for the 25 largest U.S. cities for distributional equity are presented here. For more on the data and methods see the \u201cMaterials and Methods\u201d section below.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Distributive outcomes in climate action and planning</emphasis></p><p>Our analysis found that distributional equity strategies fall into five different categories\u2014economic empowerment, food and health, housing and land use, urban greening, and water (see Table 1). Economic empowerment refers to strategies to boost residents\u2019 capacities, particularly for frontline communities. Food and health refer to actions to improve food access and health outcomes. The housing and land use category includes strategies to increase housing stock, improve its accessibility, related anti-displacement measures, energy efficiency improvements, as well as efforts to retrofit buildings. Urban greening refers to actions to increase green space, such as tree canopy and green infrastructure. Finally, the water category includes strategies to distribute water. Each category is characterized by cities attempting to distribute goods, services, and programs to climate and socially vulnerable residents to address inequities they already experience. Several categories align with typical priority planning areas of a city, such as green space or housing, for which there is frequently dedicated programmatic staff. We additionally identified categories that were cross-cutting, where priorities spanned multiple sectors. Below we provide specific programs and quotes from the plans to illustrate these distributive categories.Table 1</p><p>Distribution categories, examples, and cities organized

typeStyle=\"bf\">Economic empowerment</emphasis></p><p>Many cities\u2014namely Los Angeles, Houston, Memphis, and Sacramento\u2014include economic strategies for workforce development and job creation, particularly for climate vulnerable residents around other distributive outcomes such as through urban greening projects. For example, Houston aims to expand financial empowerment centers in under-resourced communities. As noted in the plan,</p><p>\u201cIn early 2020, the City in partnership with The Alliance [of neighborhood councils], opened three new financial empowerment centers in targeted Complete Communities [neighborhoods that have experienced historical disinvestment] that offer financial capability and financial literacy services to connect Houstonians to safe and affordable financial products and services to build savings and wealth\u201d (p. 56).</p><p>This economic strategy provides both workforce development programs and financial literacy to help residents build wealth.</p><p>Workforce development programs for under-resourced communities frequently dovetailed with other areas of distributive equity such as those related to water, waste, and land use. For example, the Memphis plan seeks a 20% reduction in cardboard and paper waste in the waste stream and a 10% food waste reduction by 2030. It also included a workforce development plan related to waste reduction and circular economies for low-income communities. The plan further suggests an economic strategy of \u201cencouraging circular economy opportunities for paper/cardboard and food waste will add jobs to the region, as well as stimulate local business partnerships to creatively use these materials\u201d (p. 141).</p><p>The Los Angeles plan offers economic strategies that both seek to adapt the city to climate change and promote multiple distributive priorities. For example, the plan reads,</p><p>\u201cIn addition to the exciting projects around clean energy and urban greening, each project will incorporate workforce development plans that include training in a number of sectors\u2014renewable energy technologies, low carbon transportation technologies, energy efficiency, waste diversion, healthy soils\u2014and fight back against displacement\u201d (p. 33).</p><p>Another example from the Los Angeles plan calls for 6500 jobs by 2025 supported by local solar installments. Finally, Sacramento plans to create workforce development around the electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure development to create living wage jobs for low-income residents (p. 27). Economic empowerment strategies such as these speak to the importance of transitioning the workforce to both reduce inequities and support the needs for climate action.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Food and health</emphasis></p><p>An area of work that cities are undertaking to further distributive climate justice includes enhancing access to goods and services for underserved communities vulnerable to climate risks, including excessive heat, as well as those lacking access to healthy foods. Such strategies reduce inequities by helping residents secure basic needs and services to support capacity building and climate adaptation.</p><p>For example, Portland plans to have cooling centers in low-income and racial minority neighborhoods for the most vulnerable residents. Columbus plans to distribute goods and services\u2014such as fans, air conditioners, and water\u2014to vulnerable groups and to provide financial instruments to help people pay for sufficient cooling during the summer. The plan writes:</p><p>\u201cAnother reason to establish a network of cooling centers is that while a list of \u201cformal\u201d cooling centers can be provided to citizens, many residents might seek cooling in other \u201cinformal\u201d locations such as retail centers, churches, libraries, and buses. There are ample opportunities for local businesses, faith communities, and community assets to participate in the cooling center network. Residents will turn to trusted locations, regardless of their identified status as \u201cformal\u201d cooling centers\u201d (p. 19).</p><p>By establishing a network of trusted places\u2014such as local businesses, churches, and libraries\u2014to provide climate actions the city hopes more residents will find cooling places. Such efforts are essential for preventing adverse health outcomes, such as heat exhaustion and stroke, from extreme heat days. Such a network can help address the inequities arising from increases in excessive heat events due to climate change.</p><p>Dallas and Oklahoma City plan to increase access to healthy foods, in part, through urban agriculture, particularly in areas with limited access to food, while Kansas City plans to increase enrollment of minority farmers and ranchers into local programs to better represent the diversity of residents and farmers. By doing so, Kansas City seeks to scale up local food production to meet demands, while also reducing emissions from vehicle-miles-traveled that contribute to climate change in the first place by reducing miles that food must be transported. While Dallas seeks to reduce food waste by helping businesses transfer food that would otherwise go to waste. This strategy also seeks to reduce emissions from the food supply chain.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Housing and land use</emphasis></p><p>Housing affordability and accessibility are other key areas of redistribution identified in the plans because of increased climate risks for the unhoused42. There remains a homelessness crisis across the U.S. (e.g.,43) with homeless residents experiencing some of the greatest climate vulnerability44. For example, San Antonio is the only plan in our sample that included anti-displacement measures, such as developing programs to help vulnerable groups have clear title to their home to try to keep people from marginalized communities in their homes and neighborhoods so they can also benefit from the adaptation measures being undertaken. The plan says,</p><p>\u201cDevelop measures to prevent displacement to ensure vulnerable groups, small businesses, and existing residents can stay in their homes/districts and benefit from resilience measures. Examples may include developing programs and policies to ensure low-income residents have clear title to their homes to allow for rebuilding as a result of weather-related damage or identifying energy-burdened households and providing resources to improve energy efficiency and increase thermal health\u201d (p. 48).</p><p>Houston identified how housing segregation created differential risks to climate change hazards, such as flooding, for historically marginalized communities. Because of this, Houston plans to explore and pilot a voluntary relocation program for people and families that meet criteria, such as low or moderate income, severe flooding, and location in the floodplain, to new or refurbished homes with lower flood risk and within the same community. Finally, Denver was the only plan reviewed that included a program\u2014the Denver Road Home Program (DRH)\u2014to provide permanent housing, shelters, and services to the homeless population by building new homes and shelters, providing rental assistance to prevent evictions, and social support. The plan elaborates on this program\u2019s successes:</p><p>\u201cAfter year eight <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">DRH</emphasis> added 2795 housing opportunities, generated 6702 employment and training opportunities, prevented 6199 families and individuals from becoming homeless through eviction prevention assistance, mentored 1208 families and seniors out of homelessness, housed 2275 individuals, and leveraged over $63 million in public and private dollars to help people\u201d (p. 21).</p><p>Adaptation actions in this sector also include energy assistance for low-income housing and building retrofits in frontline communities. These initiatives seek to reduce impacts from climate change for those who are unequally burdened by it and/or lack adequate resources or data to access effective adaptation actions. For instance, Dallas has pursued low-cost weatherization through the Dallas County Health and Human Services\u2019 Weatherization Assistance Program. The Dallas plan notes, \u201cIn partnership with Dallas County, the city will implement a weatherization program for the city\u2019s vulnerable residents to improve energy efficiency and reduce utility costs\u201d (p. 37). Similarly, Indianapolis has an Income-Qualified Weatherization Program and increased financial incentives for renewable energy, first to under-invested and historically marginalized neighborhoods. Another common approach is to address inequities by retrofitting buildings in frontline and under-resourced communities to make them more energy efficient (e.g., as seen in Memphis, Portland, San Francisco, San Antonio).</p><p>Waste management is another form of land use planning that cities are working in to advance distributive equity. For example, Los Angeles and Memphis both acknowledge that landfills tend to occur in low-income and communities of color. By reducing waste, it will decrease the emissions and impacts of these landfills. The Memphis plan notes, \u201creducing waste from these sectors can help decrease the need for new and/or enlarged landfills which often disproportionately impact low-income communities\u201d (p. 140). Similarly, several cities\u2014including Los Angeles, Memphis, and Portland\u2014note the importance of reducing landfill emissions to reduce their contribution to climate change. Portland aims to do this through the \u201cBe Cart Smart\u201d campaign to raise awareness of recycling and composting programs. This program includes communication strategies for residents with limited English proficiency as well as to renters and landlords. Taken together, housing and land use is one established area where cities are working to adapt to climate change and address urban inequalities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Urban greening</emphasis></p><p>Infrastructure initiatives include expanding the urban tree canopy, particularly in communities that have experienced disinvestment, and green infrastructure to help alleviate climate impacts they are likely to face. One common strategy employed by cities such as Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Antonio, and Washington D.C. to address inequities\u2014such as the urban heat island effect in predominantly poor and community of color neighborhoods (e.g.,45,46)\u2014is by more evenly developing the urban tree canopy, which can reduce urban-heat island effects and provide shade. Los Angeles aims to increase the tree canopy in areas of greatest need by at least 50% by 2028 to provide cooling, habitat, and energy savings.</p><p>Similarly, Phoenix, Portland, San Francisco, and Washington D.C. seek to increase their tree canopy in similarly under-resourced communities for the same kinds of benefits. For example, Phoenix\u2019s program is called \u201cRight Tree, Right Place\u201d to ensure drought tolerant trees are planted in places where they can grow. This effort also included training for city staff to ensure trees are properly cared for. The San Francisco plan focuses on the co-benefits of increasing the urban tree canopy with climate adapted plants. The plan notes,</p><p>\u201cTree planting will prioritize neighborhoods with low tree canopy rates, those most vulnerable to extreme heat, and public health/air quality disparities. Species will be selected with a climate adaptation and mitigation focus to promote carbon sequestration, pest and disease resilience, drought tolerance, urban heat island reduction, and stormwater filtration\u201d (p.250).</p><p>From these examples, we see how cities are using urban greening strategies, including enhancing tree canopy, to provide climate co-benefits to mitigate climate impacts while trying to address urban inequalities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Water</emphasis></p><p>Water usage is another emergent category of distributive equity in adaptation planning as cities work to provide basic services to alleviate climate risks for vulnerable residents. A few cities plan to distribute water to those in need particularly during excessive heat days. For example, Phoenix assists partners in the Heat Relief Network\u2014a regional partnership between the county association of governments, local municipalities, and non-profit organizations that emerged in response to a 2005 heatwave\u2014to provide hydration stations and water-donation sites, while Columbus plans to distribute water to vulnerable communities. Cities are also thinking about ways to assist low-income residents with their water bills. For instance, Dallas is introducing cost savings from water bills for low-income, vulnerable residents, who tend to spend a greater proportion of their income on utilities.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>Climate urbanism explores the drivers of inequality in a climate changed city. Such research has revealed the ways in which adaptation tend to reify business-as-usual functions and reinforce hierarchical social structures rooted in historically unequal urban planning practices and their oppressive outcomes (e.g.,25). For example, redlining practices in housing and neighborhood development segregated cities and created long-lasting social and environmental inequalities47. Though climate urbanism is adept at identifying drivers of inequality, it can lack specificity about potential solutions to such problems. Our work builds on this diagnosis by exploring how cities are enacting more redistributive strategies on the ground.</p><p>Our analysis yields two main takeaways, which are introduced here and elaborated in the subsections below. First, cities are pursuing distributive equity strategies in climate adaptation although these efforts lag behind procedural equity efforts as documented elsewhere14,15. Acknowledging that procedural, distributive, and recognitional forms of injustice are linked, the planning literature has focused extensively on process and procedure related to adaptation planning, while paying less attention to what cities are trying to do on the ground to advance distributive equity (for exception, see11,41). In filling this gap, we found in our analysis that distributive equity strategies employed by large U.S. cities tend to be mostly low-hanging fruits, meaning that they tend to be easy to implement and within the sole control or jurisdiction of the cities themselves. It makes sense that cities would begin with jurisdictional specific efforts given adaptation planning has been largely left up to cities with the lack of sustained federal funding and engagement over the past decade in the U.S. Second, we see evidence that cities are beginning to rely on these strategies to catalyze more transformative action through what others have described as developing racial and gender goals in regulations, policies, and plans related to distributing more equitable outcomes and addressing inequalities resulting from land use decisions12,37. The implication of this evidence shows cities are trying to more directly tackle the drivers of climate urbanism by exploring potentially more redistributive strategies.</p><p>Our research documents the key strategies that cities are using to advance distributive equity in climate adaptation planning. These strategies suggest incremental efforts that span many different sectors with many commonalities between them. These include redistributing adaptation resources to frontline communities, a focus on basic well-being, livelihoods, and service access needs, and bridging the adaptation gap between low-income and wealthy neighborhoods. Doing so is essential for advancing sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11). Here, we highlight opportunities for redistributive action and explore opportunities cities can undertake in the future.</p><p>However, our analysis highlights that many strategies appear to be low-hanging fruits\u2014that is, strategies that a city needs to implement to redress urban inequalities at a baseline, minimum level, rather than those that seek to proactively tackle historical and structural inequalities that will be exacerbated by climate change impacts. On the one hand, cities seek out low-hanging solutions that they potentially learn about from other cities. Cities implement these solutions to deal with immediate adaptation and adaptive capacity needs in the context of resource constraints and long-term climate uncertainties. Examples of this include building EV infrastructure in low-income communities, educational campaigns to try to reduce waste, and extending the urban tree canopy. The distributive equity actions such as the ones identified here are important to increase equity in adaptation planning and help advance climate action (SDG 13). However, few efforts focus on proactively planning for and mitigating future climate conditions. In other words, few cities consider the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">additional</emphasis> inequalities brought on by climate change, with exception of the climate displacement and housing programs as documented in Boston and Denver (see Table 1). Redistributive efforts that tackle the drivers of inequality need to be constantly revisited. Such low-hanging actions are a good start, but as with all capital-oriented solutions, questions of where, how, and who is benefiting from these solutions needs to be consistently and frequently asked. Focusing on such obvious short-term distributive strategies that are one-size-fits-all may hamper some adaptation mechanisms, such as reparations, that may more effectively address both climate vulnerabilities and past and contemporary inequality48.</p><p>Our analysis is also telling in what kinds of sectors are missing in U.S. cities\u2019 adaptation equity actions. For example, there is little focus on education or youth resources. Given climate change impacts are likely to continue, education and youth support would be essential for advancing adaptation to improve equity both in the immediate- and long-term time horizons (e.g.,49). We found little in the plans that described media, information, or technology\u2019s role in adaptation plans to advance distributional equity. Transportation initiatives were also missing in centering distributional equity in their approach to adaptation. These are key sectors moving forward that can help communicate and improve distributional equity in adaptation planning.</p><p>At the same time, there may be unintended consequences from the low-hanging strategies cities plan to implement, such as increased displacement, a lack of waste reduction enforcement, or a lack of benefit going to marginalized communities most vulnerable to climate impacts due to a lack of careful consideration of their specific context50. Cities are encouraged to make every effort to try to think through and limit such unintended consequences. Adaptation efforts may not reduce inequities (e.g.,51). Making strategies more relevant to the needs of specific communities in their cities could help ensure that adaptation actions can increase equity48. For example, cities should consider ways they can implement countermeasures to ensure frontline communities are able to benefit from such climate investments, such as retrofit buildings and cooling centers. Without these kinds of accompanying policy innovations, it is likely that adaptation actions will lead to greater displacement through climate gentrification52.</p><p>Furthermore, these distributive equity strategies appear across many of the cities included here. This finding may indicate that cities face similar resource and capacity constraints, which limit the opportunity space for more radical action. It also may point to the kinds of actions that cities can implement within their own jurisdictions. However, focusing on these kinds of strategies may prevent more innovative, ground-up thinking about ways to restructure urban economies to be responsive to local climate vulnerabilities37. One such unintended consequence is how adaptation can become a conflict over limited resources and capacities between communities that are at the frontlines of climate change29. Such competition prevents more collective solutions to tackle underlying structural causes (as described in this section) as well as more creative solutions that address compounding or cascading implications of climate change (i.e., across sectors, boundaries, scales, time). This lack of collective and creative problem solving can lead to further resident displacement, increased greenhouse gas emissions, investments in private industries that yield minimal social impact, or \u201cenclaving\u201d of risks (i.e., disconnected network of climate refugees)\u2014all of which exacerbate climate inequality17,25.</p><p>Increasingly, scholarship has focused on the structures that maintain social inequality and climate vulnerability and how to try to address it, which has supported SDGs 11 and 13 (e.g.,10,11,14,15,24,40. To move from incremental changes to transformative redistributive actions on the ground, adaptation efforts will need to be scaled up. Climate justice frameworks (e.g.,5, 6, 7\u20138), broadly, and intersectional climate justice12,37, specifically, provides just such a framework to think through solutions to climate inequalities. For example, in the housing and land use space, cities might first develop explicit gender and racial equity goals across housing and land use that takes into consideration historic legacies of inequality12. To achieve these goals, cities might provide funding in the form of grants to families from disadvantaged backgrounds to address gender and racial inequalities, which can help families tackle drivers of differential vulnerability. Doing so can advance sustainable communities and cities (SDG 11) through impactful climate action (SDG 13).</p><p>Our work begins to link on the ground strategies that seek to advance distributive justice in U.S. cities with theorized pathways cities can take to tackle long standing inequalities. Doing so starts a conversation about the importance of making explicit the ways climate resilient development, especially those that are capital-oriented which climate urbanism diagnoses as drivers of inequality25, can address differential vulnerability on the ground. Our analysis makes clear cities must figure out how to scale-up from specific, incremental actions to mobilizing more transformative social change37,48,53. For example, cities could in their adaptation efforts empower local marginalized communities to manage their own resources and land thereby promoting community resilience. Doing so could foster transformative change across urban space to build more sustainable and resilient cities. A second example could be arranging reparations and ownership or access to lands for marginalized communities, which could advance place-based strategies. These specific sets of actions could help ameliorate drivers of injustice, such as the limitation of community involvement and the legacies of racial and colonial oppression. We find that cities are doing some of the work that scholars have theorized12,37,48 particularly around building community resilience\u2014but cities have not advanced other theorized pathways, including reparations, developing a politics of care, or addressing drivers of differential vulnerability. More integration across theory, including theorized pathways for distributive justice, and what cities are doing on the ground to promote redistribution is encouraged.</p><p>There are several limitations to the current research. First, though plans were included through 2024, some of the plans are more dated than others, and given the extended timeframe there may be some variance across the plans related to distributive equity categories that are unaccounted for. Future research should consider methodologies that enable an assessment of trends over time (see for example ref. 41,). Additionally, implementation of plans and evaluation of climate actions remain two critical gaps in the field. Future research should endeavor to consider implementation and evaluation of urban adaptation plans. In this paper, we have focused on what cities are doing on the ground to advance distributive justice in their adaptation planning efforts. Other research should build on these findings in their work in other cities and in other countries. Additionally, future research should consider investigating the linkages across procedural, distributive, and recognitional justice given their theoretical connections4,11,41. Though this sample size is robust given prior research frequently focuses on single cities (e.g.,12,25), for some, 25 cities may represent a small sample size (e.g.,41). Subsequently, the generalizability of the findings may be limited, and the specific social, political, and cultural contexts of a place must be considered when drawing conclusions from this work.</p><p>In conclusion, our research shows that engagements with deeper distributive justice issues within city-level climate adaptation plans is only just emerging. Such work is essential to advance sustainable cities and climate action (including through SDGs 11 and 13). Compared to efforts that prioritize procedural equity, which has been acknowledged in the literature14,15, there are fewer actions that seek to redress distributional inequities. There remains a lack of consensus around what needs to be done in response to climate vulnerabilities and inequities. Climate urbanism approaches reviewed above offer theoretical insights to expand analysis of distributive equity in adaptation planning54,55. Yet, there remains a gap between theory and practice. To begin to bridge this gap, our paper connects climate urbanism\u2019s diagnosis of drivers of climate inequality with climate justice approaches to guide how, where, and for whom redistributive efforts could benefit and grounds our analysis in planning practices in US cities. To address such problems, we many need to reconfigure infrastructure in urban areas to increase climate resilience50. We argue such reconfiguration needs to include an analysis of inequity, not just vulnerability, to inform climate actions that can alter infrastructure in such a way that reduces inequity. The U.S. context under the Biden Administration\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act (2022) provided an opportunity to rethink urban climate justice given the influx of federal funding. With the recently inaugurated second Trump administration, U.S. cities will play an even more crucial role in advancing climate equity in the face of their attacks, defunding strategies, and hostility towards climate change and social equity. Without a more transformative and holistic way of thinking about and approaching distributive climate justice, there risks producing additional inequalities from climate impacts.</p><p>Research makes clear that climate change will have differential impacts on communities. City planning efforts do not yet fully consider how communities will need different strategies to face climate risks from local vulnerabilities. Acknowledging procedural, distributive, and recognitional forms of justice are linked, moving towards actions that ensure more transformative forms of distributive justice will be necessary to develop sustainable and resilient cities. In this study, we provided examples of the ways in which cities are trying to address distributive equity in their adaption planning. We find there has been movement to address distributional inequities across U.S. cities, providing some optimism for a deeper integration of justice and equity in climate adaptation planning. However, there remains a disconnect between theory and practice. Cities are only slowly bridging this gap. Our research highlights both the importance of cities as leaders in climate justice adaptation efforts and that cities across the U.S. can learn from one another in advancing distributional equity, resilience, and broader environmental sustainability goals, like SDGs 11 and 13. It remains to be seen how cities can be arenas in which these difficult questions are posed, and potential strategies can be developed and trialed especially those that tackle the underlying, structural causes of climate inequity in the first place.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Material and methods</emphasis></p><p>This study investigates climate change adaptation related plans (i.e., climate resilience plans, climate action pans, and adaptation portions of general sustainability plans) for the 25 largest cities in the U.S. by population size for which plans were publicly available. Such planning documents assess actions across different municipal agencies and can be extensive. Plans generally last for many years and may not be updated unless there are specific policies governing how frequently plans will be updated. We systematically selected the 25 largest U.S. cities by metropolitan area for two main reasons. First, these cities represent ~10% of the U.S. population. Second, these are cities for which climate adaptation plans were publicly available. This case selection provides a robust sample from which to gain representative insights from what cities are doing across the U.S. (e.g., Cannon et al.11,15). This analysis helps yield necessary insights to advance SDG11 on developing sustainable cities and SDG13 on advancing climate action.</p><p>To locate city-level documents, we performed an online search of relevant planning documents for each city in three types of databases: (1) the Adaptation Clearinghouse (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adaptationclearinghouse.org/\">https://www.adaptationclearinghouse.org/</url>), an online portal that provides resources for various stakeholders to help communities adapt to climate change; (2) individual city or municipal government websites; and (3) the specific offices of sustainability or environmental protection (if available) website for a given city. Following similar approaches of prior research, stand-alone documents are the focus of our examination to narrow the research scope for in-depth analysis (e.g., Reckien et al.56; Chu and Cannon10; Angelo, 2022). If there were multiple climate adaptation-related planning documents for a city, we selected the most recent document available at the start of data analysis at the end of 2024 or the plan that most readily and apparently addressed adaptation priorities and strategies (see, for example, Brousseau et al.41). Cities along with their planning documents included in the sample are presented in Table 2.Table 2</p><p>Alphabetized list of city, year, and planning documents that are included the in the

DC2016</p><p>aPopulation size is based on 2020 Census within defined city limits.</p><p>Individual planning documents were analyzed to identify the key strategies of climate action undertaken by cities and how these actions link to distributional equity outcomes. We focus on distributional forms of inequality as prior research has focused on procedural equity in climate adaptation planning (e.g., Cannon et al.15). Plans were analyzed using diverse keyword searches to inductively code planning documents using a coding protocol (see Table 3) developed from prior research investigating equity, inclusion, and justice criteria for decision-making on climate adaptation in the 10 largest U.S. cities (see Chu and Cannon10). Search terms included the following keywords, \u201cequit,\u201d \u201cvulnerab,\u201d \u201cequa,\u201d \u201cfrontline,\u201d \u201cmarginal,\u201d \u201celderly,\u201d \u201cunderserved,\u201d \u201cdisadvantaged,\u201d \u201cminority,\u201d \u201clow-income,\u201d \u201crace,\u201d \u201cethnicity,\u201d \u201chistor,\u201d \u201caccess,\u201d \u201cjust,\u201d \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d \u201ctransform,\u201d \u201cdistribution,\u201d and \u201creconciliation.\u201d Fragments are used to capture multiple meanings of the word, for example <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vulnerable</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vulnerability</emphasis>.

Building on prior environmental justice research that has found utility in describing and categorizing inequality across distributional forms (Schlosberg4), we developed coding criteria to assess what cities were doing on the ground in their adaptation planning to advance distributional equity (see Table 3). Interrater reliability of coding was achieved by two authors analyzing each plan and discussion of analysis and findings in team research meetings (see Creswell and Creswell,57). After inductive coding, plans were analyzed deductively by one author and checked by another author to identify climate adaptation actions across cities and their linkages with distributional equity outcomes (e.g., Schlosberg,58). The goal of this analysis was to identify broad categories of distributional equity as articulated in practice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The authors would like to acknowledge all those who helped develop the plans that were used in this study.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p><anchor id=\"refCR1\"/><link><marker>[1].</marker><locator anchorIdRef=\"referenceCR1\"/></link>Shi, L.

The issuance will result in overall net present value savings and will match the original maturities of the bonds to be refunded. The bonds are expected to price in July 2025, depending on market conditions.<br/><br/>The Rating Outlook is Stable.<br/><br/>RATING ACTIONS<br/><br/>Entity / Debt<br/><br/>Rating<br/><br/>Prior<br/><br/>Illinois Municipal Electric Agency (IL)<br/><br/>LT IDR<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Affirmed<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Illinois Municipal Electric Agency (IL) /Power Supply Revs/1 LT<br/><br/>LT<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Affirmed<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Page<br/><br/>of 1<br/><br/>VIEW ADDITIONAL RATING DETAILS<br/><br/>The 'AA-' IDR and bond ratings reflect the agency's very strong revenue defensibility, which is rooted in IMEA's take-and-pay power sales contracts with its 32 all-requirements members, the independent legal ability to increase rates, and the strong credit quality of the largest members. In addition, the rating incorporates IMEA's strong operating risk profile, stable financial performance trends, and very low leverage.<br/><br/>The strong operating risk profile is driven by a low-cost burden and diversifying resource base. While IMEA's resources are still predominantly coal-fired, the agency continues to add renewable resources and uses short-term agreements for capacity and energy, as well as market purchases to meet demand. Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources, which coupled with rate-raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-looking stress scenario.<br/><br/>The ratings also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net-zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant standards that require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032. IMEA, a partial owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA carbon reduction milestones. Additionally, the Trimble County coal units in northern Kentucky, in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards, should they be upheld by the current administration.<br/><br/>Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation. Fitch will monitor developments with respect to meeting statewide and federal carbon reduction targets and assess any potential impact on IMEA's future costs, capital needs or operations as they become known over time.<br/><br/>SECURITY<br/><br/>The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the power supply system after payment of operating and maintenance expenses. Net revenues consist primarily of payments received by IMEA pursuant to long-term take-and-pay all-requirements power sales contracts with 32 participating members.<br/><br/>KEY RATING DRIVERS<br/><br/>This is a text exhibit 'USPF - GRE KCD'. See instructions in side pane.<br/><br/>Revenue Defensibility - 'aa'<br/><br/>Long-Term Contracts, Strong Member Credit Quality<br/><br/>IMEA's revenue defensibility is very strong due to its long-term all-requirements power supply contracts with members, autonomous rate-setting authority, and strong underlying credit quality of its largest members. IMEA serves its 32 members across the state of Illinois, pursuant to all-requirements contracts that include provisions for an implied, unlimited step-up across members. Additionally, the IMEA board has full authority over rate setting. The agency initiated the contract renewal process in March 2024 to extend the power supply contracts' termination date from Sept. 30, 2035 to May 31, 2055. IMEA has secured extensions for 84%, or 27 of the 32 members, which equates to approximately 50% of member revenue.<br/><br/>Revenue defensibility also considers the strong purchaser credit quality of the largest members, the cities of Naperville and St. Charles, and the agency's very strong rate flexibility. The credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles is characterized by midrange and very strong net margins and cash cushion, respectively. Both cities have sound demographic and socioeconomic trends within the respective service areas and maintain rate setting autonomy. Naperville and St. Charles have yet to extend their power sales contracts beyond 2035 but are still considering a long-term extension.<br/><br/>Operating Risk - 'a'<br/><br/>Diverse, Low-Cost Resource Base<br/><br/>The strong operating risk assessment is driven by the agency's low operating cost burden of 6.7 cents/kWh and access to a diverse mix of available purchased power and generation resources to meet its almost 1,000 MW of load requirements and maintain at least a 15% operating reserve margin. Generation resources include ownership interests in the Trimble County units and PSEC. Both plants are coal-fired units that could be impacted by state and federal regulations. Favorably, IMEA is increasingly diversifying its resource base with the addition of low-cost wind and solar energy power purchase agreements (PPAs). IMEA will complete debt service payments for both plants by 2035 and has set up a decommissioning fund for both plants starting on May 1, 2025<br/><br/>The operating risk assessment also reflects the low Fitch-calculated age of plant of 12 years and manageable capital expenditures, as the agency primarily spends on plant upkeep. The capital plan anticipates approximately $ 92 million in spending through 2029, which is expected to be funded with cash flow from operations. While near-term capital requirements are limited, proposed federal regulations to limit carbon emissions could require significant capital spending over the long term or limit dispatch, increasing PSEC and Trimble County's operating costs.<br/><br/>Financial Profile - 'aa'<br/><br/>Stable Margins, Very Low Leverage<br/><br/>IMEA's very strong financial profile assessment reflects consistently healthy operating margins, robust liquidity levels, and very low leverage, measured as net adjusted debt to adjusted funds available for debt service (FADS). Leverage was 4.7x in fiscal 2024 (ended April 30) and averaged 5.8x between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2024. Coverage of full obligations has consistently exceeded the 1.0x threshold and was 1.3x in fiscal 2024. The liquidity profile is neutral to the assessment. Unrestricted cash equaled 197 days on hand, while the agency's liquidity cushion, which factors in IMEA's $ 50 million in available lines of credit, was 284 days.<br/><br/>Fitch's Analytical Stress Test (FAST) scenario analysis reflects leverage on a downward trend in each year of the base case. The stress case, which is considered Fitch's rating case, shows leverage is expected to trend around 5.0x over the next five years due to no planned sizable debt issuances, continued debt amortization, and expectations for generally stable FADS.<br/><br/>With a relatively limited amount of debt remaining that will mature by 2035, Fitch also believes IMEA to be relatively well-positioned to meet longer-term challenges related to carbon reduction mandates and potential resource transition over the medium term.<br/><br/>Asymmetric Additional Risk Considerations<br/><br/>There are no additional asymmetric risk considerations affecting the rating at this time.<br/><br/>RATING SENSITIVITIES<br/><br/>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade<br/><br/>Adoption and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations and emission limitations than those included in the CEJA;<br/><br/>A leverage ratio that consistently trends above 8.0x through Fitch's rating case scenario;<br/><br/>A meaningful weakening in purchaser credit quality that shifts the revenue defensibility assessment lower.<br/><br/>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade<br/><br/>Actual and projected leverage in Fitch's rating case scenario consistently below 5.0x;<br/><br/>An improvement in purchaser credit quality that leads to a stronger purchaser credit quality PCQ assessment.<br/><br/>PROFILE<br/><br/>IMEA is a joint action agency comprised of 32 members located throughout the state of Illinois. It supplies all-requirements power to its members through long-term take-and-pay power sales contracts (PSC) that will expire in 2035. IMEA's members serve approximately 145,000 residential and 21,000 commercial and industrial accounts.<br/><br/>IMEA's increased proportion of owned generation over the past decade affords it greater control over power supply, while reducing its historical dependence on purchased power and providing cost stability to its members. The share of IMEA's total planned capacity provided from purchased power has declined to about 25% from nearly 80% in 2010. An integral part of this process was the acquisition of an ownership share of PSEC and Trimble County Unit 2.<br/><br/>In late 2021, the state of Illinois passed CEJA, which requires all electric generators to provide 100% clean energy generation statewide by 2050. This is likely to be accomplished by phasing out fossil fuel power plants, like PSEC, over time. According to the legislation, PSEC must reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035,with a three-year grace period, and eliminate emissions totally by YE 2045.<br/><br/>While the law provides the framework for a significant shift in the generation and delivery of energy for utilities like IMEA, Fitch believes the legislation's extended time horizon provides sufficient flexibility to address the carbon reduction requirements. Additionally, all of IMEA's outstanding debt, including the debt issued to finance PSEC, is scheduled to be retired by 2035, limiting the potential costs and obligations of managing future power supply on IMEA and its members, including the fixed-costs associated with future potential stranded assets. A lack of debt beyond 2035 also provides a degree of flexibility to manage potential resource transition and/or adoption and implementation of new technologies.<br/><br/>Sources of Information<br/><br/>In addition to the sources of information identified in Fitch's applicable criteria specified below, this action was informed by information from Lumesis.<br/><br/>REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING<br/><br/>The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.<br/><br/>ESG Considerations<br/><br/>The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity.

The issuance will result in overall net present value savings and will match the original maturities of the bonds to be refunded. The bonds are expected to price in July 2025, depending on market conditions.<br/><br/>The Rating Outlook is Stable.<br/><br/>RATING ACTIONS<br/><br/>Entity / Debt<br/><br/>Rating<br/><br/>Prior<br/><br/>Illinois Municipal Electric Agency (IL)<br/><br/>LT IDR<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Affirmed<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Illinois Municipal Electric Agency (IL) /Power Supply Revs/1 LT<br/><br/>LT<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Affirmed<br/><br/>AA-<br/><br/>Page<br/><br/>of 1<br/><br/>VIEW ADDITIONAL RATING DETAILS<br/><br/>The 'AA-' IDR and bond ratings reflect the agency's very strong revenue defensibility, which is rooted in IMEA's take-and-pay power sales contracts with its 32 all-requirements members, the independent legal ability to increase rates, and the strong credit quality of the largest members. In addition, the rating incorporates IMEA's strong operating risk profile, stable financial performance trends, and very low leverage.<br/><br/>The strong operating risk profile is driven by a low-cost burden and diversifying resource base. While IMEA's resources are still predominantly coal-fired, the agency continues to add renewable resources and uses short-term agreements for capacity and energy, as well as market purchases to meet demand. Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources, which coupled with rate-raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-looking stress scenario.<br/><br/>The ratings also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net-zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant standards that require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032. IMEA, a partial owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA carbon reduction milestones. Additionally, the Trimble County coal units in northern Kentucky, in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards, should they be upheld by the current administration.<br/><br/>Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation. Fitch will monitor developments with respect to meeting statewide and federal carbon reduction targets and assess any potential impact on IMEA's future costs, capital needs or operations as they become known over time.<br/><br/>SECURITY<br/><br/>The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the power supply system after payment of operating and maintenance expenses. Net revenues consist primarily of payments received by IMEA pursuant to long-term take-and-pay all-requirements power sales contracts with 32 participating members.<br/><br/>KEY RATING DRIVERS<br/><br/>This is a text exhibit 'USPF - GRE KCD'. See instructions in side pane.<br/><br/>Revenue Defensibility - 'aa'<br/><br/>Long-Term Contracts, Strong Member Credit Quality<br/><br/>IMEA's revenue defensibility is very strong due to its long-term all-requirements power supply contracts with members, autonomous rate-setting authority, and strong underlying credit quality of its largest members. IMEA serves its 32 members across the state of Illinois, pursuant to all-requirements contracts that include provisions for an implied, unlimited step-up across members. Additionally, the IMEA board has full authority over rate setting. The agency initiated the contract renewal process in March 2024 to extend the power supply contracts' termination date from Sept. 30, 2035 to May 31, 2055. IMEA has secured extensions for 84%, or 27 of the 32 members, which equates to approximately 50% of member revenue.<br/><br/>Revenue defensibility also considers the strong purchaser credit quality of the largest members, the cities of Naperville and St. Charles, and the agency's very strong rate flexibility. The credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles is characterized by midrange and very strong net margins and cash cushion, respectively. Both cities have sound demographic and socioeconomic trends within the respective service areas and maintain rate setting autonomy. Naperville and St. Charles have yet to extend their power sales contracts beyond 2035 but are still considering a long-term extension.<br/><br/>Operating Risk - 'a'<br/><br/>Diverse, Low-Cost Resource Base<br/><br/>The strong operating risk assessment is driven by the agency's low operating cost burden of 6.7 cents/kWh and access to a diverse mix of available purchased power and generation resources to meet its almost 1,000 MW of load requirements and maintain at least a 15% operating reserve margin. Generation resources include ownership interests in the Trimble County units and PSEC. Both plants are coal-fired units that could be impacted by state and federal regulations. Favorably, IMEA is increasingly diversifying its resource base with the addition of low-cost wind and solar energy power purchase agreements (PPAs). IMEA will complete debt service payments for both plants by 2035 and has set up a decommissioning fund for both plants starting on May 1, 2025<br/><br/>The operating risk assessment also reflects the low Fitch-calculated age of plant of 12 years and manageable capital expenditures, as the agency primarily spends on plant upkeep. The capital plan anticipates approximately $ 92 million in spending through 2029, which is expected to be funded with cash flow from operations. While near-term capital requirements are limited, proposed federal regulations to limit carbon emissions could require significant capital spending over the long term or limit dispatch, increasing PSEC and Trimble County's operating costs.<br/><br/>Financial Profile - 'aa'<br/><br/>Stable Margins, Very Low Leverage<br/><br/>IMEA's very strong financial profile assessment reflects consistently healthy operating margins, robust liquidity levels, and very low leverage, measured as net adjusted debt to adjusted funds available for debt service (FADS). Leverage was 4.7x in fiscal 2024 (ended April 30) and averaged 5.8x between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2024. Coverage of full obligations has consistently exceeded the 1.0x threshold and was 1.3x in fiscal 2024. The liquidity profile is neutral to the assessment. Unrestricted cash equaled 197 days on hand, while the agency's liquidity cushion, which factors in IMEA's $ 50 million in available lines of credit, was 284 days.<br/><br/>Fitch's Analytical Stress Test (FAST) scenario analysis reflects leverage on a downward trend in each year of the base case. The stress case, which is considered Fitch's rating case, shows leverage is expected to trend around 5.0x over the next five years due to no planned sizable debt issuances, continued debt amortization, and expectations for generally stable FADS.<br/><br/>With a relatively limited amount of debt remaining that will mature by 2035, Fitch also believes IMEA to be relatively well-positioned to meet longer-term challenges related to carbon reduction mandates and potential resource transition over the medium term.<br/><br/>Asymmetric Additional Risk Considerations<br/><br/>There are no additional asymmetric risk considerations affecting the rating at this time.<br/><br/>RATING SENSITIVITIES<br/><br/>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade<br/><br/>Adoption and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations and emission limitations than those included in the CEJA;<br/><br/>A leverage ratio that consistently trends above 8.0x through Fitch's rating case scenario;<br/><br/>A meaningful weakening in purchaser credit quality that shifts the revenue defensibility assessment lower.<br/><br/>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade<br/><br/>Actual and projected leverage in Fitch's rating case scenario consistently below 5.0x;<br/><br/>An improvement in purchaser credit quality that leads to a stronger purchaser credit quality PCQ assessment.<br/><br/>PROFILE<br/><br/>IMEA is a joint action agency comprised of 32 members located throughout the state of Illinois. It supplies all-requirements power to its members through long-term take-and-pay power sales contracts (PSC) that will expire in 2035. IMEA's members serve approximately 145,000 residential and 21,000 commercial and industrial accounts.<br/><br/>IMEA's increased proportion of owned generation over the past decade affords it greater control over power supply, while reducing its historical dependence on purchased power and providing cost stability to its members. The share of IMEA's total planned capacity provided from purchased power has declined to about 25% from nearly 80% in 2010. An integral part of this process was the acquisition of an ownership share of PSEC and Trimble County Unit 2.<br/><br/>In late 2021, the state of Illinois passed CEJA, which requires all electric generators to provide 100% clean energy generation statewide by 2050. This is likely to be accomplished by phasing out fossil fuel power plants, like PSEC, over time. According to the legislation, PSEC must reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035,with a three-year grace period, and eliminate emissions totally by YE 2045.<br/><br/>While the law provides the framework for a significant shift in the generation and delivery of energy for utilities like IMEA, Fitch believes the legislation's extended time horizon provides sufficient flexibility to address the carbon reduction requirements. Additionally, all of IMEA's outstanding debt, including the debt issued to finance PSEC, is scheduled to be retired by 2035, limiting the potential costs and obligations of managing future power supply on IMEA and its members, including the fixed-costs associated with future potential stranded assets. A lack of debt beyond 2035 also provides a degree of flexibility to manage potential resource transition and/or adoption and implementation of new technologies.<br/><br/>Sources of Information<br/><br/>In addition to the sources of information identified in Fitch's applicable criteria specified below, this action was informed by information from Lumesis.<br/><br/>REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING<br/><br/>The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.<br/><br/>ESG Considerations<br/><br/>The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

We test whether a lockbox intervention paired with micro-saving nudges could alleviate the unaffordability of clean fuels. In a year-long stepped-wedge randomized control trial in Tanzania (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 511), we find that compared to savings nudges only, a lockbox and savings nudges increased annual refills of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) by 1.4 (0.054 per 2 weeks ([95% confidence interval: 0.043, 0.066], <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">P</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001)) and minimally decreased firewood use but had no effect on lags between LPG refills or the frequency of LPG and charcoal use. We find that easing liquidity constraints is insufficient for exclusive LPG use when LPG is the financial responsibility of only women, who ration LPG purchases to meet other household needs and social expectations. The financial and gendered realities of low-income consumers demand clean energy policies beyond easing liquidity constraints or targeted subsidies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Clean cooking fuels can be unaffordable. A year-long randomized control trial in Tanzania finds that a lockbox intervention along with behavioural nudging to encourage savings modestly increased liquefied petroleum gas use but did not lead to exclusive adoption, and that gendered financial constraints explain these results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis></p><p>About 2.4 billion people rely on smoky solid fuels, resulting in ambient and household air pollution (HAP), to which over eight million annual untimely deaths are attributed1. Near-exclusive use of \u2018clean\u2019 stoves and fuels, as categorized by the World Health Organization, is needed to avert negative health outcomes2. Affordability remains one of the largest barriers to the consistent use of clean cookstoves and fuels3,4. The challenge for energy policy is thus to provide affordable clean stoves and fuels that minimize users reverting to biomass (the \u2018refill gap\u2019)5 or using multiple stoves in parallel (stove \u2018stacking\u2019)6.</p><p>Clean cooking has two cost components: the upfront stove cost and the ongoing fuel and maintenance costs4,6, 7, 8, 9\u201310. The fuel cost consists of everyday sums or occasional lump sums. Traditional fuels (wood, agricultural waste) are often purchased or collected day to day, whereas cleaner fuels such as liquified petroleum gas (LPG) are purchased on a monthly (or longer) basis. Many individuals without clean fuels have neither regular cash flows nor financial tools11,12, making it difficult to save even modest sums. Further, individuals under the stress of chronic poverty often \u2018tunnel\u2019 or focus exclusively on immediate priorities, struggle to make forward-looking choices and must exert constant vigilance to not spend the small amounts that they could (and often must) save13,14.</p><p>The clean cooking literature has focused more on the upfront cost of clean stoves15, 16\u201317 than on financing the recurring fuel costs or reducing the refill gap. Micro-saving programmes could potentially accommodate low-income users\u2019 spending and saving patterns for either upfront or recurring costs. Numerous randomized control trials (RCTs) have investigated banked savings programmes18, 19\u201320, organized savings groups21, 22\u201323 and portable devices such as lockboxes23, 24\u201325, with varying levels of commitment. Lockboxes have been proven to help increase savings overall26 as well specifically for healthcare23 and education24,25. We hypothesized that tools to encourage small savings could help to increase (on time) clean fuel refills.</p><p>The behavioural economics literature has developed a range of interventions to encourage socially desirable habits, including nudges, boosts, gamification, priming, framing and so on27,28. Nudge theory29 is based on structuring choices to guide individuals towards better decisions without restricting their freedom or requiring notable changes to existing practices. Savings nudges in the literature make strategic use of such small interventions30,31 to protect against procrastination or valuing current consumption over future needs. Another suggested solution to the savings challenge is setting up dedicated saving accounts (earmarked for specific purchases) for low-income individuals. These accounts do not alleviate scarcity itself but could remind participants of their savings goals32, lower the mental burden of remembering to save and give individuals a sense of control even under constrained circumstances.</p><p>Combining these literatures, we designed an intervention that incorporates a dedicated account (drawing on behavioural economics) as a financial tool for small savings (drawing on clean cooking research) and acknowledges that nudging or encouragement (also from behavioural economics) may be necessary to facilitate a pro-saving behaviour change. We provided individuals a locked deposit box (\u2018lockbox\u2019), earmarked for LPG cylinders, which served as an informal financial device and a physical reminder to save, but without formal commitment or enforcement. Our theory of change was that if individuals saved in the lockbox, this would increase their on-hand liquidity (having eased their liquidity constraints) to spend on LPG refills. We present here the results on changes on LPG purchases on account of any change in savings. We also present new ethnographic evidence to explain our experimental results, grounded in understanding intra-household gender dynamics and the portfolio of household needs as key determinants of purchasing and using clean fuels.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Experimental design</emphasis></p><p>We designed a year-long stepped-wedge RCT in which participants (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 511) across Shirati, a rural town in Mara Region, Tanzania, started in control and then crossed over in waves into the intervention/treatment group. At the baseline, no one used LPG. Each participant received two free 6-kg LPG cylinder/burner sets, along with information from their community technology worker (CTW). All future refills of the LPG cylinder were the participant\u2019s responsibility (~US$10). Participants were randomly assigned to roll over into the treatment (that is, receiving the lockbox) (Fig. 1). The CTWs followed up every 2 weeks to encourage clean fuel use and nudge participants to save, for both treatment and control. That is, the control group also received encouragement nudges. At these visits, the CTWs also conducted surveys. From those surveys, LPG purchase receipts and triangulation with photos, we constructed our pre-specified primary outcomes: purchased refills, the days between running out of LPG and purchasing the next cylinder (\u2018the refill gap\u2019), categories of LPG use (exclusive, habitual, occasional and none) and biomass (firewood/charcoal) usage33. Savings outcomes are reported in another paper (A.G.-W., manuscript in preparation). Following the full trial, we conducted a 6-month period of qualitative work that included observations, focus groups, budgetary games and 90 semi-structured interviews (Methods).Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Schematic of study design.</emphasis></p><p>This illustration depicts how individuals transitioned into the treatment of a locked deposit box. We enrolled 511 participants at baseline (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis> = 0) and then randomly assigned each to transition into treatment after weeks 16 through 32. The first ~46 participants received the intervention (blue) at week 18, then ~46 more participants at week 20 and so forth until all 511 respondents received the treatment. Once in treatment, participants remained thus until the end of the study. The randomized rollout was intended to create balanced comparison groups between the control (white) and the treatment (blue). Photo of lockbox and key taken by A.G.-W. Lockboxes were hand crafted by a local artist.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sample characteristics</emphasis></p><p>We spoke with the mostly female main cooks (94%) with an average weekly expenditure of US$56.7 (standard deviation (s.d.) 34.4) after adjusting for purchasing power parity (PPP) (Table 1). Women earned small amounts of income from selling products from their farms, selling small fish, braiding hair and so on. LPG use in the region was very low ( ~ 2% in 2018)34. Confirming previous anthropological literature from sub-Saharan Africa35, 36\u201337, spouses kept finances completely separate: \u201cThere are very few couples who save their money together\u201d (Respondent 4, Focus Group 1). Women were responsible for daily household expenses (for example, food, soap, charcoal and children\u2019s needs), while men were responsible for larger purchases (building the house, furniture, television and so on). Couples could come together for certain purchases, but this was not the norm. Spouses rarely disclosed their financial status to each other. Thus, our main respondents reported only their own available weekly expenditures. At the baseline, 56% of respondents reported being able to save anything at all.Table 1</p><p>Socio-demographic characteristics of our sampled respondents, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> =

They were stacking with other fuels and seemed to time running out of LPG for when they had money to refill (Supplementary Fig. 1). Respondents\u2019 rationing behaviour avoided any measured LPG \u2018refill gap\u2019. During follow-up interviews, some women acknowledged rationing LPG use to avoid absolutely running out: \u201cI decided to reduce my gas use so that it should take at least one month to run out\u2026 if I decide to use it only, it will not even take one month [to run out] \u2026so I decide to use it to make only tea and reheat the food\u201d (Respondent 2, Focus Group 1). Many individuals reported stacking, reducing their LPG use to occasional (such as reheating food) to control when they would run out; others simply never refilled (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1).Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Categories of LPG use during study.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>, We tracked categories of LPG use across low (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>), mid (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">e</emphasis>) and high (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) per capita expenditure strata during treatment (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) and control (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">d</emphasis>\u2013<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">f</emphasis>) periods. Most respondents were using a combination of LPG and firewood and/or charcoal (that is, stacking stoves). We stop the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">x</emphasis> axis at 26 weeks in treatment or control to keep observations around 50 individuals for each time point.</p><p>Most respondents claimed to need only one cylinder, holding the second as reserve for when the first cylinder ran out: \u201cWhile using one cylinder I save for another one\u201d (Respondent 387). This was also a form of rationing: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s hard to get money to refill them both at once\u201d (Respondent 178). Using only one cylinder was also a way to maintain savings for other items: \u201cI was just saving and not only for gas\u2026I have not refilled the second one because for now we have a lot of funerals\u201d (Respondent 54). Money for refills was especially tight as LPG purchases were solely in the women\u2019s expenditure domain; their \u2018share\u2019 of the household expenses was being saved towards LPG (and food-related expenses overall). Men rarely assisted with LPG refills: \u201cIn all cooking matters women are the one responsible\u2026 as a woman you will struggle to make sure you refill the cylinder and cook, so when he comes home, he only eats\u201d (Respondent 4).</p><p>Regarding self-reported LPG use categories, we find, while controlling for weeks into the experiment, neither an immediate nor cumulative impact. Descriptively, the percentage of participants reporting no LPG use rose with number of weeks in control across all income strata. The percentage reporting no LPG use was, on average, higher in treatment than in control but did not increase measurably with weeks in treatment (Table 2, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables 1\u20133). The stability of LPG use categories reinforces our result that users were rationing their LPG.</p><p>Each additional 2-week period in treatment decreased average firewood use by \u22120.038 kg (95% CI: (\u22120.078, 0.002) (extrapolates to ~1 kg a day by the end of the year), particularly for participants with mid-level expenditure (Supplementary Table 3). Stacking was stable throughout control and treatment, consistent with our treatment effects, which found minimal effect on biomass usage (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 1). While stacking fuels, respondents across expenditure strata were spending well over the 5% threshold (using only the women\u2019s reported expenditures as denominators) set by the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) as the affordability bar for cooking fuel38. Low expenditure participants spent the largest percentage (Supplementary Fig. 3). The post-treatment fuel expenditure ratio is largely consistent with that reported at baseline; polluting fuels thus account for substantial costs, often similar to clean fuels per unit of energy generated (Supplementary Fig. 2). Our interviews and focus groups explained these results through two recurring themes: LPG was but one priority among many, and the nature of cooking fuel purchases is highly gendered.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Easing liquidity is insufficient given a portfolio of needs</emphasis></p><p>The treatment was an effective nudge for respondents to save, thus easing their liquidity constraints (A.G.-W., manuscript in preparation). They dipped into those savings for refills, essential items as well as emergencies: \u201cI am the one buying each and everything in this house [so] the money that I was supposed to buy gas with I use to buy food\u201d (Respondent 67). Or \u201cthe child was sick, so we used the [lockbox] money\u201d (Respondent 400). Most women we interviewed claimed to be saving for LPG but ultimately saved whatever they could, whenever they could (Fig. 4).Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualitative results.</emphasis></p><p>Our qualitative results reveal that the unaffordability of LPG (white) is underpinned by (1) a portfolio of (competing and urgent) needs that prevent easing liquidity constraints from fully addressing the financial challenge (orange) and (2) the gendered expectations of household budgets that place LPG in the woman\u2019s domain (brown). TSH, Tanzanian shillings.</p><p>The lockbox increased participants\u02bc recognition of the need to save for LPG: \u201cit is good to save because it\u2019s hard to get all 24,000 shillings at once\u201d (Respondent 202). And they did in fact save. This awareness could have contributed to the stabilizing LPG use and continued rationing: \u201cI can even see how much I am left with to reach the total amount\u201d (Respondent 273). The lockbox visualized for participants the fraction of the hefty LPG refill cost that they had on hand: \u201cif I use gas daily it will run out quickly before I get enough money to refill\u201d (Respondent 13). Participants used the lockbox to time when the cylinder would run out to when they had enough saved (Fig. 4).</p><p>When the gas ran out, they would look in the lockbox to see if there was enough to refill. If there was enough, or almost enough, they tended to refill. If there was any extra, they would buy other things, they would not leave the residual towards a future refill. If there was not enough, they waited to refill, turning to the second cylinder and reducing their LPG use: \u201cin the lockbox we were just saving so that when the cylinder runs out, we go and refill and if there is some amount of money left after refilling, we just use the money to buy other items in the house\u201d (Respondent 500). Having enough money on hand in their lockboxes (that is, easing liquidity constraints) was a necessary but by no means sufficient condition to increase LPG use given the portfolio of needs.</p><p>The literature suggests many reasons for continued stove stacking8,39, but the slight reduction in firewood and no change in charcoal that we find is largely underpinned by low and fluctuating incomes. The instability of their financial situations made saving particularly hard: \u201cI am now saving if I get money, it\u2019s not every week\u2026 because I depend on the business of oranges and as you know it\u2019s seasonal\u201d (Respondent 272). Distance to refill, often cited as a separate barrier, contributed to the affordability challenge in that transport typically added another dollar to the refill cost). The widespread prevalence of rationing (using LPG when in a hurry, reducing LPG to never run out, refusing to use LPG for beans because beans have a long cooking time and so on) points to unaffordability being a dominant reason for persistent stacking. For instance: \u201cI don\u2019t want to run out\u201d [when cooking beans] (Respondent 101). To our probe: \u201cSo is it something about the beans?,\u201d the response was: \u201cNo, it\u2019s about the money\u201d. Participants expressed a strong preference for LPG: \u201cif gas was free, I\u2019d refill everyday\u2026even if there was still available firewood and charcoal\u201d (Respondent 13).</p><p>The literature already documents the unaffordability of clean cooking fuels40, 41\u201342. Our results support that literature but show that alleviating liquidity constraints alone is insufficient to mitigate unaffordability, in contrast to previously posed hypotheses4. We show that even when there are savings increases, LPG is not always prioritized amid myriad household needs. With saved money, many items become more affordable, not LPG alone. There have not been any randomized trials of pay-as-you-go LPG43, but our results suggest similar competing needs would arise. We also find that fluctuating business opportunities make for fluctuating savings: \u201c[my savings] depends on how much I sell, because sometimes I sell 500 or 1000 or 3000 TSH\u201d (Respondent 179). Small irregular cash flows make it easier to purchase fuel in small irregular quantities. In reality, even if LPG is not substantially more expensive than charcoal per unit of energy, it is more \u2018unaffordable\u02bc because it is a lumpy purchase. We conclude that LPG is unaffordable not as a stand-alone commodity but in the context of other unmet needs and uncertain income streams.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The gendered nature of clean fuel purchases</emphasis></p><p>We initially targeted main cooks as representing their households. However, we found that not just the physical but the financial burden of cooking falls on the woman. A survey enumerator explained: \u201cWomen have always been the ones to collect firewood or purchase charcoal, so even though it is now purchasing gas, it is still her responsibility\u201d. Using their own earnings, a stipend from their husbands or both, women alone were responsible for cooking fuel purchases. We highlight here the under-appreciated separation of financial responsibility for fuels rather than the intra-household power asymmetry highlighted in other work44,45. In this part of Africa, LPG is not a \u2018household\u02bc expense, so the total income in \u2018a household\u02bc is not necessarily a predictor of LPG\u2019s affordability.</p><p>Our results suggest that successful efforts to increase clean fuel use demand a gendered understanding of household responsibilities. We need to understand what women are asked to give up to purchase clean fuels consistently. Where household finances are entirely in women\u2019s hands, they are the ones who must choose between LPG and clothes for their children. Some researchers have implied that non-habitual use of clean fuels or continued stacking means that the users do not truly value the benefits of clean stoves9,46,47, but we find that women do value and purchase LPG with higher savings. While they do not refill LPG at the frequencies needed to see health benefits (exclusive use)2, we argue that this reflects long-standing practices of women paying for household needs with their own health when they cannot pay with cash. Feminist scholarship, echoing the work of Sen48, has argued that an individual\u2019s overt preferences do not reflect individual welfare where the preferences themselves have had to adapt to constrained circumstances49. We, therefore, cannot conflate LPG non-use with low valuations for clean energy; rather, we must re-conceptualize this choice as reflecting low valuations of women\u2019s health. This re-conceptualization strongly supports the need for the energy and health sectors to account for the full costs of their interventions and for the individual who is expected to pay these costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion and conclusions</emphasis></p><p>Our study demonstrates that an effective \u2018nudge\u2018 to (modestly) increase LPG consumption and keep individuals from running out completely of LPG is possible at the level of individual cooks. Although we only find an increase in ~1.4 refills (8.4 kgs) over the year and no change in LPG use categories, prominent LPG policies have been even less successful. India\u2019s policies for individuals below-the-poverty line (for example, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana), which covered the upfront cost of the stove, led to an annual refill increase of 0.68 kg of LPG50. Experimental evidence indicates that LPG demand is very sensitive to price51, even with pay-as-you-go models52. Our intervention increased LPG consumption, but not exclusive use, the level needed for potential health benefits2. Even with eased liquidity constraints, therefore, and intention to save for clean cooking fuels, financial and gendered realities forced our participants to continue to stack LPG and solid-fuel stoves. Our findings have research and policy implications well beyond rural Tanzania, as intra-household budgeting separation and multiple household needs are common in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Our results are a call to reconsider a key metric used to measure clean fuel affordability: the conventional affordability ratio40. The conventional affordability ratio is typically constructed as the ratio of fuel costs to the household monthly expenditure40. However, we have shown that fuel affordability may be primarily a function of the woman\u2019s, not the household\u2019s budget, and relevant on weekly or even daily timescales, given our respondents\u2019 earning patterns. \u2018Household\u02bc monthly affordability measures may not accurately estimate a low-income user\u2019s ability to purchase clean fuel. Further, our work reveals that this measure on its own, without the context of other needs, will not be a useful predictor of LPG use. Residual income approaches to affordability that consider essential items (rent, food and so on) and gender-specific affordability metrics4 would provide a more realistic picture of clean fuel affordability.</p><p>Our findings call for energy policy to consider that increasing incomes/saving, subsidizing LPG and/or providing purchasing options with relaxed liquidity constraints (for example, smaller quantities4, pay-as-you-go technologies52) are necessary but probably not sufficient to ensure habitual or exclusive LPG use and abandonment of polluting fuels. Simply alleviating liquidity constraints or providing cheaper LPG will not be enough if there are too many other needs and only a portion of household income available for them. To foster exclusive clean fuel use, we may need to pursue direct fuel provisions, such as vouchers for the entire cylinder (unlike the partial cylinder voucher explored in Peru53) or direct, targeted delivery (such as nutritional programming54 or drinking water through pipes or tanker trucks55), that can ensure a public health-consistent level of use. Energy research and policy must understand how fuel purchases are embedded in gendered, that is, separate but not necessarily asymmetric, intra-household dynamics and within a portfolio of urgent unmet needs to increase clean fuel use.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study setting</emphasis></p><p>We conducted this work in Shirati, Rorya District, Mara Region, Tanzania. Shirati is a rural town of ~50,000 on the edge of Lake Victoria near the Kenyan border. Shirati has a tropical climate with light rains from October to December and heavy rains from March to June.</p><p>According to the 2022 census, when our study was completed, the average number of \u2018persons who spent the census night\u02bc56 (pg. 77) living together in the Mara region was five individuals. In Mara, 42.3% of households were female headed, but over half of adults were married (56%)57. According to Tanzania\u2019s 2018 Household Budget survey, most individuals in Mara were 47 years old, had completed primary school (62%); many used a rechargeable lamp (35.3%) or solar lamps (26.6%) as their main source of lighting34. Average monthly household consumption was ~US$207 in 2017/2018. Female heads of households were self-employed (including farming, petty trade and so on), 14% were unemployed, never worked or did not know and 17.5% were unpaid household workers. Only 11.6% of households in the region had at least one member (typically not a woman) with a bank account. We note that these characteristics are for the region and of all individuals not only main cooks (our sample). In Mara, most used firewood (72.9%) or charcoal (23.5%) for cooking, although LPG was available.</p><p>In Shirati, firewood and charcoal could be collected and purchased in every village, and charcoal making was a common small business. For LPG users, 6- or 12-kg cylinders could be exchanged at retail points in the village with the main market, Obwere. To refill, participants had to either walk with the heavy cylinder or pay the extra cost of a motorcycle or three-wheeled delivery cart ( ~ US$1). We intentionally targeted a rural setting as rural communities are disproportionately understudied and are often targeted for improved but not (truly) clean stoves.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sampling and randomization</emphasis></p><p>We randomized both how participants were selected to participate and the order in which selected participants were assigned to the intervention. We relied on a combination of ward-level shapefiles, Google Maps, interviews with village leaders, local knowledge and Python to randomly place ~511 points across Shirati and then invited the main cook from the closest homestead to participate. After baseline data collection, the first author determined treatment distribution order using a random number generator in R.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Participants</emphasis></p><p>Main cooks were approached by our local team to participate. We intentionally targeted main cooks as the most pertinent individual involved in cooking for the household. Further, we needed to train main cooks on LPG use and safety. After a few days to consider our request, we returned to obtain written informed consent. The only eligibility criterion for our selected participants (Supplementary Fig. 1) was that they did not already use LPG for cooking. This was not a limiting criterion as LPG use in the Mara region was 1.4% as of 2018 and similarly low in the study area58. We decided to target non-LPG users to isolate the phenomenon of continued consumption (as opposed to conflating continued use with the upfront cost of the stove that existing LPG users would have paid for already). At baseline in 2021, our respondents reported an average monthly expenditure of US$182 (or US$462.28 at PPP). Most individuals engaged in subsistence agriculture, raising goats or cattle or pursuing small business.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Procedures</emphasis></p><p>After establishing eligibility, explaining the study and obtaining consent, we conducted a baseline survey. This baseline collected demographic, socio-economic and energy information. Within 2 weeks, we delivered two 6-kg LPG cylinder/burner sets and trained the main cook on how to safely use the sets. We interviewed LPG suppliers in Shirati when we piloted the study, and they reported that LPG supply was not a concern. However, this was before the trial. During the study, no participant ever reported failing to purchase a cylinder due to a supply shortage.</p><p>The every-other-week follow-up surveys obtained information on the user\u2019s cylinder purchases, the lag time between cylinder refills and their cooking fuel use. During these visits, we also confirmed that both LPG cylinders were still in the home even if empty. A few households asked to give one away to their relative or friend because they were rationing LPG and only needed one cylinder/burner set. We asked that they keep both at least until the end of the trial. We had survey enumerators take photos of all cylinders (and all stoves for that matter) at each visit and report the number of cylinders within the home and those being used. Establishing rapport was of the utmost importance to our research and field team. The local women we hired to work in their own communities assured participants that the cylinders were theirs to keep and just asked that they keep both until the end of the year-long study. Finally, we conducted an endline survey that mirrored the baseline. Each visit lasted about 30 min; our work was made possible by the labour of the women working for and participating in the study.</p><p>Supervisors of the local team delivered a locked deposit box with a key that respondents could choose to keep or give to their local outreach worker, whom we titled Community Technology Workers (CTWs). The CTWs encouraged the use of the lockbox to save for LPG refills. We did not, however, seek to commit participants to saving only for LPG. Most respondents chose to keep the key with the CTW (Supplementary Figs. 5 and 6). The first author worked on the ground with the local team throughout the entire study and held weekly meetings where logistics or any safety/adverse events could be addressed (although none arose).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outcome construction</emphasis></p><p>Pre-specified primary outcomes were purchased refills, the days between running out of LPG and purchasing the next cylinder (\u2018the refill gap\u02bc), categories of LPG use (exclusive, habitual, occasional and none) and biomass (firewood/charcoal) usage33. We counted purchased refills for each participant over their times in control and treatment, respectively. Respondents self reported the day that one or both cylinders ran out and the date on which they refilled one or both cylinders. This allowed us to calculate the refill gap. We categorized each participant at each visit into one of four LPG categories based on their responses to numerous questions, indicating whether they were exclusively, habitually or occasionally using LPG or had failed to refill for an extended period. We prescribed how these categories would be defined in Appendix 6 of our pre-analysis plan (PAP). For example, if a user was categorized as an Exclusive LPG User if the number of meals prepared and the number of meals prepared with gas were equal, the user reported only using LPG, the user reported no firewood or charcoal use in the past 7 days and yesterday and neither the firewood nor charcoal stove is warm. Respondents reported their firewood or charcoal consumption in typically purchased quantities; we translated these into kilograms after weighing numerous bundles/bucket sizes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sample calculation</emphasis></p><p>We overpowered the sample size to provide higher than 80% power to detect a 10% difference in intervention versus control for the rarest outcome we tracked within the entire study, exclusive LPG use, as detailed in our PAP33. We pursued individual randomization at the level of the main cook (our independent unit of analysis) after finding similar coverage and standard errors across our simulations of individual and cluster/community randomization. These simulations were conducted including and ignoring spillover effects and with different levels of contamination and intra-cluster correlation coefficients (PAP Appendix 4). We timed the \u2018steps\u02bc in the step-wedge design to start at week 18 until 30 to balance the number of control and treatment observations. Every participant contributed on average 25 observations (of 26 possible). We had 6,605 control and 6,221 treatment observations. We define attrition as an individual whom we were not able to contact again or who asked to not be involved in the study anymore. We define missingness as a participant whom we were unable to contact during a 2-week period, whether that be because they were travelling or had conflicting schedules, but we were able to survey again; they continued in the study.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistical analysis</emphasis></p><p>We describe the mean and percentage, range or standard deviation of baseline demographic and socio-economic characteristics of participants. We conducted a balance test on key covariates with weights for how many time periods each household contributed to control and treatment respectively to ensure balance across control and treatment observations (Supplementary Table 1).</p><p>We assess treatment impact on refills by constructing a user\u2019s rate of refilling while in control versus treatment (total refills in control or treatment divided by cumulative time in control or treatment). For all other outcomes, we analyse immediate and cumulative impacts of offering participants a saving lockbox. For all, we investigated the immediate treatment impact, which refers to the outcome for the first 2-week time period after entering into treatment. For all, we estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) using logistic regression, which indicates the difference in the mean outcomes between treatment and control groups.</p><p>In an intent-to-treat analysis, we modelled immediate impact of treatment on binary and continuous outcomes using logistic and linear regressions, respectively. We model the rate of refilling over the time periods in control vs treatment using Poisson regression. For binary outcomes, we report robust inference through the bootstrap method, clustered at the level of the participant. For continuous outcomes, we report robust inference, clustered at the level of the participant.</p><p>We also estimated the cumulative treatment impact by finding average impact of each additional 2-week time period in treatment. The initial impact may change over time, as users may adapt to better saving habits or drop off.</p><p>To do so, we model the outcomes against the cumulative time in treatment (9 to 18 2-week periods) with a logistic or linear regression (if binary/continuous) and predict the average. For binary outcomes, we then model this average with a linear regression against all possible time in treatment. That is, we find the additional treatment effect for one more period of being treated. We report robust inference through the bootstrap method, clustered at the level of the participant.</p><p>We control for time since the study began to isolate the effect of treatment from the effect of time as cooking fuel needs can change seasonally and participants over time may dig themselves into a financial LPG hole before even reaching treatment status. This was not pre-specified, so we also include the analysis without controlling for time since the study began in Supplementary Information.</p><p>Although not pre-specified, as a secondary investigation, we repeated all analyses for sub-groups of per capita expenditure: the first quartile (low), the second and third quartiles (mid) and the fourth quartile (high).</p><p>As additional sensitivity analysis for the analysis not controlling for time, we repeat the intent-to-treat immediate impact analyses that does not control for time using double-robust, targeted maximum likelihood estimation (Supplementary Tables 9 and 10). This estimation technique is based on both the calculation of the propensity score and the parametric model specified; if either is correct, the model is robust to bias. We partly modelled this analysis off of cluster RCT evaluated HIV treatment in Uganda (although we pursue individual randomization)59. Although not necessary in an RCT as treatment was randomized, we pursued this approach as sensitivity analysis as it does not rely on any parametric assumptions about the distribution of the underlying data and allow for the adjustment of covariates to increase efficiency without requiring any additional modelling assumptions60,61.</p><p>We conducted a complete case analysis as overall missingness was &lt;5% of observations (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8). We had ~1% (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 7) attrition (for example, participants left the study) and missing observations (that is, field team could not contact the participant that specific week) never exceeded 6% for a single time period (Supplementary Fig. 7). No analysis was conducted until after the end of data collection. All analyses were conducted in STATA 16.1 and R studio 4.2.1. Data were collected with SurveyCTO 2.71.4. The study protocol was approved by the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020-02-13013) and by Tanzania\u2019s COSTECH (permit number 2021-465-NA-2021-112 (renewed as 2022-886-NA-2021-112). The study PAP is available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8465\">https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/8465</url>. Full replication files for this study are available online, as is the deidentified data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Qualitative methods</emphasis></p><p>Following the full trial, we conducted a 6-month period of qualitative work that included observations, focus groups, budgetary games and 90 semi-structured interviews. We collected quantitative and qualitative data sequentially62 to understand the reasons behind the respondents\u2019 reported saving and cooking fuel consumption practices. We conducted all qualitative work after the experiment had ended so as to not interfere with the experiment. Further, to align with best practice62, no analysis was conducted until after the end of data collection. Therefore, to structure the interviews to understand the results, we conducted all qualitative work after the end of the quantitative data collection. We used our qualitative results to help interpret the quantitative survey results. Although the trial had ended before the interviews started, participants were allowed to keep both cylinders and their lockboxes. Therefore, the present tense used by interviewees is indicative of the continued use of both the lockbox and LPG.</p><p>After data collection from the survey instrument documenting LPG use and saving patterns ended in March 2023, we randomly selected interview respondents across the RCT participants, stratified by expenditure groups (low, medium and high) and LPG categories (exclusive, habitual, occasional and no LPG use) (Supplementary Table 1). We slightly overweighted smaller categories and conducted interviews in June\u2013July of 2023 and then again in January 2024. The first author and our main research assistant conducted interviews in Swahili; however, if the participant only spoke Luo, the research assistant led the interview. We conducted a total of 90 interviews by which time we had reached qualitative saturation, wherein new interviews were not revealing new insights.</p><p>We conducted four focus groups in May\u2013June 2023 and January 2024 to better understand how respondents spent and saved within their household units across key expenditure categories. Each group consisted of five or six women from a representative sample across villages and expenditure groups. We conducted two more focus groups to present and ground truth our findings (July 2023) with a random selection of participants and with our survey enumerators, who helped us to better understand household responses (January 2024).</p><p>We asked all participants for verbal consent to audio record and also hand-wrote notes during focus groups and interviews. The interviews were transcribed and translated in the weeks following their completion. We performed initial and intermediate coding from interview notes and advanced coding for all transcripts in Dedoose 9.0.107, a qualitative data analysis software. Within this platform, we coded and kept track of frequency of codes to ensure that key themes were representative and comprehensive of all ~90 interviews and focus groups. We discussed emergent themes, category identification and final codes/themes throughout the fieldwork and while analysing the results.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitations</emphasis></p><p>Our work may be vulnerable to self-selection bias. We believe this to be minimal as participants did not self select into our programme but rather were chosen randomly from a spatial random sampling approach. Further, only ~5% (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">n</emphasis> = 24) approached individuals did not agree to participate.</p><p>As with all participant-reported data (survey or interview), our results are vulnerable to recall and social desirability bias. We protected against recall and social desirability bias by asking about the previous day\u2019s cooking activities, recent practices saving and purchasing patterns, building rapport and trust with our participants, and triangulating among receipts, photos of all stoves in use and any biomass stoves, survey answers and interview responses.</p><p>Our work was also vulnerable to the risk of contagion where control participants could hear of the treatment and obtain their own lockbox. We modelled this contagion in our PAP to inform our decision to not cluster our intervention; there was minimal impact on our ability to detect an effect (Methods, Sample calculation and our PAP).</p><p>To make our interviews and focus groups as representative as possible, we randomly sampled across LPG categories and expenditure groups from our trial. In the focus groups, we ensured that individuals were representative of the different LPG categories and expenditure categories. We do not, however, present these as experimental results but rather as context and explanation to understand our experimental results. We waited until the experiment was over to interview respondents on their savings habits so as to not change their behaviour mid-experiment and affect our internal validity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inclusion and ethics</emphasis></p><p>The research has included local researchers throughout the research process. The first author built a relationship with the author based at the University of Dar es Salaam in 2016 before she started any research in Tanzania. The local implementation team was included in designing and implementing the study from before the pre-pilot work to ensure it was locally relevant. Study participants from an earlier feasibility pilot for the concept of community technology workers even became enumerators for the larger study, wanting to shape the new study based on their experience. The study protocol was approved by the University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Institutional Review Board (protocol 2020-02-13013) and by Tanzania\u2019s COSTECH (permit number 2021-465-NA-2021-112 (renewed as 2022-886-NA-2021-112). The study posed minimal risk to participants. We have taken local and regional research into account in our citations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work was funded by the National Science Foundation\u2019s Graduate Research Fellowship Program (A.G.-W.), the Global Distribution Fund (A.G.-W.), University of California, Berkeley\u2019s Center for African Studies\u2019 Rocca Dissertation Grants (A.G.-W.), the James and Katherine Lau Climate Equity Fellowship (A.G.-W. and D.M.K.), the Foreign Language and Areas Studies Fellowship (A.G.-W.).

Designed to fund new renewable energy projects, this multi-impact climate capital solution aligns with long-term climate goals and accelerates measurable contributions to energy security. The investment will accelerate the development of solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) on the ERCOT grid, with increased renewable energy capacity expected as early as late 2025 and continued progress toward critical milestones through 2027.</p><p><br/><br/>'This investment exemplifies how GEMS initiatives unite market competition and innovative capital deployment to deliver scalable, cost-effective energy solutions with measurable impacts,' said Benny Barton, Executive Manager of BadCarbon.<br/><br/>This equity investment complements the $ 300 million portfolio-level debt facility provided by certain funds and accounts managed by HPS Investment Partners, LLC, which closed in November 2024. Together, these investments enable the expansion of new renewable infrastructure with a projected lifetime output exceeding 45,000 GWh and sequester more than 3 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE), resulting in an immediate reduction in GHG emissions. These initiatives strengthen energy independence and economic growth while supporting long-term sustainability. By providing capital-efficient energy solutions, these investments enhance grid reliability, drive innovation, and contribute to a stable and resilient energy future.<br/><br/>'This investment exemplifies how GEMS initiatives unite market competition and innovative capital deployment to deliver scalable, cost-effective energy solutions with measurable impacts,' said Benny Barton, Executive Manager of BadCarbon. 'With Nexus, we are actively shaping a future built on preservation and accelerating economic opportunities that establish the foundation for long-term energy prosperity.'<br/><br/>'The support from BadCarbon and HPS Investment Partners provides Nexus with the financial flexibility to execute our near-term growth strategy,' said Sargon Daniel, CEO of Nexus Renewable Power. 'With these projects, we are advancing renewable energy on the ERCOT grid and contributing to meaningful emissions reductions.'<br/><br/>The transaction was securely recorded and managed using The Northern Trust Carbon Ecosystem, a digital platform for the end-to-end lifecycle management of digital voluntary carbon credits leveraging private ledger digital blockchain technology.<br/><br/>Advising on the transaction, the Faegre Drinker team is committed to supporting this and other impact-driven transactions that address transparency, accountability, and the digitalization of carbon commodities markets. 'The BadCarbon collaboration establishes an effective benchmark for credible, market-driven energy strategies,' said Deanna Reitman, Partner and Co-Leader of the Energy Transactions Team law firm Faegre Drinker. 'Innovative projects like this create meaningful opportunities for the energy and commodities markets to strengthen resource security and deliver measurable energy benefits.'<br/><br/>This agreement underscores a commitment to deploying capital as a measurable driver of energy market expansion and long-term stability. As a first-of-its-kind investment, it establishes a framework where financial value is directly linked to accelerating clean energy growth, enhancing grid resilience, and strengthening domestic energy resources. This initiative paves the way for a more stable and prosperous energy future by aligning economic returns with energy security and sustainability.<br/><br/>Transactional counsel included Sidley Austin LLP for Nexus and Baker McKenzie LLP for BadCarbon.<br/><br/>About Nexus Renewable Power:<br/><br/>Nexus is a Texas-based company that develops, finances, and operates solar and energy storage assets.

Dailymail.Com</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin has identified where $20 billion of climate-related funds purposefully wasted by the Biden administration landed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He says Biden cronies dumped millions into a secretive unnamed 'outside financial institution.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It all came to light in a recent 'disturbing' video showing a Biden EPA political appointee. </p><p>The employee bragged abut how the administration was 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic' and rushing to get 'billions of your tax dollars out the door before Inauguration Day,' Zeldin said in a video.</p><p>'The gold bars were tax dollars, and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden administration knew they were wasting it.'</p><p>Zeldin said his team discovered where exactly the billions were intentionally placed by the outgoing Biden officials after they bragged about handing the money over to nonprofits to make it harder for Republicans to recover the funds. </p><p>The December report by Project Veritas shows EPA Adviser Brent Efron bragging about how Biden officials were spending agency money as fast as possible before Trump's administration could take over and cut their environmental spending. </p><p>'We're Throwing Gold Bars off the Titanic,' Efron said of the effort, calling it 'an insurance policy against Trump winning.'</p><p>The goal, he said, was to 'get the money out as fast as possible before they [the Trump administration] come in ... it's like we're on the Titanic and we're throwing gold bars off the edge.' </p><p>The adviser shared that he and his colleagues were frantically trying to send billions of dollars to nonprofits because if they held the cash it would be harder for the federal government under Trump to claw it back. </p><p>Efron explained how his agency had discretion over how to spend up to $50 billion worth of EPA money last year and that by mid-December, when his undercover interview was filmed, they only had roughly $2 billion left. </p><p>The adviser goes on to detail that if they did not spend the money before Trump's inauguration then a Republican official could order a freeze on spending and cut off their ability to dole out taxpayer funds. </p><p>The adviser then admits that he hopes to go work at ones of these recipients of government funds after leaving the EPA.</p><p>Efron notes how 'green banks' that 'make it more financially feasible to build renewables' received wads of cash in the Biden's waning days and that joining one of them after his government tenure would be 'cool.' </p><p>In Zeldin's announcement this week, he noted that the EPA will retrieve the $20 billion in funding sent to financiers that benefitted from Efron's wasteful spending. </p><p>'Shockingly, roughly $20 billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA,' the EPA administrator shares. </p><p>'This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history, and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.'</p><p>'Even further, this pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency.'</p><p>Zeldin admits theres currently no reason to believe the banks in question did any wrongdoing. </p><p>Though he confirmed that he is referring the matter to the EPA's inspector general and to the Department of Justice to investigate the incident. </p><p>'The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,' the administrator said in the video. </p><p>'I've directed my team to find your gold bars, and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-109117971</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F46-WHH3-RSJ8-W269-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"615\"/><timeReceived>9:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

This grant is aimed at implementing urban forestry efforts focused on tree planting and maintenance, and community engagement.</p><p><br/><br/>This significant contribution will be used to support WHC's initiatives aimed at preserving and protecting wildlife habitats across Northwest Indiana. WHC's focus is geared towards improving local canopy networks to help mitigate urban heat island effect, prevent sediment runoff in local waterways (namely the Grand Calumet River), and increase biodiversity in urban communities.<br/><br/>Throughout the initiative, community members will benefit from horticultural and arboricultural education, increasing local expertise and providing sustainable opportunities. After completion, Northwest Indiana communities will benefit from increased public green spaces that may be utilized for recreational activities and public wellness.<br/><br/>\"By nurturing local canopy networks and green spaces in urban areas, we are not only enhancing the environment but also creating a sense of pride and well-being among residents,\" said Daniel Goldfarb, Director of Social Impact, WHC. \"Our commitment to the area, both with our work and our membership presence, empowers us to continue making a positive impact one tree at a time.\"<br/><br/>Added Goldfarb, \"For our member companies located in the Great Lakes (and beyond), urban and community forestry is emerging as a key point of intersection between equity and justice efforts for communities, and climate adaptation actions contributing to corporate climate goals. It's another way to engage our corporate membership in the communities they work.\"<br/><br/>The collaboration between WHC and GreenLatinos highlights a shared commitment to environmental equity and community engagement. Together, both organizations will work to enhance biodiversity, promote the importance of preserving wildlife habitats in urban and underserved communities, and develop pathways for nature-related jobs.<br/><br/>This initiative is funded by the USDA Forest Service in aims of promoting health and vitality in urban communities across the United States. The USDA Forest Service Urban and Community Forest Program plays a vital role in fostering resilient and thriving urban forests for the benefit of present and future generations, while promoting a sense of stewardship and connection to nature within urban communities and environments.<br/><br/>About WHC (Soon to be Tandem Global)<br/><br/>WHC (Wildlife Habitat Council) has been working at the nexus of business and biodiversity for 35 years and is the only international NGO focused exclusively on enabling private sector action for nature. WHC builds strategies and frameworks for companies to integrate nature with climate, equity and engagement to support sustainable ecosystems and healthy communities. WHC's corporate members represent some of the leading national and multinational corporations. WHC-certified programs can be found in 19 countries and 48 U.S. states.

This grant is aimed at implementing urban forestry efforts focused on tree planting and maintenance, and community engagement.</p><p><br/><br/>This significant contribution will be used to support WHC's initiatives aimed at preserving and protecting wildlife habitats across Northwest Indiana. WHC's focus is geared towards improving local canopy networks to help mitigate urban heat island effect, prevent sediment runoff in local waterways (namely the Grand Calumet River), and increase biodiversity in urban communities.<br/><br/>Throughout the initiative, community members will benefit from horticultural and arboricultural education, increasing local expertise and providing sustainable opportunities. After completion, Northwest Indiana communities will benefit from increased public green spaces that may be utilized for recreational activities and public wellness.<br/><br/>\"By nurturing local canopy networks and green spaces in urban areas, we are not only enhancing the environment but also creating a sense of pride and well-being among residents,\" said Daniel Goldfarb, Director of Social Impact, WHC. \"Our commitment to the area, both with our work and our membership presence, empowers us to continue making a positive impact one tree at a time.\"<br/><br/>Added Goldfarb, \"For our member companies located in the Great Lakes (and beyond), urban and community forestry is emerging as a key point of intersection between equity and justice efforts for communities, and climate adaptation actions contributing to corporate climate goals. It's another way to engage our corporate membership in the communities they work.\"<br/><br/>The collaboration between WHC and GreenLatinos highlights a shared commitment to environmental equity and community engagement. Together, both organizations will work to enhance biodiversity, promote the importance of preserving wildlife habitats in urban and underserved communities, and develop pathways for nature-related jobs.<br/><br/>This initiative is funded by the USDA Forest Service in aims of promoting health and vitality in urban communities across the United States. The USDA Forest Service Urban and Community Forest Program plays a vital role in fostering resilient and thriving urban forests for the benefit of present and future generations, while promoting a sense of stewardship and connection to nature within urban communities and environments.<br/><br/>About WHC (Soon to be Tandem Global)<br/><br/>WHC (Wildlife Habitat Council) has been working at the nexus of business and biodiversity for 35 years and is the only international NGO focused exclusively on enabling private sector action for nature. WHC builds strategies and frameworks for companies to integrate nature with climate, equity and engagement to support sustainable ecosystems and healthy communities. WHC's corporate members represent some of the leading national and multinational corporations. WHC-certified programs can be found in 19 countries and 48 U.S. states.

Speaking at a panel titled 'The New Economic Revolution: An African Perspective' on February 11, 2025, he cited striking data that turns conventional wisdom on its head.<br/><br/>'We actually asked Moody's Analytics to look at the risk profile of Africa, of investments and infrastructure over the last 14 years. Guess what they found? The rate of loss in Africa is 1.7%. That in Latin America was about 13%. The one in Eastern Europe was more about 10%.'<br/><br/>These statistics paint a picture starkly different from the risk premiums typically demanded for African investments. The continent's actual performance suggests it might be one of the world's safest investment destinations-a reality masked by persistent negative stereotypes.<br/><br/>Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and chairman of multiple African businesses, spoke from direct experience: 'There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa.' Elumelu, whose portfolio spans power, oil and gas, financial services, and healthcare across four continents, including investments in the Gulf states.<br/><br/>He emphasized that success lies in seeing opportunity where others see risk.<br/><br/>'There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,' said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.<br/><br/>'There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,' said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.<br/><br/>'You may decide to see risks or challenges, or you may see opportunities,' Elumelu explained. 'But ability to identify opportunities and structure your approach in a way that addresses and mitigates those risks confers extra competitive advantage on you and your business.'<br/><br/>To bridge this perception gap, the African Development Bank Group announced plans to establish a new Africa Investment Guarantee Agency. The institution will offer comprehensive coverage against climate, equity, political, and currency risks-addressing key concerns that have historically deterred international investors.<br/><br/>The timing could not be more critical. Africa stands at the nexus of several global transitions: demographic, energy, and agricultural. With 75% of its population under 35 years old, including 600 million people between ages 15 and 35, the continent is positioned to become the world's workforce. Its vast mineral resources-including critical materials for electric vehicles and renewable energy-make it indispensable to the global energy transition.<br/><br/>'Whether it is lithium-ion batteries, whether it is electric vehicles, whether it's platinum, whether it's copper, whether it's graphite, whether it's any of this lithium-ion, all is in Africa,' Adesina noted. 'So what Africa actually does with its resources will shape the future of the world.'<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development story also came under scrutiny at the summit. Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh rejected this framing entirely, introducing instead the concept of 'conscientious concessions'.<br/><br/>These, he explained, are deals that benefit investors, governments, and local communities alike.<br/><br/>'It's so easy to speak about concessions from any one of these countries or from private sector that is 100 years, lots of waivers, employees coming from abroad, everything gets shipped out. That's not consensual. You're talking about bad deals, by the way, which turned things into a curse, and I think that's what people talk about,' Sengeh explained. He pointed to recent developments in Sierra Leone's rutile mining sector, where domestic ownership is changing the dynamics of resource management.<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.<br/><br/>'If we think about not just pennies, but the people and the planet, then the deals and the agreements we sign, with our conscience, will work for the people, will bring economic value for everyone, for the investor, for the government, and the people who are there,' Sengeh added.<br/><br/>The African Development Bank Group is actively working to facilitate such balanced agreements. 'We have the African Legal Support Facility at the African Development Bank to help Sierra Leone and DRC, several other countries, to be able to structure deals that are in their own interest,' Adesina explained.<br/><br/>The Africa Investment Forum Market Days held in Morocco in December 2024 demonstrated strong investor appetite when barriers are removed, securing $ 29.4 billion in investment interest within just 72 hours! This contributed to over $ 225 billion in investment interests mobilized since the Africa Investment Forum's inception in 2018. This success is part of a broader push to industrialize the continent and move beyond raw commodity exports.<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' Adesina emphasized. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>Major initiatives are already underway to build this infrastructure. The African Development Bank Group is investing $ 3 billion in special agro-industrial processing zones, while 'Mission 300,' a partnership with the World Bank, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans. These projects represent significant opportunities for private investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution.<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>The African Continental Free Trade Area, with its $ 3.4 trillion market potential and population of nearly 1.5 billion people, adds another layer of opportunity. 'Africa is not going to beg its way into development,' Adesina insisted. 'Africa is going to trade and invest its way into development.'<br/><br/>Looking ahead, African leaders are clear about who will drive this transformation. As Sierra Leone's Chief Minister Sengeh put it: 'Who's going to dominate in Africa? Africans are going to dominate in Africa.'

Speaking at a panel titled 'The New Economic Revolution: An African Perspective' on February 11, 2025, he cited striking data that turns conventional wisdom on its head.<br/><br/>'We actually asked Moody's Analytics to look at the risk profile of Africa, of investments and infrastructure over the last 14 years. Guess what they found? The rate of loss in Africa is 1.7%. That in Latin America was about 13%. The one in Eastern Europe was more about 10%.'<br/><br/>These statistics paint a picture starkly different from the risk premiums typically demanded for African investments. The continent's actual performance suggests it might be one of the world's safest investment destinations-a reality masked by persistent negative stereotypes.<br/><br/>Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and chairman of multiple African businesses, spoke from direct experience: 'There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa.' Elumelu, whose portfolio spans power, oil and gas, financial services, and healthcare across four continents, including investments in the Gulf states.<br/><br/>He emphasized that success lies in seeing opportunity where others see risk.<br/><br/>'There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,' said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.<br/><br/>'There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,' said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.<br/><br/>'You may decide to see risks or challenges, or you may see opportunities,' Elumelu explained. 'But ability to identify opportunities and structure your approach in a way that addresses and mitigates those risks confers extra competitive advantage on you and your business.'<br/><br/>To bridge this perception gap, the African Development Bank Group announced plans to establish a new Africa Investment Guarantee Agency. The institution will offer comprehensive coverage against climate, equity, political, and currency risks-addressing key concerns that have historically deterred international investors.<br/><br/>The timing could not be more critical. Africa stands at the nexus of several global transitions: demographic, energy, and agricultural. With 75% of its population under 35 years old, including 600 million people between ages 15 and 35, the continent is positioned to become the world's workforce. Its vast mineral resources-including critical materials for electric vehicles and renewable energy-make it indispensable to the global energy transition.<br/><br/>'Whether it is lithium-ion batteries, whether it is electric vehicles, whether it's platinum, whether it's copper, whether it's graphite, whether it's any of this lithium-ion, all is in Africa,' Adesina noted. 'So what Africa actually does with its resources will shape the future of the world.'<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development story also came under scrutiny at the summit. Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh rejected this framing entirely, introducing instead the concept of 'conscientious concessions'.<br/><br/>These, he explained, are deals that benefit investors, governments, and local communities alike.<br/><br/>'It's so easy to speak about concessions from any one of these countries or from private sector that is 100 years, lots of waivers, employees coming from abroad, everything gets shipped out. That's not consensual. You're talking about bad deals, by the way, which turned things into a curse, and I think that's what people talk about,' Sengeh explained. He pointed to recent developments in Sierra Leone's rutile mining sector, where domestic ownership is changing the dynamics of resource management.<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.<br/><br/>'If we think about not just pennies, but the people and the planet, then the deals and the agreements we sign, with our conscience, will work for the people, will bring economic value for everyone, for the investor, for the government, and the people who are there,' Sengeh added.<br/><br/>The African Development Bank Group is actively working to facilitate such balanced agreements. 'We have the African Legal Support Facility at the African Development Bank to help Sierra Leone and DRC, several other countries, to be able to structure deals that are in their own interest,' Adesina explained.<br/><br/>The Africa Investment Forum Market Days held in Morocco in December 2024 demonstrated strong investor appetite when barriers are removed, securing $ 29.4 billion in investment interest within just 72 hours! This contributed to over $ 225 billion in investment interests mobilized since the Africa Investment Forum's inception in 2018. This success is part of a broader push to industrialize the continent and move beyond raw commodity exports.<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' Adesina emphasized. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>Major initiatives are already underway to build this infrastructure. The African Development Bank Group is investing $ 3 billion in special agro-industrial processing zones, while 'Mission 300,' a partnership with the World Bank, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans. These projects represent significant opportunities for private investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution.<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>The African Continental Free Trade Area, with its $ 3.4 trillion market potential and population of nearly 1.5 billion people, adds another layer of opportunity. 'Africa is not going to beg its way into development,' Adesina insisted. 'Africa is going to trade and invest its way into development.'<br/><br/>Looking ahead, African leaders are clear about who will drive this transformation. As Sierra Leone's Chief Minister Sengeh put it: 'Who's going to dominate in Africa? Africans are going to dominate in Africa.' He called for 'progressive, social, democratic radicalism' to ensure development benefits all Africans.<br/><br/>For global investors, the message from Dubai was clear: the risk is not in investing in Africa, but in missing out on its opportunities.

Cemex sponsors this white paper, which is available for free on our website.</p><p><br/><br/>Biodiversity loss continues to pose a significant threat to ecosystems and human well-being. To address this global biodiversity crisis, the Global Diversity Framework (GBF) lists 23 targets to achieve by 2030. Following the initial announcement back in 2022, Target 15 was isolated, becoming the primary focus for corporate companies. While important, promoting and highlighting initiatives beyond Target 15 is necessary to push us forward. This conversation was highlighted at the latest Conference of Parties(COP16), where companies determined how the GBF goals and targets aligned to their national action plans.<br/><br/>Because we understand corporate conservation's long-term positive impact on biodiversity, communities, habitats, species, and company morale, WHC is committed to investing in all conservation efforts. Over the years, WHC-certified sites have made significant strides in facilitating nature-positive actions that align with GBF targets.

This commitment is strategically divided: $ 50 million supports nonprofit grants that empower organizations driving climate and social impact, while the other $ 50 million is dedicated to equity and debt investments in early-stage climate startups (Seed to Series A) and venture funds.</p><p><br/><br/>As climate challenges accelerate and natural disasters intensify, the $ 50m climate investments program has refined its approach to impact investing by focusing on transformative, venture-backed technologies and solutions. Today, we're proud to announce the evolution and rebranding of our climate investments program as the Regenerative Future Fund.<br/><br/>This new name reflects our deep commitment to leveraging the Foundation's endowment to drive scalable, high-impact solutions. By investing in startups and venture funds that deliver measurable, transformative results, the Regenerative Future Fund focuses on regenerating ecosystems, strengthening community resilience, and advancing sustainable economies.<br/><br/>Beyond providing capital, the Fund embodies the Cisco Foundation's holistic approach: catalyzing market-driven, regenerative solutions that actively protect and renew our planet. With portfolio development support and a vision to accelerate the next wave of climate innovation, the Regenerative Future Fund is dedicated to creating a more sustainable, thriving future through its portfolio of solutions.<br/><br/>Why the Regenerative Future Fund?<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is part of our Cisco Foundation $ 100M Climate Impact and Regeneration commitment. It represents our belief in the power of climate impact investing to drive tangible, meaningful action. Through the Fund we will continue to invest in climate tech companies at the seed and series A stages, while also serving as a limited partner with early-stage venture funds advancing climate solutions. This dual approach enables us to support high-potential startups directly, de-risk key early-stage markets, and foster ecosystems of innovation through venture fund partnerships.<br/><br/>Our vision is to help build systems where humanity and nature thrive together. This rebranding signals a sharpened focus on technologies and solutions that regenerate rather than deplete and that strengthen resilience, particularly for communities most impacted by climate change. Our priorities include:<br/><br/>- Restoring and regenerating: Supporting innovations that replenish biodiversity, restore and build resilient ecosystems, and advance circular, regenerative economies.<br/><br/>- Prioritizing co-benefits, climate equity and inclusion: Championing solutions that promote resilience and equity in communities facing climate risks.<br/><br/>- Catalyzing lasting change: Investing in breakthrough ideas that reshape industries towards sustainability, such as regenerative agriculture and the built environment.<br/><br/>Why Now?<br/><br/>The climate tech investment landscape has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few years. After peaking in 2021 with a record $ 48 billion in global venture and growth equity investment, the sector saw a third successive year of decline in 2024, dropping to $ 30 billion-a 14% decrease from 2023 and a 37% drop from its 2021 peak (Sightline Climate). However, the climate tech sector has demonstrated resilience compared to the venture capital market, where investment volumes have plummeted by 52% since 2021, largely due to rising interest rates (KPMG). Carbon technology investing has bucked the overall trend, experiencing a 24% increase in venture capital investments in 2023, totaling $ 17.7 billion (Pitchbook). This surge has been driven by regulatory demand and corporate decarbonization goals, highlighting the growing importance of scalable carbon solutions.<br/><br/>Why Catalytic Impact Capital Is Still Needed: Catalytic capital like Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund is needed now more than ever to provide the funding required for first-of-a-kind and scaling innovations essential to meeting global climate goals (Foley Hoag). With their resources, networks, and influence, corporate foundations like Cisco Foundation can help elevate pioneering technologies and position them to be adopted and scaled by larger players in the tech ecosystems. By stepping in where the market falls short, catalytic funding can ensure that transformative solutions are scaled to deliver meaningful climate impact.<br/><br/>Early-Stage Climate Investments Hold Strong: Within the climate tech space, early-stage investments have shown remarkable durability. In 2023, 69% of climate tech deals were directed toward early-stage companies-an increase of 14 percentage points from the prior year (CB Insights). In addition, the overall financing picture for climate tech start-ups is evolving. While equity investments have declined, new forms of non-dilutive capital are stepping in. Debt financing for climate tech soared from $ 13.9 billion in 2021 to $ 45.6 billion in 2024, as companies transition from venture capital to bank loans and other funding sources (Net Zero Insights).<br/><br/>Gaps in Funding for Adaptation, Biodiversity, Decarbonization, and Nature: Despite these advances, critical funding gaps remain. Adaptation finance represents just 10% of global climate finance (UNEP), while investments in nature-based solutions and biodiversity remain underfunded despite their crucial role in combating climate change. Additionally, climate mitigation and decarbonization technologies still struggle to attract the necessary capital to scale solutions.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, by refocusing as the Regenerative Future Fund, we reaffirm our dedication to solutions that regenerate ecosystems and drive resilient, sustainable growth. Through catalytic venture capital, we aim to address the critical funding gaps in adaptation, mitigation, and nature-based solutions, supporting innovations that harmonize with natural systems. Together, we're working to create a future where businesses, ecosystems, and communities can thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>Celebrating Our Portfolio's Progress<br/><br/>Since 2021, the Regenerative Future Fund has been a catalyst for transformative change, weaving a tapestry of innovation in more than 25 companies and funds. As we cross the halfway mark in deploying our committed capital, the stories of our portfolio light the path to a more sustainable and equitable future, including:<br/><br/>- Building Resilient Ecosystems. At the heart of disaster preparedness lies the ability to anticipate and adapt. Our portfolio company Hohonu is leading the charge in protecting communities from the rising threats of flooding and sea-level rise. With its groundbreaking real-time water monitoring technology, Hohonu equips municipalities, insurance, researchers, and underserved communities with the tools to stay ahead of climate-driven disasters. By collecting over 2 million hours of precise data, Hohonu has laid a critical foundation for safeguarding livelihoods and resilient ecosystems. The fund also aims to bolster solutions in regenerative agriculture to enforce the climate resilience of our soil, farmlands, and farmer systems to extreme weather events through investments like in Trailhead Capital.<br/><br/>- Leading Decarbonization Across Land, Sea, and Cities. The Cisco Foundation is advancing transformative decarbonization with investments across ecosystems. In the ocean and coastal sector, Ebb Carbon is pioneering Electrochemical Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement to remove up to 350,000 tons of CO2 over the next decade in partnership with Microsoft. This builds on our initial commitment to marine and coastal technologies, starting in 2022 with our investment in Vesta. On land, Terradot is scaling Enhanced Rock Weathering in tropical climates, supported by $ 58.2 million in new funding and partnerships with Google, Frontier, and Microsoft. In industry, CarbonBuilt is transforming the cement sector with its breakthrough low-carbon concrete technology, recently securing a major deployment agreement with Meta. A few months ago, we also backed Carbon Reform's innovative solution for the built environment.<br/><br/>- Reimagining Carbon Markets for a Transparent Future. We also support platforms and solutions that will make decarbonization technologies a success. The frontier of Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) is being reshaped by portfolio visionaries like Chloris Geospatial and Miraterra. Chloris's partnership with Trove Research is bringing clarity to over 550 forest carbon projects, illuminating pathways to accountability. Meanwhile, Miraterra is revolutionizing soil carbon monitoring. By combining AI and sensor technology, Miraterra empowers landowners to accurately measure, track, and increase soil carbon stocks, bridging the gap between more sustainable agriculture and robust carbon markets.<br/><br/>- Expanding Access with Inclusive Clean Energy. From African villages to bustling urban centers, our dynamic clean energy portfolio is powering communities with hope and resilience. Jaza Energy, through its acquisition, has not just marked a successful exit but amplified its mission of solar-powered empowerment. And the merger of SteamaCo and Shyft Power Solutions is rewriting the playbook for decentralized renewable energy for Africa and South Asia. In the spring of 2024, our investment in Aikido Technologies has propelled advancements in floating offshore wind solutions. Their Aikido One platform achieved a groundbreaking milestone with its final structural assembly completed in under 40 working hours-a tenfold increase in speed compared to traditional methods-setting a new standard in the industrialization of floating platforms.<br/><br/>- De-Risking Early-Stage Climate Capital. Our climate venture funds are at the forefront of driving systemic change. The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility (SEACEF) has established the first blended finance fund for the energy transition in Southeast Asia. The fund is electrifying Southeast Asia's energy landscape by supporting transformative early-stage projects aimed at accelerating the region's transition to renewable energy. Third Sphere is empowering startups to push the boundaries of venture investing in climate with groundbreaking hardware solutions. By building the world's leading venture fund for biodiversity, Superorganism is setting a new community for nature technologies globally. Enduring Planet is redefining climate financing by providing rapid and flexible capital to founders, while, Catalyst Fund and Katapult deliver tailored, quality venture support to ventures across Africa and Europe, respectively, to drive impact and address key needs beyond capital.<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is more than an impact investment initiative-it's a community of visionary founders, co-investors, and partners working together to build bridges to a regenerative, resilient future.<br/><br/>Just as Cisco connects the world through transformative technology, we're connecting businesses, ecosystems, and communities to create a regenerative world where innovation and resilience thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>With every venture investment and partner fund, we're weaving a web of opportunity and impact, ensuring a future where people and planet are more resilient together.<br/><br/>To connect with us, learn more, or share a pitch deck, and please follow our online form or reach out on LinkedIn.<br/><br/>About Cisco Foundation<br/><br/>Cisco Foundation envisions a world of equitable, resilient and empowered communities where everyone can reach their full potential and thrive.

This commitment is strategically divided: $ 50 million supports nonprofit grants that empower organizations driving climate and social impact, while the other $ 50 million is dedicated to equity and debt investments in early-stage climate startups (Seed to Series A) and venture funds.</p><p><br/><br/>As climate challenges accelerate and natural disasters intensify, the $ 50m climate investments program has refined its approach to impact investing by focusing on transformative, venture-backed technologies and solutions. Today, we're proud to announce the evolution and rebranding of our climate investments program as the Regenerative Future Fund.<br/><br/>This new name reflects our deep commitment to leveraging the Foundation's endowment to drive scalable, high-impact solutions. By investing in startups and venture funds that deliver measurable, transformative results, the Regenerative Future Fund focuses on regenerating ecosystems, strengthening community resilience, and advancing sustainable economies.<br/><br/>Beyond providing capital, the Fund embodies the Cisco Foundation's holistic approach: catalyzing market-driven, regenerative solutions that actively protect and renew our planet. With portfolio development support and a vision to accelerate the next wave of climate innovation, the Regenerative Future Fund is dedicated to creating a more sustainable, thriving future through its portfolio of solutions.<br/><br/>Why the Regenerative Future Fund?<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is part of our Cisco Foundation $ 100M Climate Impact and Regeneration commitment. It represents our belief in the power of climate impact investing to drive tangible, meaningful action. Through the Fund we will continue to invest in climate tech companies at the seed and series A stages, while also serving as a limited partner with early-stage venture funds advancing climate solutions. This dual approach enables us to support high-potential startups directly, de-risk key early-stage markets, and foster ecosystems of innovation through venture fund partnerships.<br/><br/>Our vision is to help build systems where humanity and nature thrive together. This rebranding signals a sharpened focus on technologies and solutions that regenerate rather than deplete and that strengthen resilience, particularly for communities most impacted by climate change. Our priorities include:<br/><br/>- Restoring and regenerating: Supporting innovations that replenish biodiversity, restore and build resilient ecosystems, and advance circular, regenerative economies.<br/><br/>- Prioritizing co-benefits, climate equity and inclusion: Championing solutions that promote resilience and equity in communities facing climate risks.<br/><br/>- Catalyzing lasting change: Investing in breakthrough ideas that reshape industries towards sustainability, such as regenerative agriculture and the built environment.<br/><br/>Why Now?<br/><br/>The climate tech investment landscape has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few years. After peaking in 2021 with a record $ 48 billion in global venture and growth equity investment, the sector saw a third successive year of decline in 2024, dropping to $ 30 billion-a 14% decrease from 2023 and a 37% drop from its 2021 peak (Sightline Climate). However, the climate tech sector has demonstrated resilience compared to the venture capital market, where investment volumes have plummeted by 52% since 2021, largely due to rising interest rates (KPMG). Carbon technology investing has bucked the overall trend, experiencing a 24% increase in venture capital investments in 2023, totaling $ 17.7 billion (Pitchbook). This surge has been driven by regulatory demand and corporate decarbonization goals, highlighting the growing importance of scalable carbon solutions.<br/><br/>Why Catalytic Impact Capital Is Still Needed: Catalytic capital like Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund is needed now more than ever to provide the funding required for first-of-a-kind and scaling innovations essential to meeting global climate goals (Foley Hoag). With their resources, networks, and influence, corporate foundations like Cisco Foundation can help elevate pioneering technologies and position them to be adopted and scaled by larger players in the tech ecosystems. By stepping in where the market falls short, catalytic funding can ensure that transformative solutions are scaled to deliver meaningful climate impact.<br/><br/>Early-Stage Climate Investments Hold Strong: Within the climate tech space, early-stage investments have shown remarkable durability. In 2023, 69% of climate tech deals were directed toward early-stage companies-an increase of 14 percentage points from the prior year (CB Insights). In addition, the overall financing picture for climate tech start-ups is evolving. While equity investments have declined, new forms of non-dilutive capital are stepping in. Debt financing for climate tech soared from $ 13.9 billion in 2021 to $ 45.6 billion in 2024, as companies transition from venture capital to bank loans and other funding sources (Net Zero Insights).<br/><br/>Gaps in Funding for Adaptation, Biodiversity, Decarbonization, and Nature: Despite these advances, critical funding gaps remain. Adaptation finance represents just 10% of global climate finance (UNEP), while investments in nature-based solutions and biodiversity remain underfunded despite their crucial role in combating climate change. Additionally, climate mitigation and decarbonization technologies still struggle to attract the necessary capital to scale solutions.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, by refocusing as the Regenerative Future Fund, we reaffirm our dedication to solutions that regenerate ecosystems and drive resilient, sustainable growth. Through catalytic venture capital, we aim to address the critical funding gaps in adaptation, mitigation, and nature-based solutions, supporting innovations that harmonize with natural systems. Together, we're working to create a future where businesses, ecosystems, and communities can thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>Celebrating Our Portfolio's Progress<br/><br/>Since 2021, the Regenerative Future Fund has been a catalyst for transformative change, weaving a tapestry of innovation in more than 25 companies and funds. As we cross the halfway mark in deploying our committed capital, the stories of our portfolio light the path to a more sustainable and equitable future, including:<br/><br/>- Building Resilient Ecosystems. At the heart of disaster preparedness lies the ability to anticipate and adapt. Our portfolio company Hohonu is leading the charge in protecting communities from the rising threats of flooding and sea-level rise. With its groundbreaking real-time water monitoring technology, Hohonu equips municipalities, insurance, researchers, and underserved communities with the tools to stay ahead of climate-driven disasters. By collecting over 2 million hours of precise data, Hohonu has laid a critical foundation for safeguarding livelihoods and resilient ecosystems. The fund also aims to bolster solutions in regenerative agriculture to enforce the climate resilience of our soil, farmlands, and farmer systems to extreme weather events through investments like in Trailhead Capital.<br/><br/>- Leading Decarbonization Across Land, Sea, and Cities. The Cisco Foundation is advancing transformative decarbonization with investments across ecosystems. In the ocean and coastal sector, Ebb Carbon is pioneering Electrochemical Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement to remove up to 350,000 tons of CO2 over the next decade in partnership with Microsoft. This builds on our initial commitment to marine and coastal technologies, starting in 2022 with our investment in Vesta. On land, Terradot is scaling Enhanced Rock Weathering in tropical climates, supported by $ 58.2 million in new funding and partnerships with Google, Frontier, and Microsoft. In industry, CarbonBuilt is transforming the cement sector with its breakthrough low-carbon concrete technology, recently securing a major deployment agreement with Meta. A few months ago, we also backed Carbon Reform's innovative solution for the built environment.<br/><br/>- Reimagining Carbon Markets for a Transparent Future. We also support platforms and solutions that will make decarbonization technologies a success. The frontier of Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) is being reshaped by portfolio visionaries like Chloris Geospatial and Miraterra. Chloris's partnership with Trove Research is bringing clarity to over 550 forest carbon projects, illuminating pathways to accountability. Meanwhile, Miraterra is revolutionizing soil carbon monitoring. By combining AI and sensor technology, Miraterra empowers landowners to accurately measure, track, and increase soil carbon stocks, bridging the gap between more sustainable agriculture and robust carbon markets.<br/><br/>- Expanding Access with Inclusive Clean Energy. From African villages to bustling urban centers, our dynamic clean energy portfolio is powering communities with hope and resilience. Jaza Energy, through its acquisition, has not just marked a successful exit but amplified its mission of solar-powered empowerment. And the merger of SteamaCo and Shyft Power Solutions is rewriting the playbook for decentralized renewable energy for Africa and South Asia. In the spring of 2024, our investment in Aikido Technologies has propelled advancements in floating offshore wind solutions. Their Aikido One platform achieved a groundbreaking milestone with its final structural assembly completed in under 40 working hours-a tenfold increase in speed compared to traditional methods-setting a new standard in the industrialization of floating platforms.<br/><br/>- De-Risking Early-Stage Climate Capital. Our climate venture funds are at the forefront of driving systemic change. The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility (SEACEF) has established the first blended finance fund for the energy transition in Southeast Asia. The fund is electrifying Southeast Asia's energy landscape by supporting transformative early-stage projects aimed at accelerating the region's transition to renewable energy. Third Sphere is empowering startups to push the boundaries of venture investing in climate with groundbreaking hardware solutions. By building the world's leading venture fund for biodiversity, Superorganism is setting a new community for nature technologies globally. Enduring Planet is redefining climate financing by providing rapid and flexible capital to founders, while, Catalyst Fund and Katapult deliver tailored, quality venture support to ventures across Africa and Europe, respectively, to drive impact and address key needs beyond capital.<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is more than an impact investment initiative-it's a community of visionary founders, co-investors, and partners working together to build bridges to a regenerative, resilient future.<br/><br/>Just as Cisco connects the world through transformative technology, we're connecting businesses, ecosystems, and communities to create a regenerative world where innovation and resilience thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>With every venture investment and partner fund, we're weaving a web of opportunity and impact, ensuring a future where people and planet are more resilient together.<br/><br/>To connect with us, learn more, or share a pitch deck, and please follow our online form or reach out on LinkedIn.<br/><br/>About Cisco Foundation<br/><br/>Cisco Foundation envisions a world of equitable, resilient and empowered communities where everyone can reach their full potential and thrive.

Lawyers, legislators and regulators have spent decades trying to craft and alter laws to reflect current political, economic and social ideals, or to achieve certain outcomes for environmental health, endangered species and resource use. As legal systems and treaties try to absorb and adjudicate the expansion of environmental rights and rise in ecological impacts around the world, notions of justice, equality and responsibility for human and natural ecosystems are becoming increasingly contested.</p><p>This month\u2019s issue of Nature Sustainability features a Focus on environmental law, with five pieces that will not only illuminate this particular area of study to our regular readers (and bring our legal brethren into the interdisciplinary fold), but also help to advance understanding of how aspects of environmental law are changing and will continue to change in the context and service of broader sustainability trends. Although the primary area of this Focus issue is on civil rather than criminal law, both threads are essential for understanding the scale and scope of how regulations, legislation and the many facets of the legal system seep into and shape our interactions with the environment.</p><p>In this issue, Misato Sato and colleagues examine how climate change litigation against emitting firms can have immediate and lasting market implications on the stock value of the targeted businesses. In their article, they find that across 108 pieces of climate litigation in Europe and the United States from 2005 to 2021, not only did a negative result in a lawsuit against a company result in an average stock market hit of about US$360 million (compared with a $190 million increase if the judgement was positive), but those impacts got bigger over time as the number of lawsuits against firms increased, suggesting that markets are becoming ever more responsive to the legal liability of companies that are seen to be causing climate change.</p><p>Looking more broadly at litigation in the United States, Christopher Rea and colleagues compile some 27,000 pieces of environmental litigation and more than 4,000 judicial decisions between 1988 and 2022 to find patterns in who is suing who, for what and where. Among their findings is that contrary to a belief in overzealous activists or power-hungry bureaucrats, environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs), companies and the federal government are generally equal in how many lawsuits they bring. Looking at the geography of where these suits are filed, they find that the federal government stays primarily within eastern courts where questions of process and jurisdiction for agencies are most pressing, while NGOs tend to do battle in courts in the western USA where land use and conservation matters are both intensely local and national at the same time; as judges are selected by politicians, with partisan interest, to be on these different courts, the question of where lawsuits are filed, in order to achieve a desired outcome, becomes yet another tactic of litigation efforts. Sabrina McCormick follows up this study with a News &amp; Views putting these findings in context for American environmental jurisprudence, making the point that as the total number of suits declines over time, the remaining gaps in environmental legislation may become clearer precisely because so many issues have been handled and settled through litigation.</p><p>Annalisa Savaresi and co-authors tackle the subject of \u2018just transition litigation\u2019 in their Perspective, aiming to conceptualize and ground how the values and aims of a just transition for climate equity and sustainable living can be achieved, or might be hindered, through existing law. With examples of litigation from around the world, they highlight three dimensions of justice \u2014 distributive, procedural and recognition \u2014 to emphasize that while there is a lot of already written and decided law on the books, much of how these laws will be applied for and against groups, governments and companies around the world is yet to be decided, because how we think about the law is also changing over time.</p><p>To round out our Focus, John Ruple of the University of Utah pens a World View reflecting on a career within environmental agencies and clarifying some misconceptions about how those agencies and their regulations work in practice. His advice for how to improve the regulatory regime under which companies, organizations and individuals use or abuse the land, air and water: fill the empty desks at environmental agencies by fully staffing and resourcing them so that they can evaluate environmental impacts faster and with better clarity to reduce costly litigation, or better prosecute wrongdoers, in the long run.</p><p>This is not the first time we have published research on how the law intersects with environmental policy or activism, but we hope to see much more cross-pollination of studies and perspectives between the scientific and legal communities so that their primary meeting place to determine the finer points of sage grouse habitats or transboundary river rights isn\u2019t inside a legislative chamber, courthouse or deposition room. Researchers and NGOs may feel up against the odds at times when confronted with the scale of the legal system that governs issues such as land use, pollution levels, food security and beyond, yet it is important to keep in mind that these systems are as malleable as any social institution and will have to respond to real-world changes in human values and ecosystem health. The law may not yet or always be equal, but it is not written in stone either. It is up to us to make it majestic.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNNASU-s41893024014847</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNNASU2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFX-BNT1-F129-P0RT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">483239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1003\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nature Sustainability</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 2398-9629</issn><volume>Vol. 7</volume><issueNumber>No. 11</issueNumber><publicationDate month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The global migration of people into cities has continued, and organizations like the International Panel on Climate Change have begun emphasizing the vital role of sub-state actors in climate adaptation and mitigation in actions related to land-use planning, infrastructure, transportation, housing, community development, and others. National and international network-serving and advocacy organizations working on climate change and other sustainability issues at the municipal level have emerged, for example, C40, the Global Covenant of Mayors, the Carbon Neutral Cities Alliance, and the Urban Sustainability Directors Network. Political and civil servant leadership from cities is a powerful force for change on the world stage, with growing influence on other levels of government, business, civil society, and the public imagination in far-reaching ways.</p><p>While city leadership on climate-related work continues to strengthen, it is often treated as a technical, engineering, land use, and financial challenge and the related systemic challenge of ongoing and growing inequity tends to be un(der) addressed in urban climate plans and policies\u2013. While cities work to mitigate and adapt to a changing climate, the very same people, lands, and waters who have been systemically excluded, oppressed, and exploited by the dominant structures and processes of government continue to be left out\u2013. This is a compelling impetus for transformative innovation, so that in their eagerness to act on climate, cities do not recreate and perpetuate problematic practices from the past/present that result in inequity and oppression,. There is an opportunity to reimagine the policy-making and planning processes of local government to ensure that climate-related concerns are considered in an integrated way with equity, justice, reconciliation, and decolonization work,. Climate change issues have the same systemic root causes of colonialism, capitalism, white supremacy, patriarchy, ableism, and cis-heteronormativy and can and should be worked on together\u2013.</p><p>The standard policy-making and planning processes used in local governments in many parts of the world, and embedded in the New Public Management, western, colonial governance paradigms, are being reinforced rather than being reimagined in many cases as governments work to innovate in response to complex challenges like climate change\u2013. This remains the case even as the suitability of these paradigms to respond to complex, social and ecological justice challenges at the rate, scale, and depth required is being questioned, with calls for transformation and innovation becoming louder and more urgent\u2013. The standard policy making cycle of agenda-setting, policy formulation, decision making, policy implementation, and policy evaluation is deeply embedded into the thinking, structures, and processes of governments around the world. This cycle \u201coffers practitioners a means to conceptually and practically guide an issue methodically through the policy process\u201d and has been both described and critiqued for decades, with academics seeking further nuance and complexity to the model and practitioners requiring a variety of process interventions that work in the real world on increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous challenges.</p><p>Similar to the standard policy making cycle, urban planning is characterized by evidence-based rationality and objectivity, established administrative routines, rule-bound bureaucratic procedures, and significant emphasis on a planner\u2019s ability to know what is good for people generally, or the public interest,,. While planning has evolved over decades to consciously seek to redistribute power through equity planning and to better align with the goals of communities through radical planning, planning processes often still involve \u201cthe analysis of problems, the setting of broad objectives, the survey of available resources, and the establishment of specific operating targets''. As planning processes continue to impede innovation and adaptation to dynamic pressures, planning must evolve to address the unpredictability of the complex challenges we face. For instance, a pressing challenge for planning (and policy making) is reconciling its role in perpetuating the dispossession, oppression, and marginalization of Indigenous Peoples and communities and grappling with the reality that all planning in Canadian cities happens on stolen Indigenous lands\u2013.</p><p>In Decolonizing Methodologies, Linda Tuhiwai Smith provides a working definition of decolonization, which \u201cdoes not mean and has not meant a total rejection of all theory or research or Western knowledge. Rather it is about centring [our] concerns and world views and then coming to know and understand theory and research from our own perspectives and purposes\u201d. Central to decolonizing methodologies within the context of working to transform complex urban climate, equity, and decolonization challenges is recognizing the coexistence of distinct knowledge systems, and how these distinct knowledge systems can work alongside each other in a good way. Conventional systems-based approaches have foundations in the scientific method that pursues knowledge in an analytical way, while Indigenous ways of knowing is about (for Elders) the pursuit of wisdom in action and using the mind, body, emotion, and spirit to make meaning of the world around us. Importantly, Indigenous ways of knowing are innately tied to the land,. Scholars and practitioners are applying decolonizing principles to their work, and central to this process is the idea that change happens from people going inward within themselves. Planning practice is starting to acknowledge this turn inwards as well, and is recognizing that people are not disconnected from other living beings and that we must connect our present lives with nature. These principles are a departure from the rational and objective mindsets that planners and policymakers have been trained to use for decades.</p><p>Concepts like justice, equity, and decolonization are not static, singular, with clear and agreed upon meanings. They are contested and actively being worked out in institutions, processes, and everyday life, and are expressed differently according to place, context, history, and culture. Tuck and Yang (2012, p.7) point out that settler colonialism and its decolonization implicates and unsettles everyone and argue that decolonization is only about land and Indigenous life. In other words, decolonization is not a metaphor for \u201cother things we want to do to improve our societies\u201d (p.1). This article pushes us to think critically about the word decolonization and what it means in planning and policy making practice. Tuck and Yang\u2019s settler moves to innocence reveal attempts to reconcile settler guilt and complicity that do not require giving up land, power, or privilege. We agree the central work of decolonization should be the return of land. At the same time, as planners and policymakers doing research entangled with practice, we are motivated to find meaningful entry points to decolonization through practices that every planner and policymaker can enact. In this research we take the perspective that settler colonialism is an ongoing structure and not an event. Our guiding principle, at least for now, is that decolonization work is for all of us to do and so we are enacting it as practice(s), and expressing these practices in multiple and embodied ways in the specific context of complex policy making and planning challenges. That said, decolonization work will look different for non-Indigenous peoples than it does for Indigenous Peoples. For Bob Joseph (2023), acts of decolonization restore Indigenous worldviews, restore culture and traditional ways, and decolonization replaces Western interpretations of history with Indigenous perspectives of history. Here we focus on policy-making and planning practice happening within settler colonial systems of local government, and explore what and how we might (un)learn and practice equity, justice, and decolonization for/among each other in the context of urban climate work.</p><p>The nature of planning and policy-making processes as they relate specifically to climate change mitigation and adaptation challenges are distinct and complex. Climate change research has rapidly expanded and evolved over the last decade, with studies being undertaken in every discipline, using diverse methodologies, providing insights for every sector, and in every part of the world. The collective of researchers that forms the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is capturing this vast field and then informing, motivating, and compelling responses from global actors through their Working Group reports and summaries for policy makers. With each report of the IPCC there is stronger consensus about the impacts, extent, and urgency of a changing climate. Promising pathways for action are becoming clearer and better evidenced, and enabling conditions and barriers to action are descriptive and explicit. The processes of activating and scaling robust, global responses by elected leaders, civil servants, financial institutions, businesses, nonprofits, in the (now) short time frames to reduce the most significant impacts on our already changing world remains fraught and inconsistent. There is much to gain and much to lose, with unequal distribution of burdens and benefits. There is an unreliable patchwork of country- and sub-state level policies, plans, targets, and financing commitments with varying degrees of commitment and impact, and very few enforceable accountability mechanisms in place. This approach continues to leave those most vulnerable to a changing climate improperly resourced to act. The roles of sub-state actors, including cities, is becoming more visible in this recent IPCC work, and this global climate context plays out in the daily lived experiences of city dwellers. There are many tensions and conflicts that exist in urban climate policy and planning, with civil servants needing to navigate the complexities of varying political support, limited jurisdiction, inadequate financing tools, challenges with data availability and staff expertise, bureaucratic silos, and inconsistent regulatory and accountability frameworks.</p><p>What then is demanded/required of urban planners and policymakers if the dominant approaches taken in their work no longer serve complex, intersectional, and systemic challenges of climate, equity, and decolonization? Theories and practices from the fields of social innovation, systemic design, and decolonizing methodologies (see above) offer promising alternatives for working differently on these complex challenges. Social innovation theory integrates many fields of social science and systems practice in service of shifting deep structures - hearts, minds, and culture - and of scaling and movement building for transformative socio-ecological change. Systemic design brings a designerly mindset, lineage, frame of reference, training, approach, and set of experiences into this mix. The experimentation- and action-as-learning bias of systemic design ensures that innovations land in the real world, in testable experiences, with- and for the people and places most affected by a particular challenge. Decolonizing methodologies ensures that social innovations and systemic design do not work within dominant and problematic paradigms of colonization and oppression and inadvertently perpetuate these systems under the guise of \u2018innovation.\u2019 Instead wisdom and insight is sourced from culture, history, people, and possibility and is deeply grounded in place-based and relational practice. Together they can inform the evolution of policy making and planning processes in ways that may result in more significant shifts than are possible when working within dominant systems that have oppression, inequity, and exploitation of humans and nature baked in.</p><p>Social innovations work to transform the behaviours, structures, mindsets, and beliefs of a social system with an intent to more skillfully and effectively respond to problems than is possible through existing or commonly used approaches that are less likely to address root causes of wicked challenges\u2013. An innovation is \u2018social\u2019 in that it aims to shift social practices, ideas, beliefs, interests, power, and agency so that innovations are diffused, scaled, institutionalized, or otherwise integrated and made routine. Social innovation processes follow a series of stages, often facilitated as iterations or cycles of experimentation and learning as new/different solutions emerge through a collaborative process, including the following stages: problem/challenge framing; action or user research; generating ideas; developing and testing ideas through experimentation; evaluation, reframing, and iteration; implementation at increasing levels of fidelity; scaling successful solutions out/up/deep; and ultimately changing systems\u2013. Some social innovation process archetypes stay focused on the specific challenge they are tackling, whereas others bring in a stronger personal transformation orientation, recognizing that inner work is required for outward-oriented change\u2013.</p><p>Systemic design integrates systems thinking into human-centered and service design approaches for working creatively on complex challenges. Jones &amp; Kijima (2018) say that \u201csystemic design advances an integrative interdiscipline with the potential to implement systems theory with creative methods and mindsets, by bringing deep technical knowledge, aesthetic skill, and creative implementation to the most abstract programmes of collective action\u201d (p. ix). Systemic design processes tend to oscillate between convergent and divergent thinking and doing, hold a strong bias toward action and experimentation, and enable right-sized risk-taking and micro-failures early on as critical pathways for learning. Examples of systemic design process archetypes include: ask, try, do; strategy, discover, design, develop, deploy; and inquire, frame, formulate, generate, reflect, facilitate\u2013. Systemic design has roots in human-centred or service design practice which center user (those most affected by a challenge) experiences; however, it significantly differs from these modes of design in that it holds deeper attention to mindsets, values, context, power relationships, leadership, and systems, and then connects these activities in a strategic learning system\u2013. Recent critique of the field and practice of design from an equity and justice point of view is resulting in theory, frameworks, and approaches to encourage/enable/require centering equity in design processes more skillfully and consistently\u2013.</p><p>Social innovation, systemic design, and decolonizing methodologies have strengths that were woven together into a different planning and policy making process in this applied research. In the next section we describe how we designed and implemented this weaving in our project, as well as into a framework that describes a transformative approach to policy making and planning processes.</p><p>Results</p><p>Experimenting with transformative process design and facilitation</p><p>The transformative policy making and planning process framework described in this section resulted from a year-long participatory action research study (\u2018learning journey\u2019) that was delivered in 2021. The learning journey was designed and facilitated by a diverse seven-person core research team (including the authors of this article), consisting of formal academic researchers as well as researcher-practitioners. Learning journey-goers, also known as our co-researchers, included municipal staff from multiple departments working in ten Canadian city-based teams (two of these teams included participants from community-based organizations), and staff from two Canadian network serving organizations (see Methods section for further details). Each team began their learning journey by preparing a design brief that described their understanding of the complex climate, equity, and decolonization question that they were beginning with, the North and Near stars (i.e. vision and goals) for their work, the theory of change informing their current approach to transformation, description of the people/places most impacted by their challenge, and the inner work and learning they committed to do. The learning journey was delivered through thirteen half-day virtual workshops (represented by the dots along the line) over nine months and active \u2018invitations to practice\u2019 (i.e. homework, represented by the connecting line) in between sessions. A visual representation of the process arc and high-level focus of each of the workshops and stages is shown in Fig. .</p><p>Transforming Cities from Within learning journey process map.</p><p>The learning journey was designed and facilitated as an intentionally transformative alternative to more standard and familiar processes. Each of the dots represents a half day synchronous, virtual workshop led by the core research team. Each workshop had a specific focus topic and practice, and overall the sessions were designed with consistent core elements, including: slow and reflective experience to enable deeper systemic work; mindfulness/embodiment practice; reflective practices; more formal teaching and content-giving; stories from the field; connecting and relationship building; team working/practice activities; and sharing our works in process. In between the workshops (the dotted line) were specific activities/homework, described as \u2018invitations to practice,\u2019 for the teams to apply and experiment with. The core research team used interactive slide decks, online collaboration tools and templates, one-on-one and team coaching with the core research team, and dialogue as central andragogical approaches. The teams experienced a transformative approach to policy making and planning which required them to reimagine and reframe their work. The process was designed to open up thinking about potential planning and policy making process interventions outside of what they were practiced/expert in, and to inquire into and challenge the paradigms that hold the current dominant ways of working in place as standard practice. It was also designed to carefully and lovingly hold the discomfort, tensions, and ambiguity that this approach generated for people to help them to stay with the learning journey.</p><p>Transformative policy-making and planning process framework</p><p>This framework for transformative policy making and planning was generated through engagement with literature and through interacting with empirical data generated during the learning journey. This framework is presented here as two parts - a process map (Fig. ), followed by a description of the transformative approaches taken at each stage of the process (Tables \u2013).</p><p>Transformative policy-making and planning process map.</p><p>The process map captures key stages of this transformative approach, as well as the movement and connections between the stages. Note that these are not drawn as discrete, linear steps but rather as interrelated and entangled stages with iteration between. There is a general movement (indicated by the looping solid lines) from broad/messy/open/exploratory that begins with framing, and toward a gradual focusing/clarifying process as we move through initiating, researching, experimenting, and eventual implementation at the scaling stage. Engaging and enabling, and evaluation and learning, happen throughout. As the connecting dotted lines indicate, there is iterative movement between stages when insights and learning require/indicate reframing, renewed experimentation, and/or return to learning from those most impacted by the challenge.</p><p>Transformative policy-making and planning approaches</p><p>Tables \u2013 detail the process map into descriptions of transformative approaches at each stage. Common policy-making and planning approaches are compared to transformative approaches at each stage, along with a description of how the transformative approach took shape in the learning journey. Some additional thinkers informed the ideas about the transformation that inspired these approaches\u2013.</p><p>Framing Stage</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Common approach</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Transformative approach</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Brief description of how this transformative approach shapes process design</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Climate, equity, decolonization are discrete</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Climate, equity, and decolonization are interrelated</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">These complex challenges have related root causes (i.e. colonialism, capitalism, racism, structural oppression) and they should be addressed together to have systemic impacts.

Careful creation/curation of transformative processes that centre learning are essential when working with practitioners who are used to being expert professionals in standard policy-making and planning processes, with many thoughtful, intentional, and reflective process design choices required to do this well. The next section describes seven of these significant choices and interventions from our research as key moves to provide texture about how policymakers and planners might think about designing and delivering a transformative process.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>The seven key moves toward transformative policy-making and planning processes explained below were intentionally integrated into the learning journey as an attempt to experiment with meaningful entry points into decolonization practices for planners and policymakers. The hope was (and is) that participants might enact these moves in their everyday professional lives. We express these practices as moves (rather than steps) because significant reflection and interaction took place during and between each session for both learning journey goers and the research/facilitation team. For example, the research team/facilitators had to consistently design for/work with/be comfortable with emergence and ambiguity, as the learning journey often and intentionally challenged participants to turn inward, reflect on their identities and positionality, show up as their authenticity selves and encouraged vulnerability in small and large group settings. The details of these moves are discussed below.</p><p>Move 1: beginning well</p><p>Our core research team members each had previous experience with designing and delivering transformative processes in diverse public sector, community-based, and academic environments which gave our team a strong collective foundation from which to grow. We began by crafting a compelling invitation to join this process based on the real-world challenges that we knew city staff were struggling with. This clarity of invitation and sensing of the field meant that the right people found their way in, and we had very little attrition along the way. The learning journey started with an intensive virtual retreat in order to co-create excitement, build relationships, and establish clarity about what people wanted the journey to be for them. The retreat series included connecting to land, place, history, context, and Indigenous pasts/presents of each place where cohort members were coming from. One cohort member reflected that \u201cI think one thing that was probably challenging for us at the beginning was figuring out how these things relate to engineering and our very specific transportation engineering field.\u201d The retreat series also included cohort members reflecting on their personal and team calls to action and accountability based on their identities and experiences, reframing the complex challenges that they were coming in with based on systems practice, and imagining possible and desired future states resulting from their transformative work. These choices clearly signaled that this process would be different from other planning, policy-making, and/or professional development processes than they were used to.</p><p>Move 2: co-creating an equitable, just, feminist, and decolonized space</p><p>Concepts of equity (e.g. power, privilege, anti-racist approaches) were intentionally (re)introduced throughout the learning journey to practice foundational concepts and develop a shared language. Grounding the process in place-based, relational, and decolonial approaches set the tone for how the cohort was invited to bring themselves into the space. Some features included the practice of abundant time, and the dance between this and the sense of urgency associated with the nature of the challenges everyone was working on. We did deep self-in-system work to explore how our individual positionality, intersecting identities, and life experiences impact how we each see, understand, and experience the world and the challenges we were working on. We worked to transform the construct of being \u2018expert\u2019, and of \u2018professional\u2019 looking and behaving in a particular way characterized by colonial and white dominant paradigms. One cohort member described it this way: \u201cThe reimagining of these core city processes has the potential to impact other systemic challenges as well, because at its foundation this is a shift toward more place-based, people-centered, experimental, and exploratory processes where we collectively need to lean into the emergent solutions that we are working toward because they are not yet known.\u201d Ongoing reflection on how there is no step-by-step guide to do decolonial practice was central in the process as, for most of us, this is a lifelong learning process filled with discomfort.</p><p>Move 3: pro-love pedagogy</p><p>Partway through the process our research team began using the phrase pro-love pedagogy as a short-form descriptor for a collection of choices we were making in design and facilitation. Pro-love meant that we prioritized being in a caring, loving, supportive, and collaborative community with/for each other as research team members, and consequently how the cohort experienced the holding space that we co-created with them throughout the process,. One member of our research team reflected that \u201cbeing in a caring and loving research team changed my perspective about research, and what that can look and feel like.\u201d Evidence of this pro-love pedagogy looked like an ongoing trust and willingness of the cohort to come along on this journey, even when it got uncomfortable and they didn\u2019t know where it was taking them. It looked like the research team navigating and holding our own and each others\u2019 discomfort, dis-ease, and uncertainty and modeling a skillful and honest navigation of this liminal space. It looked like an opening up to the diverse experiences and perspectives of the research team to co-create a rich learning-oriented process for everyone even when it wasn\u2019t clear how all of the pieces fit together. It looked like radically trusting ourselves and each other at every step along the way.</p><p>Move 4: focus on practicing not problem solving</p><p>The process emphasized building and practicing competencies and capacities for transformation rather than on solving problems. We thought about this as exercising different muscles, and rehearsing the new/resurgent. We did this by co-creating a learning, practice, experimentation, and reflection-focused space with/for each other. The dominant problem-solving orientation in planning and policy-making processes taps into well-honed and exercised skills, habits, approaches, and subsequent results. We needed the cohort to question, reframe for themselves, and look beyond this standard approach if they were to have a real chance at getting to a different outcome. Working on complex, ambiguous challenges demands a different set of skills and approaches, and practitioners can quickly find this overwhelming and daunting to navigate. One cohort member shared that the journey helped them to \u201cthink about how we can overlap our different programs to create multiple effects instead of just using one program to treat one problem.\u201d</p><p>Move 5: drawing on different theories and practices</p><p>Our research team carefully curated a set of theories, approaches, and practices that are not commonly used in city governments, including action and user research, systems mapping, prototyping, reflective practice, developmental evaluation, imagining possible futures/speculative fiction, prototyping, and others. The cohort worked the techniques, made mistakes and had breakthroughs, shared their experiences with one another, and built their literacy and confidence in approaches more suited to the complex challenges they were working on than their go-to approaches. An example of this was the regular returning to systems mapping throughout the journey to develop each person\u2019s understanding of the deeply connected and shared roots of climate, equity, and decolonization challenges. We worked and iterated these systems maps as people expanded and shifted their perspectives, and then used the maps to generate promising fractals and feedback loops where they could intervene. One participant captured their experience in this way: \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to just be in the normal ways of doing and being; it\u2019s so ingrained and easy to go along with it. I realized I can question this, and that it takes so much presence and intention to hold a different possibility as this isn't part of people\u2019s jobs or recognized as legitimate work.\u201d</p><p>Move 6: working with fear</p><p>We also noticed the implicit influence of fear as a motivator of in/action and behaviour - fear of messing up, of saying the wrong thing, of offending, of failing to have impact. Surfacing and shining a light on these fears and supporting the cohort to develop different, more generative relationships with these fears and what they might contribute or catalyze was an important part of the process. A particular fear that many people acknowledged was that they lacked the skills, abilities, and connections necessary to work in highly relational, respectful, and mutually beneficial ways with the people and communities whom they serve, and who are most impacted by these intersecting challenges. One cohort member said that they \u201cdon't have the relationships with equity-denied people and groups. The fear that staff have is projected onto people - otherizes them, focuses on risks, and is based in fear. What if the foundations of our work were about good relationships instead?\u201d Another member realized that we need to \u201cprioritize the time and space needed to reframe the complex problem, asking \u2018who have we not talked to?\u2019 and then prioritize action and user research to understand their experiences and perspectives.\u201d</p><p>Move 7: redefining impact and outcomes</p><p>Standard planning and policy-making processes offer the comfort of a clear endpoint - the successful approval of a piece of work by decision-makers, elected officials, and community stakeholders. Transformative processes are not as clear and tidy. They are concerned with transformation at the personal, team, organizational, cultural, relational, and systems scales and in this case, on complex intersecting climate, equity, and decolonization challenges. There is no clear finish line in this work as it is long-term, ongoing, and generational. Cycles of action, learning, and reflection are necessary, putting planning and policy-making processes in a direct and ongoing relationship with implementation, rather than viewing them as separate processes. Generating other ways to measure, understand, reflect upon, evaluate, and tell stories of impact was an important part of grounding the experience of this process for people, and supporting them in articulating why it mattered and what resulted. We used ongoing developmental evaluation, speculative fiction, and persuasive storytelling to support individual and collective sensemaking about impacts.</p><p>Imagining, enabling, and enacting transformative policy-making and planning processes will require equipping both new and established planners and policymakers with emerging/resurging approaches to complex urban climate, equity, and decolonization challenges. The transformative policy-making and planning process framework shared here intends to support research and practice in this important domain, and contribute to enhancing research and action more generally on complex, intersectional urban sustainability challenges.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Participatory action research bricolage</p><p>The core method used in this study was participatory action research (PAR), defined as \u201ca participatory process concerned with developing practical knowing in the pursuit of worthwhile human purposes. It seeks to bring together action and reflection, theory and practice, in participation with others, in the pursuit of practical solutions to issues of pressing concern to people, and more generally the flourishing of individual persons and their communities\u201d (p.4). In PAR, research subjects are co-participants in the processes of inquiry which includes activities of generating questions and objectives, sharing knowledge, building research skills, interpreting findings, and implementing and measuring results. Recent turns in PAR call for the method to support transformation while providing rigour and quality in ethics, process, and outcomes and this provided additional guidance to our approach\u2013. Bradbury et al. articulate seven choice points for quality action research as: (1) articulation of objectives; (2) partnership and participation; (3) contribution to action research theory/practice; (4) methods and process; (5) actionability; (6) reflexivity; and (7) significance which informed the method taken in this work.</p><p>PAR was embedded within an interdisciplinary, critical, qualitative, activist, and practice-oriented bricolage, \u201cconcerned with the depth and complexity of a question, what lies below the surface, and the form in which that complexity might best be understood and revealed\u201d (p.2). This methodological layer was added to ensure that PAR would critically engage with the dominant systems and structures of planning and policy-making that this research was aiming to question and reimagine. The two authors of this paper, along with the five additional members of the core research team, each brought diverse lived experiences, professional practices, distinct disciplinary lineages, and diverse positionalities and perspectives together to construct this PAR bricolage, and to design, facilitate, and generate insights about this learning journey together based on our collective of experiences and perspectives. Indigenous, feminist, anti-oppressive, and ecological methods were features of our bricolage, and necessary to better support working in/with processes of transformation, and to find our ways out of the dominant paradigms of planning and policy-making through our methodological approach\u2013. Using a PAR bricolage meant that we took an orientation of gathering up and applying what was useful from these different methods, in a generative dialogue with these methods and with each other. This also helped us to remain focused on being in service to generating insights about our practice-oriented questions, and those of our 40 co-researchers in the learning journey. This methodological approach enabled our research team to balance theoretical rigour, transdisciplinarity, practice-based foundations, and emergence. Together we held an entangled and engaged researcher orientation where the opinions, perspectives, and experiences of our research team and action co-researchers were considered a strength.</p><p>Research design</p><p>The University of British Columbia Behavioural Research Ethics Board provided approval for this study (H17\u201302282). All research participants provided \u2018written informed consent\u2019 to take part in the study. The core research team crafted the learning journey and invited participation through an open call that was distributed through existing networks supporting city governments working on climate and equity-related work in Canada. This invitation was open to public sector staff working within City governments, and could include team members from community-based partner organizations if this would be relevant to the challenge that the team wished to work on during the journey. It was also open to network-serving organizations that worked to support City governments in their climate, equity, reconciliation, and/or decolonization work. All of the ten Canadian city-based teams (two of which had community partners) and two network-serving organizations that applied to participate in the journey were invited to join. City staff were from the environment, sustainability, social policy, planning, engineering, equity and reconciliation, and public engagement departments/roles. Teams completed the application requirements, and our research team held the approach of saying yes to as many teams that were ready as we could properly support. One team dropped out of the learning journey about halfway through due to their limited capacity to fully participate, although they continued to be invited into all learning journey activities through to the end of the project. Team\u2019s were informed that this was an applied research project before applying, and upon acceptance into the learning journey their formal consent to participate was confirmed. Several new people joined the journey part-way through, with their consent confirmed when they joined.</p><p>Each multi-departmental team brought a different, locally relevant, complex planning and/or policy-making climate, equity, and decolonization challenge that they actively worked on throughout the nine-month-long learning journey held from April - December 2021. Social innovation, systemic design, and decolonization theories, processes, and practices were used to design the backbone of the learning journey. Other theories and processes informed the andragogical approach as well, including transformative adult learning; critical race theory; feminist and queer methodologies; sustainability transitions; complexity and emergence; and AfroFuturism. Our core research team shared the responsibility for the overall design of the learning journey, with individual team members and external guests invited in to lead and facilitate specific workshops based on their expertise and experience. The research team engaged in ongoing reflective practice throughout the whole journey, documenting insights and learning along the way, and shifting and pivoting the design of the journey in response to what was happening in-session with co-researchers and their emerging questions and needs.</p><p>Qualitative data was collected throughout the journey, and included observation, interviews, reflection of the research team and cohort members, team coaching sessions, document review, active process design and facilitation interventions and their impacts, and shared sense-making with the research team to uncover themes and insights. Active and ongoing sensemaking of this data occurred through regular dialogue amongst research team members, tracking what was emergent, responding through the design of the learning journey, and noting themes throughout. Emerging insights and themes were regularly returned to the co-researchers during the learning journey workshops to ensure that the sensemaking being done by the core research team was reflective of the co-researchers\u2019 experiences. Active consent of cohort members to participate in the research continued throughout the journey, including reaffirmed consent at their last interview three months after the journey had finished.</p><p>Reporting summary</p><p>Further information on research design is available in the  linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This research was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (Canada).

The white paper is sponsored by General Motors and is available for free on our website.</p><p><br/><br/>Water and air are the earth's most valuable resources. No ecosystem or human community could exist without access to clean air and water, making the protection of these resources a paramount concern. Unfortunately, decades of industry and development have had negative effects on the quality of the earth's air and water.<br/><br/>Because of the widespread and well-documented impacts of air and water pollution, governments have implemented regulations requiring industries to minimize deleterious effects on air and water. Adherence to these critical regulations is not the final step in corporate efforts to protect air and water quality. The private sector can go above and beyond these regulations to promote air and water quality through voluntary habitat conservation projects, with the added benefits of supporting wildlife species and human well-being.<br/><br/>The case studies featured in this white paper illustrate the role of habitat-specific projects in water and air quality improvement. Featured case studies from WHC-Certified sites include:<br/><br/>*ArcelorMittal: AM/NS Calvert, Alabama, USA<br/><br/>*Bacardi: Bombay Sapphire Distillery, Hampshire, UK<br/><br/>*Cemex: Laguna de Los Cangrejos, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<br/><br/>*DTE Energy: Downtown Detroit Headquarters, Michigan, USA<br/><br/>*The Earth Lab: Ejido Sisal, Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico<br/><br/>*Freeport-McMoRan: Miami Site, Arizona, USA<br/><br/>*INVISTA: Victoria Site, Texas, USA<br/><br/>*ITC Holdings: Iowa City Warehouse, Iowa, USA<br/><br/>*WM: Twin Creeks Landfill, Ontario, Canada<br/><br/>Sponsored by General Motors, this white paper features a foreword stating, \"Environmental conservation requires everyone's participation. At GM, we believe that businesses have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of nature and the protection of biodiversity. As we strive to enhance resource circularity in our products and operations, we are also promoting biodiversity across our sites.\"<br/><br/>About WHC:<br/><br/>WHC (Wildlife Habitat Council) has been working at the nexus of business and biodiversity for 35 years and is the only international NGO focused exclusively on enabling private sector action for nature.

The white paper is sponsored by General Motors and is available for free on our website.</p><p><br/><br/>Water and air are the earth's most valuable resources. No ecosystem or human community could exist without access to clean air and water, making the protection of these resources a paramount concern. Unfortunately, decades of industry and development have had negative effects on the quality of the earth's air and water.<br/><br/>Because of the widespread and well-documented impacts of air and water pollution, governments have implemented regulations requiring industries to minimize deleterious effects on air and water. Adherence to these critical regulations is not the final step in corporate efforts to protect air and water quality. The private sector can go above and beyond these regulations to promote air and water quality through voluntary habitat conservation projects, with the added benefits of supporting wildlife species and human well-being.<br/><br/>The case studies featured in this white paper illustrate the role of habitat-specific projects in water and air quality improvement. Featured case studies from WHC-Certified sites include:<br/><br/>*ArcelorMittal: AM/NS Calvert, Alabama, USA<br/><br/>*Bacardi: Bombay Sapphire Distillery, Hampshire, UK<br/><br/>*Cemex: Laguna de Los Cangrejos, Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic<br/><br/>*DTE Energy: Downtown Detroit Headquarters, Michigan, USA<br/><br/>*The Earth Lab: Ejido Sisal, Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico<br/><br/>*Freeport-McMoRan: Miami Site, Arizona, USA<br/><br/>*INVISTA: Victoria Site, Texas, USA<br/><br/>*ITC Holdings: Iowa City Warehouse, Iowa, USA<br/><br/>*WM: Twin Creeks Landfill, Ontario, Canada<br/><br/>Sponsored by General Motors, this white paper features a foreword stating, \"Environmental conservation requires everyone's participation. At GM, we believe that businesses have a responsibility to contribute to the regeneration of nature and the protection of biodiversity. As we strive to enhance resource circularity in our products and operations, we are also promoting biodiversity across our sites.\"<br/><br/>About WHC:<br/><br/>WHC (Wildlife Habitat Council) has been working at the nexus of business and biodiversity for 35 years and is the only international NGO focused exclusively on enabling private sector action for nature.

For example, examining the extent to which climate policies affect different parts of society is key to effective policy design. Such considerations are also important because those who are most economically disadvantaged will be worst affected by the impacts of climate change owing to their geographic location, type of work or other socioeconomic differences. To achieve an equitable outcome in the climate transition, it is therefore necessary to consider not just how the transition will be managed but also how different groups will be affected by the impacts of climate change. Global climate change assessments have traditionally overlooked within-country economic disparities, except for a few studies such as ref. . Accounting for economic disparities in climate change assessments can help to inform policies such as the use of compensation mechanisms or carbon dividends to address the dual challenges of environmental sustainability and economic justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The solution</p><p>To analyse the interplay between climate and economic inequality, we used an ensemble of eight integrated assessment models (IAMs), incorporating different economic paradigms and representations of economic heterogeneity. We used this ensemble to assess the effects of various climate policies compatible with keeping global temperatures within the limits of the Paris Agreement (keeping global mean temperature increases well below 2 \u00b0C). These policies use different mechanisms to redistribute the revenues generated by carbon pricing to households, with a particular focus on an equal per capita carbon dividend.</p><p>Using this approach, we assessed the impact of climate change and climate policies on economic inequality as measured by the Gini index (the most widely used index of inequality), which takes values between 0 and 100, where 0 is perfect equality (Fig. ). We found that unchecked climate change would increase economic inequality within countries, raising the Gini index by, on average, 1.4 points by 2100 (ref. ). Stabilizing the climate to be in line with the Paris Agreement reduces the climate-induced inequality by more than two-thirds. However, such carbon pricing policies led to a short-term increase in inequality (+0.1 Gini points by 2030). Redistributing carbon revenues on an equal per capita basis more than offset this effect, decreasing the Gini index by almost 2 points in the short to medium term.</p><p>The effect of climate policies on inequality.</p><p>The median change in inequality computed by eight IAMs for 2030 and 2100 under different policy scenarios relative to a reference scenario in which there are no climate impacts. The top, middle and bottom rows show scenarios with climate change but no climate policy, a Paris Agreement-aligned climate policy without redistribution and a Paris Agreement-aligned policy with equal per capita (EPC) revenue redistribution, respectively. The inequality is quantified using the Gini index where positive values indicate an increase in inequality relative to the reference. The hashed regions indicate regions in which less than two-thirds of the models agree on the sign of the change in equality. \u00a9 2024, Emmerling, J. et al., CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.</p><p>These findings highlight the potential for well-designed climate policies to simultaneously address environmental and economic equity. Economic transfers within countries are essential for making climate policies appealing today. Indeed, our model projects that equal per capita redistribution of the fiscal revenues through an annual \u2018climate dividend\u2019 is sufficient to more than compensate for the negative impacts of carbon pricing, and even leads to a reduction in inequality.</p><p>The implications</p><p>Our findings indicate that redistributive mechanisms have a key role in achieving the double climate\u2013equity dividend. Implementing such mechanisms will require political commitment and clear communication to ensure public support. Our analysis, however, identifies a potentially critical period for climate policy: as climate neutrality approaches, carbon prices remain high but carbon revenues begin to decline, limiting the capacity to offset distributional concerns.</p><p>There are limitations to this research: uncertainties are associated with the model design and the numerical parameters used in the IAMs included in our ensemble. Additionally, the baseline projections of the income distribution used varies across models. The use of more granular income distribution data, for instance focusing on the poorest 5% or richest 0.1% of the population could provide important information to clarify the impacts of policies on those with these extreme incomes. Future research should focus on refining these models and exploring additional policy measures that go beyond carbon pricing, such as alternative schemes to redistribute revenues to households or considering multidimensional inequalities. The next steps will involve more refined empirical work to quantify the implications of climate hazards and climate policies on not just economic inequality, but more generally on well-being and policy acceptability.</p><p>Johannes Emmerling &amp; Massimo Tavoni</p><p>RFF\u2013CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment, Milan, Italy.</p><p>Expert opinion</p><p>\u201cThe effect of climate policies and climate change on intraregional inequality is an important topic that is only beginning to receive attention, partially because integrated assessment models are only now developing the capabilities to do these analyses. Questions around inequality and human well-being are becoming increasingly important in international, national, and local policy decisions; therefore, this work is timely and a good first multi-model exploration of the topic.\u201d Stephanie Waldhoff, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Joint Global Change Research Institute, College Park, MD, USA.</p><p>Behind the paper</p><p>The idea for this study emerged from discussions in two European projects (NAVIGATE and PRISMA) about the links between inequality and climate change impacts and policies. Although many economists argued that redistributing carbon tax revenues could offset the costs of carbon pricing, particularly for poorer households, the overall effect of climate impacts and policies on inequality remained unclear. Inequality has already been represented in many models; however, it was challenging to assemble a multi-model comparison because models use different methods to capture the within-country inequality dynamics.</p><p>The most surprising result from our study was how consistently the benefits of redistribution outweighed policy costs in reducing short-term inequality across models and countries. This finding gives us more confidence that well-designed climate policies really can be a win\u2013win for the environment and equity. J.E. &amp; M.T.</p><p>From the editor</p><p>\u201cIn this article, the authors bring together a range of models that capture the interaction between climate policy and economic inequality, which is often lacking in such modelling exercises. Inequality issues in climate change have become increasingly important at different levels. This work provides a comprehensive assessment showing how proper climate policy design can address both emergent issues, as well as highlighting the potential challenges that need to be overcome.\u201d Editorial Team,Nature Climate Change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNNCC-s41558024021526</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNNCC2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D5B-SF51-JDK8-02ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">483237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Nature Climate Change</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1758-678X,1758-6798</issn><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 10, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DRP2</classCode><className>ECONOMIC INEQUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001941</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7YO</classCode><className>GEOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SU</classCode><className>PRICE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001588</classCode><className>SOCIAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DSLY</classCode><className>PRICING STRATEGIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SU</classCode><className>PRICE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DSLY</classCode><className>PRICING STRATEGIES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
