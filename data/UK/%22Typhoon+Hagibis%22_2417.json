Although disturbances have been studied in isolation, studies recently have highlighted the interaction among multiple disturbances. Riparian plant communities are primarily shaped by flooding disturbances, where periodic seasonal floods, and rare large-scale floods also play a role. Therefore, the interaction between these floods can markedly impact the formation of riverine plant communities. Such disturbance interactions, caused by the same type of representation, have been overlooked. In this study, we examined a riparian area impacted by Typhoon Hagibis in October 2019, situated along the Akigawa River in Tokyo. Through a comparison of land covers before and after the typhoon, we determined the effects of large-scale flood, and assessed the influence of periodic floods one and two years post-typhoon. Plant community surveys were conducted in both post-typhoon periods, investigating the relationship between community structure using both \u03b1- and \u03b2-diversity and disturbance interaction regimes. One year postdisturbance, the plant communities strongly reflected the varying intensities of the large-scale flood disturbance. However, two years postdisturbance, community structures exhibited changes, likely influenced by interactions with periodic disturbances. The results of this study suggest that interactions with the same type of disturbance may enhance community diversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Disturbance is a fundamental ecological event that reshapes ecosystem structures, profoundly influencing biological communities and their diversity1, 2\u20133. Disturbance effects are characterized by their type, frequency, scale, and intensity, and extensive research has explored the impact of individual disturbances on biological communities4, 5\u20136. However, disturbances do not act in isolation. Ecosystems reflect the impacts of past disturbances, and new disturbances can indirectly interact with previous disturbances4,5,7. In recent years, disturbances interactions, a previously overlooked phenomenon, have become a topic of interest in ecology and ecosystem management4,5,7, 8\u20139.</p><p>Interactions among disturbances arise when a prior disturbance either amplifies or suppresses the impact of a subsequent disturbance, yielding community changes distinct from those caused by a single disturbance4,5,8,10. For instance, Simler et al. (2018) demonstrated that the interaction between forest fires and beetle outbreaks might impact species survival differently compared with each disturbance occurring independently. Shinoda and Akasaka (2020) found that the interplay between forest gap formation and ungulate grazing influences germination from seed banks in forest understories, diverging from the outcomes of isolated events. Although the outcomes depend on disturbance type and scale, it is widely accepted that disturbance interactions introduce complex changes, thereby reshaping community structures4,5,11.</p><p>Biological communities in riparian areas are shaped under the strong influence of disturbances, with flooding being the primary driver. These areas owe their structure and diversity to river channel erosion and deposition processes resulting from frequent flood events12, 13, 14\u201315. In monsoon Asia, including Japan, riparian areas experience periodic seasonal floods. Consequently, many resident species have adapted to these recurrent floods, leading to the formation of specialized communities1,3,16. Among the various river-dwelling organisms, plants are particularly influenced by floods, which directly affect their dispersion, establishment, and growth17,18. Thus, the resulting plant communities strongly reflect the impacts of flooding disturbances16,19,20.</p><p>Floods, a significant disturbance factors in riparian areas, can be classified into at least two types: seasonal periodic floods, and rare large-scale floods that occur infrequently. As seasonal periodic floods are relatively uniform in magnitude, species under these conditions adapt, resulting in minimal community structure changes1,5. In contrast, rare large-scale floods, such as those caused by typhoons, can dramatically alter both community structures and entire ecosystems functions1,21, 22\u201323. According to the framework of disturbances interaction which a prior disturbance either amplifies or suppresses the impact of a subsequent disturbance4,5,8,10, the large-scale disturbances can act as legacies, interacting with subsequent periodic disturbances, either enhancing or suppressing their effects, potentially shaping community structures differently compared with periodic disturbances alone4,13,24. The phenomenon of the same type of disturbances interacting may be an aspect that has been overlooked in previous research on disturbance interactions.</p><p>To investigate how the interaction between periodic disturbances and rare large-scale disturbances influences riparian plant communities, we focused on the riparian area affected by Typhoon Hagibis in October 2019. This typhoon brought record postwar hourly rainfall to several parts of Eastern Japan, triggering extensive river embankment failures and large-scale flooding (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, Hokuriku Regional Development Bureau 2020). In the subsequent years (2020 and 2021), there were no similar flood events, and periodic rainy seasons were observed (Appendix S1 Fig. S1). Consequently, the formed riparian plant communities were likely influenced by the interaction between the large-scale flooding disturbance as a legacy and the periodic disturbances.</p><p>In this study we aimed to test how the large-scale floods caused by Typhoon Hagibis, in combination with subsequent periodic disturbances, influenced the formation of riparian plant communities.</p><p>To test this, we evaluated the impact of flood disturbances and plant communities along the Akigawa River in Akiruno City, Tokyo, Japan, which has suffered extensive typhoon damage. Initially, we analyzed land cover changes before and after the typhoon using aerial photographs to assess the large-scale disturbance\u2019s impact on the riparian area. We then categorized disturbance intensities of the large-scale disturbance based on land cover changes. Subsequently, we examined land cover changes in 2020 and 2021, categorizing disturbance intensities of periodic disturbances based on land cover changes in each category of large-scale disturbance. This allowed use to classify disturbance interactions as high intensity in large-scale disturbance and low intensity in periodic disturbance. Additionally, we investigated plant communities in each disturbance intensity one and two years after the typhoon. We explored the relationship between these interaction types and plant communities, interpreting the effects of the disturbance interactions on plant communities. Our findings highlight the processes of plant community formation under the influence of disturbance interactions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Results</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effects of disturbances for three land categories</emphasis></p><p>The results of the generalized linear model (GLM) for the land areas showed significant differences among the years for both bare ground and grassland (Appendix Table 1). Accordingly, we conducted Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test before and after the 2019 typhoon, between after the 2019 typhoon and 2020, and between 2020 and 2021 for each combination of these land cover types. The changes in the areas of each land cover type from before the 2019 typhoon to 2021 are presented in Table 1. There were no significant differences in the bare ground area for each time series combination (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.05) (Table 1). Conversely, grassland area exhibited a significant decrease between before and after the 2019 typhoon (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001; Table 1) but significantly increased from after the 2019 typhoon to 2020 (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis> &lt; 0.0001; Table 1).

One year after the typhoon, the plant community exhibited unimodal biodiversity patterns, indicating the effects of the large-scale disturbance. Notably, the interaction between high-intensity large-scale flooding and periodic flooding resulted in unimodal biodiversity patterns at the local scale, persisting for one and two years after the typhoon. This suggests that interactions between the same type of disturbances; large-scale and periodic flooding influence local plant community formation.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effects of large-scale flooding on the riparian area</emphasis></p><p>Comparing conditions before and after Typhoon Hagibis in 2019, a significant decrease in natural terrestrial area was observed. Specifically, the grassland area experienced a drastic reduction, whereas the bare ground area increased gradually. This shift can be attributed to the impact of flooding, which led to the removal of vegetation and the deposition of sediment. By 2020, one year post-typhoon, grassland areas had significantly increased compared with immediately after the 2019 typhoon. However, no significant differences were observed in that between 2020 and 2021, which only experienced periodic disturbances. These findings suggest that the typhoon constituted a large-scale disturbance leading to land cover changes on a scale not observed with periodic disturbances. Flooding is a major factor contributing to the creation of bare ground areas in riparian zones and strongly influences plant communities3,16. Therefore, Typhoon Hagibis likely had a lasting impact on the plant communities across the study area.</p><p>The survey units were classified into three categories based on the impact of Typhoon Hagibis as determined by changes in the natural terrestrial area. Setting thresholds for variable categorization can be subjective, necessitating validation25. Comparing the number of plant species among classes in 2020, which is likely to retain the impact of the typhoon, it was evident that the class with medium disturbance intensity exhibited the highest diversity. This aligns with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis26, which suggests that the highest diversity occurs under moderate disturbances. Although this pattern was not mirrored in the Jaccard index, these findings indicate that the classification of disturbance intensity used in this study was appropriate, at least concerning its impact on plant communities in the study area. In this study, the Jaccard index represented the diversity of local communities within a class. The absence of differences among classes suggests that, after large-scale flooding, the habitat quality in each class became considerably homogeneous. This result is consistent with the observation that species diversity varied among classes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Plant communities change after large-scale flooding</emphasis></p><p>Although the number of plant species in 2020 was the highest in the medium disturbance intensity class of large-scale disturbance, this pattern was not evident in 2021. However, in 2021, the average species numbers in all cases increased compared with those in 2020. Moreover, in 2020, annual species numbers exhibited a distinct unimodal pattern, which was not observed in 2021. Notably, the average number of annual species was highly similar between the medium class in 2020 and all classes in 2021. These results suggest that annual species were added to both low- and high-intensity classes in 2021. Typically, annual species favor disturbed sites as pioneer species, whereas perennial species tend to prefer areas with relatively milder disturbances in riparian areas3,16. However, a previous study suggested that the response to disturbance can vary even within annual plants27. Therefore, in 2020, following the typhoon, annual species that favor strong disturbances may have invaded areas with high disturbance intensity, whereas species that favor relatively weak disturbances may have invaded areas with low disturbance intensity. This led to medium-intensity disturbance areas exhibiting the highest species diversity, consistent with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis. Contrastingly, in 2021, with no large-scale flooding events, habitat heterogeneity caused by large-scale flooding was less pronounced, leading to the loss of the unimodal pattern in annual species diversity.</p><p>Perennial species exhibited a relatively weak but consistent unimodal pattern over 2 years. Although the pattern remained, the number of species increased in all classes. Perennial species tend to have higher tolerance to disturbances to some degree in riparian areas16,28. Therefore, in 2020, perennial species with relatively high disturbance tolerance likely persisted based on the intensity of large-scale flooding. In 2021, species with lower tolerance may have evenly invaded all classes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Effects of disturbance interaction for plant communities</emphasis></p><p>Under the high-intensity class of large-scale disturbance, plant species diversity and the Jaccard index showed clear unimodal patterns in both 2020 and 2021 by the subdivided unit which according to the intensity of periodic disturbances. In the high-intensity class of large-scale disturbance units, species with high disturbance preference (i.e., pioneers) may establish themselves preferentially. This process could lead to species composition homogenization, resulting in an increase in the Jaccard index [i.e., a decrease in \u03b2-diversity29]. However, the actual plant communities showed an increase not only in species numbers (\u03b1-diversity) but also in \u03b2-diversity. These results suggest that periodic disturbances influenced community formation. One of possible explanation for the increase in both \u03b1-diversity and \u03b2-diversity is that periodic disturbances suppressed the succession process. Periodic disturbances have a relatively smaller impact range compared with large-scale disturbances. Therefore, they do not uniformly affect all locations. Disturbance intensity can be high in some areas and low in others, creating a gradient26,30. Consequently, there might have been differences in the stages of succession within the high-intensity class of large-scale disturbance31,32. The coexistence of different succession stages within the same class would lower similarity, leading to increased \u03b1-diversity and \u03b2-diversity. The phenomenon where a subsequent disturbance alters the effects of a preceding disturbance is frequently noted in research on disturbance interactions4,5,8,10.</p><p>In the medium- and low-intensity classes of large-scale disturbance, plant species diversity and the Jaccard index did not exhibit patterns similar to those in the high-intensity class. Akin to the high-intensity class of large-scale disturbance, periodic disturbances created a gradient of disturbance impact within these classes. One possible explanation for these results is the total intensity of flooding. In 2020, species numbers in the low-intensity classes of large-scale disturbance were typically lower than those in the high-intensity classes of periodic disturbance. In contrast, species numbers in the medium-intensity classes of large-scale disturbance were generally higher than those in the high-intensity classes of periodic disturbance. Therefore, the combination of low-intensity classes of large-scale disturbance and low-intensity classes of periodic disturbance, as well as the combination of medium-intensity classes of large-scale disturbance and high-intensity classes of periodic disturbance, might have provided a habitat suitable for high species diversity in 2020. In the former case, the area experienced the least disturbance impact across the study area, allowing many species to persist postdisturbance. In the latter case, the area suffered a higher disturbance impact relative to other parts of the study area. This impact likely created a suitable habitat for many plants, including pioneers. However, these patterns were not sustained in 2021, which can also be explained by disturbance interactions. Based on the results for plant species diversity among large-scale disturbance classes, habitat heterogeneity among these classes was less pronounced in 2021. Therefore, the impact of disturbance interaction, specifically the total intensity of flooding between large-scale and periodic flooding, appeared to have diminished.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Limitation and future challenges</emphasis></p><p>This study successfully detected the phenomenon in which interactions between disturbances of the same type. However, this study has some limitations. The first is the spatial scale limitation. In this study, disturbance intensity was defined based on changes in land cover. Based on the results of the plant species number, this classification seems to have some validity, at least within the survey area, and the resulting findings have a certain degree of reliability. However, the surveyed area covered only 5 km of the Akigawa River, which is a small part of the entire river system. Land-cover conditions likely differ among parts of the river system. For example, bare ground with gravel predominates in the upstream regions and significant urban development in the downstream regions. Therefore, it remains an interesting question for future research whether the interactions among disturbances of varying intensities affect and how to evaluate these for the entire river ecosystem. The second is data limitation. Ideally, to detect the impact of disturbance interactions, it might be appropriate to include an interaction term for large-scale and small-scale disturbances in the statistical model. However, owing to data constraints, this study conducted a two-step analysis to evaluate the impact of small-scale disturbances within classes defined by the intensity of large-scale disturbances, without directly detecting interactions. Also, we used only indicators related to the plant community that could be addressed were the species number and Jaccard index, which means that species richness could not be evaluated due to the limitation of the survey efforts. Moreover, how the disturbance interactions examined in this study affect taxonomic groups other than plants remains an important question. These limitations can be resolved if large-scale projects allow for the collection of more widespread data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>This study suggests that disturbance interactions, which have previously been discussed in the context of different types of disturbances4,5,8,10, may also occur in disturbances of the same type but varying intensities. Such disturbance interactions, caused by the same type of representation, have been overlooked. Such disturbance interactions, caused by the same type of representation, have been overlooked. Disturbances, such as the floods addressed in this study, often include both small-scale events and rare, large-scale ones. Also, discussions in previous studies have typically revolved around whether an initial disturbance suppresses or promotes subsequent disturbances4,5,7,8,10. In contrast, the present study suggests that disturbance interactions have the potential to enhance community diversity, particularly in the context of large-scale disturbances. By delving deeper into the processes of biodiversity and community assembly through the exploration of disturbance interactions, we aim to advance our understanding of the intricate relationship between disturbances and ecosystems.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Study area</emphasis></p><p>The survey was conducted in the riparian area of the Akigawa River (Fig. 4), covering a regulated section spanning 33.57 km with a catchment area of 101.9 km2, managed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Construction Bureau (Tokyo Metropolitan Construction Bureau, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kensetsu.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/jimusho/nishiken/kanri-ka/4-kasen/kasen.html\">https://www.kensetsu.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/jimusho/nishiken/kanri-ka/4-kasen/kasen.html</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023). This study focused on the area near the confluence with the Tama River, considered a midstream region with relatively stable environmental factors, including riverbed gradient, that can influence plant growth.</p><p>Upon reviewing monthly precipitation data from Hachioji City, the closest meteorological observation point to our survey site, it was evident that the monthly rainfall for October 2019 substantially exceeded 600 mm, indicating heavy rainfall associated with a typhoon (Appendix S1 Fig. S1). Additionally, between June and August in 2019, 2020, and 2021, there were smaller peaks in rainfall, suggesting the presence of seasonal rain (Appendix S1 Fig. S1).Fig. 4</p><p>Study area location: Akigawa River.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Evaluation of disturbance impact</emphasis></p><p>We assessed disturbance impact by categorizing land cover types within river channels, specifically bare ground, grassland, and forest, before and after the large-scale flooding event in October 2019, as well as one year (2020) and two years (2021) postflooding. Although directly quantifying flood disturbance in riverine areas can be challenging, the presence of bare ground within river channels, a result of flooding effects, serves as a reliable indicator of such disturbance3,16,33.</p><p>Aerial photographs, captured between June and November 2019, were used to measure areas of land cover, with such photographs of the river preflooding sourced from GSI Maps (<url normalizedValue=\"https://maps.gsi.go.jp\">https://maps.gsi.go.jp</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023). Although the typhoon passed in October 2019, the aerial photographs showed walking paths and bridges in their pretyphoon state, indicating that the images were captured prior to the typhoon occurring. Additionally, post-typhoon aerial photographs were obtained from GSI Maps, featuring images from October 13, 2019, i.e., shortly after the typhoon (<url normalizedValue=\"https://maps.gsi.go.jp/development/ichiran.html#t20191012typhoon19_tamagawa_1013do\">https://maps.gsi.go.jp/development/ichiran.html#t20191012typhoon19_tamagawa_1013do</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023).

Finally, aerial photographs taken 2 years after the flood (May 2021) were obtained using a multicopter DJI Phantom 4 Pro (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dji.com/jp/phantom-4-pro\">https://www.dji.com/jp/phantom-4-pro</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023), and an orthophoto was created using Pix4Dmapper ver.4.6.4 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pix4d.com/product/pix4dmapper-photogrammetry-software/\">https://www.pix4d.com/product/pix4dmapper-photogrammetry-software/</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023). Although the shooting months varied each year, no significant differences in land cover were expected due to the timing of photographs, as they were all taken during the plant growing seasons. The aerial photographs were interpreted, and terrestrial areas within the river channel were classified into three land cover categories: bare ground, grassland, and forest (dominated by woody plants). Polygon data were generated using QGIS 3.10 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://qgis.org/en/site/\">https://qgis.org/en/site/</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023).</p><p>To quantify the changes in land cover as an indicator of disturbance impact, survey units were established. Gregory et al. (1991) recommended that a section length of 10\u2013100 times the channel width is an appropriate spatial scale to assess the impact of natural disturbances on river structure19. In this study, the survey area predominantly featured a channel width of 20\u201330 m. Therefore, buffer polygons measuring 300 m in width were established at approximately 200 m intervals from stream centerline data, sourced from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism\u2019s National Land Numerical Information (<url normalizedValue=\"https://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/ksj/gml/datalist/KsjTmplt-W05.html\">https://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/ksj/gml/datalist/KsjTmplt-W05.html</url>, accessed on August 30, 2023). Each buffer polygon was subdivided into north and south sections (Fig. 5), resulting in a total of 52 units for analysis. These divided buffers were used as units for land cover and subsequent field surveys (as described later).Fig. 5</p><p>Survey unit description. Each unit spans 300 m in width at approximately 200 m intervals from the stream centerline.</p><p>The bare ground, grassland, and forest areas in each unit were derived from the created polygons. To quantify changes in land cover over time, we calculated the areas of each category in each unit, both before and after the typhoon in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Areas of land cover that were water or other types, such as agricultural land, artificial land, and constructions, were excluded from the analysis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Classification of large-scale flooding impact</emphasis></p><p>We categorized survey units into three classes based on the disturbance intensity caused by large-scale flooding: high, medium, and low intensity. This classification was based on a comparison of land cover data from before and after the 2019 typhoon, serving as a direct reflection of the large-scale flooding event\u2019s impact. Classification criteria were based on the loss of natural terrestrial area, encompassing the total area of the three land categories we established. If &gt; 50% of the land area was lost due to the flooding, the unit was designated as high intensity. For land area loss between 25% and &lt; 50%, units were assigned medium intensity. If land area loss was &lt; 25%, the unit was classified as low intensity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Classification of periodic flooding impact</emphasis></p><p>Further classification of survey units into three classes, within each large-scale flooding impact category, was based on the disturbance intensity caused by periodic flooding. This classification involved the use of land cover data from 2020 and 2021, comparing land cover changes between years. As no large-scale flooding occurred in these years, land cover changes were indicative of the effects of periodic disturbances. Classification criteria were chosen according to changes in natural terrestrial area, considering the total area of the three land categories for this period. Differences in the natural terrestrial area of each unit between 2020 and 2021 were calculated and ranked within each large-scale flooding intensity category. Units with the largest third of differences were designated as high intensity, the next third as medium intensity, and the smallest third as low intensity. Consequently, each of the three large-scale flooding intensity categories had three periodic flooding intensity categories within them.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Vegetation survey</emphasis></p><p>Vegetation surveys were conducted in each survey unit from early August to early September in 2020 and from late July to late August in 2021. The survey involved establishing a 20 m line transect from the boundary between the river flow and the terrestrial area in each unit, and recording the plant species along the transect. In each survey transect, we recorded the occurrence of annual plant species, perennial plant species, and other plant species, including woody species. The surveys focused on the presence of species. For each unit in each year, we counted the total species number, annual species number, and perennial species number as an \u03b1-diversity index. We also calculated the Jaccard index based on the composition of plant species among each unit as a \u03b2-diversity index. The Jaccard index, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">J</emphasis>, was calculated as follows:1where SA and SB represent the species number in site A and B, respectively, and SAB indicates the common species number between site A and B. The Jaccard index is bounded between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating no shared species between the two sites, and 1 indicating identical species composition. We calculated the Jaccard index for transect pairs in the same class of large-scale disturbance and in the same class of periodic disturbance within the large-scale disturbance class. The former reflected \u03b2-diversity between large-scale disturbances, whereas the latter reflected \u03b2-diversity between the periodic disturbance classes within the same class of large-scale disturbance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistical analysis</emphasis></p><p>To evaluate the impact on natural terrestrial area by both large-scale and periodic disturbances across the entire study area, we used a generalized linear model (GLM) with Gaussian distributions (identity link) and a Tukey\u2019s multiple comparison test to compare the areas of the three types of land cover among study periods. The explanatory variables were years; these were 2019 before the typhoon, 2019 after the typhoon, 2020, and 2021. If significant differences among these years were detected, we compared land cover areas between before and after the 2019 typhoon, between after the 2019 typhoon and 2020, and between 2020 and 2021 for each combination in each land cover type. To evaluate the influence of periodic disturbances on terrestrial area in each land cover type in each class of large-scale flooding impact, we compared the areas of the three land cover types between 2020 and 2021 using the same approach.</p><p>To assess the influence of large-scale disturbances on plant communities in the riparian area, we examined the total species number, annual species number, and perennial species number in each unit using generalized linear model (GLM) with Poisson distributions (log link) and a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wald test</emphasis>. The explanatory variable was the large-scale disturbance category (low, medium, and high) in the survey units. Given the categorical nature of the explanatory variable, the medium level served as the reference standard. Similarly, we assessed the Jaccard index in each unit using a GLM with Gaussian distributions (identity link) and a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wald test</emphasis>. The explanatory variable was the large-scale disturbance category in the survey units. Additionally, to evaluate the influence of plant communities resulting from the interaction between large-scale and periodic disturbances, we conducted a similar analysis, using periodic flooding classes in each large-scale disturbance class. For example, in the high-intensity class of large-scale disturbance, three classes of periodic disturbance were present. Thus, each periodic disturbances class was defined as follows: (1) high\u2013high, (2) high\u2013medium, and (3) high\u2013low intensities (referring to the large-scale disturbance\u2013periodic disturbances combination). We analyzed both species numbers and Jaccard index using GLMs based on periodic flooding classes as the explanatory variable in the survey units.</p><p>All statistical analysis were performed using the R statistical package (version 4.4.2; R development core Team, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.r-project.org/\">https://www.r-project.org/</url>, accessed at 30, November, 2024).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This study was supported by the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF20222G01) of the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency of Japan and Water Resources Environment Center, Japan.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><bibliography><bodyText><p>[1].Turner, MG.

meaning that each outcome is assigned a likelihood of occurring.</p><p>Although this provides a fuller picture of the weather, it is also extremely demanding in terms of time and computer power.</p><p>In a new paper published in Nature, Google DeepMind shows that its new AI model is more accurate than the top-performing ENS model from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMRWF).</p><p>Both GenCast and ENS are probabilistic, but the way they create their set of predictions is totally different.</p><p>Rather than trying to simulate the complex physics of the atmosphere, GenCast uses a type of AI called a diffusion model which is typically found in video, image and music generators.</p><p>When provided with the most recent state of the weather, the AI generates 50 predictions for the future state of the weather just like some AIs might make images from a text prompt.</p><p>The difference is that GenCast has been specifically adapted to work on the Earth's spherical surface and has been trained on 40 years of weather data.</p><p>Google claims that this method is not only faster, but also provides a better forecast for both day-to-day weather and extreme events than ENS.</p><p>The AI was trained on data leading up to 2018 and then evaluated against the real weather data from 2019 and ENS's forecasts for that year.</p><p>GenCast was more accurate than ENS on 97.2 per cent of predictions and on 99.8 per cent when making predictions more than 36 hours in advance.</p><p>Most notably, when both systems were tasked with predicting the arrival of Typhoon Hagibis, GenCast was able to produce a warning 12 hours earlier.</p><p>When Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan in 2019, it was the worst storm in 60 years and led to widespread devastation.</p><p>The engineers behind GenCast hope that, by giving authorities an earlier warning, AI-powered weather forecasts could help save lives.</p><p>Mr Price says: 'As climate change drives more extreme weather events, accurate and trustworthy forecasts are more essential than ever, yet weather cannot be predicted perfectly and forecasts are especially uncertain beyond a few days.</p><p>'Getting better and more advanced warnings of where they'll strike land is invaluable.'</p><p>Poor predictions based on traditional methods have led to deadly consequences in the past when reports downplayed the dangers of incoming storms.</p><p>For example, in 1987 BBC weatherman Michael Fish assured viewers that there was no hurricane making its way to the UK.</p><p>The next day, devastating hurricane-force winds hit Britain killing 18 people and causing \u00a31 billion ($1.3 billion) of damage.</p><p>However, the power of computational weather forecasts has come a long way since the 1980s.</p><p>When Michael Fish made his fateful prediction, the Met Office's supercomputer had the processing power equivalent of an average smartphone today.</p><p>Currently, the Met Office has upgraded to the Cray XC40 supercomputing system which is capable of more than 14,000 trillion arithmetic operations per second.</p><p>Even the ENS model against which GenCast was measured has improved significantly in the last few years.</p><p>In their paper, Google DeepMind used ENS 2019 predictions but ECMRWF has made some major improvements since this time.</p><p>In particular, ENS is now capable of producing significantly higher-resolution forecasts than GenCast can produce.</p><p>Dividing the world into a grid, GenCastlooksat squares that are 0.25 degrees across by latitude and longitude. </p><p>By contrast, the ENS weather forecast now operates at a resolution of just 0.1 degrees, which means finer predictions. </p><p>Google DeepMind admits that traditional models are likely to be irreplaceable for the foreseeable future - not least because they provide the data to train AI.</p><p>However, AI forecasts have a major advantage in terms of speed and computer power.</p><p>Traditional forecasts such as the ENS take hours on a supercomputer with tens of thousands of processors.</p><p>GenCast, on the other hand, takes just eight minutes to produce a 15-day forecast using a single processing unit. </p><p>In the future, this means AI models could become far more common for applications like extreme weather prediction or planning around renewable energy sources like solar and wind.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-107573737</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DM0-SG61-DY4H-K2DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"936\"/><timeReceived>8:39 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

In addition to that, seawater sometimes exerts additional forces for coastal stations, and the atmosphere often plays an important role for stations within continents. Here we report a case in and around the Arabian Peninsula. Despite little seasonal hydrological changes there, stations show fairly uniform seasonal vertical crustal movements, characterized by ~ 1\u00a0cm winter subsidence, over the entire region. We found that they are mainly driven by the atmospheric loading. Differences in their amplitudes are compensated by large and moderate seasonal ocean mass changes in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf (also called the Arabian Gulf),  respectively, resulting in fairly uniform amplitudes of the winter subsidence in this region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Seasonal changes of various surface masses can be measured as time-variable gravity with satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (FO), with a temporal and spatial resolution of 1 month and ~ 300 km, respectively. Such changes also drive seasonal crustal movements that can be measured using global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receivers. The GNSS network has a higher temporal resolution (typically daily) and has a high spatial density in tectonically active regions. GRACE and GNSS now play complementary roles in studying surface mass changes12.</p><p>Seasonal crustal motions and their link to hydrological mass changes (mainly soil moisture) have been studied in China3, North America4, and Europe5. Studies in Iceland6 and Japan7,8 showed that seasonal crustal movements are mainly driven by winter snowpacks. Zheng et al.9 reported a case of the Gulf of Carpentaria, northern Australia, where interference of the seasonal changes of ocean and hydrological masses results in a phase shift between the vertical and horizontal seasonal movements. Atmospheric loading also drives significant seasonal crustal movements. However, it has been deemed as a quantity that needs to be removed rather than a target of geophysical studies.</p><p>As a recent trend, timescales of the crustal deformation studies by surface loading are shifting from seasonal to intra-seasonal loading events. Such studies include crustal subsidence by stormwater loading associated with the landfall of tropical cyclones10,11, heavy rainfall12, and heavy snowfall13. Such studies will lead to a sophistication of hydrogeodesy, a newly developing field in geodesy that is deeply linked to various studies associated with climate change14.</p><p>Seasonal crustal movements have not been studied well in dry regions in Southwest Asia. There, hydrological mass changes are very little, but ocean mass changes are often significant. Wahr et al.15 found, using the GRACE data, seasonal ocean mass changes of ~ 30 cm peak-to-peak in the Red Sea, separating the Arabian Peninsula from the African Continent, driven by winds and the ocean-atmosphere exchange of heat. Later, Alothman et al.16 studied seasonal vertical movements of GNSS stations around the Red Sea and confirmed seasonal vertical crustal movements driven mainly by ocean mass changes. Here we perform a comprehensive study, using the GNSS and satellite gravimetry data, of seasonal crustal movements in and around the Arabian Peninsula caused not only by mass changes of the surrounding oceans, including the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, but also by atmospheric loading.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Datasets utilized</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) data</emphasis></p><p>Figure 1 shows the monthly gravity data for 2002\u20132024 at three points representing the Persian Gulf (also called the Arabian Gulf), the inland region of the Arabian Peninsula, and the Red Sea. We used the mascon solution of GRACE (and its FO) from Univ. Texas, Center for Space Research (UTCSR). We fit the data using the quadratic function of time and the seasonal (annual and semiannual) changes. The inland point shows a significant gravity decrease possibly caused by groundwater depletion17 but little seasonal changes. On the other hand, points in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea show significant seasonal changes with peak-to-peak amplitudes of ~ 15 cm and ~ 25 cm, respectively. They both show maxima in winter and minima in summer.</p><p>The winter mass increases in the Red Sea have already been studied by Wahr et al.15. Mass changes in the Persian Gulf have an amplitude ~ 60% as large as in the Red Sea and are driven by flow through the Strait of Hormuz18,19. If we only consider surface mass changes as measured by satellite gravimetry, we expect that winter subsidence has the largest amplitudes around the Red Sea. We also expect that they have amplitudes of ~ 60% around the Persian Gulf. On the other hand, in the inland region of the Arabian Peninsula, seasonal vertical movements would be negligible. Here we also note that the atmospheric mass changes have already been removed in the GRACE mascon solution. However, atmospheric loading would also cause seasonal crustal movements measured with GNSS.</p><p>Fig. 1</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) We selected three points representing the Persian Gulf, inland, and the Red Sea.

Best-fit seasonal (annual and semiannual) changes together with secular changes expressed with quadratic functions are added. Oceanic points show strong seasonal signatures but little secular trends. On the other hand, the inland point shows little seasonal variations but a significant negative trend.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data</emphasis></p><p>We download daily coordinates of 25 GNSS stations with sufficiently long time spans in and around the Arabian Peninsula from the database run by Univ. Nevada Reno20. They provide solutions by precise point positioning without corrections of any non-tidal loading. We fit the vertical component of the position changes using the quadratic functions of time showing long-term changes and average seasonal (combination of annual and semiannual changes) terms. We considered the data up to 2024 May, but few stations continue observations until 2024. Figure 2a shows the positions of GNSS stations near the Persian Gulf (RASZ, BHR4), inland (SOLA), and near the Red Sea (RASH, ALWJ).</p><p>Figure 2b shows the time series of vertical positions of these five stations. The time periods shown there are different from station to station. Hence, we do not show labels in the horizontal axis of Fig. 2b. The data of all the other stations near the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea are shown in Figures S1 and S2, respectively. There, many stations show significant long-term subsidences, but they are out of the scope of this study.</p><p>Despite the different time windows, all the stations show clear winter subsidence of ~ 1 cm relative to summer, qualitatively consistent with the expectation. However, we did not anticipate such uniform amplitudes, i.e., the GRACE data (Fig. 1) predict that the stations on the Red Sea coast should show much larger winter subsidence than inland stations. Hence, the uniform amplitudes in Fig. 2 suggest that some other factor controls the winter subsidence of these stations.</p><p>Fig. 2</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Positions of GNSS stations near the Persian Gulf (RASZ, BHR4), inland (SOLA), and near the Red Sea (RASH, ALWJ).

ALWJ has a jump in the middle of the time series of an unknown origin. Vertical grid lines indicate year boundaries. It is intentional that year labels are not given (they are different from station to station). (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) Vertical movements by non-tidal atmospheric loading. Best-fit seasonal (annual and semiannual) changes are added to those time series.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Non-tidal atmospheric loading (NTAL) data</emphasis></p><p>Atmospheric pressure changes also drive crustal movements. An effective way to correct them is to subtract the non-tidal atmospheric loading21 (NTAL), available as a product from the Earth System Modeling Group at Deutsches GeoForschungsZentrum (ESMGFZ). They are calculated using the atmospheric surface pressure changes given at 0.5-degree grids every 3 h using the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts) operational data. Zheng et al.13 demonstrated that NTAL gives movements consistent with those calculated using atmospheric pressure data from a local network.</p><p>Figure 2c shows the vertical crustal movements due to NTAL changes at the five stations. They are in phase with the observed crustal movements. Their amplitudes are almost identical to the observation for the inland station. On the other hand, they are somewhat smaller at stations around the Persian Gulf and are significantly smaller at stations near the Red Sea. Such differences in amplitudes can be seen in the two-dimensional distributions of NTAL discussed later in Sect. 3.2.</p><p>Fig. 3</p><p>Average seasonal variations are drawn for two years for the observed (black/grey) vertical components and for NTAL (blue), for the GNSS points representing the Persian Gulf (right), inland (bottom), and the Red Sea (left). The observed and NTAL seasonal curves are shown so that their maximum values (occurring in July) coincide with each other to highlight differences in the winter subsidence. Grey curves (positions shown with grey circles in the map) represent stations not influenced by ocean mass changes in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea. Differences of the black/grey and blue curves are given, together with their root mean squares, in Figure S3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison between GNSS and NTAL</emphasis></p><p>Figure 3 compares average seasonal (annual and semiannual components of the model curves in Figs. 2a, S1 and S2) vertical movements for all the stations studied here. To emphasize differences in winter subsidence, NTAL, and the observed movements are plotted so that their July positions coincide. At inland stations such as SOLA and YIBL, the NTAL and the GNSS amplitudes are very similar, suggesting that their seasonal movements come almost entirely from NTAL. The same is true for coastal stations facing the Indian Ocean like JASK, SQUO, and ASAB.</p><p>For stations on the Red Sea coast, NTAL amplitudes explain only ~ 1/2 of the observed changes. In contrast, observed subsidences of the Persian Gulf coast stations are only slightly larger than NTAL. These large and small differences between the observed and NTAL winter subsidences for the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, respectively, correspond to the contributions from the ocean mass changes. Differences between the observed vertical seasonal movements and those from NTAL are given in Figure S3 together with their root-mean-squares.</p><p>Fig. 4</p><p>(<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) Excess mass in January relative to July from the CSR GRACE mascon solution in terms of equivalent water thickness. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) Crustal subsidence was calculated from the mass anomalies measured by GRACE using the Green\u2019s function. Small white triangles and grey squares represent GNSS stations where significant and negligible winter subsidence occurs due to ocean mass changes, respectively. They are compared in (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) with the observed winter subsidence after the NTAL correction. Those on the Persian Gulf (PG) and Red Sea (RS) are marked with blue and red colors, respectively. The five stations given in Fig. 2 are indicated with larger circles. &gt;1/2 of the stations fall within 1 mm from those calculated using the GRACE data.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Comparison between GNSS and GRACE datasets</emphasis></p><p>Here we compare the excessive winter subsidence of GNSS stations inferred from Fig. 3 (Obs\u2212NTAL), with those calculated using the excess mass from the GRACE data (mainly from the ocean because atmospheric mass contributions have already been corrected in the GRACE data). Figure 4a shows the average difference of mass in terms of equivalent water thickness (EWT) in January relative to July. The GRACE data (Fig. 1b) suggest an excess ocean mass of ~ 25 cm in the Red Sea and ~ 15 cm in the Persian Gulf. Figure 4b shows the vertical crustal movements as the elastic response of the solid earth calculated using the data in Fig. 4a and the load Green\u2019s function22. The expected winter subsidence relative to summer is 3\u20135 mm around the Red Sea while it is ~ 2 mm around the Persian Gulf. Figure 4c compares the observed (Obs\u2212NTAL) and calculated (Fig. 4b) winter subsidences for all the GNSS stations used here.</p><p>Figure 4c shows that the two quantities mostly coincide with each other. Despite the scatter, the majority of the data fall within 1 mm from the thick line. This would suggest the detection of the seasonal mass change of the Persian Gulf and provide support for the Red Sea mass change15,16. An interesting feature is that the nonuniformity in the NTAL seasonal amplitudes (getting smaller toward the southwest) (Fig. 5a, b) is compensated by significant ocean mass changes in the Red Sea. As a result, a fairly uniform winter subsidence of ~ 1 cm is realized in the studied region (Fig. 2).</p><p>Many of the GNSS stations used here are located in or near cities. If artificial groundwater extraction activities have seasonal changes, they may influence seasonal crustal movements. The scatter seen in Fig. 4c would partly come from such a groundwater contribution, together with miscellaneous factors like the deformation of geodetic monuments, vegetation changes, and so on.</p><p>Fig. 5</p><p>Surface vertical movements in January (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) and July (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) by atmospheric loading around the Arabian Peninsula, obtained as NTAL from GFZ. (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">c</emphasis>) Distribution of the average displacements by NTAL in January 2024 relative to July 2023. White dashed curves show \u00b1 4 mm and \u00b1 8 mm contours.</p><p>Figure 5c shows the worldwide distribution of winter-summer contrasts of displacements by NTAL. Lands around the Persian Gulf is one of the regions with the largest winter subsidence due to atmospheric loading, together with northern India, central Asia, China, and inland of Australia. On the other hand, atmospheric contributions are not so large in Europe, South America, Japan, Indonesia, and so on (non-seasonal short-term atmospheric contributions are large even in other regions). Removal of NTAL is deemed as a standard step in crustal deformation studies. Nevertheless, future research of seasonal crustal movements in those regions should pay extra attention to seasonal atmospheric pressure changes as the dominant factor.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Horizontal movements</emphasis></p><p>As discussed in the previous session, seasonal vertical movements in and around the Arabian Peninsula can be understood in terms of seasonal change of loads, combination of the atmosphere and the ocean mass changes. Like vertical movements, seasonal horizontal movements are also considered to be driven by seasonal atmospheric and ocean mass changes. Figure S4a shows the January displacements relative to July by ocean (and partly hydrological) loads, and Figure S4b shows those by NTAL. The former is characterized with winter displacements of 1\u20132 mm toward the Red Sea. The latter is more complicated, but is characterized by the winter northward movements of the region south of 20 N by ~ 2 mm.</p><p>Such seasonal horizontal movements would not be easy to detect considering that both ocean and NTAL contributions do not exceed 1\u20132 mm. It is expected that we observe the sum of Figure S4a and S4b, but the observed displacements (Figure S5) are only partly consistent with the expected. Those in the southwestern part of the studied area show winter displacements toward NNE, which matches with the expectation. Around the Persian Gulf, however, their behaviors are rather systematic (e.g., winter displacement toward the gulf) and such large displacements are not expected by the winter excess mass in the Persian Gulf (Figure S4a). These misfits would reflect various unknown factors such as groundwater, deformation of geodetic monuments, vegetation around the antenna, and so on.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conclusion</emphasis></p><p>Geodesists often simply remove atmospheric loading by using products available on-line without paying much attention. This study shows that atmospheric loading plays by far the largest role in seasonal timescales in dry regions like the Arabian Peninsula. Hence, to isolate subtle crustal movement signals from hydrological and ocean loading in such regions, atmospheric loading would need to be correctly understood.</p><p>We conclude the essence of this study as follows.</p><p>Seasonal crustal movements in and around the Arabian Peninsula are dominated by atmospheric loading.</p><p>Around the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, ocean loading enhances the winter subsidence.</p><p>This study gives the first detection of the Persian Gulf mass changes with GNSS.</p><p>Combination of the atmospheric and ocean loading realizes apparently uniform amplitudes of winter subsidence there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>We thank two anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments.

They differ from conventional, probabilistic attribution approaches which consider a class of similar, generally univariate, extremes. Instead, their focus is on particular, historic extreme events of large impact which are still vividly anchored in collective memory. The innovation of the method is the feasibility to quantify the role of anthropogenic climate change for specific extreme events of the recent past, and it draws on experience from regional climate downscaling. Spectrally nudged storylines thus offer a new, easily implemented and easily understandable way of communicating climate change to the general public and decision-makers, as well as a pathway for detailed attribution of climate impacts. The technique offers great potential as an addition to the established attribution methods by answering different questions and providing new attribution results.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Spectrally nudged storylines are innovative methods for attributing extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change, which can address the limitations of conventional probabilistic attribution methods by focusing on specific historical events with significant impacts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Introduction</emphasis></p><p>Extreme weather events have a large impact on population, economy, infrastructure, agriculture and ecosystems. The attribution of these events to climate change is a relatively new scientific field and only emerged during the last decades1. The reason for this is that in classical climate-change science, attribution of an observed phenomenon to anthropogenic climate change requires demonstrating that the phenomenon is both consistent with anthropogenic climate change and inconsistent with any other explanation2. This classical approach generally fails in the case of single extreme events, because of the large role of internal variability. Palmer and R\u00e4is\u00e4nen3 therefore suggested replacing the strong form of classical climate attribution with a weaker form, where it is only required to demonstrate that anthropogenic climate change made the event more likely. In general terms4, this can be seen as replacing specific causation (the actual cause of a specific event) with general causation (the potential to cause the specific event). Thereby, the statistics of an event are compared as it was observed under present climate (so-called \u2018factual\u2019 conditions), including climate change, to its corresponding statistics in a \u2018counterfactual world\u2019 without anthropogenic climate change. If the event was made more likely, e.g., as estimated by a risk ratio, then it is attributed to anthropogenic climate change, in this weaker sense of general causation. This has now become the conventional approach to event attribution5.</p><p>There are at least two inherent limitations of this conventional, probabilistic approach. The first is that a statistical population must be constructed, whereby the specific event is replaced by a much broader \u2018event class\u2019, which is typically univariate. Yet the impacts of the event, which are normally the reason for the interest in the event, can be quite sensitive to the particular details of the event. That is why it is widely understood in statistics that inferences concerning statistical populations cannot be reliably applied to individual members of those populations6. The second limitation is that even this weaker form of attribution relies on a clear climate change signal, which is generally obtained from climate models, and which can be ambiguous because of the deep uncertainties in the dynamical response to climate change at the local scale7. To address both of these limitations, Trenberth et al.8 suggested that distinguishing between dynamic and thermodynamic factors could lead to less uncertainty in the attribution of extreme events. In particular, they proposed treating the dynamical conditions leading to the event as given, and asking how the thermodynamic consequences of the event (e.g., heavy precipitation) were affected by known aspects of climate change, such as warming of sea-surface temperatures (SSTs). It was argued that the inclusion of this established scientific knowledge on climate change increases the signal-to-noise ratio and thus leads to a more reliable attribution result (see also Shepherd9, who dubbed it the \u2018storyline\u2019 approach). Lloyd and Oreskes10 noted that the storyline approach could be seen as guarding against false negatives (i.e., failing to detect the consequences of climate change), whilst the conventional approach guarded against false positives. Thus, both had their scientific purposes.</p><p>To implement the storyline approach in a climate model, one needs to be able to re-simulate specific extreme weather events which happened in the recent past under different climate conditions. For that, some kind of constraint on the model\u2019s dynamics is needed. This is essential, because initially similar dynamical states will diverge in time through chaos, a phenomenon known as the \u2018butterfly effect\u201911. Therefore, to follow an extreme event through its entire evolution, the model needs some additional enforcement to stay close to observations, beyond the initial or lateral boundary conditions. A popular method to fulfil this task is spectral nudging. It constrains the large spatial scales of a climate model within the free atmosphere (i.e., outside of the boundary layer) so that it is \u2018nudged\u2019 towards, for instance, reanalysis data. The technique was first adapted and applied to regional climate models at the GKSS research centre12 (today Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon) after the idea emerged in the 1990s for weather models13. At a storm workshop in Reading in 2017, the authors started to develop the idea to combine their methods, namely storylines and global spectral nudging, to a new extreme event attribution technique called spectrally nudged storylines.</p><p>This article provides a perspective on how the storyline and spectral nudging methods were combined to spectrally nudged storylines as a new method of attributing extreme weather events to anthropogenic climate change. We show how the spectral nudging technique was established and evolved over time, for a variety of different purposes. What these different purposes have in common is the need to constrain the butterfly effect in order to answer a particular, conditional scientific question, where the large-scale flow can be reasonably regarded as given. Then we elaborate on the development and details of spectrally nudged storylines and review studies that use these methods. Spectrally nudged storylines are discussed in comparison to other strongly conditioned attribution methods, and first approaches are presented that apply spectrally nudged storylines for impact studies. We conclude with an outlook on further applications of spectrally nudged storylines given current developments in climate science.</p><p>A list of frequently asked questions on the method, subjectively assembled by the authors, is provided in Table 1 below. Since this kind of storyline attribution is a recent innovation, only a limited number of studies exist so far. However, we believe that the new attribution method adds valuable information for extreme event attribution and will improve communication about climate change and its impacts. Instead of providing generalized probabilities based on abstract model ensembles, the method gives readily interpretable answers to practical questions such as \u2018What if this same extreme event happened in a warmer or cooler climate and how large is the human impact?\u2019.Table 1</p><p>Frequently asked questions about Spectrally Nudged Storylines, based on the authors\u2019 experience</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col2\" namest=\"col1\">Frequently asked questions</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">What are Storylines?</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Storylines are causal explanations where some of the explanatory factors may be contingent, i.e., considered as accidental.

Independently of this work, von Storch et al.12 developed spectral nudging for regional climate model simulations. In both cases, the method was developed for technical reasons, as an add-on to the standard method of constraining the large scales of a regional weather or climate model only through the lateral boundary conditions, as constraining only the lateral boundary conditions can lead to internal states inconsistent with the driving fields. Spectral nudging is applied for only a very few variables, specifically horizontal wind components or divergence and vorticity, and in the free atmosphere, to allow the lower atmosphere, and smaller-scale features, to respond to perturbations in a dynamically consistent way. It is called spectral, as the nudging is applied only for large spatial scales, for instance just for the low wavenumbers of a spectral model. (For grid point models a Fourier transformation is applied, to connect grid point space to wavenumber space.) The rationale behind the method (which can be verified a posteriori) is that local meteorological conditions are determined by a combination of the large-scale flow (provided by the nudging) and the details of the surface physics (provided by the model). Weisse and Feser14 showed that for ensemble simulations for wind hindcasts with and without spectral nudging using slightly disturbed starting conditions, spectral nudging reduces the internal model variability and leads to smaller differences to observations on average, compared with solely constraining the regional model through the lateral boundary conditions. In other words, it constrains the butterfly effect.</p><p>Von Storch et al.12 noted that spectral nudging could be seen as a \u201cpoor person\u2019s data assimilation technique,\u201d and thus was also a way of producing regional reanalyses, even without regional observations, using the regional model to fill in the physical detail. A large number of studies subsequently applied spectral nudging for dynamical downscaling of large-scale reanalysis data to produce long-term regional hindcasts of climate variability15. Of course, there is nothing to prevent applying spectral nudging within a global model16; the rationale in that case has nothing to do with lateral boundary conditions but instead has to do with avoiding temporal inhomogeneities that can arise from the assimilation of varying numbers of measurement data in reanalyses over time. In a similar spirit, spectral nudging can be used to validate a model against sparse observations, by ensuring that the comparison is \u2018like for like\u201917. Importantly, all of these studies emphasize that the nudging must be carefully adjusted for the purpose at hand, since too strong nudging can lead to a dampening of regional processes, whilst too weak nudging can fail to sufficiently constrain the large-scale flow. More details on choosing the nudging settings can be found in the Supplementary and in refs. 16,18.</p><p>Relevant to our purpose here, spectral nudging has also been used for the attribution of causal effects. Here, the global model is run twice, once with and once without the causal effect. If the model was run freely, then the butterfly effect would mean that differences between the two simulations would not necessarily reflect the causal effect, but could also reflect internal variability. Overcoming this ambiguity by performing a large ensemble of simulations would return us to the previously discussed problems associated with probabilistic event attribution. In contrast, spectral nudging provides a direct causal estimate that is conditional on the imposed atmospheric state. For example, Kooperman et al.19 used spectral nudging to estimate the aerosol indirect effect, although the nudging was to a climate model simulation rather than to reanalysis. A closer parallel to extreme event attribution is Shepherd et al.20, who applied spectral nudging within a chemistry-climate model to attribute the role of halogen-induced stratospheric ozone loss in the observed record of global ozone. Because the observed record includes a strong component of natural variability, the set-up was able to resolve a number of outstanding scientific puzzles, e.g., where anomalous dynamical variability had masked chemical ozone loss. The attribution relied on the assumption that the effect of halogen-induced ozone loss on stratospheric circulation could be neglected in the interpretation of the ozone record, which is a reasonable assumption outside of the Antarctic ozone hole region.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Spectrally nudged storylines</emphasis></p><p>The method of spectrally nudged storylines was introduced independently by Refs. 18,21, applied to heat waves. The method uses a global atmospheric climate model wherein the large-scale atmospheric weather patterns are nudged towards reanalysis data so that observed extreme events can be simulated in different climate states. (A necessary first step for any attribution is to confirm that the factual simulation can closely follow the event in question.) Between the individual storylines only those external parameters are changed that were influenced by anthropogenic forcing with high certainty, notably SSTs and greenhouse gases. (Modifying sea-ice concentrations is tricky because of the need to ensure physical consistency with the modified SSTs, so is handled on a case-by-case basis and may not be necessary. Note that the same issue arises with probabilistic attribution using atmospheric models, where the sensitivity to the sea-ice counterfactual will be much more consequential because of the response of the atmospheric circulation to the sea-ice modification.) In this way, the method keeps the dynamical conditions similar between storylines, while a focus is put on the thermodynamic responses to the imposed forcings, such as warming and increased specific humidity, which are provided by the model physics and which are the robust aspects of climate change7. Van Garderen et al.18 used a small ensemble of three members for each storyline to show that such a conditional attribution can lead to high signal-to-noise ratios and thus a higher confidence in the attribution, compared to the conventional, probabilistic approach. Examples of the different kinds of attribution statements provided by the two approaches are given in Table 218. A variant on this approach is to allow the SSTs to respond interactively to the changed greenhouse gases, whilst maintaining the nudging of the atmospheric state22.Table 2</p><p>Example of the complementary attribution statements that are possible using the probabilistic and storyline approaches, for the case of the 2010 Russian heat wave (Table from van Garderen et al.18)</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Probabilistic attribution (based on results from ref. 61)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Averaged over the Russian domain and over the month of July, temperatures in 2010 were 5 \u00b0C above the 1960s climatology, of which 4 \u00b0C was due to internal variability and 1 \u00b0C was due to anthropogenic climate change.The heatwave represented a 1-in-33 year event, which was three times more likely than it would have been in the 1960s.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Storyline attribution (based on results from ref. 18)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Averaged over the Russian domain, temperatures in 2010 steadily increased from the 1985?2015 climatology through the month of July until about August 10, then rapidly returned to climatology.The domain-averaged heatwave reached 10 \u00b0C above the 1985-2015 climatology in early August, of which 8 \u00b0C was due to internal variability and 2 \u00b0C was due to anthropogenic climate change.The anthropogenic component of the warming reached 4 \u00b0C in the region to the south of Moscow during the first half of August, where it exacerbated the already warm temperatures there.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>Probabilistic attribution (based on results from ref. 61)Averaged over the Russian domain and over the month of July, temperatures in 2010 were 5 \u00b0C above the 1960s climatology, of which 4 \u00b0C was due to internal variability and 1 \u00b0C was due to anthropogenic climate change.The heatwave represented a 1-in-33 year event, which was three times more likely than it would have been in the 1960s.Storyline attribution (based on results from ref. 18)Averaged over the Russian domain, temperatures in 2010 steadily increased from the 1985\u20132015 climatology through the month of July until about August 10, then rapidly returned to climatology.The domain-averaged heatwave reached 10 \u00b0C above the 1985-2015 climatology in early August, of which 8 \u00b0C was due to internal variability and 2 \u00b0C was due to anthropogenic climate change.The anthropogenic component of the warming reached 4 \u00b0C in the region to the south of Moscow during the first half of August, where it exacerbated the already warm temperatures there.</p><p>The summer heat wave of 2022 over Europe was analysed by Feser et al.23. The study combined spectrally nudged storylines and a statistical cluster analysis of a 2000-year paleo simulation and reanalysis data to attribute the heat wave and put the extreme event into historical context. The main result is that anthropogenic climate change increased the heat wave by 1.25 \u00b0C on average and locally by up to 5.7 \u00b0C (Fig. 1). Although the present-day storyline does not exactly match the reanalysis due to model biases, the day-to-day variations are highly correlated, and it is the difference between storylines that matters. This illustrates how the storyline approach quantifies the distributions of differences (conditional specific causation) rather than the differences of distributions (general causation) considered in the conventional approach. The statistical analysis of a multimillennial paleo climate simulation confirmed that it was one of the most extreme heatwaves of the last 2000 years. This article outlines a first comprehensive approach or common framework to combine both the conventional statistical climate attribution and storyline attribution. In this way, different questions such as \u2018How would the heat wave have evolved under different climate conditions?\u2019 and \u2018How extreme was the heat wave within the last millennia?\u2019 can be answered.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Storyline attribution of the European heatwave 2022.</emphasis></p><p>Left: The upper panel shows the 2 m temperatures [\u00b0C] (shaded) and present-day storyline geopotential height at 500hPa [m] (black contours) for July 2022.

Van Garderen and Mindlin24 examined the 2011/2012 drought in southeastern South America, which had devastating impacts. Climate change has already clearly led to higher temperatures and thus to increased evaporation/evapotranspiration of water from vegetation, soil and water surfaces. On the other hand, climate change is causing more precipitation in this region, albeit in the winter season. The study showed that so far, but also in a 2 \u00b0C warmer world, this additional winter precipitation more than compensates for the increased summer evaporation. Whether this will also be the case as temperatures continue to rise, or whether evaporation will then dominate, is still unclear. This article was particularly interesting as a showcase for the potential of spectrally nudged storylines, as the interplay between larger winter precipitation offsetting the increasing summer drought potential would not have been captured with a drought index based on summer meteorological conditions alone.</p><p>In terms of heavy rainfall, a near-real-time storyline set-up was used to examine the extreme rainfall and subsequent flooding from storm Boris over Central and Eastern Europe in September 202425. This study shows that a near-real-time attribution is feasible with spectrally nudged storylines, given the ease of their implementation. Recently, John et al.26 applied the approach in a global climate model at a kilometre-scale resolution. This study represents a new step in very high-resolution storyline attribution, reaching convection-permitting scales in a global setting. In this regard, spectrally nudged storylines could lead to improved attribution results for extreme events that are more heterogeneous or of smaller spatial extent such as extreme convective precipitation, mesoscale systems or intense cyclones. Such simulations have a massive demand in high performance computing power and storage space, making them completely infeasible for probabilistic attribution, but at least within reach for the storyline approach.</p><p>A very recent development are regional spectrally nudged storylines and only a few studies applying them so far exist. Ref. 27 examined the European summer heat wave of 2019, using global storylines spectrally nudged to reanalysis data which were dynamically downscaled using a regional climate model. The regional storylines showed a more intense, longer lasting and spatially extended heat wave for future climate states due to human-induced climate change. Another recent study28 used spectral nudging to conduct thermodynamic global warming simulations for the continental US with a regional climate model. The resulting multi-decadal data set for present-time conditions and several future warming trajectories is openly available and seems to be an interesting data base for attribution applications. This is a return to the origins of spectral nudging, which as noted earlier was first developed for downscaling of climate change via regional models, but now applied in a storyline context to focus on particular kinds of extreme events. This new attribution approach offers the possibility to attribute extreme events of smaller spatial scale than heat waves and droughts, such as storms or intense precipitation events, without having to run a global high-resolution model.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Strongly conditioned attribution methods</emphasis></p><p>As discussed in Ref. 9, the key ingredient is constraining the large-scale atmospheric circulation so as to distinguish between the dynamic and thermodynamic contributions to an extreme event. Ref. 1 refers to this as \u2018strongly conditioned attribution\u2019, since probabilistic attribution often also involves some level of conditioning, e.g., on SST patterns. Importantly, in strongly conditioned attribution the dynamical component is not ignored, but is treated separately because of the different level of uncertainty associated with dynamical aspects of climate change. There are two basic ways of constraining the atmospheric circulation: passively, through statistical selection; and actively, through a physical model (as with spectrally nudged storylines). The most commonly used methods, together with their advantages and disadvantages compared to other strongly conditioned attribution methods, are summarized in Table 3 and are described in slightly more detail below. Of course, in any particular application more than one method can be used, as in the case of Ref. 23 discussed above.Table 3</p><p>Overview of strongly conditioned (storyline) event attribution methods</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"216\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col1\">Strongly Conditioned (Storyline) Event Attribution Methods</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Attribution Methods</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">How does it work?</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Advantages/Disadvantages</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Statistical</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The dynamic and thermodynamic components of a spatial timeseries (e.g., daily maps of surface temperature) are isolated statistically</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">No climate model simulations are neededThe dynamic component is available for separate analysis, e.g., in terms of its long-term trendsThe thermodynamic component is estimated as a residual and may contain unidentified dynamic componentsA target variable must be chosen, restricting the method to univariate extremesFull 3-D fields are not available, limiting the use for impact studies</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Analogues</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The most similar circulation patterns (analogues) to a particular event are selected to represent the dynamical conditions</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Observed changes in the frequency of the analogue states provide an estimate of the observed changes in the likelihood of the dynamical conditions conducive to the event, providing a bridge to probabilistic attributionGood analogues may not always be found</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Dynamical Adjustment</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Dynamically induced variations are statistically removed to isolate the anthropogenic climate change signal</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">The nature of the dynamical trend is not immediately interpretable</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Modelled</emphasis></entry><entry colname=\"col2\">A physical model is run in factual and counterfactual mode, with the circulation constrained in some way</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Not restricted to the historical record so can consider unseen eventsThe role of changing circulation is not directly estimatedThe model may have biases</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Pseudo Global Warming</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Differences between global simulations for various climates are added to reanalysis data to constrain the boundary conditions for regional extreme event simulations</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Very similar in spirit to spectrally nudged storylines, but cannot be applied globally and suffers from the limitations of limited area models driven only from the boundary conditions</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Short-term Forecasts</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Historical extreme event forecasts with weather models are re-forecast under counterfactual conditions</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Can use existing operational forecast systemsCan represent any extreme that can be forecastTarget events need to be identifiedOnly useful for short-term eventsInterpretation of simulations is challenging because of statistical non-stationarity</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">?Spectrally Nudged Storylines</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Extreme events are simulated for different climates using similar large-scale circulation</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Output is statistically homogeneous in space and time, so analysis is easyEvents do not need to be predefined;

The key idea is to represent regional climate variables as a function of the large-scale atmospheric conditions (which is the rationale behind downscaling). For that, large-scale weather patterns for a given day are compared to high-resolution observation or reanalysis data, and time periods with the most similar circulation patterns (analogues) are selected. The observed weather at these times then serves as input to estimate the high-resolution climate state, assuming statistical stationarity. The technique can, for instance, be useful for statistical downscaling purposes or for paleoclimate reconstructions, but also for attribution of extreme events30. In the latter case, the difference between the analogue-estimated state and the actual state represents the thermodynamic component of climate change, relative to the reference period. For example, ref. 31 used the method to demonstrate that the cold European winter of 2010 was less cold than it would otherwise have been, because of anthropogenic warming.</p><p>Another statistical method of event attribution is termed Dynamical Adjustment. The method removes dynamical variations in a time series of a target variable, for instance by using empirical orthogonal functions, weather pattern clustering or linear regression, so that the anthropogenic climate change signal becomes more distinct32,33. The implicit assumption, as with storyline attribution, is that long-term dynamical variations are best regarded as internal variability. Rather than targeting a particular extreme event (as with Analogues), long-term trends are adjusted, although the decomposition can of course be examined for a particular event to provide an event attribution. Ref. 34 demonstrate the potential of dynamical adjustment as an attribution method for extreme events using the European cold spell and the Russian heat wave of 2010 as examples.</p><p>In regional climate modelling, a technique called Pseudo Global Warming (PGW) to study climate change effects on extreme events was presented by Ref. 35. It calculates climate change differences between global model simulations of e.g., present-day and pre-industrial climate or between future and present-day climate for important meteorological variables such as temperature, pressure, wind and humidity. These differences are then added to reanalysis data and constitute the PGW input data as modified boundary data for the regional climate model so that high-resolution simulations for the extreme event can be simulated for different climate states. The method is quite similar to spectrally nudged storylines, the difference is in its application being limited to regional studies and in not applying spectral nudging throughout the model domain. Although mainly used to study changes in climate, some studies have used PGW for attributing extremes to anthropogenic climate change, for instance, precipitation events over Asia36 or typhoon-induced extreme precipitation37.</p><p>Another model-based event attribution method is to use short-term weather forecasts of the event, which are re-simulated under counter-factual conditions. Since the dynamical conditioning only occurs via the initial conditions, it weakens with forecast lead time because of the spread in the forecast ensembles through the butterfly effect. This leads to a temporal non-stationarity in the degree of conditioning as well as from spin-up of the climate response during the forecast, which complicates the statistical analysis38. Moreover, the dynamical conditioning is only effective for weather forecast timescales of a few days to a week, where the main anthropogenic effect comes from the counter-factual SSTs38. Hence the method has mainly been used for tropical cyclones39, showing in particular that the rainfall was increased by anthropogenic climate change. Since the probability of the initial conditions is not assessed, it is still a conditional attribution. Another conditional attribution using a regional-model ensemble weather-hindcasting approach analysed the Colorado floods of September 2013, showing that anthropogenic drivers increased the magnitude of heavy precipitation40.</p><p>Compared to the other model-based approaches, global spectrally nudged storylines have the key advantage of providing model fields that are both spatially and temporally statistically homogeneous, making the statistical analysis much simpler, at the cost of not necessarily being able to follow small-scale extreme events.</p><p>A new approach which is very similar in spirit to spectrally nudged storylines is to use a simple data assimilation system rather than spectral nudging to constrain the atmospheric state41. In this approach, the only atmospheric field assimilated is sea level pressure, which is combined with either factual or counter-factual SSTs. The method appears to be very effective for analysis of storms, and can be applied to historical storms in the distant past provided surface pressure observations are available. Thus, rather than asking how a recent extreme event would have been in the past, this method is able to ask how an extreme event from the distant past would be today. We do not include this method in Table 3 since there is not yet sufficient literature.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact-based studies applying spectrally nudged storylines</emphasis></p><p>A new task for spectrally nudged storylines is to move forward from attribution of hazards to attribution of their impacts. So far, only a small number of such studies have been published. One of them is a storyline study on Hurricane Sandy\u2019s impact on New York City42, which assessed how sea-level rise and changes in storm features affected coastal flooding impacts on critical infrastructure. To account for some degree of internal variability, the hurricane was altered in its landfall position, intensity and shape. It was found that even moderate increases in sea level and changes in storm tracks can affect flood impacts. A strength of this study is the simulation of the compound flooding effect of storm surge, high tide, sea level rise and extreme precipitation which caused the hurricane\u2019s impact on critical infrastructure. Through their specificity, storylines can provide a more advanced insight into the interaction of these drivers under past and future climate conditions.</p><p>Heat waves can lead to droughts, wildfires or crop failures. Extremely dangerous is the impact of heat on human mortality. This impact was assessed by ref. 43 for Germany. The aim was to predict the heat-related mortality for different future climate states based on storylines using advanced machine learning techniques. The storylines\u2019 factual and future climate data relies on observed extreme events and shows how their impact on mortality may change if these events would happen in a warmer world. This is one of the first studies to combine machine learning with spectrally nudged storylines to attribute extreme event impacts. Neural networks are well suited and often superior to conventional statistical analysis in finding complex nonlinear relationships between extremes and variables such as mortality, provided that the underlying data basis is sufficiently large and of high quality. However, the machine learning model assumes that the climate-mortality relationship is not changing due to external factors in different climates, which may not be realistic in the far future.</p><p>In 2012, a large crop loss for soybeans, which even affected global food markets, occurred in the three largest soybean producing regions in the United States, Brazil, and Argentina due to compound hot and dry weather conditions. Ref. 44 examined the impact of climate change on soybean production for this extreme drought year using a statistical crop model combined with global storyline data. The study found that drought intensity did not change between the storylines, but higher temperatures and an intensified temperature-moisture interaction will lead to larger crop losses in the future. Applying such crop models to climate storylines may improve adaptation to climate change and communication with decision makers by identifying regions that are most vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change, e.g., where more irrigation or a change in crop type is needed.</p><p>Ref. 45 investigated near-surface ozone pollution levels in warmer climates, which would have health implications for humans and ecosystems. Storyline scenarios of air pollution were developed using a global atmospheric chemistry model to assess ozone pollution extremes in a warmer climate. The results point to two competing processes, which are dependent on the level of warming: vegetation and local photochemistry increase ozone extremes, while a concurrent moistening of the atmosphere leads to lower ozone concentrations. Such highly complex interrelating processes could well have been missed in a purely probabilistic attribution study, emphasizing the value of adding the storyline method in a combined attribution approach.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Outlook</emphasis></p><p>Spectrally nudged storylines bring together the concepts of global climate downscaling (spectral nudging) and conditional attribution (storylines) to provide a methodology to predict surface climate from large-scale atmospheric circulation together with thermodynamic forcings, with the details filled in by the climate model. The methodology is easy to implement and easy to interpret, whilst respecting the complexity of a local situation, and thus exemplifies the key principles of \u201cSmall is Beautiful\u201d46. We conclude this piece by reflecting on how spectrally nudged storylines can contribute to the changing face of climate science.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Impact attribution</emphasis></p><p>There is a rapidly growing demand for attribution of climate impacts, yet this inevitably involves multiple causal factors, not just climate change. It is highly misleading if disasters are attributed solely to climate change, even if climate change increased their likelihood. In order to go from hazards to impacts for particular events, specific causation is needed: general causation is not sufficient47. Spectrally nudged storylines have the potential to fill this gap, as the few existing studies already show. What is needed is the inclusion of impact models with realistic intervention points, so that counterfactuals in the decision space can be combined with climate counterfactuals. Digital twins48 offer promise in this respect.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unseen events</emphasis></p><p>Risk management requires examining things that might have happened (so-called \u2018downward counterfactuals\u2019) rather than just those that did happen. There is rapidly growing work in this space, either mining large ensemble simulations49, or boosting ensemble members to create extremes that are more extreme than those observed50. This is very much in the spirit of \u2018tales of future weather\u201951, but for the present. Such unseen events could be used to spectrally nudge higher resolution climate models and propagate the events through to impacts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dynamical aspects of climate change</emphasis></p><p>A long-recognized limitation of the storyline approach to event attribution is its inability to account for possible changes in atmospheric circulation. This has been justified by the importance of quantifying the robust aspects of climate change, given the ambiguity of predicted circulation changes from climate models at the regional scale. However, circulation changes are beginning to emerge in the ever-lengthening observed record, and very often, they lie outside the range of changes predicted by the climate models, even after accounting for internal variability52. This raises the question of whether storylines of circulation change based on observations might be more useful than those based on the climate models themselves53. Spectral nudging using these observed circulation trends could be used to expand the range of explanatory factors considered in event storylines.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bridging between specific and general causation</emphasis></p><p>Both specific (storyline) and general (probabilistic) attribution have their purposes, and their strengths and weaknesses. Given the widespread prevalence of probabilistic event attribution and its planned operationalization, it is important to be able to connect the two approaches, and connect them both to attribution of changes in the statistics of extreme events, as reflected in aggregations over many events (and as discussed, e.g., in IPCC Assessment Reports). Because global spectrally nudged storylines are not event-specific but include all events worldwide during the simulation period, collections of events can be analysed, as with the attribution of a single hurricane season by aggregating over all forecasted hurricanes using the short-term forecast method54. This would also help connect attribution of historical events to long-term trends and future risk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Global km-scale modelling</emphasis></p><p>There is a growing push for the use of km-scale atmospheric models in order to explicitly model atmospheric convection, which is important for extreme events such as heavy precipitation55. Such models are very computationally expensive to run, however, which effectively precludes their use in probabilistic attribution. Any short simulation is necessarily conditional on the large-scale conditions. As already mentioned, spectral nudging provides an interpretable conditionality so that the short simulations can be more effectively compared against observations, and used for event attribution.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</emphasis></p><p>AI could further enhance the potential of climate storylines. In their recent study, Ref. 56 assess an AI-based weather and climate model in simulating extreme heat waves. They show that the model can realistically reproduce such events in different climate states. However, the study also points to a limiting factor. In comparison to physics-based models the AI-model tends to underestimate future warming. As a reason for this the authors suggest the absence of land-atmosphere feedbacks in the AI-based model. Perturbing AI-based models (analogously to how spectrally nudged AGCMs are perturbed with SSTs) has been shown to produce physically realistic responses in some AI-based weather models57. For application to extreme event attribution, AI is very well suited not just for detection and attribution of extreme events, but also for the detection of nonlinear relationships and drivers of extremes58. New AI attribution methods are currently explored in the EU-funded projects Climate Intelligence (CLINT, <url normalizedValue=\"https://climateintelligence.eu/\">https://climateintelligence.eu/</url>) and eXtreme events: Artificial Intelligence for Detection and Attribution (XAIDA, <url normalizedValue=\"https://xaida.eu/\">https://xaida.eu/</url>) which already show promising results into the direction of combining AI and storyline attribution to result in a common attribution framework.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This article contributes to the European Union H2020 Project \u201cCLIMATE INTELLIGENCE Extreme events detection, attribution and adaptation design using machine learning (CLINT)\u201d, Ref: 101003876-CLINT, to the BMFTR-project ClimXtreme-A5 (01 LP 2322 B), the BMFTR-project WAKOS-2 (01LR2003A1) and to the European Union H2020 XAIDA Project, grant no. 101003469.

Built in 2012 using the latest in Japanese building and seismic technology, this skyscraping radio tower can continue transmitting information to affected areas even in the event of a major disaster such as an earthquake. </p><p> One element of the tower that plays a major role in its earthquake resistance is the reinforced concrete cylinder in its center, the shinbashira or Core Column. </p><p>Measuring eight meters in diameter and 375 meters tall, the column is fixed to the body of the tower with steel up to 125 meters above ground level. </p><p>From that point up to the 375-meter point, the shinbashira is not fixed to the tower itself, but is connected by a cylinder with oil inside, called an oil damper. The oil damper acts as a cushion to prevent the core column from hitting the tower body when it shakes. </p><p> The steel frame of the tower's main body and core column are designed to sway at different cycles during an earthquake, which damps the swaying of the tower overall, reducing it by up to 50%. It was the first time this sort of damping system had ever been implemented. </p><p> The tower body has a truss structure consisting of steel pipe parts, vertically, diagonally, and horizontally, joined in a triangular shape. This structure is carefully calculated and designed so it can withstand the shaking caused by earthquakes and typhoons. </p><p> Additionally, the Skytree also functions as an important space for disaster preparedness activities and a disaster prevention stockpile, serving as a crisis management hub for Sumida City. </p><p>The 7,000 tons of water stored in the tower for heating and cooling purposes can be utilized in homes and for firefighting purposes in the event of a major disaster.</p><p>                      Hyper Rescue Team                    </p><p> The Fire Rescue Task Forces, also known as Hyper Rescue, were created after the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake that hit western Japan in 1995. </p><p>The quake did not only cause fires but also other complicated rescue situations, including collapsed buildings and roads, that conventional firefighting forces were not equipped to deal with. </p><p>It became clear that there was a pressing need for advanced units with specialized knowledge and skills, as well as custom-built heavy machinery and life detectors. </p><p> Hyper Rescue HR was established the following year. </p><p>Currently divisions are stationed at five of Tokyo\u2019s 10 fire district headquarters, always ready to respond quickly to large-scale disasters that fall within the jurisdiction of the Tokyo Fire Department. </p><p> 6HR is one such division, headquartered in Adachi City. This district is surrounded by two major rivers, so water rescue is also part of their duties. Unlike other units they have watercraft systems such as jet skis, urethane boats and advanced lifeboats which can hold 20 people and be used to rescue people in wheelchairs. </p><p> The unit is also equipped with highly advanced rescue equipment such as underground sound detectors and electromagnetic life detectors, as well as heavy machinery that typical fire stations do not have. </p><p>6HR has been dispatched to deal with disasters such as the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, the torrential rain in the Kanto and Tohoku regions in 2015, and the Noto Peninsula Earthquake in 2024.</p><p>                      Protecting Tokyo                    </p><p> The Port of Tokyo is an international trading port that serves as a foundation for the industry and everyday lives of the 40 million people who live and work in the city. </p><p>But it is also located on the furthest end of Tokyo Bay, where the connection to the sea combined with the shallow bay waters make the area particularly vulnerable to phenomena like storm surges.  This is important, as roughly 20% of the 23 wards of Tokyo\u2014approximately 124 square kilometers, housing 1.5 million Tokyo residents\u2014consists of \"zero-meter zones\" that fall below sea level at high tide. </p><p> The Port of Tokyo\u2019s coastal protection facilities\u2014such as floodgates, inland locks, seawalls, and pump stations\u2014continue to be built around low-lying areas to protect the lives and property of Tokyo residents.</p><p> The TMG has established the TOKYO Resilience Project in order to prepare against five major potential disasters\u2014storm and flood damage, earthquakes, ash fall from volcanic eruptions, power/telecommunication disruptions, and infectious disease. </p><p>Through this 15 trillion yen project, the city is also promoting its safety-minded urban development to the wider world. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DSTONL-109936121</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DSTONL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FBF-MKP3-RRNF-74ND-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408508</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><timeReceived>10:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Northern and Shell Media Publications All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Daily Star Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"12328\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 15, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

In addition, the Seventh SEP lacks detailed targets for thermal energy sources, unlike the previous Sixth SEP which specifies individual targets for coal, oil and gas. We believe this absence of clarity could delay the coal phase-out. Overall, this has led us to revise our thermal capacity forecasts upwards, expected to remain approximately at the same level for 2024 and 2034, at about 177GW.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In April 2025, Japan's second long-term decarbonisation auction (LTDA) awarded four LNG-fired power plants totalling 1.3GW, or 21% of the awarded capacity.

This unit is intended to replace two ageing thermal power units: a 250MW coal-fired unit and a 240MW oil-fired unit that is currently idled.</p></bodyText></listItem></list>Structural TrendsJapan is heavily reliant on conventional thermal power generation for its power supply, relying on it for more than 60% of its power generation needs. Over the long term, we believe that climate commitments will become the focus of Japan\u2019s power market, with coal- and oil-fired power plants to be gradually decommissioned. As new gas-fired power plants come online, they will balance out the decommissioning of coal- and oil-fired power capacity for Japan\u2019s net conventional thermal power capacity to remain around 181GW throughout our forecast period to 2034.        Conventional Thermal Dominance Will Wane, But Still A Significant Contributor To The MixWe believe that the main cause for the sector\u2019s contraction is the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI)'s decision to phase out 100 coal power plants by 2030, which was announced in August 2020. These 100 power plants are part of 114 power plants that were built before the mid-1990s, and are marked by the government to be \u2018inefficient\u2019. While coal-fired power plants are being decommissioned, we believe that there will be an increase in gas-fired power plants, resulting in a slight net decrease in conventional thermal capacity. We further believe that the decommissioned coal power plants will be replaced with newer coal technologies, which will mean that generation capacity will not change much.METI regards coal as an important generation source. We believe that closures will also be met with the implementation of more efficient coal technologies, such as those using ultra-supercritical boilers or integrated coal gasification plants. This means that Japan will not completely phase out coal power generation. Instead, the government has been making continued investments in the research and development of newer, more efficient coal generation technologies. In 2019, the government formed a panel to draft a plan to urge the closure of all coal-fired plants in the long term. This was met with strong opposition from panel members in the business sector, leading to the scrapping of the plan.\u00a0Japan remains committed to exploring ammonia as a form of thermal power generation source given its suitability to be blended with coal. In November 2022,\u00a0JERA\u00a0announced that, together with\u00a0Mitsui OSK Lines\u00a0and\u00a0NYK, it\u00a0will explore the construction of the world\u2019s largest operations for the transport of ammonia for power plant fuel to reduce Japan\u2019s coal consumption. JERA currently has 26 thermal power plants in Japan\u00a0and believes that this project will help develop a supply chain for green fuels, mainly ammonia. However, we believe that this might result in the prolonging of operable coal-fired power plants in Japan, as existing plants can be retrofitted to burn ammonia with coal. As a result, we maintain a marginal contraction of conventional thermal power capacity for Japan.Conventional Thermal Dominance Dependent On Market\u2019s Stance On Natural GasJapan's approach to its power generation mix has continued to evolve since the release of its Sixth Strategic Energy Plan 2030 in October 2021. The plan calls for a reduction in gas-fired power generation to contribute to around 20% of 2030\u2019s generation mix. Gas currently contributes about 33% to the power mix, and this new target marks a downward revision of the target set by the previous Abe administration, which pegged the share of gas to fall to 27% in 2030. This stems from the government\u2019s plans to reduce reliance on liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports, which has exacerbated since the Fukushima disaster, as well as to reduce high retail electricity prices for consumers.Since 2021, progress toward these targets has been mixed. The government's updated Seventh SEP in 2025. As of 2024, thermal generation still accounts for 65% of Japan's power mix. Recognising these hurdles, the government has extended its timeline for achieving a 40-50% share for renewables by 2040 instead. Thermal power is targeted to contribute to 30-40% of Japan's power mix by 2040, though no breakdown is provided among coal, oil and gas, which stands in contrast to the individual targets provided for each renewable source and the previous Sixth SEP's individual breakdown for thermal sources. We expect that this absence of clarity could delay the coal phase-out, potentially increasing coal's share in the energy mix and posing upside risks to our coal forecast.In addition, the Seventh SEP raises the self-development ratio - Japanese companies' control over oil and natural gas imports - to 50% by 2030 and 60% by 2040, encouraging investment in overseas fossil fuel development for supply certainty rather than prioritising domestic renewable sources for energy resilience. This poses upside risk to the thermal sector as a whole, at the expense of renewables growth.Japan remains a key player in the global LNG market, with sustained demand projected over the next decade. However, the expiration of many contracts between 2026 and 2033, particularly those with Russia, introduces uncertainty in the future LNG procurement in Japan. We expect increasing diversification of gas suppliers and a shift away from gas-fired power generation. In July 2022, Russia seized control of the Sakhalin-2 gas and oil project, which is partly owned by Shell, Mitsui and Mitsubishi. Despite the transfer of operations to a new Russian firm in August 2022, Mitsui and Mitsubishi continued their investment due to Japan's energy crisis. With Japan sourcing nearly 10% of its LNG imports from Sakhalin-2 and on the back of upwards revision to our forecasts for coal and nuclear generation, we have revised our gas generation forecast downwards.                     <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nuclear Forecasts</emphasis>                Latest Updates<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Japan's nuclear energy policy has evolved significantly since the Fukushima disaster in 2011. By 2022, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had adopted a policy of 'maximum use' of nuclear energy, extending the operational lifespans of existing reactors and lifting bans on new reactor construction in early 2023 to meet rising electricity demands, particularly from data centres. The Seventh SEP targets 20% of nuclear power in the country's power mix by 2030 and 2040. However, due to the lead time required for safety checks, which limits the technically feasible pace of restarts, we expect the share of nuclear to only reach between 12-13% in 2030.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In April 2025, Japan\u2019s second long-term decarbonisation auction (LTDA) awarded 6.3GW across 38 projects, representing 47% of the 13.6GW total bid capacity.

Source: METI, EIA, IRENA, local sources, BMI                                               Structural TrendsNuclear power's contribution to the power generation mix remains small compared with its performance before the 2011 Fukushima incident and contributions from other power types. It used to account for slightly more than 25% of the generation mix in 2010 but dropped to about 6% by the end of 2022. However, recent developments have shown a marked increase in nuclear output, with a 5.6% rise in 2024 reaching about 88TWh. Over the next decade, nuclear power generation will increase to 135.3TWh in 2034, at an annual average of 4.3%. This growth is attributed to the restart of 14 nuclear units, including Onagawa-2 and Shimane-2, reflecting Japan's efforts to enhance nuclear capacity and diversify its energy sources. The strategic restart of these reactors, supported by a legislative framework allowing for operation beyond 60 years with necessary safety upgrades, indicates a robust policy direction aimed at stabilising the energy supply and reducing Japan\u2019s reliance on imported fuels for power generation while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.While we expect further support for nuclear power to take shape in the coming quarters, as electricity price and energy security concerns grow, there has been some progress in gaining more approvals for the restarting of more nuclear power plants in the latter half of this decade. We have included Tokai-2 in our forecast for 2026-2027, Tomari-3 in 2027 and Unit 6 of the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa nuclear power plant in 2029. The Onagawa-2 nuclear reactor came online in October 2024. Due to the high cost of reactor restarts and regulatory and safety concerns, we expect reactor restarts to only pick up at the end of this decade and into the 2030s.The ruling LDP coalition lost its majority in the lower house elections in October 2024, which will make policymaking challenging and could lead to increased barriers for nuclear restarts. While the LDP and pro-business allies support nuclear restarts and next-generation technologies, opposition parties like the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan favour limiting nuclear reliance. The Japanese Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party advocate for a complete phase-out in favour of renewables. This political split highlights the ongoing debate as Japan balances energy security, decarbonisation and public safety concerns. As a result of these challenges and strict Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) regulations imposed on nuclear power plants, we believe nuclear reactor restarts will continue to face consistent delays to their restart dates.Japan has two new nuclear reactors under construction: the 1.4GW Ohma nuclear power plant and the 1.4GW Shimane 3 nuclear reactor. Both reactors have been under construction since 2011 and 2012 respectively, with consistent delays to their commissioning date. We remain cautious on whether they will come online, as Japan devotes resources to nuclear power plant restarts. We expect Japan\u2019s operable nuclear power capacity to remain at about 31GW over the coming 10 years. This represents the total capacity of Japan\u2019s existing 33 nuclear reactors. Currently, 10 of the 33 reactors are approved by the NRA to generate electricity. The statuses of these 10 reactors can be found in the table at the end of this section.

The plan aims for nuclear power to contribute about 20% of Japan's energy output by 2040. In order to decrease its dependence on gas power generation, Japan has acknowledged the need to speed up the restarting of nuclear power plants, presenting upside risks to our conservative nuclear generation forecast. In May 2022, former prime minister Fumio Kishida announced that Japan was actively looking to diversify its power mix away from gas power generation, largely from growing nuclear power generation.\u00a0The rising oil and gas prices have resulted in calls for nuclear power plant restarts in Japan to bring down rising electricity prices. The restart of Takahama 1 and 2 nuclear reactors in 2023 resulted in strong nuclear power generation growth for that year, which we estimate was more than 10TWh. Onagawa 2 is another nuclear power reactor included in our short-term forecast, having come online in October 2024. These plants, which have passed the stringent safety checks, will be retrofitted with anti-terrorism mechanisms and receive the appropriate regulatory approvals. Aside from these plants, we expect limited growth in Japan\u2019s nuclear power sector for the longer term, although we see upside risks to this forecast if Japan successfully diversifies its generation mix.In February 2023, Japan's government formally introduced a major policy for the nuclear power sector by extending the operation time for nuclear power plants. The previously set\u00a0nominal operating period, introduced in July 2013, was 40 years. Under the former policy, extensions were granted up to a maximum of 20 years, dependent on safety requirements. The operating period has since been extended to 60 years (not including closure periods for maintenance and refuelling), following the NRA\u2019s approval on December 21 2022. Operators of reactors in use for 30 years or longer must formulate a long-term reactor management plan and gain approval from the regulator at least once every 10 years if they are to continue to operate. The Takahama reactors 1 and 2 were the first to be granted a licence extension of more than 40 years after the regulation revision in February 2023, with Takahama 1 restarting in 2023.In July 2023, Japan announced that it is considering a financing scheme to aid in the development of safety measures for dormant nuclear reactors. These reactors are operable but have been brought offline after the 2011 Fukushima disaster. Currently, owners and operators are apprehensive about restarting these nuclear power plants due to the costs of upgrading the plants with stringent safety and operational checks. In light of this, METI proposed to include existing nuclear power plants in the January 2024 auction programme, which currently only encompasses new renewable and nuclear power projects. However, given the limited nuclear reactor restart approvals in Japan and companies reluctant to apply for approvals, we believe that the inclusion, if approved, will only provide a minor upside for the nuclear power sector.                              <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hydropower Forecasts</emphasis>                Structural TrendsWe believe that there will be limited developments in the hydropower sector, although the sector will continue to contribute 8-9% to the overall power mix throughout our forecast period to 2034. While limited, most of the development will be pumped hydropower projects, with the Kannagawa hydropower plant being one of the largest such plants globally in development.Japan\u2019s hydropower capacity will remain at about 23GW over the coming years, while pumped hydropower capacity will increase from about 27GW in 2024 to about 31.6GW in 2034. Pumped hydropower developments will be supported by increasing efforts to balance the grid as Japan introduces more intermittent renewables to the power mix. Growth for conventional hydropower plants will mainly be due to small hydropower plants. However, the cost to generate electricity from such plants is much higher than large-scale hydropower plants and other power types, resulting in a limited overall growth for hydropower capacity.                     <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Power Storage </emphasis>                Latest Updates<list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In April 2025, Japan\u2019s second long-term decarbonisation auction (LTDA) awarded 6.3GW across 38 projects, representing 47% of the 13.6GW total bid capacity.

Japan also has ambitions to expand its battery manufacturing sector, reaching around 20% global market share by 2030. The industry ministry has announced that it needs more than USD24.0bn in public and private sector investment for batteries of electric vehicles and energy storage.\u00a0The market's focus on solid-state batteries highlights its commitment to leading the next generation of energy storage solutions. These batteries promise higher energy density and enhanced safety compared to traditional lithium-ion variants. Substantial subsidies, over USD660mn allocated in 2024, are facilitating the commercialisation of solid-state batteries by 2030, with companies like Toyota spearheading the efforts. Toyota's strategic plan to commence mass production by 2027 or 2028, along with Japan's commanding 36% share of global solid-state battery patents, underscores the market's innovative capacity and potential market leadership.\u00a0We expect the effects of an expanding battery manufacturing industry to cascade into the market\u2019s ability to develop BESS over the next decade. There is currently about 170MW of grid-connected BESS capacity in Japan, coming from Pacifico Energy\u2019s BESS project. We expect this to expand robustly, mainly in the latter half of our forecast period, to about 4,045MW by 2034.\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, as Japan continues to refine its feed-in-premium (FiP) scheme, the ability of generators to increase electricity supply during peak hours using BESS will likely drive further growth in the market as well.\u00a0In April 2023, METI announced plans to launch a new auction scheme for battery storage facilities. This will allow battery storage facilities of at least 10MW to be connected to the grid and permit its operators to sell electricity on the Japanese Electric Power Exchange or engage in power purchase agreements. METI started the auction in January 2024, with expressions of interest from companies to pre-register from October 2023. As of May 2024, the government announced that it has allocated about 1.1GW of BESS capacity was allocated across 30 projects, through the Long-Term Decarbonisation Power Source Auction. The auction was carried out by the Organisation for Cross-regional Coordination of Transmission Operators (OCCTO), which governs auctions launched for renewable power types, such as solar and wind.\u00a0We believe that this will encourage the growth of the battery storage sector in Japan, supporting more growth in renewables as the market grapples with integrating intermittent renewables into the grid. As part of the auction, there was 577MW of pumped hydropower storage up for bidding, bringing the total power storage capacity on offer to about 1GW.

This indicates an average annual growth of 4.6% over our forecast period, with more than 85% of all the sector\u2019s capacity growth coming from solar PV installations. Currently, non-hydropower renewable sources account for approximately 17.6% of Japan's electricity generation, which we expect to rise over the next decade to 24.4% in 2034, from 161.0TWh in 2025 to 238.0TWh.The incorporation of renewable energy sources and the consequential reduction in thermal power generation are seen as key trends of Japan's transition to a low-carbon emissions profile.\u00a0Central to this evolution is the focus on perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which offer lightweight, flexible, and efficient properties particularly suited for urban environments. This innovative technology is expected to significantly contribute to Japan's renewable energy targets, with plans to generate 20GW of electricity using PSCs by 2040, equivalent to the output of 20 nuclear reactors. This initiative is integral to Japan's broader goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, leveraging its position as the world's second-largest iodine producer to establish a localised supply chain for PSC production. The Sixth\u00a0Strategic Energy Plan (SEP) aims for a more rapid shift towards renewables, presenting upside risk to renewable energy deployment. The plan aims for renewables to contribute to 36-38% of 2030\u2019s power mix (up from 22-24% from the Fifth Energy Plan), while reducing thermal power to around 41% and unchanging nuclear power\u2019s target. The Sixth SEP supports Japan\u2019s pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, announced by former prime minister Suga Yoshihide. The Seventh SEP, launched in February 2025, pushed back renewable targets despite increasing their ambition - renewable energy aims to comprise 40-50% of Japan's mix by 2040, out of which 23-29% will be from solar, 4-8% wind, 8-10% hydro, 1-2% geothermal and 5-6% biomass.\u00a0                  Despite Slowdown, Solar Will Continue To Dominate Growth     Japan - Non-Hydropower Renewables By Type, MW (2015-2034)      <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"pdf\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media>                    e/f = BMI estimate/forecast.

Net solar capacity growth will slow from 2025 to 2034, averaging an annual growth rate of 4.1%, compared to the previous decade at 15.2%, as auctions and PPAs, rather than FiTs, become the main driver of large-scale solar capacity growth. This policy shift is the result of the government's efforts to ensure price competitiveness for new projects through a bidding system. An auction system means that the government can identify solar project areas that can be easily integrated into the grid before developing them.METI held its first solar power auction in November 2017. By implementing auctions, the government aims to gain greater control over the sector\u2019s growth, reduce the risk of curtailments and achieve cost savings for Japan\u2019s public finances relative to using FiTs across all solar power projects. Unlike fixed FiTs, where it is up to the regulator to set a cost-based purchase price, auctions drive down tariffs paid by the government, as companies are incentivised to submit the lowest bid possible to win contracts.Overall Uptake For Renewable Power Auctions Improving, Companies Show Waning Interest For Solar\u00a0Initially, Japan struggled to manage the transition to an auctions system, with lower-than-expected capacity being awarded and limited reduction in electricity costs. In the first three auctions, bids submitted were over USD130/MWh, which is higher than other solar power markets. In the fourth and fifth auctions (both held in 2019) bids were lowered, to an average of USD116/MWh, which is still high. This is attributed to significant security deposit requirements, high labour costs, limitations to grid capacity availability and difficulties in acquiring suitable land. Biomass projects faced similar challenges, although they typically require lesser land requirements than solar.\u00a0In April 2022, FiP system took effect, superseding the FiT system for certain renewable power projects above 1MW in capacity. This will allow renewable power producers to sell electricity at a premium price above the wholesale spot market. Most sub-sectors have faced FiT cuts in recent years, except for geothermal, offshore wind and small-scale renewables generation. This highlights Japan's push to support these sub-sectors in particular. In parallel, the transition from the FiT system to the FiP system has reshaped Japan's solar PV market. The FiP system introduces a market-driven approach, adding a premium to market prices rather than offering fixed purchase prices, thereby fostering competition and innovation while reducing consumer costs. As of early 2024, the FiP system had certified 1,507MW across 1,036 projects, with solar power accounting for 518MW across 955 projects. This shift has particularly promoted low-voltage solar projects for business use, expanding the market's reach.In June 2022 and August 2022, the OCCTO announced solar PV project tender results for the 12th and 13th tenders. From January 2022 to August 2022, Japan experienced an increase in solar PV tenders.The 12th tender, which is a solar PV auction scheme, was Japan\u2019s first programme that awarded either FiTs or FiPs. FiPs were awarded to projects above the capacity of 1MW, while FiTs were awarded for projects ranging in capacity from 250.0kW to 1.0MW. Within the 12th tender, FiPs were set at JPY9.9/kWh (USD0.0703) while FiTs had the lowest bid of JPY9.80/kWh (USD0.0698). These prices are much lower than that awarded in the first auction, which was USD0.13/kWh. This indicates that the scheme is starting to drive prices down, which was the aim of the government in phasing out the FiT scheme.\u00a0On March 10, 2023, OCCTO released the results of its 15th solar auction for the FiP and FiT programmes. Both programmes saw bids lower than the rate cap on offer, which indicates that there is an ongoing trend of solar prices dropping in Japan. This has continued on for the subsequent auctions, with the latest 22nd solar auction allocating 56.4MW of solar PV capacity with the lowest bid at JPY7.5/kWh (USD0.049/kWh). The average final price was JPY8.17/kWh. In comparison to previous auctions, this auction's lowest bid is one of the lowest recorded, indicating competitive pricing and potential cost reductions in Japan's solar market. In prior auctions, the average final prices ranged from JPY4.5 to JPY9.73/kWh.

For example, the City of Tokyo will have mandatory rooftop solar installations for new buildings and homes from April 2025. We believe that the elevated electricity prices due to the high cost of natural gas imports are encouraging residential and commercial consumers to install rooftop solar.\u00a0We have been observing rising trend in developed markets, whereby the rise of rooftop solar installations are driving the increase of installed solar capacity. Japan is also experiencing this, as the Japan Photovoltaic Energy Association (JPEA) is registering an increasing use of solar panels for distributed solar installations. As of 2022, rooftop solar installations each quarter has surpassed that of large-scale solar power projects. We believe that this trend will continue for the coming years, as large-scale solar power projects face increasing headwinds in the form of limited land availability and high land cost, while consumers are turning to distributed solar to combat the rising electricity prices.\u00a0With distributed solar expected to drive growth, we forecast solar power to maintain its dominance as the primary source of non-hydro renewables. We expect total solar capacity to reach 141.4GW by 2034 up from 96.0GW in 2025.

Our conservative outlook is attributed to surging costs that have resulted in construction delays, as well as the falling costs of solar, reducing the competitiveness of wind in comparison. By 2030, wind power generation is expected to contribute less than 2% of Japan's total power generation, aligning with the government's target of 1.7% by that year. About 74% of this generation in 2030 will come from onshore wind; however, we expect offshore wind\u2019s share to increase in the coming years due to favourable policies. Looking forward, Japan's wind power capacity is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 9%, increasing from 6.3GW in 2025 to 13.7GW by 2034. While challenges such as project delays and financial risks remain, the strategic focus on offshore wind, supported by robust international collaborations and government policies, positions Japan to significantly enhance its renewable energy portfolio.There is a significant upside risk to the wind power sector as the government is targeting 10GW of offshore wind development by 2030. In November 2022, METI announced that it plans to resume offshore wind power auctions in December 2022. With revised rules for offshore wind for operators, METI expects this to encourage more operators to be involved in the development of the market\u2019s offshore wind power sector. METI is aiming to select operators for offshore wind power projects across four newly designated zones, capable of housing about 1GW of offshore wind power capacity. While there are still restrictions on how much one consortium or company can win in an auction (the limit is currently at 1.0GW), hindering the attractiveness of auctions for companies, we believe that the resumption of offshore wind power auctions presents upside risks for the sector. As a result, we have revised up our forecasts for offshore wind power capacity and generation.Location And Cost Hurdles For Onshore Wind, Risks AlleviatingJapan\u2019s wind power strategy envisions robust onshore wind power capacity growth. However, the development of onshore wind is limited by the lack of land close to power demand centres. Suitable land areas for onshore wind are usually less populated and mountainous. These areas usually have high wind speeds but have poor access to the national grid. While transmission and distribution (T&amp;D)\u00a0investments will rise, we expect most of it to focus on integrating existing solar farms, instead of onshore wind farms.The first onshore wind power auction, launched in November 2021, awarded a total of 936.0MW in capacity across 32 bids, out of 1,000MW offered. The range of awarded bids was from JPY14.98/kWh to JPY17.00/kWh. These prices were much higher than that observed in the table above for solar power auctions.The results of the second onshore wind power auction, released on November 4 2022, offered a much-needed lift for the sector with about 1,290MW of the allocated 1,300MW for the auction being awarded. Bid prices were slightly lower than that of the first auction, with the minimum successful bid price being JPY14.80/kWh while the maximum is JPY16.00/kWh.As for the third auction, there was 1,000MW of onshore wind capacity on offer. The auction was oversubscribed, with bids totalling about 1,414MW in capacity. However, there was an underwhelming response for the offshore wind power sector. For the 190MW on offer there was only one plan of 165MW that was eligible, but the company did not submit a bid. We highlight that this seems separate from the 1,800MW auction that the government launched in June 2023 under METI. The same underwhelming response was experienced for the biomass power auction, which saw no bids for 120MW on offer. We believe that onshore wind and solar remain the top renewables types for the short term, which is evidenced by the market\u2019s response to these auctions.Increasing Upside For Nascent Offshore Wind\u00a0Given the challenges for onshore wind, Japan has pivoted to developing the offshore wind sub-sector. The government targets 10GW and 30-45GW offshore wind capacity by 2030 and 2040 respectively. With Japan\u2019s major power demand cities located near coasts, developers can develop offshore wind power farms closer to them. Japan estimates offshore wind power potential over 600GW, supporting their ambitious offshore wind capacity targets for 2030 and 2040.We believe that this focus on offshore wind presents an upside risk to our forecasts. Japan has launched a policy bill for offshore wind, which sets regulations and a framework to boost offshore wind development across 30 locations by 2030. Japan launched its first offshore wind tender in June 2020, for the Goto project near Nagasaki. The government further announced that it will launch auctions for four additional offshore wind sites: Noshiro;\u00a0Yurihonjo\u00a0North; Yurihonjo\u00a0South, in the Akita prefectures; and\u00a0Choshi, in the Tokyo\u00a0Prefecture. In December 2021, the government awarded a consortium consisting of\u00a0Mitsubishi Corporation,\u00a0Mitsubishi Corporation Energy Solutions\u00a0and\u00a0C-Tech Corporation\u00a0as operators for three wind power projects in Akita and Chiba. The wind farm in Chiba will have a capacity of 391.0MW, while the two wind farms in Akita will have 479.0MW and 819.0MW respectively. Venti Japan will join the consortium for the 819MW wind power project. The companies expect the wind farms to come online between September 2028 and December 2030.In June 2023, Japan wrapped up its bidding applications for its second offshore wind auction. The auction offered a total of 1,800MW of offshore wind power capacity across four areas, garnering interest from major companies such as Itochu and Tokyo Gas. In December 2023, METI and MLIT announced that three Japanese consortiums had won bids for projects in Akita, Niigata, and Nagasaki Prefectures. In the Akita Prefecture, a consortium including JERA will build 21 wind turbines with a total capacity of 315MW off the coasts of Oga, Katagami, and Akita Cities. The project is expected to be operational by June 2028 at a bid price of JPY3.0/kWh. In the Niigata Prefecture, a consortium comprising Mitsui, RWE Offshore Japan and Osaka Gas will construct 38 turbines with a total capacity of 684MW, also at JPY3.0/kWh, with operations starting by June 2029. In the Nagasaki Prefecture, Sumitomo Corp. and Tokyo Electric Renewable Power will develop 28 turbines totalling 420MW. The bid price is JPY22.2/kWh, with operations commencing in August 2029. The higher cost is attributed to the hard bedrock in the area.In December 2024, METI and MLIT revealed the outcomes of Japan\u2019s offshore wind 'Round 3' auction. The successful bidders included the Tsugaru Offshore Energy Consortium for the Sea of Japan (South), Aomori project with a capacity of 615MW, and the Yamagata Yuza Offshore Wind LLC for the Yuza, Yamagata project with a capacity of 450MW. Both projects are slated to begin commercial operations by June 2030, offering power at JPY3.0/kWh.\u00a0Our forecasts show that offshore wind power growth will be weighted towards 2027 and beyond, which these recent developments are in line with, considering the time taken to construct and commission offshore wind power projects after companies are awarded project areas.Cost, Scaling And Climate Issues To Weigh On Offshore Wind GrowthDespite the growing momentum for offshore wind in Japan, there is caution in revising forecasts upward due to previous setbacks in the sector. Legislation from 2018 aimed to establish wind energy development zones to address location challenges, particularly opposition from fisheries and shipping industries. This law emphasises selecting bid winners based on price and development plans, with MHI Vestas as a preferred bidder for the 220MW Hibikinada project in 2019. However, we note that offshore wind companies, like Orsted, faced significant financial setbacks in 2023 and 2024 due to rising construction costs, higher interest rates, and supply chain issues since increased generation costs after auction applications could not be reflected in electricity prices.Offshore wind in Japan is currently more costly than other energy sources like solar, partly due to insufficient supply chains and lengthy environmental assessments, which can take up to five years. Additionally, Japan faces unique challenges such as typhoons and tsunamis. With deep waters making fixed-bottom wind projects costly, there is a shift towards floating offshore wind technology, which offers flexibility and higher wind speed access. This has led to ambitious targets of 4.0GW of floating wind by 2030 and 18.0GW by 2050, tapping into deeper waters where 80% of potential sites are over 100m deep.Japan's push for floating wind power also faces challenges due to deep waters, increasing costs for fixed-bottom turbines. While floating wind could offer solutions, it's currently limited to pilot projects, supporting a cautious outlook for growth. The technology needs economies of scale, reduced equipment costs, and expertise development to become commercially viable. Floating wind is costlier than fixed bottom, requiring significant government support, which is limited in Japan. Past experiences with solar and biomass sectors, where initial incentives led to overwhelming capacity and subsequent support reductions, suggest conservative government backing for wind. Japan's focus on reducing electricity costs constrains its ability to offer subsidies akin to those in the solar and biomass sectors.To help curb some of these challenges, in 2024, the Japanese government revised its rules for offshore wind power auctions in response to global sector challenges such as delays and increased costs due to tight supply chains and inflation. After consultations since September 2024, the industry and land ministries have implemented changes, including an electricity price adjustment scheme and higher deposit requirements to manage project delays. Similarly, Japan's well-developed labour market and strategic location could help it lead in floating offshore wind development. This could allow Japanese firms to gain a first-mover advantage in the global wind market, compensating for their late entry into fixed-bottom technology. Over time, developing expertise in floating wind could position Japanese companies competitively in the offshore wind sector globally.                     <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other Non-Hydropower Renewables Forecasts</emphasis>                Structural TrendsJapan remains at a crossroads in its controversial use of burning forest biomass to make electricity. While the government and private sector\u2019s understanding of the fuel\u2019s harmful environmental and climate impacts is growing, biomass power plants long in the pipeline continue to come online, requiring ever-greater volumes of imported wood pellets from primary forests in Canada or plantations in Vietnam.Using forest biomass for electricity generation took off in Japan in 2012, when the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry introduced an FiT with 20-year fixed rates to support renewable energy projects. However, despite push back form forest advocates and environmentalists on the negative climate impacts of using wood pellets for biomass power generation, we highlight that the government\u2019s feed-in tariff scheme, which has been tweaked but not cancelled, continues to incentivise these projects. Over the next decade, we expect biomass capacity to increase from 6.1GW in 2025 to 7.0GW by 2034, with generation remaining relatively constant at 37-39TWh over this period. With operators of existing biomass power plants keeping their plants running in order to pay back construction bank loans, and the government\u2019s, albeit limited, continued support for the power source in an aim to reach its energy transition goals.                     <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electricity Generation And Power Generating Capacity</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Electricity Consumption</emphasis>Japan's long-term electricity demand is projected to grow moderately, driven by a combination of factors that highlight the need for increased capacity and resilience. Our forecasts indicate a modest annual growth rate of approximately 0.6% in electricity consumption, rising from 878.0TWh in 2025 to about 923TWh by 2034. This growth reflects not only the burgeoning need for energy in emerging technologies and sectors, but also the resilience of Japan's industrial demand despite demographic challenges.As a global leader in manufacturing, Japan's industrial sector has historically been the largest consumer of electricity, largely due to its substantial production of automobiles, consumer electronics, and computers. This trend is expected to persist, with manufacturing continuing to dominate energy consumption. However, Japan faces a unique challenge: population decline, and urbanisation trends are set to influence the electricity market significantly. Forecasts indicate a contraction in the urban population by an annual average of -0.50% from 2025 to 2034, with the total population expected to decrease by 0.6%, from approximately 123mn in 2025 to just over 115mn by 2034. This demographic shift could potentially moderate overall electricity demand growth, as fewer people may translate into reduced residential electricity usage.The rise of electric vehicles (EVs) presents a new dimension to electricity demand. Our Autos team projections suggest that EV sales in Japan will increase by about 140% between 2025 and 2034, with an annual average growth rate of 17%, reaching about 10% of total vehicle sales by the end of the decade. This surge is expected to drive a considerable increase in electricity consumption, as the transport sector transitions from fossil fuels to electric power.The market\u2019s recent power supply challenges, exacerbated by the increase in early 2025 due to colder temperatures, have also underscored the urgency of expanding reserve margins to ensure grid stability. Additionally, the rapid expansion of AI and data centre operations, is set to further boost electricity consumption over the next decade. However, this rising demand will be tempered by advancements in energy efficiency and substantial investments in modernising the grid. Enhanced transmission infrastructure and smart grid technologies are expected to optimise energy use, partially offsetting the overall increase in consumption and helping Japan transition to a more sustainable and reliable power system.\u00a0In line with this, Japan's 10 regional utility companies and the government are accelerating the development of smart metres to help consumers monitor and moderate consumption. Smart meters facilitate two-way communication between consumers and generators, allowing consumers to monitor consumption and electricity prices at set time intervals. This keeps households aware of their power consumption and encourages them to reduce bills by reducing or shifting consumption from peak periods to off-peak periods.As retail electricity prices increase, we believe that residential, commercial and industrial\u00a0consumers will develop on-site solar capacity and shift towards self-generation. Consumers can also supply surplus generation back into the grid, reducing their reliance on retail electricity. This will likely result in a drop in on-grid power consumption.\u00a0                  Total Power Generation And Consumption To Stagnate Over The Coming 10 Years     Japan - Total Power Generation &amp; Net Power Consumption, TWh (2000-2034)      <nitf:media nitf:media-type=\"pdf\"><nitf:media-reference><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"215\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"47764\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></nitf:media-reference></nitf:media>                    e/f = BMI estimate/forecast.

This is lower than larger and more mature markets, reflecting the market\u2019s strong capability to curb losses, mainly through technological developments and the location of power plants near demand centres. Distribution losses in Japan are among the lowest in developed markets, comparable with other densely populated, often smaller markets.The 10 main utility companies, which own and operate all high-voltage transmission lines, were historically required to maintain self-sufficiency in each of their respective localities. This meant that interconnections between the 10 supply areas were weak and mainly intended for operational system security purposes. This acted as a barrier to entry for independent power producers as they were unable to secure grid connections and faced high grid charges. In 2015, the government established OCCTO, an independent institution to oversee an efficient T&amp;D network across Japan, which fully deregulated the retail sector in April 2016. The government also laid out the 2013 Energy Reform Plan, which required companies to split their T&amp;D operations from the electricity generation and retail businesses.Japan\u2019s national grid remains isolated from other markets due to geographical constraints. There is also no construction of cross-border power lines planned to connect the market to regional peers.Grid Expansion Limited, Upgrades To Existing Infrastructure Under WayJapan's transmission system is divided into the northern system, with 50Hz, and the southern system, with 60Hz. The two frequency areas are currently interconnected with three frequency converters. Overall, Japan's transmission system consists of 14,100km of 500kV\u00a0transmission lines, 16,000km of 275kV cable, 11,000km of lines capable of transmitting 187-220kV and more than 30,000km of 110-154kV lines. There is around 95,000km of cabling capable of carrying 77kV or lower amounts. We expect limited growth in the transmission system, as Japan has a subdued growth in electricity demand and the current grid coverage extends to all major power demand centres.We expect the government to upgrade the power grid\u00a0to a next-generation T&amp;D network. This will deal with structural issues, such as a decline in power demand from changing population demographics, cross-regional electricity trading, the integration of intermittent renewable power sources, the expansion of distributed energy resources and environmental changes. Tokyo Electric Power has announced plans to invest JPY470bn (USD3.25bn) by financial year 2027 to expand its power grid to meet growing electricity demand for AI data centres. The Japanese utility giant also plans to triple its investment in power grid infrastructure in the next five years.Government support to strengthen Japan\u2019s grid resilience was further reaffirmed recently after a series of natural disasters.\u00a0Following Typhoon Hagibis and Typhoon Faxai, which damaged power grids and caused major power outages, the government plans to encourage investment in storage systems. The government believes that this will be a key demand response technology. METI plans to spend JPY7.5bn (USD68.0mn) to promote such purchases, while the Ministry of Environment plans to create a financial aid programme, which will assist in independent community-based systems that will incorporate renewable energy, storage systems and transmission grids.

Three matches at the 2019 Rugby World Cup were cancelled and Scotland\u2019s final group match against the hosts in Yokohama was under threat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even at breakfast on the morning of the game most of us were still unsure as to whether it would go ahead. Even more uncertain were the arrangements if the game was called off; could it be played the following day, or would it be cancelled and the points shared?</p><p>I had no real appreciation what the typhoon would be like. I remember in the evening stepping outside our hotel situated in the middle of Yokohama, a long way away from where the full force was felt, and thinking it like a storm on the west coast of Scotland. I went back inside and into a lift with our forwards coach Danny Wilson and Stuart Yule, our head strength and conditioner, and all of a sudden the lift went black and dropped around five to 10 metres! We were about 40 stories up in a huge skyscraper and it was terrifying. We got out of the lift and the whole building was swaying and you could hear it creaking and shrieking. I know now that all those skyscrapers are built to move in hurricanes and typhoons but it was a very strange sensation.</p><p>Despite it all, I actually slept like a baby that night, very unusual before a Test match!</p><p>The game got the green light to go ahead and as we made our way to the stadium you couldn\u2019t tell that there had been a typhoon.</p><p>They had begun clearing up the damage at about 2am and by the time we\u2019d woken up all the routes to the ground and the stadium itself had been cleared.</p><p>Every single fan with a ticket was able to go. It was an unbelievable achievement to get the game on in a packed stadium, a monumental effort and testament to the organisers and the Japanese people.</p><p>It was a match-day I will never forget, starting with the anthems.</p><p>The Japanese anthem is very solemn and there were around 70,000 people singing it. It was a very strange and humbling experience because of what had happened in the previous 24 hours.</p><p>The game itself was played at a ferocious pace. We knew we needed a bonus-point win and in the first half we made a couple of mistakes and Japan capitalised and all of a sudden, we\u2019re going in at half-time chasing the game.</p><p>The tempo Japan created in their phase play was incredible but that was how they been playing throughout the tournament. Leading-up to that World Cup the Japanese players had been in camp for something like nine out of the previous 12 months. They were an incredible rugby team but they were also one of the best prepared. Their skill-set was brilliant, their pace was brilliant and the way they pushed the boundaries was brilliant.</p><p>Their angles clearing out rucks were questionable and at times they just came straight in at the side but they were clever about it, always removing opposition players and clearing through to create quick ball.</p><p>I remember vividly the noise in the last ten minutes. I\u2019d been replaced by Stuart McInally and it had become obvious to the whole stadium that Japan were going to win and go through to the quarter-finals. The sound was like nothing I\u2019ve ever heard before in a stadium. It was incredible.</p><p>READ MORE: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/ab-zondagh-thinks-scotland-can-crack-the-da-vinci-code-as-new-coach-gives-backing-to-finn-russell-3458992\">AB Zondagh thinks Scotland can \u2018crack the Da Vinci code\u2019 as new coach gives backing to Finn Russell</url></p><p>Japan won 28-21 and it felt strange after the game. I didn\u2019t think we\u2019d played poorly. There were some bad mistakes, some bad defensive errors but we scored some good tries, particularly in the second half. There was the obvious disappointment not just for the loss to Japan but for the entire tournament, we had massively underperformed and underachieved.</p><p>For some guys in that team, they probably knew that was the end of the road for their Scotland careers, whether through retirement or not hitting the heights at the tournament.</p><p>Scotland and Japan meet again on Saturday at BT Murrayfield and they are two very different teams to where they were in 2019.</p><p>Covid has disrupted Japan\u2019s ability to build on their World Cup success and that is a real shame.

Domestic demand fell in the quarter at an annual pace of 8 per cent, with cars, household appliances, and winter items saw lower demand.</p><p>It was the biggest fall in quarterly economic output since 2014, when Japan underwent a 7.4 per cent contraction in GDP soon after Abe's administration also raised the sales tax. Private consumption dropped by 18 per cent.</p><p>This time around, the government introduced numerous exemptions to try and stave off any major economic damage, such as a $120billion stimulus package in December and tax breaks on new car and home purchases. </p><p>Business investment also fell during the quarter due to weak construction spending while imports and exports fell. </p><p>The Rugby World Cup hosted in Japan was predicted to give a $4billion boost to the economy, according to accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis brought enormous disruption to the country though, with insurer Aon estimating that the disaster caused around $15billion worth of damages. </p><p>Economists are now expecting the coronavirus outbreak to push the country into a recession, as the number of tourists from China dries up and businesses shut down production at factories. </p><p>Taro Saito, Executive research fellow at NLI Research Institute, said: 'There's a pretty good chance the economy will suffer another contraction in January-March. </p><p>'The virus will mainly hit inbound tourism and exports, but could also weigh on domestic consumption quite a lot.'</p><p>Chinese tourism to Japan has quadrupled in the last five years to over 9.5 million and equals about a third of all foreign visitors to the Land of Cherry Blossoms.</p><p>But about 400,000 Chinese tourists are expected to cancel their holidays to the 'Land of Cherry Blossoms' by the end of March according to the Japanese Association of Travel Agents.</p><p>Worries over the illness have escalated to such an extent that public birthday celebrations for Emperor Naruhito have been cancelled, while the Tokyo Marathon, due to take place on March 1, has been limited to a few hundred participants.</p><p>The 'Big Three' car companies Toyota, Nissan, and Honda have all shut down production at its Chinese car plants due to the Covid-19 epidemic, while Nissan has also been harmed by declining sales. </p><p>Kerstin Braun, president of financial services firm Stenn Group writes that the economic shrinkage 'is a worrying sign if you are looking for an indicator of the health of the global economy. </p><p>She added: 'Japan boasts the third largest economy in the world, so if it contracts again in the next quarter they will be staring down the barrel of a recession. </p><p>Given the impact the coronavirus has had on the global economy, it is hard to see this being avoided.' </p><p>Tokyo is set to host the Olympic Games in July and August, which the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has insisted will go ahead.</p><p>But Taro Saito says: 'If this epidemic is not contained by the time of the Tokyo Olympic Games, the damage to the economy will be huge.' </p><p>Shares on the Nikkei 225 Index fell by 0.7 per cent to 23,523. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-60347510</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7B-H9G1-F021-61N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"670\"/><timeReceived>11:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

Although they have a low probability of occurring, extreme weather events undermine the reliability and resilience of energy systems,. Moreover, the severity of climate-induced extreme events is projected to continue to increase, \u2013. The growing integration of weather-dependent renewable energy sources, coupled with the increasing electrification of various energy sectors, exacerbating challenges related to the security and resilience of modern energy supply, \u2013.</p><p>Adverse effects of extreme weather events on centralized power grids, include widespread damage to power generation, transmission, and distribution components, causing widespread power outages,. From an overall structural perspective, power systems are designed to meet energy demand by deploying long-duration energy storage systems, resilience upgrades, and enhancement of transmission networks,. Those common approaches often require high investment costs. In the absence of a comprehensive understanding of mitigation preparation for outage risks associated with extreme events, utility regulators or policymakers can only hope that the next occurrence will not lead to sudden and severe impacts on the power supply. As society transitions ever more toward widespread electrification, long-duration power outages will have further-reaching consequences, including substantial economic losses, and threats to human safety and health,. Assessing and planning for energy resilience in the face of extreme events is receiving increasing attention from researchers and policy makers,. Outages must be understood accurately and deeply to combat their effects. Yet accurate characterization of the dynamic of outages during extreme events is scarce partly because datasets of real-world outages are difficult to obtain.</p><p>The integration of distributed energy resources and rapid electrification is transforming the conventional power transmission architecture. To mitigate the extended power outage, previous works verify that collaborations between policymakers, power utilities, and distributed energy prosumers are alternative approaches to cope with the impacts of power outages under extreme weather conditions,. Active distribution energy network offers increased opportunities to reduce the impact of widespread power outages and enhance energy resilience by transitioning from a centralized to a decentralized energy supply paradigm,. For example, deploying distributed energy generators is widely regarded as one of the effective approaches to reduce the need for costly upgrades and helps alleviate peak load,. Adoptions of distributed electricity generation and storage systems can provide localized power supply during public grid disruptions, and enable an opportunity to secure critical energy demand, \u2013. Rapid building electrification drives the evolution of residential energy systems, accelerating investments in electrical heat pump and battery systems,. It is worth noting that building electrification with distributed energy resources can also change the amount and pattern of time-series electricity demand, consequently impacting energy resilience. The increasing adoption of plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) and the construction of charging infrastructures are closely interconnected with the power and building sectors, providing an opportunity for bio-directional power exchange. Previous studies and surveys have confirmed that residential customers demonstrate a willingness to pay additional costs to enhance their energy, \u2013. This knowledge gap still exists, although many studies have explored the energy resilience of building energy systems, they primarily rely on simulation work that focuses on either the supply or demand side. This is partly due to the scarcity of high-resolution data on real-world grid operations and consumer demand patterns. The implications of growing building electrification on energy resilience, as well as the ability and effectiveness of various demand-side solutions to enhance this resilience, are not well understood. Furthermore, the power generation ability of distributed generation is constrained, necessitating the prioritization of critical electricity-dependent demands over regular operational management during prolonged outage events. However, limited research has been conducted to effectively ensure the provision of critical demand energy services during the recovery process following extreme event outages. Results can inform strategies for enhancing infrastructure resilience and provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of demand-side solutions.</p><p>Part I of this work, we investigate public grid power outages caused by typhoon events from 2018 to 2022. In Part II examines how to manage distributed energy resources to minimize the impacts of severe power outages have on residential consumers.</p><p>Results</p><p>Characterization of supply-side power outage conditions</p><p>Part I of this study investigated the effects of typhoon events on four regional electrical systems in Japan from 2018 to 2022. The disruption conditions in public power grids were reported by the affected electrical companies. Figure\u00a01a shows the geographical regions of the power grid studies and the typhoon occurrences from 2018 to 2022. Figure\u00a01b illustrates common physical damages observed in distribution and transmission networks resulting from typhoon events, including electric pole toppling, circuit disconnection, and power tower failures.</p><p>Examined typhoon events that trigger widespread power outages.</p><p>Map of the typhoon path (a) and physically damages caused by severe typhoon events (b).</p><p>This study selected six typhoon events based on their wind velocities exceeding 40 m/s and the widespread power outages they caused, supported by reported recovery data. Table\u00a0 provides detailed information on these typhoon events and induced power outage events affecting four electrical companies. Typhoons are numbered according to the order in which they occur each year. According to the Japanese Meteorological Agency, there was a high frequency of landed typhoons in September and October reported severe power outages concentrated in this period. Table\u00a0 provides a summary of component failures caused by typhoon events based on company reports. A large portion of the damage are in power distribution infrastructures, similar to previous works,,.</p><p>Information summary of surveyed regional outages triggered by typhoons</p><p><table><tgroup

Here, we characterize utility-scale power outages using publicly available data, Fig.\u00a0 illustrates 2-week grid electricity loads (blue lines) and regional solar PV generation (yellow lines) at 60-min interval before, during and after typhoon events. The red dot denotes the specific grid load at the time the greatest number of customers lost power. The effect of widespread power outages on the grid load during typhoon events is particularly evident for the Chubu (Typhoon Nos. 24 and 19) and Kyushu (Typhoon Nos. 10 and 14) grids, where there was a substantial reduction in grid power supply. While typhoons are typically accompanied by heavy rainfall, which can lead to a decline in solar PV generation, it is important to note that the extent of this decline can vary depending on the specific location and timing of the typhoon. In the Tokyo grid, solar PV systems may still generate power during certain periods of the typhoon, resulting in less impact on generation profiles.</p><p>Hourly grid load and solar PV generation profiles before and after typhoon events.</p><p>Blue line refers to grid load, yellow line is PV generation, color band presents 48 h period that experiences typhoon events (from reported typhoon increased outage).</p><p>Figure\u00a0 depicts the initiation and restoration of power disruptions caused by typhoon events, y-axis presents the number of customers experiencing outages. The dataset used for this analysis was sourced from regional Power Companies\u2019 websites and reports. The x-axis begins at the moment the typhoon starts affecting the power grid. Initially, the number of customers experiencing outages rises sharply, reaching a peak that represents the maximum impact of the typhoon. After this peak, the number of affected customers gradually decreases as power restoration efforts proceed, eventually returning to normal levels once all services are fully reinstated. The scenarios analyzed for the Chubu (Typhoon Nos. 24 and 19) and Kyushu (Typhoon Nos. 10 and 14) grids indicate that higher maximum wind velocities are associated with longer recovery durations. However, the increased number of affected customers does not appear to impact recovery durations, in consist with previous work. A comprehensive comparison of those scenarios shows that the severity and recovery duration of outage events present regional variations, which could come from regional intrinsic resilience characteristics and the varying number of customers at the grid edge. As shown in Table\u00a0, the main cause of power outages is distribution network disruption. The service areas of the Kansai and Tokyo grids are 28,704 and 39,575 km\u00b2, respectively. The population densities in these regions are approximately 700 people per km\u00b2 and 1100 people per km\u00b2. The Tokyo grid\u2019s recovery process exhibits a long tail characteristic, likely due to its larger service area and higher population density, which can complicate logistics and resource allocation during recovery efforts. Figure\u00a0 shows the restoration pattern of each power outage for the maximum number of customers affected. The dots present the normalized raw data (reported number of customers affected by peak power outage number), and the yellow curves illustrate the recovery process. The widespread power outages affect customers across a wide geographical area, the primary cause of these outages, as demonstrated in Table\u00a0 attributed to infrastructure failures in distribution lines. Therefore, identifying failures is time-consuming, repairing damage to the transmission network over long distances typically takes longer time compared to shorter distances.</p><p>Changes in the number of customers lacking electricity, beginning with the initial outage increase triggered by the typhoon.</p><p>Recovery process for regional power outages.</p><p>Circle dots present normalized raw data; yellow lines show regression results; pentagram dots present 24 h; and diamond dots show results after 48 h.</p><p>The recovery processes among regional power grids follow exponential decay dynamics. The regression results indicate that, on average, percentages of affected customers after peak power outages decrease to 38.5% and 16.3% after 24 and 48 h, respectively.</p><p>Harding measures, such as undergrounding distribution lines and upgrading poles can make centralized grids less susceptible to extreme weather events. However, hardening the system is usually costly. The decentralized energy system, characterized by high spatiotemporal flexibility and rapid response capability, offers an opportunity for reliable power flow implementation and management. This, in turn, enhances the security of energy supply.</p><p>Securing long-duration home energy self-energy supply</p><p>People tend to spend more time at home during extreme weather periods, and losing power for extended periods can create potential safety risks. As the penetration of distributed energy generators, EV cars, and smart meters increases, managing on-site energy generators and integrating electric vehicles (EV) in Vehicle-to-Building mode presents an opportunity to mitigate home power outages,. Figure\u00a0 depicts representative distributed power resources (home battery storage, bidirectional EV, and fuel cell) in Japan\u2019s house. The micro combined heat and power (CHP) systems can deliver power and hot water even given power failures in the centralized power network, thereby guaranteeing critical energy services at minimal levels. Installation of a battery storage system gives homeowners independent control over their energy usage.</p><p>Representative distributed energy resources.</p><p>EV electric vehicle, home battery, rooftop PV, micro fuel cell (combined heating and power CHP), and heat pump systems, and detailed electricity loads in residential houses.</p><p>Rapid building electrification is accelerating investments in electrical heat pump and battery systems. We assess the performances of demand-side resources to meet home electricity demand given the increase in building electrification in Japan. In Japan\u2019s current market, the storage capacity of home battery systems generally ranges from 4.0 to 15.0 kWh,. The power generating capacity of fuel cells, which are used widely as cogeneration systems in Japanese residential houses, is 0.70 kW, power consumption of electrical heat pump water heater is about 1.0 kW at nominal generating capacity,. If local backup generators are installed to ensure uninterrupted energy services during prolonged power outages, a substantial capacity of on-site generators or power storage units would be necessary. Although EV storage capacities range from 20 to 80 kWh, the actual electricity available depends on the state of charge of the battery storage system. Therefore, it needs to consider power availability constraints and priorities of the critical electricity demands under extended power outage events.</p><p>At present, the average annual household electricity consumption shares roughly 50% of the total energy demand within the Japanese residential sector. The intensity and pattern of household energy load profile depend on the number of appliances in use and occupants\u2019 energy consumption behavior. Moreover, hot water shares a large proportion of home energy usage, electrifying hot water would increase home electricity demand. This work distinguishes home energy loads by hot water resources, including electrical heat pumps and fuel cell systems. To ensure the representativeness of the examined households, a careful selection process was employed. We randomly collected half-hourly measurements of single-family electricity loads of two groups characterized by different hot water resources (electrical heat pump and micro fuel cell system) throughout September. Figure\u00a0 shows the daily electricity load profiles of the two groups; both exhibit similar normal distributions. The average daily electricity loads of Group 1 and Group 2 are 17.0 and 14.6 kWh, respectively. As described in Fig.\u00a0, electrifying domestic hot water increases daily electricity consumption and results in an obvious peak load during early morning. Additionally, we specifically measured the load profiles of critical lighting and refrigeration appliances at 30-min intervals. We chose those end uses because power disruptions that interfere with the functioning of refrigerators can result in food or medication insecurity. While room lighting systems play a crucial role in ensuring residents\u2019 safety (national survey results show that lighting is the top function residents want during natural disasters). As shown in Fig.\u00a06e, the power consumption of the refrigerator exhibits relative stability, while the lighting power consumption profile displays variability with prominent peak periods during the early morning and night as shown in Fig.\u00a06d. The average daily power consumption for home lighting and refrigeration is 2.95 and 2.17 kWh, respectively, which closely aligns with the reported dataset.</p><p>Distributions of measured daily electricity loads for representative single-family homes.</p><p>a Group 1: Electrical heat pump supplies hot water (136 families), Group 2: Fuel cell meets hot water needs (131 families). b load profile for Group 1, c load profile for Group 2, d critical home lighting, and e refrigerator electricity demand, red dashed lines, and shaded band indicate standard deviations of average load at various times, respectively.</p><p>This study assesses energy resilience through the self-load cover ratio index, defined as the ratio of on-site generation to energy demand during power outages. By analyzing measured daily electricity loads from representative households, we constructed distributions of these ratios for various on-site technologies across outage durations of 24 and 48 h (see Fig.\u00a0). On-site available energy can fully sustain energy demand when the self-generated energy to load ratio is over 1.0. As electrification increases, there are greater challenges in sustaining the home electricity load solely through an on-site battery storage system, it even becomes difficult to fully cover critical loads under prolonged outage events. In high-electrified homes, we investigate the energy self-sustaining scenario with power from bidirectional EV and home storage systems, Fig.\u00a0 depict the self-load covering scenarios under different available electricity from bidirectional EV and home battery systems during 24 and 48 h home outages, respectively. It is important to recognize that battery storage systems may not be capable of providing or sustaining power for all private energy needs due to limited energy capacity, 10.0 kWh electricity from on-site storage systems can only sustain critical loads when experiencing a prolonged power blackout. Therefore, priority selection of home appliances is important to sustain critical loads.</p><p>Distributions of ratios of on-site electricity generation to demand using various technologies.</p><p>(a) and (b) are under 24-h outage duration, (c) and (d) are under 48-h outage duration.</p><p>Figure\u00a0 display the self-generating scenarios using on-site fuel cells and different home battery systems. Uptake of distributed fuel cell system effectively increases self-energy sufficiency, the combination of home battery and fuel cell systems offers a reliable ability to sustain critical electricity demands under prolonged outage conditions. According to measured results, implementations of fuel cell cogeneration systems smooth the electricity load. A fuel cell operating at nominal power capacity can meet critical lighting and refrigerator load, while also meeting hot water demand. However, it may fail to meet the entire peak electricity load, however, requiring a battery storage system or load restoration.</p><p>Although integrating rooftop solar panels can promote energy self-sufficiency, the heavy rainfall that accompanies typhoons leads to intermittent PV generation, which is insufficient to reliably cover daily energy demand. Consequently, a standalone PV system cannot meet critical household energy loads throughout the day. Therefore, energy cover ratios of PV standalone and hybrid PV and battery systems are also examined. Two types of residential loads, as described in Fig.\u00a0, are examined. The energy load cover ratios of standalone PV and hybrid PV-battery systems in maximum power outage days are presented in Table\u00a0. The hourly generation profiles of a 5.0 kWp rooftop PV system over two days (the day before and the day of the typhoon event) were computed by scaling the monitored PV load profiles (illustrated in Fig.\u00a0) according to solar PV capacity connected to the power grid (reported in Table\u00a0). PV capacity is determined based on limited rooftop areas and previous survey work. Detail simulation process is described in the \u201cMethods\u201d section, results indicate that standalone PV systems are unreliable for meeting home energy demand during typhoon events. Incorporating battery storage effectively increases the load cover ratio, providing increased opportunity to meet critical energy demand. Case studies have shown that 5.0 kWp battery storage systems can increase the load coverage ratio by 25\u201350% in certain disruption scenarios. This improvement enhances the reliability of the lighting and refrigeration energy supply (as illustrated in Fig.\u00a0), ~30% of daily electricity consumption. However, fully meeting the total electricity demand remains challenging when PV generation significantly decreases.</p><p>Comparison of energy cover ratios of different energy systems</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\" morerows=\"1\">Typhoon event</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col4\" namest=\"col2\">Load Type 1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\" nameend=\"col7\" namest=\"col5\">Load Type 2</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col2\">PV alone</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">PV + 5.0 kWh battery</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">PV + 10.0 kWh battery</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">PV alone</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">PV + 5.0 kWh battery</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">PV + 10.0 kWh battery</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No. 21</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.209</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.477</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.715</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.236</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.556</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.834</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No. 24</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.314</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.817</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.415</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.931</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">1.00</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No. 15</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.309</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.812</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.416</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.943</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">1.00</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No. 19</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.318</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.821</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1.00</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.420</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.927</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">1.00</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No. 10</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.238</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.482</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.720</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.286</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.564</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.843</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">No. 14</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.240</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.496</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.734</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.305</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.584</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.863</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Discussion</p><p>Typhoons although infrequent, damage centralized energy supply systems, often resulting in widespread power outages. Prolonged power disruption may expose many residents to darkness, leading to economic loss and even threatening occupants\u2019 health. It is the increase in the intensity of extreme events more than the frequency that causes increasing severe disruption in systems,. Using data collected from four power companies, this study characterizes widespread power outage events. The analysis results also reveal that the utility grid load is greatly impacted during power outages, and the restoration of service follows a consistent exponential pattern. The extended recovery process is primarily attributed to the extensive damage sustained by the distribution infrastructure across a wide geographical area. Given this, it is crucial to implement demand-side solutions to mitigate the impacts of extended power outages.</p><p>The increasing integration of environment-dependent renewable energy sources, as well as rapid electrification, highlights the need for strengthening the energy resiliency of power supply. Grid utilities must prioritize boosting electric system resilience at a reasonable cost, it should be noted that solely focusing on improving energy resilience from a top-down perspective can create a financial burden. Demand-side solutions have the potential to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the overall energy system at a relatively low cost,. To address this challenge, the present study explored the effectiveness of demand-side solutions in mitigating the risk of power outages in residential settings. By analyzing actual household energy consumption data, it became evident that relying solely on batteries may be insufficient to achieve high levels of energy self-sufficiency during prolonged outage events. Moreover, increasing battery storage capacity poses a financial burden on customers, and the issue of low annual utilization rates needs to be addressed, prioritizing critical energy services is crucial for occupant safety and health under prolonged outages. Demand options, such as deploying microgrids and energy electrification, emerge as promising approaches to mitigate carbon emission. The electrification of households contributes to increased electricity demand, which in turn impacts the resilience of home energy systems. Therefore, striking a balance between electrification and resiliency is crucial. This balance can be achieved by adopting a diversified mix of distributed energy resources, ensuring a reliable and sustainable energy supply while reducing carbon emissions. Energy resilience can be enhanced by investing in distributed energy resources, levelized costs of electricity for solar PV, home battery storage, and electric vehicles vary by region and electricity market. Their estimated values are as follows: electric vehicles at 0.30 $/kWh,, solar PV systems at 0.05 $/kWh, and home battery storage at 0.25$/kWh. The levelized costs for rooftop PV systems are lower than market electricity prices. The levelized costs for micro-CHP units are based on several factors, including generator lifespan, efficiency, installed capacity, and fuel cost. The estimated levelized costs for home fuel cell and diesel generators are 0.25 $/kWh and 0.40 $/kWh, respectively. Electrical vehicles can serve dual purposes but involve higher costs due to vehicle prices and battery capacities. While micro-CHP technologies are commonly used for backup power, they have higher operating costs and environmental impacts, fuel availability may be constrained during extreme events. Integrating PV systems with home battery storage enhances reliability in meeting critical household energy demands during prolonged outage periods. Customers need to consider techno-economic performances of these solutions carefully to make informed investment decisions that increase home energy security.</p><p>There are indeed regional differences in household electricity use per day, and these differences are influenced by factors such as the number of electrical appliances, the electrification rate, and home income. According to IEA reported data, daily household electricity consumption in the United States is 28 kWh, Japan is 13 kWh, Germany is 8.6 kWh, China is 6.0 kWh, and India is 2.8 kWh. The difference would substantially affect the ability of demand-side solutions to sustain self-energy supply under extended power outage conditions. In rich countries, the role of demand resources in reducing the risks associated with extended outages can be enhanced by identifying and prioritizing energy loads. In developing regions, affordability can be a barrier for households to access on-site power generation technologies, and the implementation of subsidy programs can enhance their economic viability and social energy equality. In terms of the varying energy consumption levels among residential consumers, promoting shared energy solutions in microgrids can help overcome affordability barriers of on-site power generation and storage technologies,.</p><p>This study can serve as a valuable reference for enhancing home energy security during extended power outages in the Japanese public grid. However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations associated with the selection of a specific regional grid and residential customers in Japan. Daily household electricity demand may vary significantly driven by seasonal space heating and cooling loads. Future research endeavors should focus on investigating the energy resilience of home energy systems in light of the rising occurrence of heat waves and cold snap events.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Grid utility and customer dataset</p><p>Detailed information regarding each power outage includes the number of customers affected at specific times and the identified component failures, which were sourced from publicly available websites published by four electricity companies in Japan. The hourly grid supply load and PV generation data from publicly available websites published by the Japanese Renewable Institute. Detailed demand-side electricity loads were collected from behind-meter via smart home energy management systems.</p><p>Characterization of power outage recovery process</p><p>This work employs the exponential decay model to fit normalized outage data for each outage event. This model is widely adopted to analyze the recovery process of extreme weather events,, described in the following equation.</p><p>In the above equation, p1 is positive and p2 is negative, x denotes duration in hours and y is the ratio of customer affected to peak value depicted in Fig.\u00a0. The nonlinear exponential decay function can be modeled as linear ones by a log transform, resulting in the following equation:</p><p>This transformed linear model presented in Eq. () can be fitted using ordinary linear least squares.</p><p>To analyze energy resilience performances of demand-side mitigation solutions, the self-power cover ratio is electricity demand divided by total available electricity.</p><p>Load cover ratio of hybrid home PV and battery systems</p><p>To simulate the load cover ratio, this work modeled the interaction among PV generation, residential electricity demand, and battery storage capacity under specific constraints. PV generation was prioritized to meet immediate electricity demand. We assumed that the home battery started at 90% of its total storage capacity, charging, and discharging efficiency were 90%, respectively. When PV output was insufficient, the battery discharged energy up to the lesser of the remaining demand or the maximum allowable discharge rate. Any excess PV generation, after fulfilling the demand, was used to charge the battery, ensuring that charging did not exceed predefined safety limits. The energy cover ratio was calculated as the total electricity demand met during the outage period divided by the total electricity demand during that period. The energy cover ratio was calculated using the following equation:where, Cover_loadi represents the electricity demand met by on-site PV generation and home battery discharging flows at hour i, Demand_loadi is the hourly residential electricity load at hour i, N denotes the length of the simulation period in hours.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (52308098) and the Hong Kong Scholarship (XJ20220028).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNCOMM-s43247025021262</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNCOMM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F64-YK03-RS47-700P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">483344</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Author(s) All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Communications Earth &amp;

As a 25-man squad gathered in Oxford for a three-day training camp, George insisted that their focus had not been affected by the events surrounding coronavirus. </p><p>\"I've learnt in professional sport that you can't listen to rumours about anything,\" said George. \"There is obviously a serious issue going on but we don't know what is going to happen so all we can do is make sure that we prepare as well as we can do. We can take a huge amount of confidence from the way we dealt with Typhoon Hagibis. Within an hour or two we were on a plane to Miyazaki and had a brilliant training camp down there that set us up nicely for a quarter-final and semi-final. It's a tough situation but one that is out of our control. Eddie (Jones) speaks about it a lot, focusing on what we can control.\"</p><p>There were echoes of England's latter-stage World Cup form in their muscular dismissal of Ireland's challenge at Twickenham, a certainty in their approach play that had been missing in their opening matches against France and Scotland. The only blot on a fine afternoon's work was the fact that, for all their dominance, England failed to secure a winning bonus point, although George believes that any deficiency in try-scoring will only serve to fuel their preparation.</p><p>\"The Ireland game was a lot more like us,\" said George. \"It was more a performance that we could be proud of. There were some areas not great, though, in the second half when we fell off a bit but there was much more of a feeling round the team that it was pretty similar to the feeling we had towards the end of the knockout stages in Japan and that's exciting. And it's exciting also that we didn't quite crack it against Ireland so there is still a lot to work on. The way everyone prepared for Ireland, their mental as well as physical approach, had a different feel to it and that was infectious.</p><p>\"You saw that in the way that we came out of the blocks. We've spoken about preparation going into a test match quite a lot. We're putting more emphasis on it. I hadn't really thought about it too much until pre-Japan about how much impact you can have on other people. Owen (Farrell) talks about it quite a lot-your body language, the way you talk, how you talk, even to how you walk off the bus. All these things matter. You can take a huge amount of confidence from it all, looking at people across the room thinking they are in a pretty good place and you want to be there too.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Bath back-three player, Anthony Watson and Sale back-rower, Mark Wilson, have been added to the squad. Exeter Chiefs' hooker, Luke Cowan-Dickie, has been given time at home for family reasons. Saracens' back-row forward Ben Earl, who won his first caps against Scotland and Ireland, has not been included, while Exeter prop Harry Williams has been preferred to Bath's Will Stuart.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-60618347</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y99-8T71-JCJY-G0JP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"629\"/><timeReceived>10:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was the first time that Italy had won a World Cup match having been behind at the break and the former Quin believes it underlies his side's maturity. </p><p>The Azzurri play the All Blacks in Lyon on Friday before rounding off their pool campaign against the hosts. </p><p>\"Let's hope there are no typhoons in France,\" joked Allan after the Uruguay win. \"A lot of Italian teams back in the day might have crumbled after that first half, but we just believed we could go out there in the second and put on a show, which is what we did. </p><p>\"We didn't play our usual rugby, we went a bit more direct. But it gives us a lot of confidence that we use both styles of play. </p><p>\"I had no idea that we hadn't won a match before having been behind at half-time. It's great.

That's three former club skippers right there taking their leave parading the Premiership trophy in front of 82,000 fans. </p><p>Such celestial synchronicity is rare. The great Sergio Parisse's final Italy game was meant to be the pool match with New Zealand in 2019 before Typhoon Hagibis intervened while George North dreamt of concluding his 121-match Test career for Wales with a win over Italy at the Principality in March. Instead, Wales slipped to defeat and he ruptured his Achilles in the final moments.</p><p>Owen Farrell and the Vunipola brothers fully intended to bring down the curtain on their remarkable Saracens careersers with a final Twickenham appearance of their own yesterday, but Northampton had different ideas and whipped the rug from under their feetet in that epic semi-final the other week. </p><p>That's the cruel beauty of sport and for long periods yesterday it seemedemed Lady Luck might be at her most capricious. Northampton dodged a bullet against a pumped-up Bath who did superbly well to adapt and adjust after the early sending off of Beno Obano.</p><p>We have seen enough fine performances and wins by teams reduced to 14 by an early dismissal to know that there is always hope in such situations, but in a huge showpiece final against such a free-running team as Saints who can cut you in pieces on their day, it was a mighty effort, and our illustrious trio will acknowledge that. </p><p>They will also highlight, though, the growing maturity of their younger colleagues which did eventually see Saints pull through and suggest that their departures are in fact very well timed. Northampton are in very good hands, the future as well the present is bright. </p><p>All three rolled their sleeves up as usual but it was a tricky afternoon. Although good at the lineout and busy at the breakdown, Lawes did not produce one of his stellar bone-crushing, try-saving performances. Waller endured a tough afternoon at scrum time but typically kept going manfully and Ludlam offered timely heft and experience off the bench but on a testing afternoon it was others who stepped up</p><p>George Furbank has been nigh on immaculate all season and continued in that vein against Bath. To these eyes he is the key figure going forward for Saints, the rallying point and fulcrum. Yesterday, he made a brilliant try for Tommy Freeman and slipped effortlessly into the fly-half slot when Fin Smith was forced off at a moment when Saints were struggling. He keeps smiling and always looks calm and these things count in a team like Northampton who are prepared to live on the edge. </p><p>Freeman is another. Unbelievably good in the air, big tackles when required and classy tries. Both are proper England players now and will have to juggle those dual responsibilities, but both are well up to the task. </p><p>Alex Mitchell also comes into that category as well. Mitchell experienced a testing, occasionally torrid, afternoon. Ben Spencer in particular and Bath in general had clearly targeted him and were determined to make life a living hell for the attack-minded scrum-half. </p><p>They definitely rattled Mitchell, who made a few poor choices and headlessly ran a tapped penalty that needed slotting over. But who was it running that clever cheat line to connect with George Hendy and who was it displaying dazzling footwork to finish off that vital try in the 74th minute? Cometh the hour, cometh the man and Mitchell rarely fails to step up when his team needs him. </p><p>And Hendy? We have seen glimpses of his exciting, unusual, awkward but devastating running style before this season. He is only 21 but Saints haven't hesitated to use him when required, he is an X factor player and there is no point holding him back. Already he has 14 tries in 22 Saints games and yesterday's glorious assist felt as good as a try. It certainly moved Austin Healey to nominate him as MOM and the recipient of the Peter Deakin medal which is the reward for that accolade in the final.</p><p>How do Saints replace this trio and indeed young lock Alex Moon who is also moving after signing for Bayonne? Is there any point trying for a like for like replacement or do you just trust the different talents you are already nurturing? I would suggest Saints are in pretty good shape. In the backrow you probably needn't look beyond No 8 Juarno Augustus, Tom Pearson at blindside and openside flanker Henry Pollock, the U20 Six Nations player of the tournament this year. The speedy Pollock could be sensational in such a free running team but if they want to gradually blood the young man the excellent and ever versatile Sam Graham can slot in wherever required</p><p>None of those permutations will give you the lineout presence of Lawes in the backrow although for the record I think Alex Coles - not dissimilar to Lawes physically - has more potential at blindside flanker than lock. With the departure of Moon, though, he will be required to soldier on in the boiler house for the foreseeable future. As for Waller's replacement, Emmanuel Iyogun is an immensely strong and focussed young prop who is learning very quickly. When he came on in the second half, briefly, he found himself at odds with referee Christophe Ridley as well as the Bath front row. Instead of losing the plot and possibly the game, he listened to Ridley's requirements, made a few changes and steadied the ship. The old heads in the Saints pack nodded their appreciation. They can leave with a clear conscience. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUGPPR-trp09062024article62</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RUGPPR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C6Y-SPR1-JC6J-0007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1025\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Greenways Publishing Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Rugby Paper</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28507\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 9, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Less than 12 months later their golden generation headed up by their remarkable full-back Andre Stoop recorded series wins over Ireland and Italy, but it was too late to qualify for RWC1991 and so that opportunity was alas lost. </p><p>Since then, it has been hard graft all the way with no reward. The Welwitschias have qualified as Africa 1 for every tournament since 1999 but have yet to record a win in the tournament proper. </p><p>Their best result was a battling 17-16 defeat against Georgia at Sandy Park in 2015, a cracking game between two minnows, and they had high hopes of breaking their duck against Canada four years ago but alas Typhoon Hagibis did its worst and the game was called off. </p><p>Namibia's World Cup experience has simply been huge defensive shifts against the giants and, alas, on four occasions they have conceded more than 80 points, most famously in 2003 when Australia amassed 142 without reply. </p><p>That humiliation cast doubts over their future participation in some quarters but Namibia's mainly amateur squad have always brought something else to the party. Characters like professional Lion tamer/flanker Schalk van der Merwe, all-rounder Ruud Van Vuuren who played in both the Cricket and Rugby World Cup in 2003 and the mighty Jacques Burger who, virtually on one leg, still made the 2011 team of the tournament for his heroics in adversity. </p><p>Namibia are always game, they hung on pretty well for much of the game against New Zealand in 2015 when they eventually lost 58-14 which is better than France managed! Centre Johan Deysel, their skipper this year, enjoyed his moment in the sun by scoring against the world champions.</p><p>This time round they have a pretty experienced squad by their standards with more players than usual based overseas in France or playing Major League Rugby in America while there is the usual smattering playing a good standard of rugby with South African provinces. </p><p>Torsten van Jaarveld is a quality hooker at Bayonne and the Frenchbased duo of PJ van Lill and Tjiuee Uanivi offer plenty of lineout options. The veteran van Lill is now 39 and playing amateur rugby at Hossegor as he completes his training to become a dentist. Flanker Wian Conradie enjoyed a spell at Gloucester but the big addition to the squad has been Melbourne Rebels flanker Richard Hardwick who earlier this year declared for the land of his birth after winning two Wallaby caps in 2017.</p><h>ONE TO WATCH</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Hardwick </emphasis>Ex-Wallaby has great ability over the ball and hard hitting defence </p><p>As ever, meaningful preparations have been in short supply but Namibia gained much from a flying visit to South America where they went down narrowly to Uruguay and an Argentina XV but recovered from a 26-9 deficit to pip Chile in Santiago. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUGPPR-trp03092023article191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RUGPPR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6936-MGM1-DYNK-P0NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"484\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Greenways Publishing Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Rugby Paper</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28507\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 3, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000170</classCode><className>BASEBALL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000578</classCode><className>AMATEUR SPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC377</classCode><className>NAMIBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC337</classCode><className>ARGENTINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GR122</classCode><className>SOUTH AMERICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC364</classCode><className>URUGUAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Instead, the 2027 tournament in Australia will be expanded to 24 teams with organisers keen not to erect \u201ca glass ceiling\u201d between the top sides and those with fewer playing and financial resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With Portugal and Uruguay, among others, having provided significant entertainment in France, there had been calls for lower-ranked sides with no hope of knockout stage qualification to be given fresh incentive in the form of a parallel event involving teams of more similar ability. It is understood, however, the proposed concept has insufficient support within World Rugby, which is also wary of the extra cost implications.</p><p>Instead, it will be formally agreed before the end of this tournament that 24 teams will be involved in Australia, opening the way for Spain, the United States, Canada and, potentially, either Hong Kong, China or Brazil to feature in four years\u2019 time. Six pools of four would also make it simpler for squads to play and train in half a dozen regional centres, reducing the amount of travel that has caused significant logistical headaches in France.</p><p>It will do little, however, to pacify those who believe the full potential of sides such as Georgia and Portugal will not be realised until they gain access to major tournaments such as the Six Nations or the top tier of the new Nations Championship, which is set to involve the world\u2019s 12 leading sides and commence in 2026. No promotion from the second tier will be on offer in the latter competition before 2030 at the earliest, while the Six Nations remains a closed shop with no relegation.</p><p>World Rugby does provide substantial development funding and coaching expertise to nations outside the elite but, while standards are rising outside the game\u2019s traditional powers, the top sides are also continually improving.</p><p>Statistically this disparity has improved little since the bad old days of the late 1990s when 100-point wallopings at World Cups were a frequent occurrence. To date, with one weekend remaining, only six of the 32 pool games in France have involved a margin of seven points or fewer. Unless there is at least one tight game in the final round, this could mean the tournament equalling the lowest figure seen at a World Cup this century.</p><p>In 2019 in Japan, there were also six \u201cone-score\u201d pool matches but three fixtures were scrapped because of the disruption caused by Typhoon Hagibis. In 2015 there were seven, while the figures for 2011 and 2007 were 10 and 12 respectively.</p><p>Michel Pousseau, the RWC tournament director, points out that audience figures for the tournament have already exceeded those from the 2015 tournament in England. \u201cWe have now reached an audience in France of more than 128 million fans watching through official broadcasters, which is already as much as the entirety of Rugby World Cup 2015 in England,\u201d he said.</p><p>Last weekend\u2019s game between <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/29/smith-hat-trick-inspires-new-zealand-to-world-cup-demolition-job-on-italy\">New Zealand and Italy in Lyon</url>  attracted 5.3 million television viewers in France, 30% more than the audience who watched the most recent Champions League final between Manchester City and Internazionale. \u201cWe are seeing a younger and more diverse audience engagement around Rugby World Cup 2023, which is very good for our sport and to continue the growth of rugby,\u201d said Pousseau. \u201cThat is our number one objective.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-97153284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699W-6MC1-JBNF-W26B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><timeReceived>12:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

First Typhoon Hagibis, then Covid-19. The storms in Japan robbed him of a send-off chance to qualify for the knockout stages of the 2019 Rugby World Cup <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/sergio-parisse-blasts-ridiculous-call-cancel-new-zealand-vs/\">when Italy's last pool game against the All Blacks was cancelled.</url> In March, the coronavirus ruined a celebratory 'Arrivederci, Sergio' appearance <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/sergio-parisse-blasts-ridiculous-call-cancel-new-zealand-vs/\">against England in front of home fans at the Stadio Olimpico.</url> It has been a double-whammy of misfortune. Parisse, though, is quick to put matters into perspective as he speaks from Rome prior to returning to the south of France this weekend for a training camp with Toulon where he has extended his career for another season. The valedictory swan-song may be back on the agenda but it has been a torrid experience for all concerned.</p><p>\"Of course it was a shock and terrible for so many people who have had real tragedies in their lives from Covid,\" said Parisse. \"It reminds us all about mortality, about the importance of little things in our lives, too. Who could imagine this? I was disappointed about my own circumstances. There had been a big party planned in Rome. But looking at it all now, it's just my little issue, a rugby thing, not life and death as it has been for lots of others. Perhaps it was destiny, eh, not meant to be at this time? But, yes, two such exceptional events is a bit strange, a story for my kids in 20 years' time.\"</p><p>Parisse was weighing up whether to retire completely when the pandemic struck. The enforced downtime has given him time to re-evaluate his immediate future as he approaches his 37th birthday in September.</p><p>\"The break has revitalised me, mentally as well as physically, and I want to finish strongly now with Toulon,\" said Parisse. \"I have no intention of hanging around just for the sake of it. I want this to be a special season. And, yes, I would still love to have that last game for Italy in front of home fans in Rome. That is still the intention. We have no dates for anything but (Italy head coach) Franco Smith as well as the Italian federation still feel the same. It remains the dream.\" </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/sergio-parisse-blasts-ridiculous-call-cancel-new-zealand-vs/\">Parisse is well used to the knock-downs that sport can deliver.</url> He has been tested like no other with over a century of defeats (106) in his 142-match career, an indication not of his own inadequacy but of his fortitude. Parisse is one of the most talented No 8s in the history of the sport, a blend of the gladiatorial rage of a Lawrence Dallaglio <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/sergio-parisse-blasts-ridiculous-call-cancel-new-zealand-vs/\">and the footballing dexterity of a Zinzan Brooke.</url></p><p>Parisse spent lockdown in Carqueiranne, a genteel harbour resort a few kilometres to the east of Toulon where he lives with wife, Silvia, and two-year-old son, Leonardo. It is there that he made the decision to carry on for a further 12 months while also coming to terms with the fact that his time in the international arena has drawn to a close. </p><p>\"It is a strange feeling, this reality,\" said Parisse. \"I have been involved in the Six Nations for 18 years. The sensation has been weird although I am at peace with the decision. I want now to give back to Italian rugby. It is a constant battle to keep the sport developing there. You have to be optimistic and positive. That is how I have always tried to be. You are empty after a match, totally spent after giving all you have of your being, but on Monday you have to look your team-mates in the eye, show certainty and resolve, and go again. If I can't do that as captain, then how can I expect them to do it? I was never fatalistic in accepting that defeat was inevitable, never.\"</p><p>Parisse's ball skills, his off-loading, his athleticism, have been lauded but it is the warrior within that truly marks him out. Those who trot out the unflattering stats - 94 Tests as captain dating back to his first stint with the armband in 2008 and only 18 wins to his name - miss the point entirely. There has never been a scintilla of self-pity.</p><p>\"I have no regrets at all,\" said Parisse, who was approached by Argentina to play for the Pumas after it came to their attention that the 17-year-old Italian player had been born and reared in Buenos Aires. \"I was spotted at the junior world championships in Chile. But it never occurred to me not to play for Italy. My parents are Italian, we were brought up speaking Italian and returned home (to L'Aquila) every summer. To play for Italy was a dream, to play for my culture and my family. When you pull on a jersey, it is not just a piece of clothing for the day, a convenience. Loyalty, honour and trust-these are the things that mean a lot to me. I don't define a person as a winner and loser by mere statistics. I see young players now after a game on their phones, judging themselves by what is being said on social media. That is a dangerous thing. People say to me, 'Don't you wish you had been an All Black and had all that success?' Well, no. Being Italian is who I am. Maybe I'd have won more games but would I have the same emotions, the same experiences, the same camaraderie, the same joy? The most important thing in life is how you feel. If you feel a failure, then sure, that is not a good thing. But I look at my career and I am proud of it.\"</p><p>Parisse does not duck questions about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/sergio-parisse-blasts-ridiculous-call-cancel-new-zealand-vs/\">Italy's lamentable recent record in the championship.</url> Without a win in five years, 22 successive matches, there are regular calls for relegation to be introduced so that Italy can be made more accountable. </p><p>\"I can understand why it is spoken about and why the focus is on Italy,\" said Parisse. \"Italy have lost a lot of matches. If I were a Georgian, like Mamuka Gorgodze at Toulon, I would be just like him, asking to get into the Six Nations. But if we have relegation, maybe for one year Georgia is there and then it's back to Italy. Does that really improve the tournament? Of course, our recent record, with no tournament win in five years, does not give a good image of Italian rugby. I can understand the critics. Of course it is not good enough. I am not happy with it.\"</p><p>Parisse will stay involved with the sport, either in a mentoring or coaching consultancy capacity. He was particularly affected <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/rugby-world-cup/2019/10/10/sergio-parisse-blasts-ridiculous-call-cancel-new-zealand-vs/\">by the death of 19-year-old Nicolas Chauvin</url> while at his former club, Stade Francais, the result of a massive double-hit in a tackle.</p><p>\"My wife does not want our son to play rugby,\" said Parisse. \"These days for young players it is all about being really physical, lifting weights, being strong. Of course, rugby is a contact sport and must be hard but what about finding space or giving a pass? We have lost some of the beauty, distorted the balance in the game.\"</p><p>Wise words. And another season on the field to come. Savour him while you can. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-64366762</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BF-DJ41-JCJY-G3VF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1108\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D9GY</classCode><className>SPORTS INSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Now it has been confirmed that the lesserspotted Mark Dodson will complete his final disappearing act when he steps down from his role as chief executive of Scottish Rugby in the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After 13 years at the helm, how are we to remember this hugely controversial, hugely divisive - and yet hugely powerful - figure who has dominated the landscape of the Scottish game for over a decade?</p><p>What will be his legacy? Is rugby in Scotland in a better place now than when he took the job in 2011?</p><p>When Dodson spoke to journalists, he seemed unwilling to engage with such issues. Like, for example, his handsome remuneration over the years and whether he has provided value for money.</p><p>Scottish Rugby's handling of the Siobhan Cattigan affair was also not up for discussion.</p><p>It was rather frustrating, yet it also typified Dodson's reign.</p><p>As one of the highest-paid executives in British sport, Dodson was sheepish when asked if Scottish Rugby was getting bang for its buck from its CEO.</p><p>A straight answer was not forthcoming. If Mail Sport can be slightly more blunt on the matter, then, no, it wasn't.</p><p>Dodson was overpaid and underdelivering in key areas of the job, never a good combination for any executive whose company just posted a loss of over \u00a310million in their latest accounts.</p><p>What he has built at Scottish Rugby is a glamorous showhome which, to the casual observer, probably looks wonderful - but one which has rotten foundations.</p><p>Murrayfield is invariably a sellout these days as fans flock to see the likes of Finn Russell and Darcy Graham work their magic.</p><p>The national team have enjoyed some decent results over the past few years. Scratch below the surface, however, and things are nowhere near as solid as Dodson would have us believe.</p><p>For instance, the steady and alarming decline of Scotland's Under-20s can't be overlooked.</p><p>Gregor Townsend has already voiced his concerns that no players from the Under-20s have broken into the senior team for four years.</p><p>Under Dodson's watch, the governing body have prioritised the cherry-picking of players from around the globe, rather than nurturing homegrown talent. Scottish Rugby lost sight of the one thing they should have valued most above all else.</p><p>If this is the house that Dodson built, then the decline of the player pathway system means the foundations have already started to crack. While it might be a nice sideshow to have Harry Styles or Beyonce doing gigs at Murrayfield, those are the issues that really matter and for which Dodson will be remembered.</p><p>The controversies have been impossible to avoid. Going all the way back to the Keith Russell affair, the chief executive didn't cover himself or his organisation in glory.</p><p>Russell, father of fly-half Finn, was dismissed as director of domestic rugby back in May 2017 before taking his case to an employment tribunal and winning.</p><p>The case eventually became a damning indictment of the governing body and their management culture under Dodson.</p><p>Although his public utterances have been rare over the years, we have come to know him as a man who only opens his mouth to change foot.</p><p>Instance the horrendous Typhoon Hagibis which hit Japan during the 2019 World Cup and threatened to have Scotland's game against the hosts called off.</p><p>Dodson held a press conference in which he threatened legal action if the game did not go ahead.</p><p>The typhoon went down as Japan's worst in over 60 years, killing more than 100 people and destroying swathes of homes.</p><p>Scottish Rugby were reprimanded by World Rugby, fined \u00a370,000, and told to apologise for those crass and ill-judged comments from their chief executive. It wouldn't be the last time he spoke out of turn.</p><p>Last year he admitted publicly he had been touting Townsend's job, before eventually handing the head coach a new contract.</p><p>The whole affair became a soap opera which smacked of amateurism. It was embarrassing. Why the need to air it all in public? Why the need to say anything at all, given Dodson's silence on matters far more serious than merely the future of the head coach?</p><p>He wasn't so forthcoming with answers when the Cattigan family were demanding them. Nor did he say anything throughout the Rufus McLean scandal last year.</p><p>Dodson bumbled his way from one PR disaster to another. That's how he will be remembered.

Then again, if you are paid such a high salary ? a reputed \u00a3676,000 last year alone ? you wouldn't be in any hurry to leave either.</p><p>It was 1984 Grand Slam legend Iain 'The Bear' Milne, who I spoke to on Friday evening, who best put Dodson's time in charge in context. The 44-times-capped Milne, in a light-hearted dig at the criticism of Dodson, said: 'I'll be so glad to go back to the good old days prior to when Mark Dodson took over. I remember fondly the joys of watching our national team perform with such panache in a full, vibrant Murrayfield. The glory days 2000-2010.</p><p>'As a nation, prior to that, we dominated the rugby world. I remember fondly the three Grand Slams we have won in our 150-year existence. Now that he has gone, we can look forward to the good old glory days.'</p><p>And he's right. It wasn't all wine and roses before Dodson turned up. Scottish rugby fans will still break out into a cold sweat when they remember the ghastly 'Matt Williams' years when Scotland couldn't buy a win for love nor money.</p><p>Whoever takes over from Dodson isn't going to wave a magic wand and Scotland will automatically become a successful rugby nation. The rot was setting in long before he arrived on the scene. His successor as chief executive will be appointed by the summer, as will a new performance director to replace Jim Mallinder. It will be a new chapter but with no guarantee of success.</p><p>The one bright spot is the appointment of</p><p>John McGuigan as the new Scottish Rugby chairman. He has put his head above the parapet more in the six months since his appointment than the other three previous chairmen of Scottish Rugby ? Moir Lockhead, Colin Grassie and John Jeffrey ? did combined. He issued an apology to the Cattigan family and seems personable enough. The problem is that up till now he has been speaking in broad brush strokes about his plans for Scottish rugby.</p><p>Hopefully, as he learns more, he can put a bit of meat on the bones.</p><p>McGuigan appears to be a far smoother operator than Dodson, whose rumbustious style rubbed many people up the wrong way. I was present at his first press conference as chief executive in Auckland, New Zealand, after Scotland were dumped out of the 2011 World Cup. Even then, you could see he would take no prisoners. He answered short and sharply and didn't suffer fools gladly. He never changed.</p><p>Over the last 12 and a bit years, I have had a few stand-up rows with him ? one near a church in South Africa after I had questioned the morale in the Scotland touring squad comes to mind ? and he always gave as good as he got.</p><p>Shooting from the hip didn't always work out. After Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan during the 2019 World Cup, there was a chance that Scotland's final group game against the hosts may be cancelled on safety grounds. I was in the room in Tokyo when Dodson held a hastilyarranged press conference threatening legal action if it didn't. The Japanese hosts were dumbfounded as the deadly storm wreaked havoc, killing more than 100 people. As it happened, the game did take place with Scotland losing to Japan and being dumped out of the World Cup at the group stages. Dodson's ill-advised comments left him embarrassed on the world stage, with Scottish Rugby being fined \u00a370,000 for his outburst.</p><p>Closer to home, the management culture under him was called into question after Keith Russell, father of Scotland international Finn, was dismissed as director of domestic rugby seven years ago. Keith Russell took Scottish Rugby to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal and won.</p><p>When it came to making coaching appointments, Dodson was pretty much spot-on every time.</p><p>This correspondent was sceptical when he appointed Franco Smith as Glasgow Warriors head coach, yet he has been a revelation.</p><p>Dodson also brought Vern Cotter, David</p><p>Rennie and Richard Cockerill ? who was the right man at the time for Edinburgh ? into Scottish rugby. He championed Gregor Townsend, fast-tracking him into Glasgow Warriors and then Scotland. Townsend's star may be on the wane after the international side failed to make the knock-out stages at the last two World Cups but he is likely to see out the remainder of his contract that ends in April 2026.</p><p>The only blot on the Dodson appointment copybook appears to be Mallinder, who was expected to revolutionise the age-grade system as performance director. I sat through a long presentation from Mallinder and Scotland Under-20 coach Kenny Murray at Murrayfield two years ago on their plans for the future, which has clearly been a failure. Not a single Scotland player has made the step up from the Scotland Under-20 team to the national side for four years. Also, on Murray's watch, the Scotland Under-20s failed to make it out of the second tier Junior World Trophy after they lost to lowly Uruguay.</p><p>Dodson did a lot of good work for the women's game after a very slow start and the fact they now have professional contracts is a big step in the right direction, although Scotland still have a long way to go to catch up with the elite nations such as England.</p><p>The outgoing Scottish Rugby chief executive said he doesn't care what people think of him and made clear his mantra was 'never complain and never explain'. He said it was for others to decide his legacy after he <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.leaves.No\">www.leaves.No</url> doubt the debate over the longest-serving chief executive of Scottish Rugby will rage on and on.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMALS-193449049</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMALS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B3M-7F61-DYTY-C1DH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419638</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"963\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

It was on the first Monday in October in a conference suite in a Hilton Hotel in Auckland, New Zealand during the 2011 Rugby World Cup.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He talked a good game. He seemed like a breath of fresh air. \"I call it as I see it,\" he said. \"I'm not an Edinburgh man, I'm not a Glasgow man. I walked through the door and I am here to do the very best for Scottish rugby and I have a plan to deliver it in short order.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He may have had a short-term plan but he stayed in the top job for almost 13 years and I have covered all the highs and lows of his time in charge.</p><p>Over the years I have had my fair share of run-ins with him - a heated face-to-face argument outside a village church on the outskirts of Nelspruit when I questioned the morale of the 2013 Scotland squad who toured South Africa was a particular highlight.</p><p>As he comes off the SRU payroll - in the 2018/2019 financial year he earned a massive \u00a3933,000 through a mix of his basic wage and bonuses - it is the perfect moment to compare his dreams for Scottish Rugby to the reality he leaves behind.</p><p>But before we do, let's look at that ridiculous salary of \u00a3933,000 that got so many of us hot under the collar. It was far too much to pay him but Dodson didn't set that figure himself. There are checks and balances within Scottish Rugby to monitor executive pay.</p><p>Shame on those within the Murrayfield corridors of power who agreed such an incentive scheme. They created the gravy train. Dodson just bought a ticket and jumped on.</p><p>For context, Dodson couldn't have taken over as chief executive at a better time from his own point of view back in 2011 as Scottish Rugby was at their lowest ebb after the national side had failed to qualify out of their World Cup group for the first time. The only way was up from that.</p><p>As I walked down the corridor in the Hilton Hotel around 10am that Monday to meet Dodson for the first time, going the other way and heading for the team bus to take them to the airport for the flight home was the disconsolate Scotland head coach Andy Robinson and senior players such as Chris Paterson, Sean Lamont, Mike Blair and Al Kellock.</p><p>It was a sad sight but such was the shortage of top hotels in Auckland that Scotland had to be out of theirs by noon to make way for a different side who made the knock-out stages to check-in.</p><p>Before he was also hurried out Dodson talked in general terms about the finances of Scottish Rugby - the governing body had bank borrowings of \u00a314.4 million when he took over and the debt stands at \u00a310.01m now - and how his aim was to make the two professional teams, Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors, more competitive.</p><p>In truth that wouldn't be that hard because they had been dreadful for years.</p><p>He set out five priorities that day in Auckland, so let's see if he has delivered on those promises all these years later.</p><p>A \"user-friendly\" SRU</p><p>First up he wanted to improve the relationship with supporters and make the governing body more \"user friendly\". Now, now, stop laughing at the back.</p><p>Of course that hasn't happened. There is more of a disconnect now between grassroots rugby and the pro ranks than ever before.</p><p>There is resentment at foreign players with not much of a track record - Mosese Tuipulotu who has signed for Edinburgh from the Waratahs in Australia a case in point - being fast-tracked into the pro ranks ahead of Scottish players coming through the ranks.</p><p>As for making the governing body more \"user friendly\"? Well they did try and bring everybody together under the hashtag \"AsOne\" but their actions undermined their words.</p><p>In 2018, the SRU were deemed to have unfairly dismissed their director of domestic rugby, Keith Russell, father of Finn, who won a big payout after winning his unfair dismissal claim against the governing body. Russell described Scottish Rugby as \"toxic\" under Dodson.</p><p>There is no doubt that Dodson and Scottish Rugby could have dealt better with the tragic death of former Scotland women's international  Siobhan Cattigan.</p><p>When an apology to the family from the governing body was first made it came from Scottish Rugby Limited Chairman John McGuigan, not Dodson. It was too little, much too late.</p><p>Dodson said on that first day in Auckland he shot from the hip but he was guilty of putting his foot in his mouth on too many occasions.</p><p>I was in the room in Yokohama cringing when he demanded that the 2019 World Cup game against Japan go ahead at some stage despite organisers being unable to give guarantees that it would due to Typhoon Hagibis which had killed more than 100 people and caused havoc in the country. </p><p>He was worried that if the game didn't go ahead and recorded as a 0-0 draw, Scotland would be dumped out of the tournament at the group stages. He needn't have worried. World Cup organisers did a great job making the stadium in Yokohama safe so the game did go ahead.

Pieter-Jan van Lill, the greying flecks in his long beard only partially obscured by the strapping of his scrum cap, renewed his quadrennial struggle to end the longest losing sequence in the tournament. Before he could make his presence felt, another Namibian cause had been hopelessly lost. </p><p>The substitute lock had endured so many from three previous World Cups that when he arrived at the front, bitter experience would have convinced him that there wasn't anything to be gained from looking at a scoreboard which told a familiar story: New Zealand 43, Namibia 3. Van Lill set forth in the 50th minute and in next to no time the All Blacks had greeted him by completing their half century with an eighth try. Three more followed which meant the outsiders had now shipped nine or more tries on a dozen occasions at the last seven World Cups. </p><p>The Welwitschias, so-called after a plant known as 'the onion of the desert,' are nothing if not consistent: Played 24, lost 24. The official World Cup record credits them a 0-0 draw, ironically for a match they never played, a fixture against Canada in Japan blown away by Typhoon Hagibis four years ago. </p><p>And yet there was still something heroic to admire on van Lill's splendid defiance of old age and impossible odds. It wasn't just that he will be 40 before the end of the year but that he plays for a club so far off the beaten track as to be largely unheard of. </p><p>Capbreton Hossegor on the Atlantic Coast is immersed so far beneath the French Top 14 that van Lill could almost have been cast as the harpooner straight out of Jules Verne's classic novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea. </p><p>He had earned the right to be there on merit, reward for ensuring Namibia's qualification with decisive wins over Kenya, Zimbabe and Burkina Faso. When they finished their warm-ups against the Bulls in Pretoria late last month, they did so under van Lill's captaincy. </p><p>For a few rousing minutes on Friday, Namibia and their ancient warrior raised the fleeting possibility of leaving All Black whale beached in their in-goal area. The spectre of a try that would have brought the house down may have vanished like a mirage but Namibia had won new admirers for their gallantry in the face of brutal odds.</p><p>As if conceding two tries in six minutes to the livewire novice scrum-half Cam Roigard wasn't punishing enough, they suffered the cruel loss of centre Le Roux Malan with an injury nasty enough to prolong the first half by the best part of ten minutes. </p><p>They could have done without being asked for the umpteenth time to display their capacity for absorbing beatings as well as their unfailing readiness to keep coming back for more. </p><p>No historical burden has ever seemed too great to bear for van Lill, the veterans' veteran giving the World Cup a final fling despite his club's status some eight divisions down from where he used to be in the Top 14 with Bayonne. </p><p>Now under the direction of former Springbok coach Alister Coetzee, aided by ex-England and Scotland forwards' coach Matthew Proudfoot, they will lick their wounds and believe that the elusive victory may be lurking round the next corner, in their last pool match against Uruguay in Lyon on September 27. </p><p>They were never closer to it than on an autumn night in Exeter eight years ago. There at Sandy Park, under the coaching of former Wales lock Phil Davies, they lost to Georgia by the narrowest possible margin, 16-17. </p><p>\"Some of the boys were in tears,\" says Davies. \"We ordered beers for the entire squad and kept telling them they had made history because they'd won their country their first bonus point. We tried as hard as we could to make a positive out of that.''</p><p>Under Davies, Namibia made significant strides towards becoming competitive. Where they had all too often been torpedoed by defeats which plumbed the depths at 0-142 against the Wallabies in Adelaide 20 years ago, van Lill &amp; co. succeeded in slashing the deficit. </p><p>\"He's a wonderful guy, PJ,\" says Davies. \"Always reliable, especially when the chips are down. Always ready to give a seven-or-eight out of ten performance. He never changes.\" </p><p>Neither will the results in the immediate future, not with France next up in Marseille on Thursday evening. For Namibia and their indomitable second row forward, it never gets any easier. </p><p>The mis-matches keep coming but that won't stop them trying to turn the tide... </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUGPPR-trp17092023article271</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RUGPPR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6966-3Y51-DYNK-P0NX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Greenways Publishing Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Rugby Paper</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28507\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 17, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A38F</classCode><className>MARINE MAMMALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX531</classCode><className>TOULOUSE, FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC377</classCode><className>NAMIBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC521</classCode><className>BURKINA FASO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC359</classCode><className>KENYA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was on the first Monday in October in a conference suite in a Hilton Hotel in Auckland, New Zealand during the 2011 Rugby World Cup.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He talked a good game. He seemed like a breath of fresh air. \"I call it as I see it,\" he said. \"I'm not an Edinburgh man, I'm not a Glasgow man. I walked through the door and I am here to do the very best for Scottish rugby and I have a plan to deliver it in short order.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He may have had a short-term plan but he stayed in the top job for almost 13 years and I have covered all the highs and lows of his time in charge.</p><p>Over the years I have had my fair share of run-ins with him - a heated face-to-face argument outside a village church on the outskirts of Nelspruit when I questioned the morale of the 2013 Scotland squad who toured South Africa was a particular highlight.</p><p>As he comes off the SRU payroll - in the 2018/2019 financial year he earned a massive \u00a3933,000 through a mix of his basic wage and bonuses - it is the perfect moment to compare his dreams for Scottish Rugby to the reality he leaves behind.</p><p>But before we do, let's look at that ridiculous salary of \u00a3933,000 that got so many of us hot under the collar. It was far too much to pay him but Dodson didn't set that figure himself. There are checks and balances within Scottish Rugby to monitor executive pay.</p><p>Shame on those within the Murrayfield corridors of power who agreed such an incentive scheme. They created the gravy train. Dodson just bought a ticket and jumped on.</p><p>For context, Dodson couldn't have taken over as chief executive at a better time from his own point of view back in 2011 as Scottish Rugby was at their lowest ebb after the national side had failed to qualify out of their World Cup group for the first time. The only way was up from that.</p><p>As I walked down the corridor in the Hilton Hotel around 10am that Monday to meet Dodson for the first time, going the other way and heading for the team bus to take them to the airport for the flight home was the disconsolate Scotland head coach Andy Robinson and senior players such as Chris Paterson, Sean Lamont, Mike Blair and Al Kellock.</p><p>It was a sad sight but such was the shortage of top hotels in Auckland that Scotland had to be out of theirs by noon to make way for a different side who made the knock-out stages to check-in.</p><p>Before he was also hurried out Dodson talked in general terms about the finances of Scottish Rugby - the governing body had bank borrowings of \u00a314.4 million when he took over and the debt stands at \u00a310.01m now - and how his aim was to make the two professional teams, Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors, more competitive.</p><p>In truth that wouldn't be that hard because they had been dreadful for years.</p><p>He set out five priorities that day in Auckland, so let's see if he has delivered on those promises all these years later.</p><p>A \"user-friendly\" SRU</p><p>First up he wanted to improve the relationship with supporters and make the governing body more \"user friendly\". Now, now, stop laughing at the back.</p><p>Of course that hasn't happened. There is more of a disconnect now between grassroots rugby and the pro ranks than ever before.</p><p>There is resentment at foreign players with not much of a track record - Mosese Tuipulotu who has signed for Edinburgh from the Waratahs in Australia a case in point - being fast-tracked into the pro ranks ahead of Scottish players coming through the ranks.</p><p>As for making the governing body more \"user friendly\"? Well they did try and bring everybody together under the hashtag \"AsOne\" but their actions undermined their words.</p><p>In 2018, the SRU were deemed to have unfairly dismissed their director of domestic rugby, Keith Russell, father of Finn, who won a big payout after winning his unfair dismissal claim against the governing body. Russell described Scottish Rugby as \"toxic\" under Dodson.</p><p>There is no doubt that Dodson and Scottish Rugby could have dealt better with the tragic death of former Scotland women's international  Siobhan Cattigan.</p><p>When an apology to the family from the governing body was first made it came from Scottish Rugby Limited Chairman John McGuigan, not Dodson. It was too little, much too late.</p><p>Dodson said on that first day in Auckland he shot from the hip but he was guilty of putting his foot in his mouth on too many occasions.</p><p>I was in the room in Yokohama cringing when he demanded that the 2019 World Cup game against Japan go ahead at some stage despite organisers being unable to give guarantees that it would due to Typhoon Hagibis which had killed more than 100 people and caused havoc in the country. </p><p>He was worried that if the game didn't go ahead and recorded as a 0-0 draw, Scotland would be dumped out of the tournament at the group stages. He needn't have worried. World Cup organisers did a great job making the stadium in Yokohama safe so the game did go ahead. Scotland lost to Japan and were dumped out at the group stages anyway.</p><p>It is fair to say not many tears were shed for the Scots from the locals after Dodson's outburst. World Rugby also weren't pleased and reprimanded Scottish Rugby and fined them \u00a370,000 following Dodson's comments.</p><p>New homes for the pro teams</p><p>The second of his five aims he delivered on big time. The plan to move Glasgow Warriors from Firhill to Scotstoun was already in the pipeline when he took over but he managed to get the switch over the line.</p><p>It took him a few false starts - plans to move Edinburgh games from Murrayfield to Myreside were abandoned after less than a season - but he did manage to build the capital club a home of their own within the national stadium footprint.</p><p>Increase commercial profits</p><p>His third aim was to improve the SRU's revenue-raising ability on the commercial front by making it clear to past, present and future sponsors that the organisation was \"open for business\" to outside backers. This was more of a hit than a miss.</p><p>The highlight was the history-making initial four-year deal in 2014 totalling \u00a320m between Scottish Rugby and BT who bought the naming rights to Murrayfield with the company extending it up until last year.</p><p>When that deal ran out, Scottish Gas took it over in another multi-million-pound transaction that has secured them the naming rights until July 2028.</p><p>You could hear the tumbleweed though when Dodson went public in 2016 with an appeal for companies or rich individuals to plough money into either or both the pro teams.</p><p>They would only get a minority interest as Scottish Rugby would remain as owners of both clubs.

They walloped Italy 70-6 and defeated Fiji 74-13. Their final pool match was a demolition of Argentina by a scoreline of 46-15.</p><p>They then defeated Scotland and Wales in the quarters and semis for the loss of just nine points racking up a combined 79 points themselves.</p><p>France were no opposition in the final and were defeated by a scoreline of 29-9.</p><p>                     1991 -Semi-final: 16-6 loss to Australia.                   </p><p>The second edition of the Rugby World Cup was held in the United Kingdom, Ireland and France. As reigning champions the 1991 tournament was seen in some quarters as a formality for the All-Blacks. But it didn't quite work out that way. </p><p>They once again breezed through the group although faced stiffer opposition with narrower victories over England and Italy. there were echoes of 1987 though as they battered the United States 46-6.</p><p>They strolled through their quarter-final against surprise package Canada before arriving in Dublin for a semi-final clash against bitter rivals Australia. It was The Wallabies who triumphed at Lansdowne Road defeating New Zealand by 16 points to 6. They went on to beat England 12-6 in the final.</p><p>                     1995 -Runners-up: 15-12 loss to South Africa</p><p>New Zealand once again performed excellently in reaching another final some eight years after their first. They won all three pool matches and defeated Scotland and England in the quarters and semis. </p><p>The All-Blacks then came up against an inspired Springboks on their home soil and were defeated after extra-time by a scoreline of 15-12. Nelson Mandela wore a South Africanjersey whilst handing over the trophy to South African captain Fran\u00e7ois Pienaar in one of the most iconic sporting images in history.</p><p>                     1999 -Semi-finals: 43-31 loss to France</p><p>In one of New Zealand's more disappointing World Cup campaigns they once again dominated their pool winning every game. They then defeated Scotland 30-18 before being overwhelmed by France in the semi-finals by a scoreline of 43-31.</p><p>A third-place playoff loss to South Africa rounded off a tournament to forget for the All-Blacks.</p><p>Australia defeated France in the final.</p><p>                     2003 -Third place: 22-10 loss to Australia in semi-final                   </p><p>In another relatively disappointing tournament the All-Blacks were defeated semi-finalists to Australia, as had been the case 12 years previously.</p><p>Another dominant, no loss pool stage was followed up with a superb victory over South Africa in the quarters before an underwhelming 22-10 loss to Australia. They did however beat France 40-13 to seal third place.</p><p>                     2007 -Quarter-finals: 20-18 loss to France</p><p>After two disappointing World Cup campaigns hopes were high for a return to glory in France. These hopes were shattered when the host nation defeated them narrowly by 20-18 in the quarter-finals. The focus then shifted to 2011.</p><p>                     2011 -Champions                   </p><p>New Zealand hosted the 2011 event andfinally managed to land their second Rugby World Cup triumph after a wonderful exhibition of offensive prowess and defensive skill. </p><p>They maintained their 100% pool winning record since the conception of the tournament and followed that up with victories over Argentina and Australia to reach the final where they came up against France.</p><p>A dramatic, albeit low scoring final ensued with the All-Blacks coming out winners by a single point 8-7.</p><p>                     2015 -Champions                   </p><p>New Zealand became the first and to date only back to back winners of the event when they triumphed once again in 2015. </p><p>Their impressive record of never having lost a pool match was sustained as they finished top ahead ofArgentina. They then hammered France 62-13 before a narrow two point defeat of South Africa in the semis. </p><p>In what was sweet revenge for multiple semi-final defeats Australia were slayed 34-17 in the final. This remains the All-Blacks most recent World Cup triumph.</p><p>                     2019 -Third place: Lost 19-7 to England in semi-final                   </p><p>Unfortunately for New Zealand they were unable to recreate their wonderful victories in 2011 and 2015 as they were defeated in the semi-finals by a determined England, going down 19-7 in the semi-finals.</p><p>They also lost their 100% pool match winning record as their match with Italy was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>They did however, hammer Wales 40-17 in the third place match.</p><p>                     Get the latest sports headlines straight to your inbox by signing up for free email alerts.                   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMRONL-97353947</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMRONL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69CH-0C41-JBNF-W06V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">418989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"889\"/><timeReceived>5:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>irishmirror.ie</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"36679\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 11, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001423</classCode><className>POOL &amp; BILLIARDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Japanese public were, after all, against staging the Games when they were polled last month.</p><p>Worried about the risk of transmission in a country that was slow off the mark with its vaccination programme, they saw the Olympics as a threat rather than a benefit.</p><p>But as the Olympics draws nearer, support is growing.</p><p>A poll conducted over the weekend by Japan's secondbiggest selling newspaper, the Asahi Shimbun, showed 34 percent now want the Games to take place compared to 32 percent for cancellation and 30 percent for a delay.</p><p>Those figures hardly represent a landslide but when you take into account the respective figures last month were 17 percent for pressing ahead, 43 percent for cancellation and 40 percent for rescheduling, it is clear how opinion is shifting. The promises of daily testing for athletes and restrictive bubbles for all officials and media seem to be having a reassuring effect alongside the ramp-up in Japan's virus fight.</p><p>A million people a day are now being jabbed and, with infection rates low, the Covid state of emergency in Tokyo was lifted on Sunday.</p><p>It will be interesting to see how this week's draconian stadium regulations - which include an alcohol ban - serve to further affect the appetite for the Games. Here, such rules would not be worth the paper they were written on. Imagine a cheer-free Wembley for the Euros? The organisers are unable to police the maskwearing and social distancing rules as it is. But Japan is culturally very different.</p><p>Two years ago, covering the Rugby World Cup, I was in Tokyo when Typhoon Hagibis hit.The instruction to stay indoors did not take much following with the</p><p>Ginza hotel beginning to creak and sway.</p><p>Seen through the smeared watercolours of a rain-lashed window, the view down from the 32nd floor was apocalyptic.</p><p>The trees were bowing and the roads in one of the world's busiest cities were completely deserted.</p><p>A solitary Japanese stood at the kerbside, his dash to safety on hold. He was waiting for the green signal to cross. Japan is a country that loves a rule.

But scratch beneath the surface and the reality is starkly different.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Scotland returned early from the men\u2019s World Cup, eliminated at the pool stage for the second time in a row; the national under-20 side are languishing in the sport\u2019s second division, unable to beat minnows Uruguay and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/its-not-working-gregor-townsend-calls-for-change-at-scotland-under-20-level-after-uruguay-defeat-4233550\">Gregor Townsend is left to lament the lack of native talent coming through</url> as he scours the globe looking for Scottish-qualified contenders.</p><p>It is now 25 years since Scotland won the final Five Nations Championship and the closest they\u2019ve come since is to finish third in the expanded competition. Glasgow Warriors\u2019 Guinness Pro12 success in 2015 remains the only major trophy won by our pro teams, although the Scotstoun club did reach the final of the European Challenge Cup last season.</p><p>Dodson said he would leave it to others to judge his tenure and it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that, for all his optimism, Scottish rugby continues to struggle just to keep its head above water.</p><p>No-one could pretend it\u2019s an easy job and his surprise resignation announcement on Friday could signal a significant change in the way the sport is run in this country. In the short term, it means the SRU is now looking for two key players at the top of the tree. As well as chief executive, there is also a vacancy for a performance director, with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scottish-rugby-looking-for-a-new-performance-director-after-jim-mallinder-decision-4451212\">Jim Mallinder also due to step down in June this year</url>. The latter\u2019s departure follows the under-20 team\u2019s travails, with the main \u201cpipeline\u201d for supplying the senior squad having all but dried up. Townsend expressed disquiet last year that no players were making the transition from under-20s to the full Scotland team.</p><p>Despite the compelling evidence, Dodson rebutted suggestions that the grassroots game had been neglected in favour of concentrating resources on the elite level.</p><p>\u201cI think the foundations are in good shape,\u201d he said in a briefing with journalists. \u201cIf you look at what we're trying to do: create role models, create winning teams, then build a stadium that creates money and a flow of cash that can be reinvested in the rest of the game.</p><p>\u201cWe invest a huge amount of money into grassroots rugby and will continue to do that. I think the new pathway system we\u2019re working on as part of our 10-year strategic plan will correct some of the weaknesses in the pathway, and we can all look for things improving across the piece.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at the way our pro teams are playing, look at the crowd last week when we had 37,000 people [to watch Edinburgh v Glasgow], there is an enormous amount of good news out there and I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll go from strength to strength.\u201d</p><p>Dodson is leaving his post a year ahead of schedule. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/mark-dodson-scottish-rugby-chief-signs-new-contract-and-will-remain-in-post-until-2025-3742406\">contract he signed in 2022 was due to expire in June 2025</url> but he said it made sense to go at the start of the next World Cup cycle. He sees no contradiction between that and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/gregor-townsend-i-wasnt-sure-new-deal-would-ever-happen-scotland-coach-set-for-nine-year-stint-4136135\">the decision last year to award a new contract to Townsend</url> which runs until April 2026, 18 months before the 2027 World Cup in Australia.</p><p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got to remember that Gregor has been involved for a long period of time, and this takes him to the midway point in the cycle so gives him the opportunity to drive forward to 2027 and beyond, but also gives him the flexibility if he doesn\u2019t want to stay on he can move away,\u201d said Dodson. \u201cHe is an outstanding coach and remains an outstanding coach and he is in place till 2026 so in reality he is carrying the torch for the team and driving us forward for the next few years.\u201d</p><p>He was characteristically bullish about the problems at under-20 level and continued to peddle the narrative that this <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/rugby-world-cup-john-jeffrey-backs-best-ever-scotland-team-to-qualify-from-group-of-death-4280305\">current Scotland squad is the strongest seen in the pro era</url>.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at the last 20 to 25 years, we have players coming through in clusters, then we don\u2019t have players coming through, then they come through in clusters again,\u201d said Dodson. \u201cThe fact of the matter is you probably only need three, four, five players coming through to the pro teams at any one time out of the under-20s. But we are still producing phenomenal talent if you look at some of the kids coming through the age-grade system now \u2013 first class players. Of course we would like more, and of course we would like a conveyor belt, but you\u2019ve got to be realistic about what Scotland can produce with its player numbers and also its pro franchise system.</p><p>\u201cIf you look at the squad we\u2019ve got currently at the moment, it is probably the most powerful and deep squad we\u2019ve had in the professional era. Now, that will continue because players will come through. There may be a couple of barren years, but players will come through and players will qualify for Scotland, so I\u2019m in no doubt we\u2019re in good stead.\u201d</p><p>Dodson batted away any chat about his legacy and whether his handsome salary had represented value for money. A straight talker who has never appeared to care overly much about what people think of him, Dodson\u2019s bluntness has been a strength and a weakness. His handling of the Siobhan Cattigan case was unedifying and needlessly stubborn and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scottish-rugby-apologises-to-siobhan-cattigans-family-for-any-anguish-we-caused-4414865\">it took the arrival of John McGuigan as chair last year for Scottish Rugby to do the decent thing and apologise to the family</url> of the late Scottish international.</p><p>On the credit side, Dodson\u2019s leadership steered the sport through difficult Covid times and he also helped negotiate the multi-million pound Six Nations and URC deals with private equity firm CVC which he described yesterday as \u201clife-savers\u201d for rugby.</p><p>He also fought Scotland\u2019s corner at the Japan World Cup in 2019 when it looked like the national side might be eliminated without playing the hosts in their final group game due to Typhoon Hagibis. He was heavily criticised in some quarters given the death toll caused by the typhoon and he acknowledged yesterday that you \u201chave to have a thick skin\u201d as he reflected on his time in charge.</p><p>\u201cPeople are not going to believe you all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to take decisions that sometimes are unpopular and sometimes create some discord. The truth of the matter is you have to stick to the task and drive things through.</p><p>\u201cAnd I\u2019ve never been worried about this being a popularity contest, and most of the guys on this call have known me for a long time \u2013 I never complain and I never explain. At the end of the day I\u2019m not explaining how I feel or anything else, I just take it and I drive on, because that\u2019s what the leader of an organisation has to do.</p><p>\u201cIf you talk to the people that work with me closely, talk to my colleagues around the rugby business, in Europe and the world, they probably have a different view of me than the way the Scottish public see me. But that\u2019s for other people to judge. I\u2019m very happy with the way I\u2019ve gone about my time in Scottish rugby, and as I\u2019ve said before it\u2019s been an utter privilege.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://imagestore.jpimedia.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjZiNzdiZTcyLTQ4MzctNDIwZi05NjhmLTI3ODdiNGRhMmEyZDoyYjUxOTMxZi1mZTRiLTRmNmUtOWRmMy02ZmQ1MzMzMDA0ZGU=.jpg\">The outgoing Scottish Rugby chief executive Mark Dodson has backed national coach Gregor Townsend to continue his \"outstanding work\".

Hundreds of flights had been cancelled, and many train services throughout the affected regions were also halted.</p><p>By 4:00 pm local time, the typhoon was moving north-northeast off the coast of Shimane prefecture on the western side of Japan, with maximum gusts of around 162 kilometres per hour, according to the JMA.</p><p>\"The thick cloud and eye area around the typhoon's centre have already disappeared and it is weakening rapidly,\" Ryuta Kurora, the head\u00a0of the JMA's forecast unit, told reporters.</p><p>Japan is currently in its typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.</p><p>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people.\u00a0</p><p>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka and left 14 people dead in its wake.</p><p>Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms\u00a0and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.</p><p>By Atish PATEL</p><p>source: AFP</p><p>Copyright 2022 Alliance News Limited.

The New Zealand-born head coach, however, expects a much stiffer challenge for his Brave Blossoms at Murrayfield tomorrow. Japan's 28-21 victory in Yokohama, in the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, saw Scotland exit the World Cup at the pool stage for only the second time. It was a breakthrough moment for the hosts and their coach as they reached their first-ever quarter-final on the biggest stage. Joseph recalled: 'Because it was at the World Cup, the final game in the pool and there was so much emotion because of the typhoon the night before - for those reasons the occasion was massive, one of the biggest I have experienced as a coach. 'The success was because of the team and the way they conducted themselves in the game. The support of the country just added to that.'</p><p>Since then, Covid restrictions have proved hugely inhibitive for Japan and they were recently beaten 60-5 by Ireland. Scotland have bounced back from their</p><p>World Cup embarrassment to land big wins over England, France and Australia. And Joseph believes his players will face a much-improved side who will be eager to finish the year on a high at home.</p><p>The 51-year-old added: 'In the first year of Covid, the year following the World Cup, we played absolutely no rugby.</p><p>'Then we played a couple of games in July after very little training. It has affected our team and the domestic game as well. 'It is uncontrollable, so we haven't worried too much about it, but it does highlight we are behind in comparison to Scotland. 'They have gone from strength to strength and have played some really good rugby in the Six Nations. They beat Australia and they were unlucky not to beat South Africa. They are a team that is growing and developing.</p><p>'Those players who were quite young during the World Cup are now experienced leaders within their team. 'On top of that, they are quite keen to run the ball and I think that's the way forward. For Scotland it has proved to be very successful, so it should be a really good match at the weekend.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-174252412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6440-5Y11-JCBW-N1C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

Joe Schmidt, Ireland\u2019s coach at the time, later remarked that \u201cwe arrived at the stadium 10 or 15 minutes late and we were late for most things in the first half\u201d. Scotland, inspired by two Stuart Hogg tries, raced into a 21-8 lead before Ireland recovered their composure and edged ahead 22-21 after the interval. The game was on a knife edge but Vern Cotter\u2019s Scotland dug in and won 27-22 thanks to two Greig Laidlaw penalties and a gutsy last 20 minutes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ireland haven\u2019t taken many wrong turnings since. A series victory over the All Blacks in New Zealand, grand slam Six Nations champions and 14 months atop the world rankings are the edited highlights. They possess a streetwise hard edge which combined with an abundance of ability makes them formidable opponents, a power on the world stage.</p><p>Scotland have flirted with great things. Cotter was jettisoned after the 2017 Six Nations, making way for Gregor Townsend whose win record is the best of any Scotland coach in the professional era. There have been 41 victories in his 73 matches, 31 defeats and one draw. The win rate measures out at just over 56 per cent but look beyond the bald statistics and you will find notable successes against England, France, Australia and Argentina.</p><p>Ireland are conspicuous by their absence from that list. Townsend has never got the better of them as head coach and it\u2019s a record he will have to overturn if Scotland are to prolong their involvement in the 2023 World Cup. The sides meet at the Stade de France on Saturday night in a showdown that should restore some much needed vitality to a tournament that has burned brightly in moments but suffered from occasional longueurs. The two weeks between Scotland\u2019s first two matches felt like an eternity. The defeat by South Africa in the opener in Marseille combined with Ireland\u2019s win over South Africa in Paris left Scotland in a bad place. They came back with bonus-point wins over both Tonga and Romania but they need to beat Ireland by eight points on Saturday to have a chance of reaching the quarter-finals.</p><p>This could be a defining moment for both Townsend and Scottish rugby, the two of which have seemed inextricably linked for most of the past three decades. As a player he tasted glory in Scotland\u2019s 1999 Five Nations triumph, scoring a try in each match in what was the national team\u2019s last great success. The highlights as coach have been more sporadic but significant nonetheless. A first win over England at Twickenham in 38 years followed by three victories in a row against the Auld Enemy; a first win over France in Paris in 22 years and a first away win in Wales in 18 years. Scotland have also beaten Australia home and away under Townsend and run New Zealand close at Murrayfield. What they haven\u2019t done is put together a run of results that would have allowed them to challenge for trophies. Third place has been their best finish in the Six Nations and they were dumped out of the last World Cup after defeats by Ireland and Japan. If they fail to get the required result against the Irish ton Saturday Townsend will become the first Scotland coach to have presided over two group stage exits.</p><p>But this year\u2019s tournament feels very different from 2019. In Japan, Scotland stuttered to a hugely disappointing loss to Ireland then succumbed to a host nation suffused with righteous indignation over what Typhoon Hagibis had done and the way some nations had reacted. The key difference between 2019 and 2023 is that Scotland were expected to make the knockout stage in Japan. Virtually no one gives them a chance in France, where Scotland are 1/25 to be eliminated at the pool stage.</p><p>Against this backdrop Scotland will have to outfight a team who seem to be able to dig deeper than any other. Ireland\u2019s win over South Africa last month was a masterclass in obdurate rugby and the Scots will need to match it to stand a chance. Grant Gilchrist, the Scotland vice-captain, spoke eloquently on Friday about embracing the emotion of the occasion and banishing all fear. He also referenced Scotland\u2019s win over France at the Stade de France in 2021 as an example of what this team is capable of when the chips are down. On that occasion, they had been reduced to 14 men by Finn Russell\u2019s red card but built phase after phase to win the game in injury time with Duhan van der Merwe\u2019s try.</p><p>Same stadium, different opponents. Scotland have beaten France five times under Townsend but lost all eight times they\u2019ve faced Ireland. It\u2019s a wretched record but the coach has belief it can be broken.</p><p>\"Well, why not?\u201d he said. \u201cThe players have performed in massive games before. We were underdogs but we have broken records, whether it was not winning in Paris, not winning at Twickenham. This is another opportunity to break another record. We believe in them, we believe in where they are mentally as a group and where they are physically. They are ready to play their best rugby.\u201d</p><p>Scotland\u2019s best rugby is a sight to behold. Fast and devastating, their backline on song is a match for anyone\u2019s, but they need the ball. They never got it against South Africa and were squeezed out the game as a consequence. Scotland\u2019s forwards have to take the fight to Ireland. As Fraser Brown wrote in these pages this week, Scotland need to play their own game and not change their identity to counter the opposition. Their forwards need to be confrontational and they need to create quick ball that Finn Russell can thrive off. The lineout needs to be accurate, which it wasn\u2019t against South Africa. Scotland\u2019s four match-day props need to get the better of Ireland in the scrum and Scotland\u2019s back row needs to muzzle Peter O\u2019Mahony and makes the occasion of his 100th cap one to forget.</p><p>Whichever way the cards fall in Paris, one of the top five teams in the world will be eliminated, a consequence of the draw being made almost three years ago when the rankings were very different to what they are now. It\u2019s a shame for the tournament that World Rugby organised it this way but the perfect riposte from Townsend\u2019s side would be to deliver the victory that would put Scottish rugby back on the map.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://imagestore.jpimedia.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmI0OTZhMDE0LWNkYTAtNDg5Ny1iMTY0LWE1Yzc1MTdmYmM0YTpmMWE3NTZmYy1lMjljLTQ4N2MtODZjYy05OWY1YjA2NGU3ZGM=.jpg\">Scotland's Duhan van der Merwe during the team run at the Stade de France ahead of the Rugby World Cup Pool B match with Ireland.

Gone, he says, are the days of being too fired up and becoming involved in unnecessary argy-bargy. \u201cI used to waste a wee bit of energy with some handbags back in the day,\u201d he reflected. \u201cGrowing up, I\u2019m a bit more experienced and realise that I didn\u2019t need to be there to be playing well. I used to feel that I needed to be angry and aggressive to play well. Now I\u2019m more confident that I can be a bit of a calmer head that can play with that controlled aggression that I need.\u201d</p><p>Ritchie was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/jamie-ritchie-was-destined-to-be-scotland-captain-hes-always-been-mature-beyond-his-years-says-team-mate-3895029\">appointed Scotland captain for the first time last autumn</url> and has grown into the role. It\u2019s not always easy to go from being at the bottom of a ruck to imparting important information to the referee but the Edinburgh flanker has never been one to shy away from getting his point across, as those who watched <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/scotland-come-so-close-to-stunning-victory-in-france-as-mid-game-drop-off-costs-gregor-townsends-team-dear-4253247\">Scotland\u2019s match against France in Saint-Etienne</url> will attest. Ritchie had an ongoing dialogue with Nic Berry on Saturday night as the Scots found themselves on the end of some tough calls from the South African ref in the first half. Things improved after the break and the player feels he is better now at combining captaincy with playing duties. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m growing in experience all the time in and around that stuff and I\u2019m starting to separate the two better,\u201d he said.</p><p>This will be Ritchie\u2019s second World Cup, the player having enjoyed a breakthrough at the tournament in Japan in 2019 when he recovered from injury and went on to be one of the few Scotland players to burnish his reputation. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/japan-28-21-scotland-rugby-world-cup-dream-over-as-scots-run-ragged-by-rampant-hosts-811462\">Defeat by the hosts in Yokohama in the final group game</url> meant an early exit for Gregor Townsend\u2019s side, eliminated at the pool stage for only the second time in the competition\u2019s history. The build-up to the match against Japan was played out in extraordinary circumstances, with Typhoon Hagibis wreaking havoc in parts of the country and casting doubt on the game being played. A remarkable clear-up operation allowed it to go ahead and although Scotland lost 28-21, Ritchie\u2019s performance was recognised by the Japanese players who presented him with a katana, or Samurai sword, after the match. The captain thinks the 2019 tournament will stand him in good stead but he believes he\u2019s a better player now.</p><p>\u201cFor me that World Cup was a bit of a whirlwind with the circumstances going into it \u2013 getting injured in the game just before we left, not sure if I was going to play, missing the first game [against Ireland] because I hadn\u2019t recovered from my operation. Then after the first game, we needed to win every game with a bonus point. The last game, with the typhoon beforehand and everything going on around it\u2026it was a great game, probably one of my favourite games in a Scotland jersey, even though it was a loss. It was just such a massive occasion, one of the best atmospheres I have ever been involved in. I would like to think I have improved, I probably have a bit of a cooler head on the pitch now. I used to be a bit angry back then!\u201d</p><p>The squad as a whole looks better equipped now than four years ago and the two recent performances against France in warm-up games - one win and one narrow defeat - suggests they are able to compete with the world\u2019s best which is something they will have to do at this year\u2019s tournament where they are drawn in Pool B with the No 1 ranked Ireland and the World Cup holders, South Africa. \u201cWe know who we are a bit better now,\u201d said Ritchie. \u201cWe are really clear in what we\u2019re trying to do and how we are trying to play. Not that we necessarily weren\u2019t in 2019, but it just feels much better now in terms of \u2018right, this is how we are going to attack\u2019. Our defence is different and, in my opinion, stronger. Everyone is buying in. As a collective I think we are in a stronger position.\u201d</p><p>Crucially, he also believes the squad are fitter than they were four years ago, something born out by the way they came back from 27-10 down against France in Saint-Etienne, scoring three tries in the final quarter to draw level before being pipped by a late Thomas Ramos penalty. \u201cI think we\u2019ve learned from our experience in 2019 and around what we\u2019ve been doing in pre-season - a little more contact-based stuff and more variety of game focus,\u201d adds Ritchie. </p><p>He talks up the group\u2019s \u2018culture\u2019 as well as their ability and believes this Scotland squad is \u201carguably one of the strongest ever\u201d. \u201cThe depth we have is excellent. Even when you look at the guys who have unfortunately missed out on the squad and could easily have been in there and arguably would have been there in previous World Cup squads. We've got a really strong group and I think we're building really nicely. Individually everyone's really good and has got better over the last couple of months because we've had that intense time together. Our culture when we're in camp together is great. You'll not find a closer group of people. Everyone\u2019s great mates but when it comes to training we all compete. We've been training hard and trying to make each other better.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://imagestore.jpimedia.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOmU3ODIxNGM5LWQ2ZDItNGY4MC1iZTIwLThhMzYwZDQ5ZjE1YTpmMWM2ZTg1Ny00ZDZmLTRmZmMtODI5OS01NDZiM2JlZGQzNzU=.jpg\">Scotland captain Jamie Ritchie during the Rugby World Cup squad announcement at Scott's Restaurant, Queensferry.

Not even a smaller earthquake in 2016 - the Kumamoto - could dissuade them and the tournament took place as planned in the autumn of 2019. </p><p>Well nearly. Autumn is the typhoon season in Japan, an event so commonplace that the Japanese themselves scarcely notice them. There were nine in total in the South China seas during the 2019 typhoon season and it was the third biggest typhoon -Hagibis - that caused the most destruction and disruption because of where it made landfall on mainland Japan. There were 121 fatalities and, after the typhoon blew through, widespread flooding was the biggest problem and the factor which affected the World Cup. </p><p>Three games had to be cancelled, the final two games in Pool B where Italy had been due to play New Zealand and Canada meet Namibia. Both matches were declared draws which happily did not affect the pool standings in any substantial way. Then in Pool C the much-anticipated clash between England and France had to be called off, which did have a knock on effect. England were leading the pool but a France win would have seen Les Bleus climb above them and alter the quarter-finals match ups. </p><p>It was all a massive shame for the Japanese organisers but as a nation they are used to natural disasters and they coped incredibly well to ensure the tournament, which had already won the hearts of many, scarcely missed a beat. </p><h>2019 That was the year that was...</h><p>\u00b7 l England won their first Cricket World Cup title, beating New Zealand at Lord's </p><p>\u00b7 Ben Stokes masterminded a remarkable one-wicket victory for England over Australia at Headingley </p><p>\u00b7 Dina Asher-Smith won the women's 200m title at the World Athletics Championships </p><p>\u00b7 Egan Bernal won the Tour de France and Richard Carapaz the Giro D'Italia </p><p>\u00b7 Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer in five sets in just under five hours to win the Men's Singles title at Wimbledon </p><p>\u00b7 Shane Lowry won The Open at Portrush </p><p>\u00b7  Notre Dame Cathedral was badly damaged by fire </p><p>\u00b7  Greggs launched a meat free sausage roll </p><p>\u00b7 5G coverage rolled out in six cities - London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Manchester and Birmingham </p><p>\u00b7\u00a0The Duke of Edinburgh, driving his Range Rover at the age of 97, was badly shaken up after an accident when driving close to the Sandringham Estate</p><p>And, until the quarter-finals, it was Japan themselves with\u00a0their exhilarating high tempo, quick passing, offloading game that had been the main story with their brilliant pool wins over Ireland and Scotland. Indeed, the Japanese topped their pool with four straight wins and if you factor in their three wins in four games at RWC2015 and draw against Canada in their final game of RWC2011 concluded a run of seven wins and a draw in their last nine World Cup games, one of the more impressive streaks among teams that have never won the tournament.</p><p>The fairytale ended with a 26-3 quarter-final defeat against eventual winners South Africa but there was no disgrace there either as they held on bravely for long periods before succumbing to the vastly superior power and heft up front of the Boks pack. </p><p>Elsewhere it was England, Wales and Boks who provided the main storylines. England had \"only\" managed three wins in the 2019 Six Nations when they finished second behind Grand Slam champions Wales but, under Eddie Jones, they got a second wind that year and started to kick on impressively with much of the energy and dynamic being provided by the partnering of two natural opensides in Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the back row as flankers, the so-called 'Kamikaze kids'. </p><p>England breezed through the pool stages with trouble free wins over Tonga and USA and an impressive 39-10 trouncing of the Pumas. The only disappointment was their cancelled game against France which among other things denied the pack and in particular the front row a serious work out ahead of the knockout stages, something which some critics fretted about, rightly as it proved. </p><p>Although not massively tested up front against the Wallabies, England romped to a 40-16 quarter-final win over the Australians and produced a supercharged performance for the ages against the All Blacks in the semi-final, wining much more comfortably than the 19-7 scoreline suggests. </p><p>Impressive stuff but England couldn't go to the well again seven days later when South Africa, flexing their muscles and employing their bomb squad off the bench to great effect, did a number on England up front and ran out commanding 32-12 winners. It was an ill-starred day for England who, stuck in traffic, arrived late at the ground and had to rush their warm up. The all-round excellence and precision in all things of seven days earlier had completely vanished. </p><p>The Boks under Siya Kolisi had been a slow burn as they lost to New Zealand in their opening game before \"dealing\" with Italy, Namibia and Canada in comprehensive if unspectacular style. Then came a thoroughly competent but hardly startling quarter-final win over Japan before they scraped home in a scrappy semi-final against Wales 19-16. </p><p>Wales, as was always the case under Warren Gatland, turned up at the World Cup in great shape physically and had emerged from their pool with a 100 per cent record before they hung tough against France in a quarter-final that, at times, they seemed likely to lose before Les Bleus imploded with the sending off of Sebastien Vahaamahina. Wales seized the initiative and can be proud of their 20-19 win. </p><p>The form book seemed to point to England but the Boks had timed their effort brilliantly and are in any case always different in a World Cup final when their competitive might takes over. In their previous two finals the Boks, as well as winning, didn't cough up a single try and that trend continued against England. With their defence rock solid and England off the boil, South Africa established the platform to open up in the final quarter to record a glorious win. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RUGPPR-trp06082023article251</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RUGPPR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68W7-C491-JC6J-022W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">475798</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Greenways Publishing Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Rugby Paper</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28507\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 6, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The New Zealand-born head coach, however, expects a much stiffer challenge for his Brave Blossoms at Murrayfield tomorrow. Japan's 28-21 victory in Yokohama, in the immediate aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, saw Scotland exit the World Cup at the pool stage for only the second time. It was a breakthrough moment for the hosts and their coach as they reached their first-ever quarter-final on the biggest stage. Joseph recalled: 'Because it was at the World Cup, the final game in the pool and there was so much emotion because of the typhoon the night before - for those reasons the occasion was massive, one of the biggest I have experienced as a coach. 'The success was because of the team and the way they conducted themselves in the game. The support of the country just added to that.'</p><p>Since then, Covid restrictions have proved hugely inhibitive for Japan and they were recently beaten 60-5 by Ireland. Scotland have bounced back from their World Cup embarrassment to land big wins over England, France and Australia. And Joseph believes his players will face a much-improved side who will be eager to finish the year on a high at home.</p><p>The 51-year-old added: 'In the first year of Covid, the year following the World Cup, we played absolutely no rugby.</p><p>'Then we played a couple of games in July after very little training. It has affected our team and the domestic game as well. 'It is uncontrollable, so we haven't worried too much about it, but it does highlight we are behind in comparison to Scotland. 'They have gone from strength to strength and have played some really good rugby in the Six Nations. They beat Australia and they were unlucky not to beat South Africa. They are a team that is growing and developing.</p><p>'Those players who were quite young during the World Cup are now experienced leaders within their team.</p><p>'On top of that, they are quite keen to run the ball and I think that's the way forward. For Scotland it has proved to be very successful, so it should be a really good match at the weekend.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-174252077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6440-5Y11-JCBW-N19R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

Worldwide, economic losses from natural and man-made disasters in 2019 were USD 146 billion, lower than USD 176 billion in 2018 and the previous 10-year annual average of USD 212 billion. The global insurance industry covered USD 60 billion of the losses, compared with USD 93 billion in 2018 and USD 75 billion on average in the previous 10 years. While severe weather events were still the main driver of overall losses in 2019, amplified by socio-economic developments in affected areas and climate-change effects, the decrease in losses primarily stem from the absence of large and costly hurricanes in the US.<br/><br/>'Economic development and ever-increasing population concentration in urban centres, alongside changes in climate, will continue to increase losses due to weather events in the future,' said Edouard Schmid, Chairman of the Swiss Re Institute and Group Chief Underwriting Officer at Swiss Re. 'Our industry can play a key role by partnering with clients and governments to develop scalable solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon world by managing risks associated with renewable energy projects and making these more attractive to investors with re/insurance risk-transfer backing'.<br/><br/>Of the economic losses in 2019, USD 137 billion were due to natural disasters, with man-made events causing the remaining USD 9 billion. Of the USD 60 billion in insured losses, natural catastrophes accounted for USD 52 billion. The biggest industry loss events of 2019 happened in densely populated and developed parts of Japan: Typhoon Faxai in September (insured losses of USD 7 billion); followed by Typhoon Hagibis in October (additional insured losses of USD 8 billion).<br/><br/>Socio-economic trends mask the impact of climate change in a dynamic risk landscape<br/><br/>Economic development and population spread leads to changes in land use resulting in, for instance, deforestation and construction in flood plains and wildland-urban interface. Another variable is the scale of risk mitigation infrastructure like flood barriers and sea defences. This all influences the scale of losses inflicted by extreme weather events and other natural disasters.<br/><br/>The latest sigma includes a chapter authored by Professor Adam Sobel of Columbia University, which notes that the ways increasing temperatures change natural catastrophe risks are not fully understood due to the short history of observational records and other factors. However, it could take decades to gather the proof points to confirm the impact of climate change, Failure to take immediate tangible action could lead to climate systems reaching irreversible tipping points. This in turn could jeopardize insurability, particularly in areas where urbanisation and economic development have led to high levels of concentration of asset (human and physical) value exposure.<br/><br/>'It's difficult to quantify the exact effects rising temperatures have on specific weather related catastrophes, but climate change is a threat that demands immediate action due to its dire effects on both human life and the global economy,' said Jerome Jean Haegeli, Group Chief Economist at Swiss Re.<br/><br/>Climate change effects are already evident, and include rising sea levels, longer and more frequent heatwaves, and erratic rainfall patterns. Warmer temperatures will likely lead to growing frequency of extreme weather events, the report says. The damaging effects manifest most notably in secondary perils, as evident in each of the last three years. In 2019 specifically, the rainfall-induced floods that came with Typhoon Hagibis, the storm surge driven flooding from Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and monsoon rains in southeast Asia and from other weather systems wreaked economic and humanitarian havoc. Record-high temperatures in eastern Australia kept wildfires burning across millions of hectares of bushland in the longest-running wildfires the country has ever seen.<br/><br/>Weather risks remain insurable<br/><br/>All told, Swiss Re Institute believes that weather risks, with adaptation actions, remain insurable. Insurers need to adapt to a dynamic risk landscape by closely monitoring and incorporating socio-economic developments, the latest scientific research on climate change effects, and the status of local risk mitigation measures in their modelling. Many of today's catastrophe models are benchmarked against historical loss data, which does not reflect the current level of urbanisation, and hence do not fully account for today's quickly rising exposures, changing socio-economic environment and climate.<br/><br/>'To uphold the insurance risk transfer model as a powerful tool to foster resilience, insurers need to adapt before, not post events,' Martin Bertogg, Head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re said. 'To this end, insurers should be wary of historical loss records in understanding today's state of the socio-economic environment and climate. Averaging out over a past spanning multiple decades can lead to distorted risk assessment.'<br/><br/>Typhoon Hagibis is a case in point. Japan has always had high exposure to typhoon risk, and with huge investment in coastal and inland flood defence following the devastating typhoon events in the 1950s and 1960s, the re/insurance industry had considered flood risk in Japan to be largely mitigated. However, most of the USD 8 billion in insured losses from Typhoon Hagibis came from floods, and due to urban development since the mid-20th century, Tokyo was unprepared for the degree of physical damage it suffered.<br/><br/>'While flood defences prevented major havoc in parts of Greater Tokyo, at least 55 levee breaches and overflowing rivers illustrated that water inundation risk is only partially mitigated,' Bertogg said. 'The flood defences mitigated the impact, but by no means entirely.'<br/><br/>Table showing total economic and insured losses in 2019 and 2018Open slide in overlay<br/><br/>Table showing Insured versus uninsured losses between 1970 and 2019, in USD billion at 2019 pricesOpen slide in overlay<br/><br/>Notes to editors<br/><br/>Swiss Re<br/><br/>The Swiss Re Group is one of the world's leading providers of reinsurance, insurance and other forms of insurance-based risk transfer, working to make the world more resilient.

Worldwide, economic losses from natural and man-made disasters in 2019 were USD 146 billion, lower than USD 176 billion in 2018 and the previous 10-year annual average of USD 212 billion. The global insurance industry covered USD 60 billion of the losses, compared with USD 93 billion in 2018 and USD 75 billion on average in the previous 10 years. While severe weather events were still the main driver of overall losses in 2019, amplified by socio-economic developments in affected areas and climate-change effects, the decrease in losses primarily stem from the absence of large and costly hurricanes in the US.<br/><br/>'Economic development and ever-increasing population concentration in urban centres, alongside changes in climate, will continue to increase losses due to weather events in the future,' said Edouard Schmid, Chairman of the Swiss Re Institute and Group Chief Underwriting Officer at Swiss Re. 'Our industry can play a key role by partnering with clients and governments to develop scalable solutions that support the transition to a low-carbon world by managing risks associated with renewable energy projects and making these more attractive to investors with re/insurance risk-transfer backing'.<br/><br/>Of the economic losses in 2019, USD 137 billion were due to natural disasters, with man-made events causing the remaining USD 9 billion. Of the USD 60 billion in insured losses, natural catastrophes accounted for USD 52 billion. The biggest industry loss events of 2019 happened in densely populated and developed parts of Japan: Typhoon Faxai in September (insured losses of USD 7 billion); followed by Typhoon Hagibis in October (additional insured losses of USD 8 billion).<br/><br/>Socio-economic trends mask the impact of climate change in a dynamic risk landscape<br/><br/>Economic development and population spread leads to changes in land use resulting in, for instance, deforestation and construction in flood plains and wildland-urban interface. Another variable is the scale of risk mitigation infrastructure like flood barriers and sea defences. This all influences the scale of losses inflicted by extreme weather events and other natural disasters.<br/><br/>The latest sigma includes a chapter authored by Professor Adam Sobel of Columbia University, which notes that the ways increasing temperatures change natural catastrophe risks are not fully understood due to the short history of observational records and other factors. However, it could take decades to gather the proof points to confirm the impact of climate change, Failure to take immediate tangible action could lead to climate systems reaching irreversible tipping points. This in turn could jeopardize insurability, particularly in areas where urbanisation and economic development have led to high levels of concentration of asset (human and physical) value exposure.<br/><br/>'It's difficult to quantify the exact effects rising temperatures have on specific weather related catastrophes, but climate change is a threat that demands immediate action due to its dire effects on both human life and the global economy,' said Jerome Jean Haegeli, Group Chief Economist at Swiss Re.<br/><br/>Climate change effects are already evident, and include rising sea levels, longer and more frequent heatwaves, and erratic rainfall patterns. Warmer temperatures will likely lead to growing frequency of extreme weather events, the report says. The damaging effects manifest most notably in secondary perils, as evident in each of the last three years. In 2019 specifically, the rainfall-induced floods that came with Typhoon Hagibis, the storm surge driven flooding from Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and monsoon rains in southeast Asia and from other weather systems wreaked economic and humanitarian havoc. Record-high temperatures in eastern Australia kept wildfires burning across millions of hectares of bushland in the longest-running wildfires the country has ever seen.<br/><br/>Weather risks remain insurable<br/><br/>All told, Swiss Re Institute believes that weather risks, with adaptation actions, remain insurable. Insurers need to adapt to a dynamic risk landscape by closely monitoring and incorporating socio-economic developments, the latest scientific research on climate change effects, and the status of local risk mitigation measures in their modelling. Many of today's catastrophe models are benchmarked against historical loss data, which does not reflect the current level of urbanisation, and hence do not fully account for today's quickly rising exposures, changing socio-economic environment and climate.<br/><br/>'To uphold the insurance risk transfer model as a powerful tool to foster resilience, insurers need to adapt before, not post events,' Martin Bertogg, Head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re said. 'To this end, insurers should be wary of historical loss records in understanding today's state of the socio-economic environment and climate. Averaging out over a past spanning multiple decades can lead to distorted risk assessment.'<br/><br/>Typhoon Hagibis is a case in point. Japan has always had high exposure to typhoon risk, and with huge investment in coastal and inland flood defence following the devastating typhoon events in the 1950s and 1960s, the re/insurance industry had considered flood risk in Japan to be largely mitigated. However, most of the USD 8 billion in insured losses from Typhoon Hagibis came from floods, and due to urban development since the mid-20th century, Tokyo was unprepared for the degree of physical damage it suffered.<br/><br/>'While flood defences prevented major havoc in parts of Greater Tokyo, at least 55 levee breaches and overflowing rivers illustrated that water inundation risk is only partially mitigated,' Bertogg said. 'The flood defences mitigated the impact, but by no means entirely.'<br/><br/>Table showing total economic and insured losses in 2019 and 2018Open slide in overlay<br/><br/>Table showing Insured versus uninsured losses between 1970 and 2019, in USD billion at 2019 pricesOpen slide in overlay<br/><br/>Notes to editors<br/><br/>Swiss Re<br/><br/>The Swiss Re Group is one of the world's leading providers of reinsurance, insurance and other forms of insurance-based risk transfer, working to make the world more resilient.

Public speaking has never really been a strong point for Scottish Rugby's head honcho.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is a man who once threatened legal action over a game of rugby, despite the fact a deadly typhoon had just ripped through the country in which the match was to be played.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once the dust had settled, Typhoon Hagibis went down as Japan's worst storm in over 60 years, killing over 100 people and destroying the homes of thousands of others.</p><p>The SRU were subsequently reprimanded by World Rugby, fined \u00a370,000, and told to apologise for crass and deeply ill-judged comments from their chief executive.</p><p>So, let's be in no doubt. Dodson is a man who only ever opens his mouth to change foot. His latest witterings on the future of Gregor Townsend provide further confirmation.</p><p>This was not a case of him getting the Paxman treatment on Newsnight. For the most part, it was a nice cosy chat with the BBC intended to portray Dodson as the all-seeing, all-knowing oracle of the SRU. Yet the hearty laughs all round couldn't drown out the fact Dodson had ducked all previous requests for interviews from the written press.</p><p>Prior to meeting with Townsend later this week, Dodson (right) obviously wanted to get the word out that he and the SRU had done their 'due diligence'. Well, thank heavens for that.</p><p>They are doing their homework on who they might wish to appoint as the new head coach once Townsend's contract expires after the World Cup. In other news, 'man does his job'.</p><p>But why the need to air it all in public like some sort of soap opera? Why the need to say anything at all, given Dodson's silence on matters far more serious than this?</p><p>He was less forthcoming and chatty when asked about Siobhan Cattigan. He needed the facts from the fact-finding mission, now six months old, before he could comment. But he did not know when these facts would present themselves.</p><p>Nor did he say anything throughout the Rufus McLean scandal. To be fair, the BBC didn't even ask about that during yesterday's podcast.</p><p>If anyone should be having to justify their position to the SRU board, then it should be Dodson, not Townsend. He is the Invisible Man of the SRU, who appears to speak only when it suits him and to a crowd of his choosing.</p><p>He's been in the job since 2011 and is one of the most well-remunerated chief execs in British rugby.</p><p>Listen, Townsend has no God-given right to keep the job. He's had six years with Scotland's most talented squad of players in a generation. That's more than a fair crack at it.</p><p>Yet nor does he deserve to have his future played out in public like this, with Dodson admitting he has been freely touting the job to others around the world.</p><p>It hardly strikes you as a harmonious relationship, does it? If everything is supposed to be aligned in an elite sporting environment, the SRU obviously didn't get the memo.</p><p>They've turned this whole episode into an omnishambles, right from the moment that details of Townsend's future emerged on the eve of the Six Nations.</p><p>Dodson can spout all he wants about 'due diligence'. It's just vacuous nonsense.</p><p>Even if Townsend was to move on, can we trust Dodson to lead the search for a new head coach?</p><p>Also, what exactly does the chief executive mean when he says he wants to know if Townsend is the 'right voice' to take the team forward?</p><p>What could the head coach possibly say that hasn't already been said over the course of the past six years? Let's talk and get to know each other more?</p><p>This isn't an episode of Blind Date.</p><p>Townsend shouldn't be having to whisper sweet nothings into Dodson's ear just to keep his job.</p><p>It was also deeply concerning to see the plight of the Scottish Under-20s in the Six Nations, thrashed by France, Ireland and even Italy.</p><p>They have been failed abysmally by the SRU, to the point they have become a laughing stock. Townsend admitted that the production of young players in this country is now becoming a very real concern.</p><p>This is not a new development. There's been a train coming down the tracks for years and the SRU have repeatedly neglected youth development under Dodson.</p><p>He claimed he was on top of that problem, though. They had a plan. It would just need some time.</p><p>Dodson will carry on and see out the remainder of his own contract, which runs until 2025. By then, the SRU media minions might need a pooper scooper to clear up his mess.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Invisible man: Dodson is rarely heard fromRough deal: Townsend's future is now a matter of public debate</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCMAIL-186683781</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCMAIL2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67Y1-C4P1-DYTY-C4NN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419634</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Newpapers Ltd.

What could Murrayfield muster in return? Definitely no Typhoon Haggis. Not even a storm on the east coast of Scotland. Just another mild, still afternoon at the end of an almost balmy week. Oh, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scotsman.com/sport/rugby-union/stuart-hogg-sets-all-time-scotland-try-record-against-japan-3465484\">Stuart Hogg</url>, hoping for a fair wind as he chased down history.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trouble was, the skipper couldn\u2019t get a touch, never mind a run, never mind a try deserving the epithet Hurricane Hogg and one to make him our most prolific crosser of the whitewash.</p><p>Japan, the absolute spoilsports, point-blank refused to boot the ball long, allowing him to embark on one of his thrilling, careering charges from the back.</p><p>The clock was about to register 20 minutes before he was given the opportunity. The most exciting piece of play up until that moment - Sam Johnson\u2019s dinked kick which almost put in man-of-the-match Chris Harris for a score before some fleet-footed and bold Japanese defending rescued the situation - eventually led to Hogg gaining possession. Right, he must have said to himself, here goes. Perfectly understandably, he got excited. After one of those trademark skips, which presumably enable him to generate more velocity, he set off diagonally but quickly ran into some downtown Tokyo traffic.</p><p>Still, at least Hogg was involved now. And the next time Scotland attacked he was hugely prominent. Finn Russell sprung him on halfway and he blurred past several red and white shirts. He could have gone for glory himself at that moment but, playing the captain\u2019s part, flung out wide to fellow Hawick man Darcy Graham.</p><p>The ball was recycled, Russell set him up again, and this time, after a little shimmy, the space opened up. Hoggy roared through it and before touching down, pumped his left fist in delight.</p><p>A leap into the air confirmed the 25th try, passing the record he\u2019d held jointly this past week with Ian Smith and Tony Stanger.</p><p>Then came the quieter element to the celebration. Hogg always makes a \u201cW\u201d with his hands in memory of his best pal, Richard Wilkinson, killed in a car crash on a Borders road in 2009. This time he seemed to gaze into the heavens for a few seconds longer than after the previous 24.</p><p>That World Cup game, of course, was won by Japan. Though Typhoon Hagibis had abated before kickoff, Scotland were blown away on the park, and what was only our second-ever exit from the tournament at group stage forced a rethink on speed vs solidity. Since then the defence has been much more mean-spirited.</p><p>Japan in this game were striving for something of the vigorous rhythm of the taiko drummers who were part of the pre-match entertainment before yet another 67,000-plus crowd, but the Brave Blossoms\u2019 progress post-2019 has been disrupted by the pandemic. It didn\u2019t look like they needed much familiarisation with the egg in the opening minutes, though, and zippy, flippy handling featuring just about every member of the XV offered the promise of a free-flowing contest. Eventually Russell got his hands on the ball and cleared upfield, where Scotland stayed until their first try. Without doing very much compared to the effort expended by their visitors, they went ahead through Duhan van der Merwe.</p><p>After\u2019s Hogg\u2019s record-breaker, Scotland\u2019s third try came from a surge from Russell, the kind which Japan, for all their clever handling and patient build-up, had been unable to fashion. Graham seemed likely to be halted in the act of scoring but the little wingman checked himself, allowing his would-be tackler to overshoot, and he was able to scuttle over the line.</p><p>The fourth from Stuart McInally, after a couple of Japan penalties had brought the visitors to within a converted try, almost allowed Scotland to relax. Russell, showing his two-footedness, launched a big kick with his left to maintain pressure and Harris continued with some big hits, but a fifth didn\u2019t come and the game went into a lull during which there were multiple substitutions, including dark-blue debuts for Dylan Richardson and Javan Sebastian. Then Tevita Tatafu went over for a try and Japan were again in touch with their hosts.</p><p>Hogg\u2019s second half had been quiet - just one break. But he had to concentrate on defensive duties as three times in rapid succession the Brave Blossoms threatened to break through the midfield. They could have pinched the game in the final ten minutes. The crowd, though, didn\u2019t seem anxious. Indeed, they launched a Mexican Wave round the stadium. Perhaps they knew that Pierre Schoeman, fast becoming a cult Murrayfield favourite with his bad hair and bullocking charges, would quell Japan\u2019s last-gasp attempt to stun Scotland again.
