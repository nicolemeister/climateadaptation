This unprecedented event led to the immediate deployment of Japanese fighter jets. The incursion occurred amid rising tensions in the East China Sea, where Chinas military activities have been increasing, raising concerns about Beijings strategic objectives in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan identified the entry of a BZK-005 reconnaissance drone into its expanded airspace, along with a Chengdu GJ-2, also known as the Wing Loong 2, for the first time. These aircraft, originating from the East China Sea, passed through the airspace between Okinawas main island and Miyako Island before entering the Pacific Ocean. They continued south of Okinawa, flying near the Amami Oshima Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, before reversing course and returning to the East China Sea via the same route. In response to this activity, Japans Air Self-Defense Force promptly scrambled fighter jets from the Southwestern Air Defense Command to intercept and monitor the drones. This command operates the 9th Air Wing, which fields Mitsubishi F-15J fighters, a Japanese variant of the F-15 Eagle, optimized for the country's air defense missions.</p><p>The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan represents a significant development. This Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance (MALE) drone is designed for both reconnaissance and strike missions, enhancing China's ability to project power in contested areas. While the GJ-2 has previously been observed over the Taiwan Strait, its operation near Okinawa indicates an expansion of Chinas unmanned aerial operations in the region. The increasing use of drones by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) reflects a broader strategy to leverage these systems for advanced surveillance, targeting, and potentially precision strikes while reducing risks to human pilots.</p><p>The Wing Loong II, developed by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), is an upgraded version of the Wing Loong I, offering improved payload capacity, endurance, and operational versatility. First unveiled at the 2015 Aviation Expo China, it was designed to meet the growing requirements of the Chinese military and international buyers. Measuring 11 meters in length with a 20.5-meter wingspan and a maximum speed of 370 km/h, it is powered by a turbocharged engine driving a three-bladed propeller. With an endurance of 32 hours and an operational range of 1,500 km, it is well-suited for extended surveillance missions in strategic areas.</p><p>Equipped with satellite communications and an electro-optical sensor suite that includes daylight and infrared cameras, the Wing Loong II can operate in both day and night conditions across various environments. It has a payload capacity of 400 kg, spread across six hardpoints, enabling it to carry guided bombs such as the FT-9/50, air-to-ground missiles like the TL-10, and GB3 250 kg bombs. Compared to its predecessor, which had a limited payload of 100 kg over two hardpoints, this expanded capability positions the Wing Loong II as a more advanced armed drone. Remotely piloted from a mobile ground control station, it provides real-time secure data transmission for operational flexibility.</p><p>Primarily developed for export, the Wing Loong II has been acquired by several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Serbia. It is marketed as a cost-effective alternative to Western drones such as the U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper, with an estimated unit price between $1 million and $2 million, compared to approximately $30 million for a Reaper. This affordability and versatility make it an attractive option for militaries seeking to enhance their strike and surveillance capabilities. The drone has been used in various conflicts, including Libya, where it conducted airstrikes under Emirati control in 2020. It has also been deployed for non-military missions, such as disaster response during the 2021 Henan floods, where a modified Wing Loong II variant carried out reconnaissance and communication relay operations.</p><p>The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan aligns with broader regional tensions in the East China Sea. This area, particularly around the Senkaku Islandsadministered by Japan but claimed by China as the Diaoyu Islandshas seen frequent incursions by Chinese military aircraft. Just two days before the GJ-2 incident, Japan detected two Chinese Y-9 military aircraft flying a similar route between the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Y-9, a multi-role aircraft used for intelligence gathering and maritime patrol, is regularly involved in such operations, prompting Japan to deploy fighters in response.</p><p>Japans Ministry of Defense has raised concerns about China's increasing military presence and its potential impact on regional stability. Although the Chinese drones did not violate Japans sovereign airspace, their proximity is seen as a show of force and a possible attempt to test Japans air defense response. A spokesperson for Japans Joint Staff confirmed that the country is maintaining constant airspace surveillance and will take all necessary measures to ensure security.</p><p>This Chinese drone incursion coincides with the U.S.-Japan joint military exercise \"Iron Fist,\" which runs until March 7 and involves maneuvers across multiple locations, including Okinawa. During this exercise, the simultaneous presence of the GJ-2 and BZK-005 near Japanese islands raises questions about potential surveillance activities or strategic messaging from Beijing. The PLA has previously escalated operations in response to military exercises conducted by the U.S. and its allies, highlighting an ongoing competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>The growing integration of drones into China's military strategy presents a challenge for Japan and its partners, who must adapt their defense capabilities to counter these evolving threats. The potential use of armed drones near Japans territory raises considerations about strengthening detection, interception, and counter-drone measures. As China continues to expand its military presence in the region, Japan and its allies remain vigilant, closely monitoring any developments that could alter the strategic balance in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DEFMON-478333497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEFMON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F83-MFR3-S1F7-73SY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">428128</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1053\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Global Data Point.

Recently, the BBC spread rumours when reporting on the heavy rainfall in Zhengzhou, saying that 'passengers were thrown into the station and left to die'!\" a 25 July article by Shanghai-based state-run weekly news magazine Xinmin Weekly, by-lined Chen Mu, said.</p><p>On China's tightly controlled,  Twitter-like social media platform Weibo, user posts, mostly by well-known nationalist users with large followings, targeted Robin Brant.</p><p>The 24 July Weibo hashtag \"BBC rumour mongering\" had around 100 million views and 35,000 comments as of 0900 gmt on 26 July.</p><p>\"Besides underworld filters, there is also disinformation. The UK's BBC has used the Henan floods for rumour-mongering,\" an online forum Diba said on Weibo.</p><p>Locals 'outraged' by foreign journalists</p><p>Media and web users in China released a video clip on domestic and foreign social media platforms on 24 and 25 July of \"outraged\" locals in Zhengzhou \"confronting\" Mathias Boelinger, a reporter from German government-funded broadcaster Deutsche Welle (DW), whom they mistook for Brant, as well as Alice Su, head of the LA Times's Bejing Bureau.  </p><p>\"A BBC reporter took a video here at Zhengzhou Railway Station and was stopped by passers-by who refused to let him go,\" the caption of one video circulated by a Weibo user said on 25 July, which had around 4.84 million views.  </p><p>\"People speculated whether he [Boelinger] was a CNN or BBC reporter, and they were worried whether he would engage in selective reporting and maliciously smear China. After all, BBC reporter Robin Brant's rumour about the Zhengzhou floods on 22nd has just been flamed by Chinese web users!\" Shanghai-based privately-run news website Guancha.cn tweeted in Chinese on 25 July.</p><p>\"However, the reporter who was surrounded does not work for CNN, nor does he have anything to do with the BBC. He was Mathias Boelinger, a reporter for DW. So how did he report the Henan floods? Is China still being distorted under the cloak of ideology?\" Guancha.cn added.</p><p>Several foreign journalists, including the Associated Press (AP) journalist Dake Kang, and Al Jazeera's Katrina Yu, reported cases of \"intimidation\" on the streets of Zhengzhou as they covered the aftermath of the flooding on 24 and 25 July.</p><p>Chinese journalists justify public anger on Twitter</p><p>On Twitter, which is inaccessible in mainland China, several state media journalists said the Chinese public had \"legitimate grounds\" for anger against foreign journalists, blaming the BBC's reporting on the Henan floods.</p><p>\"Why this happened? Ppl [people] from zhengzhou mistakenly take Mathias as BBC's Robin. The BBC reporter calling metro floods victims 'passengers left to die '- which intentionally/mistakenly translated into 'throw passengers to the platform and wait to die'. That really make locals angry,\" Meng Zhe (203 followers), a journalist with state-run China Daily, tweeted in English on 25 July.</p><p>Global Times reporter Alex Yang Sheng (1.1K followers) countered a tweet on 25 July by BBC Beijing correspondent Stephen McDonell who said that the Communist Youth League had led an \"orchestrated\" campaign against foreign media in Zhengzhou.</p><p>\"You guys just refuse to admit that it was you, Western media with bias and hostility, who offend Chinese first. If you really come here for the good of Chinese, the people here will welcome you. But they have learnt a lot about your nasty behaviours in China, so don't complain,\" Yang tweeted in English on 25 July.</p><p>BBC Chinese report questioned </p><p>An earlier Guancha.cn article by contributor Zhang Zhaodong on 22 July flagged up a social media backlash over a 21 July Chinese-language tweet and report by the BBC Chinese Service on the Henan floods.  </p><p>The BBC's tweet and report said that despite Zhengzhou's investment of more than 50 billion yuan (7.7 billion dollars) to build a sponge city with a strong flood prevention, the rainstorms appeared to have \"shattered that myth\".</p><p>The report, along with a Guancha.cn Chinese-subtitled 23 July video on Twitter, accused the BBC of resorting to \"famous double standards\" again, this time over its coverage of floods in Europe and in Zhengzhou.</p><p>\"The disasters were caused by heavy rainfall, yet the BBC used two faces when reporting on the floods in Europe and the rainstorms in Zhengzhou. The BBC played by the rules when reporting on the floods in Europe; but when reporting on the Zhengzhou rainstorms, it began to bring to make inappropriate assertions, disregard the facts, and deliberately highlight that 'the myth of Zhengzhou as a sponge city has been shattered',\" Zhang commented.</p><p>Source: Chinese sources in Chinese (written) 26 Jul 21</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBCMIR-JUL2621FST3787</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBCMIR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6378-MJJ1-JC8S-C1J8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">10962</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 British Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>BBC Monitoring Asia Pacific - Political <br/>Supplied by BBC Worldwide Monitoring</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30259\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 26, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0009SVI</classCode><className>LOS ANGELES TIMES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0005AOM</classCode><className>DEUTSCHE WELLE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC2711 NEWSPAPERS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

During climate-related emergencies including floods, wildfires, heatwaves, or winter storms, blackouts often occur due to demand-related stress or physical damage to the power distribution system (e.g., Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria 2017, Australia bushfires 2019, Texas winter freeze 2021, Henan floods 2021). Such power outages can disrupt the fundamental needs of the populace, e.g., heating/cooling, food, and communication. Supply chains for fuels such as petrol and diesel can also be affected due to the damage to critical transport infrastructure. Given that the availability of energy resources is critical for life preservation and recovery efforts in the aftermath of a disaster, microgrids are a widely-regarded solution to provide uninterrupted power to critical loads\u2013. Microgrids energize portions of the grid from the bottom up by coordinating locally available power generators (photovoltaic systems and diesel generators), storage units (community battery banks and vehicle-to-grid installations), and electrical loads,. In exchange for a guarantee of a low-amperage uninterrupted power access, a community of residents can opt in to pay for a microgrid setup through a localized levy to finance the installation of backup devices and associated supporting infrastructure.</p><p>As extreme weather events become increasingly frequent, and microgrid technologies become more mature, power sector vendors are expanding their portfolios in the microgrid space\u2013. This makes microgrids increasingly affordable, efficient, accessible, and mainstream. Further, governments such as that of California are investing significantly in community microgrid ventures. For these to succeed in practice, businesses need to consider, apart from the technical aspects, the social implications behind how energy is managed within a microgrid during blackouts. Particularly, it is important to recognize that a community microgrid is limited by the overall energy storage capacity present (in the form of batteries or diesel fuel) and cannot provide power indefinitely. At the same time, major blackouts from extreme weather events can last several days or even weeks (Texas winter freeze 2021 - over 2 days, Australia bushfires 2019 - up to 10 days, Puerto Rico Hurricane Maria - 84 days). Note that during a blackout, some consumers might be willing to pay large sums of money to continue to use electricity, which necessarily comes at an expense to others, given the scarcity of available energy. However, such a practice that views energy as a paid service may not be socially acceptable. Recognizing that continued energy access is a matter of life and death, microgrid operators should ensure equity and fairness in how the stored energy is rationed amongst the consumers. Otherwise, the viability of a market-based mechanism within the community would become questionable.</p><p>Surveys have been extensively conducted to elicit consumers\u2019 willingness-to-pay (WTP) for uninterrupted power supply (US\u2013, Europe, Ghana, India,, Indonesia). While these studies are directly related to the economic considerations in microgrid planning, they do not inform us on how such a microgrid should indeed be operated. Given that energy could be critical for survival during extreme weather events, and that perceived fairness of the payment and energy-use framework has been documented, to have an impact on WTP for backup services (which can be viewed here as a proxy for societal acceptance of such services), it is essential to study the preferences of the populace thorough a survey, and identify the factors that influence them. Therefore, the primary goal of this study is to identify consumer preferences towards a differentiated service paradigm for community microgrids, where those who pay more receive a higher consumption quota. Our first hypothesis (H1) is that respondents will be against a conventional market-based system where certain residents could pay more to use more electricity during blackouts, depleting the share of others. Since some residents might be willing to pay significantly high prices to continue receiving backup power during contingencies, the expectation is that survey responses would skew towards favoring equal energy-use quotas for all residents. It is worth noting that prior studies (e.g., ref. ) that conducted surveys to estimate WTP for backup services did not inform respondents on the inherent limit of overall backup energy available; it may therefore not be possible to extrapolate the results (e.g., reported critical electricity amperes) to design energy-use quotas in practice. Other studies (e.g., ref. ) have considered how fairness indicators can be included in regulating energy consumption in the microgrid paradigm, but did not discuss how the values of these indicators are ascertained in practice.</p><p>In addition to community resources such as centralized battery storage and diesel generators, microgrid operators can tap into distributed resources that already exist within the community during blackouts. For instance, rooftop renewable generation and household battery storage are now commercially available, e.g., Tesla SolarRoof and PowerWall, which can offset utility consumption and reduce bills under normal circumstances. Several electric vehicle manufacturers (e.g., Ford F-150 Lightning,) also enable vehicle-to-grid services to obtain monetary compensation from utilities for services such as peak shifting. These technologies currently offer the capability of powering up a house for a few days during blackouts. Nonetheless, while the technical feasibility of integrating distributed storage resources is sound, the amount of energy that microgrid operators can retrieve from these resources depends on the willingness of consumers to share. Regrettably, this crucial factor has not been considered in previous studies, potentially leading to overestimation of available energy resources. The second goal of our study is therefore to elicit the amount of stored energy these consumers are willing to sell (termed here as willingness-to-sell (WTS)). The WTS would be a hedged trade-off between the expected blackout duration, available personal storage capacity, and thereby the perceived surplus. This yields our second hypothesis (H2) that respondents would make a rational decision based on self-preservation, duly reducing their WTS when the personal storage capacity reduces, or when the blackout is expected to last longer. Ultimately, the goal is to estimate the amount of stored energy that the residents are willing to sell, and how it varies with the expected blackout duration, contributing towards more accurate estimates of consumer participation and informing calculations on leveraging such participation for the reduction in centralized storage,. Finally, we wish to study the interdependence between the responses relating to H1 and H2, so as to ensure that the designed energy-use framework is socially acceptable both from the consumer and supplier perspectives.</p><p>In this work, we analyze the results of a survey of US respondents to elicit their preferences on energy management in a community microgrid during blackouts. We find (a) strong support for a differentiated service paradigm where consumers can pay more to secure higher energy quotas (91.8% of respondents), and (b) a strong inclination to sell from personal energy storage (91.4% of respondents), with the mean WTS ranging between 42\u201353% of the available storage. We also observe that while the WTS is proportional to the storage capacity of the resource owned, it increases when the perceived blackout duration is longer. Our findings enable microgrid manufacturers and electricity retailers to develop and implement an energy-use framework that is socially and economically fair under energy-scarcity situations, accelerating community acceptance and deployment.</p><p>Results</p><p>To ascertain the preferences of individuals on the fairness of a differentiated service paradigm and the WTS for resource owners, we conducted a web-based survey of 1021 respondents from the US. The survey first explains to the respondents the consequences of prolonged blackouts, and the capabilities and limitations of a community microgrid in providing backup power. It then elicits the respondents\u2019 preferences on how energy quotas for different residences served by the microgrid should be set up. Finally, it poses questions on WTS in the hypothetical scenario that the respondent owns one of the following storage resources: Ford F-150 electric vehicle, Tesla PowerWall, or portable diesel generator. Each of these devices has a different utility under normal circumstances\u2014transportation, offsetting energy consumption, and camping respectively\u2014but can be used during blackouts to power up a residence. The framework of the survey is shown in Fig.\u00a0. Further details and the survey questionnaire are given in Methods and .</p><p>Framework of the web-based survey.</p><p>The\u00a0survey\u00a0elicits respondent perceptions on the fairness of a differentiated service scheme for energy rationing in a community microgrid, and their willingness to sell stored energy during a blackout.</p><p>Fairness in differentiated service</p><p>The overall energy stored in a microgrid is determined by the installed centralized battery capacity and the fuel tank capacity associated with the diesel generator. We study how this energy should be apportioned to the various participating residences by eliciting responses on a Likert scale on the respondents\u2019 support for a scenario where the quota allocated depends on the amount paid beforehand. This is in contrast to the scenario where each resident gets an equal quota and pays an equal price for the backup service. The responses are given in Fig.\u00a0, where over 91.8% of the respondents indicate support for the differentiated service paradigm for the participating residences, with a response greater than or equal to 5 (mean = 6.595, s.d. = 2.065 on a Likert scale from 0 to 10). The propositions that residents who use less power (e.g., by judicious use of energy) should receive energy for longer, and that backup power supply should be terminated immediately for residents who exhaust their quotas during the course of the blackout, also received strong support. Directly contradicting hypothesis H1, these results indicate that the respondents view emergency energy backup as similar to non-emergency services and support a traditional market paradigm\u2014although this could perhaps change if respondents experience more frequent or more severe blackouts.</p><p>Survey responses pertaining to a differentiated service paradigm for community microgrids.</p><p>a Histogram showing the preference of respondents on the fairness of differentiated service, quota-based usage, and whether usage quotas should be strictly enforced during a blackout. Here, the responses are on a Likert scale from 0 to 10, where a larger number indicates stronger support. b Responses on the payment plan perceived to be the most fair for availing of backup service from the community microgrid, where the choices differ in the fixed cost per year (USD($)/year) and variable cost ($/blackout day (BD)). c Density plots showing the probability distribution of the additional amount of money that respondents are willing to pay per year towards providing backup for economically weaker residents in the community. Responses are grouped according to the responses from (b), where values above $1000 are capped at $1000.</p><p>In exchange for receiving backup power during blackouts, we presented respondents with the following yearly payment options in the expectation of 10 blackout days per year: (i) a one-time yearly payment of USD($) 200, (ii) a reduced one-time payment of $100 with additional $20 per blackout day (i.e., $100\u2013300 per year), or (iii) a lower one-time charge of $50 with dynamic pricing between $20\u201340 per blackout day (i.e., $50\u2013450 per year). For context, the average monthly electricity bill in the continental US ranged from $84\u2013187 in 2022 depending on the state, and a 2020 study reported a median WTP of $43 per blackout day. Referring to Fig.\u00a0, amongst the respondents who indicated a particular preference, over half favored the plans with variable annual cost, suggesting that they expect that blackouts would be less frequent in reality and therefore wish to reduce their upfront monetary commitment towards power backup. The results are not region-specific, remaining largely consistent for respondents from the western and eastern parts of the US; see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. We also investigated the choice of respondents who endured blackouts exceeding one day (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0). Interestingly, this set showed a clear inclination towards the plan with a fixed annual cost of $200. This suggests that, as more individuals experience prolonged power outages, fixed-cost payment options are likely to become more attractive. Based on the above options, we then presented the maximum yearly amounts that the respondents have committed to the community microgrid ($200, up to $300, up to $450, and $200 for those who expressed no particular preference), and then asked them how much more per year they are willing to pay to subsidize economically weaker residents of the community (see Fig.\u00a0). Despite different committed amounts, we find that most respondents are willing to pay a median value between $50 and $150 per year. Furthermore, our investigation reveals an intriguing phenomenon where respondents who are hesitant to pay a higher upfront annual cost are willing to pay more to support others, as depicted by Fig.\u00a0. To explain this observation, we instead studied the correlation between the latter value and the maximum yearly amount they committed to paying for backup, as this was also displayed in the survey question for each payment plan. Here, a Spearman test revealed a statistically significant relationship (p-value \u00a0\u2248\u00a00\u00a0\u226a\u00a00.05) suggesting a potential anchoring effect; those committed to paying more for the backup service also volunteered higher amounts to help their community.</p><p>Willingness to sell stored energy</p><p>Given the limited nature of stored energy, the microgrid operator may contract resource owners (e.g., those who own battery storage, diesel generators, etc.) to purchase any available surplus to supplement the existing resources in the microgrid. Such an arrangement can also serve to reduce the centralized battery size and significantly reduce the capital cost for the microgrid infrastructure. Notably, while the participation of individual resource owners towards mitigating generation deficits for monetary compensation is already a mainstream practice in power grids (termed as ancillary services), the decision-making process in selling energy to a microgrid during a blackout involves the conflicting objective of self-preservation. An accurate estimate of the fraction of community residents that are willing to participate in such a contract, and their WTS, would be valuable due to the earlier reasons. From our survey, about 91.4% of the respondents were interested in selling surplus energy in the hypothetical scenario that they owned a storage resource (mean = 6.414, s.d. = 1.860 on a Likert scale from 0 to 10); see Fig.\u00a0. Furthermore, Fig.\u00a0 shows that the WTS responses were strongly correlated to how fair the respondents found the differentiated service paradigm (linear regression slope = 0.322, p-value of T-test \u00a0\u2248\u00a00). This suggests that respondents who believe in the market-based energy-consumption framework under scarcity are also more likely to participate in selling to the same market, should they own a storage resource. In exchange for such residence-to-microgrid energy sharing, both higher energy quotas and monetary returns appear acceptable; see Fig.\u00a0.</p><p>Survey responses on willingness-to-sell (WTS).</p><p>a How willing the respondents are to participate in a contract where they sell energy to the microgrid from personal storage in exchange for a payment.

The size of the circles represents the number of respondents. c Preferences on the nature of payment for selling energy to the microgrid. d\u2013f Heat map of the WTS for an anticipated 2-day blackout versus a 7-day blackout for the three cohorts. Here, the solid line is the result of a linear regression, and the coordinates indicate the mean WTS.</p><p>To determine WTS and how it is impacted by the capacity of personal storage as well as the perceived surplus (based on anticipated blackout duration), the respondents were divided randomly into one of 3 cohorts. In each, the respondents were presented with the hypothetical scenario that they owned a Ford F-150 electric vehicle (cohort size 339), Tesla PowerWall (cohort size 342), or portable diesel generator (cohort size 340). These devices were explained to have different energy storage capacities, and that they could power a typical US residence for 10, 3, or 2 days, respectively. Given the differences in storage capacity amongst the cohorts, we designed the questions on WTS to report in percentages of the overall storage capacity. The results are shown in Table\u00a0, where the indicated percentages correspond to the mid-points of the intervals selected by the respondents in the survey. Surprisingly, opposite to our second hypothesis where we initially supposed a reduction in WTS when blackouts are anticipated to be longer, the survey results for each cohort indicate that the WTS increases when the blackout duration increases from 2 to 7 days; see Fig.\u00a0. In other words, these results are inconsistent with H2. Note that this is despite reminding the survey respondents that their own stored energy would decrease should they choose to sell to the microgrid. This could perhaps be due to two reasons: (i) a desire to obtain more revenue by selling more energy during a longer blackout, or (ii) a willingness borne out of responsibility to help the rest of the community during a worsening predicament. To delve into this aspect further, we conducted a Spearman test to examine the correlation between the increase in WTS and the participants\u2019 willingness to allow their neighbors to charge their electronic devices during a blackout. The outcome of the test revealed a negative correlation of \u00a0\u22120.098 (p = 0.0017), which challenges the hypothesis that the increase in WTS is driven by a sense of communal responsibility. Further, we analyzed the increase in WTS for respondents who opted for reductions in fees, cash incentives, and increased energy quotas as compensation mechanisms. The results show a notable 7.64% increase in average WTS for this group, with a statistically significant difference in the paired sample test (p-value \u00a0\u2248\u00a00). This analysis suggests that the primary motivation behind the increased WTS is the individual\u2019s desire to obtain additional revenue.</p><p>Summary of the respondents\u2019 willingness-to-sell (WTS) for different blackout durations</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"10\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\" morerows=\"1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col6\" namest=\"col2\">Response on WTS of different cohorts</entry><entry colname=\"col7\" nameend=\"col9\" namest=\"col7\">Linear regression (2 days vs 7 days)</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">KS test for change in WTS (2 days vs 7 days)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col2\">Blackout</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Lowest</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Median</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Highest</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">s.d.</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Slope</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">Intercept</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry><entry colname=\"col10\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">p</emphasis>-value</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cohort 1:Ford F-150</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2 days</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">45%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.187</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.464</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">32.51%</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">?\u00a0 0</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">Cohort 1 - Cohort 2:0.992</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">7 days</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">55%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.224</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cohort 2:PowerWall</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2 days</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">45%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.168</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.617</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">24.53%</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">?\u00a0 0</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">Cohort 2 - Cohort 3:0.999</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">7 days</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">55%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.226</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cohort 3:Diesel Gen</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2 days</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">5%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">45%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">0.175</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">0.292</entry><entry colname=\"col8\">39.59%</entry><entry colname=\"col9\">?\u00a0 0</entry><entry colname=\"col10\">Cohort 3 - Cohort 1:0.978</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">7 days</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">5%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">55%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">95%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.216</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>p-values of linear regression are based on two-sided T-test. The KS test is also two-sided.</p><p>For each cohort, we conducted the paired sample test to check whether the blackout duration had a statistically significant effect on the WTS responses. Here, the p-values \u00a0\u2248\u00a00, indicate that a statistically significant difference does exist. We further confirm this positive correlation using linear regression; see Table\u00a0. These observations also hold when all the cohorts are considered together, as seen from Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. To determine whether the increase in WTS for longer blackout durations is dependent on the available storage capacity, we conducted two-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (KS) tests to compare the distributions of the WTS difference for a 2-day versus 7-day blackout. For the cohort combinations taken pairwise in cyclic order, the p-values were respectively 0.992, 0.999, and 0.978 (all \u226b0.05), indicating that the capacity does not have a statistically significant impact on WTS decisions. This is also evident from the probability distributions of the responses given in Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. It should however be noted that since the WTS values were reported in percentages of the overall storage capacity, the actual WTS would be proportional to the storage capacity, meaning that this section of results is in accordance with hypothesis H2. In fact, when the respondents were broadly asked if they would sell more energy during a blackout if they had a larger capacity, they overwhelmingly agreed (from Supplementary Fig.\u00a0, mean = 6.759, s.d. = 1.740 on a Likert scale from 0 to 10). Overall, this suggests that WTS estimates from the survey may be broadly applicable to different storage device types and models. We further inquired about the price at which respondents would be willing to sell their energy to the microgrid (refer to Supplementary Fig.\u00a0. The results indicate that a majority of respondents who expect compensation prefer a higher price than the normal electricity price.</p><p>Relationships to demographic data</p><p>Finally, we analyze the survey responses in the context of the demographic data of the respondents. Referring to Table\u00a0, we find that the responses on the fairness of differentiated service and WTS both exhibit significant positive correlations to the income of the respondents. An implication here is that the section of the population with relatively higher financial capacity to invest in, and be the most likely to own storage resources, is more inclined to participate in buying and selling energy from community microgrids. The results also suggest that relatively older, more educated individuals tend to view a differentiated service paradigm as less fair, and have a lower WTS. Individuals with these demographic characteristics could potentially have increased awareness or experience of the consequences of a blackout, resulting in a more risk-averse stance. Despite a positive correlation between income and education level (\u03c1 = 0.136, p-value \u00a0\u2248\u00a00 in Spearman test), their effects on perceived fairness and WTS diverge, which is presented as opposite signs of their coefficients in the linear regression. Along similar lines, we find a negative correlation between blackout experience and the perceived fairness of differentiated service. This implies that individuals who have experienced longer blackouts are less inclined to support the market-based mechanism. Additionally, we find that sex, ethnicity, and employment status do not have much bearing on either the perceived fairness of differentiated service or the WTS. It is worth mentioning here that the same demographic factors\u2014age, income, and education level\u2014have been found to influence WTP decisions in other studies as well,\u2013,.</p><p>Linear regression of the perceived fairness of differentiated service and willingness-to-sell (WTS) with demographic data</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"120\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><thead><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Demographics</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col2\">Perceived fairness of differentiated service</entry><entry colname=\"col4\" nameend=\"col5\" namest=\"col4\">WTS for 2-day blackout</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\">Coefficient</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">s.e.</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Coefficient</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">s.e.</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Income</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.372*</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.083</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.316*</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.069</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Age</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?0.021*</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.011</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?0.029*</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.009</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Education</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?0.094*</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.047</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?0.240*</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.039</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Blackout experience</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?0.193*</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.077</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.084</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.064</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Not full-time employed</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?0.222</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.329</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">?0.515</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.276</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Female</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.143</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.133</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.027</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.111</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Hispanic</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">?0.250</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.157</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.050</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.131</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Constant</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7.351*</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.489</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">4.897*</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.410</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>s.e. standard error.</p><p>*Statistically significant, i.e., p-value of two-sided T-test is below 0.05.</p><p>While our results broadly indicate that the respondents overwhelmingly prefer a market-based or capitalistic approach to transact energy during blackouts, a majority of respondents nevertheless express empathy with other residents in the community. Specifically, they would (i) be willing to share food with neighbors during blackouts (mean = 6.934, s.d. = 1.841 on a Likert scale from 0 to 10), or (ii) allow them to charge electronic devices in their homes (mean = 6.831, s.d. \u00a0= 1.985), should they have backup power available; see Supplementary Figs.\u00a0 and . We also observe that these two preferences are correlated (see Supplementary Fig.\u00a0, which reveals that respondents\u2019 empathy is reflected consistently across the various survey questions; the response trends on the fairness of differentiated service and WTS are therefore realistic.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>While a microgrid entails participants buying and selling backup energy during blackouts, its operation differs significantly from the conventional market paradigm. That is, energy is a scarce commodity and could be critical for survival during long blackouts. Despite this key difference, our research finds that US residents generally prefer a market-based system where consumers can pay more to use more energy during a blackout, and residents are rewarded for storing and sharing energy. Survey respondents also continue to support such a differentiated service paradigm when the blackouts are expected to be more severe and longer. This contradicts our hypothesis H1 that people would prefer equal usage quotas for all residents. This finding suggests that while community microgrids could arguably be viewed as a community service, it may be socially acceptable to implement a market mechanism (with some subsidies for economically weaker residents). With regard to residence-to-microgrid energy transactions, the results are partly inconsistent with hypothesis H2 that the WTS decision-making process rationally leans towards self-preservation. While our results show that the amount of energy the respondents are willing to sell is proportional to the available storage capacity, they also show that a substantial number of respondents prefer to sell more to gain higher monetary compensation even at the cost of increasing personal risk of losing backup power, suggesting that they do not actually expect to remain without power for extended periods of time. We also uncover that respondents are willing to sell their excess energy at a price higher than the regular rate. Diverse reimbursement plans such as microgrid fee reductions, cash incentives, and increased usage quotas, can be considered effective incentives to engage customers in selling their surplus energy. These findings carry important implications for developing successful business models for community microgrids, as well as for policymaking and regulation. In fact, considering that more distributed storage is now available, and that community microgrids at present rely largely on bulk investment into centralized storage/generation, the use of a market framework for distributed storage/generation can alleviate investment costs. This makes greenfield community microgrid projects more economically and technically viable.</p><p>We note that the results presented in this work relate to respondents from the continental US. However, the following observations suggest that the results could be more broadly applicable. While prior studies have noted statistically significant correlations between the blackout experience and the willingness-to-pay (WTP) for uninterrupted backup (e.g., Ghana, India), we did not observe similar correlations of the blackout experience with the perceived urgency to invest into backup solutions and WTS (p-values of Spearman test are respectively 0.278 and 0.832). This could perhaps be due to the fact that in the present survey, the consequences of long blackouts were explained in detail to the respondents, mitigating the impact of a lack of personal experience (similar findings were previously reported in the context of WTP). Overall, this implies that surveys regarding community microgrid energy management can be carried out on a general populace, and not necessarily from those previously affected by long blackouts, to obtain meaningful results. Note that there is the possibility that the WTS responses could be affected by the hypothetical bias as not all respondents currently own a storage device, especially given that the community microgrid concept has not yet proliferated in the continental US. Moreover, the attitudes of individuals toward fairness and willingness to share may change over time. Yet, it is essential that the outcome of WTS research\u2014an energy-use framework for community microgrids\u2014should be palatable even to a na\u00efve populace to enjoy broad societal acceptance.</p><p>Overall, microgrids are required for life preservation and recovery in times of crises such as climate emergencies and war. Heretofore, electrical engineers often assume that the various elements of a microgrid are fully controllable and optimizable, except in the instance of direct human interventions such as demand response. However, even for distributed storage, there is a human element of ownership and decision-making involved that is particularly complex due to energy scarcity. In reality, as we have shown, WTS is not 100%, which makes WTS an important question that has not been formerly considered. The next step would be to develop a socially acceptable market mechanism for community microgrids during blackouts. Establishing such an operational philosophy is fundamental to developing a sustainable business model for microgrids, and more broadly, the energy-as-a-service model during blackouts and emergencies.</p><p>Methods</p><p>Survey design</p><p>Prior work on WTP estimation suggests that the respondents express accurate preferences when they are educated on the consequences of a blackout. Therefore, the survey begins with a detailed description of the consequences of extreme weather events and the blackouts that result thereof. The survey follows up with questions to gauge the respondents\u2019 experience with electricity blackouts including blackout duration, the electric loads they consider essential during a blackout, and their (planned) ownership of backup solutions. Since one of the goals of the survey is to elicit preferences on WTS that relates to electrical energy in community microgrids, we included questions to understand whether respondents are generally willing to share other essential items such as food and water with their neighbors, or allowing them to charge essential electronic devices, e.g., cell phones, during blackouts.</p><p>The next part of the survey describes a community microgrid and explains its capabilities. The respondents are then informed on the zero-sum nature of energy consumption during a blackout, and are presented with questions to determine their preferences on how usage quotas should be set up. Here, to avoid inducing a bias for/against a quota-based usage system, the questions presented both scenarios: (i) if a resident uses energy frugally, they should be able to be guaranteed backup for longer, and (ii) if a resident reaches the end of their quota, their backup should be cut off even if the blackout is ongoing.</p><p>Finally, the survey elicits responses on WTS by introducing the hypothetical scenario that the respondent owns (randomly selected), one of the following devices: (i) a Ford F-150 electric vehicle for travel needs, (ii) a Tesla PowerWall solar array with battery storage for offsetting electricity consumption, or (iii) a diesel generator for camping. The survey describes how these devices can alone power up a typical US household for respectively 10/3/2 days, even if the community microgrid runs out of energy. A key component of the WTS decision-making process being the available storage capacity which directly influences the amount of energy surplus beyond personal use, we selected the cohort storage devices with the above significantly-different capacities. We also study the other key component: the expected blackout duration\u2014which is balanced against the storage capacity\u2014by eliciting the respondents\u2019 WTS under two scenarios: a blackout expected to last 2 days, and then, one that is expected to last 7 days. To avoid bias in the WTS responses by anchoring the responses to a baseline, we did not provide the actual storage capacity in kWh of each device, nor did we elicit the WTS in terms of kWh. Instead, the WTS choices were in percentages of the overall available personal storage. Furthermore, in regard to the preferred compensation for energy sold to the microgrid, we did not ask respondents to report the expected amount, e.g., in $/kWh, or indeed provide the actual investment cost of the storage devices for any of the cohorts. The underlying reasoning is that each of these devices serves a different primary purpose in a resident\u2019s life, namely, transportation and ancillary services for the Ford F-150, reduction of electricity consumption for PowerWall, and camping for the diesel generator. That these devices can also be used to provide energy during a blackout is incidental, and therefore WTS decisions should not be made on the basis of recouping the respective investment costs.</p><p>Data</p><p>The survey was hosted on Qualtrics and administered through Amazon Mechanical Turk, where we recruited 1,021 unique respondents. To be eligible to participate, respondents had to be at least 18 years of age and have been living in the continental US for the past 5 years. The survey was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore, and informed consent was obtained from all survey respondents before they started the survey. The responses were collected in February 2024. Approximately 70% of our respondents have experienced blackouts lasting more than half a day, and 24% have endured outages lasting over a day in the past five years. These are generally consistent with the current US blackout situation, as evidenced by data from the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) showing an average of over eight hours of power interruptions for US residents in 2020. Notably, specific states like Texas, Connecticut, and Oklahoma experienced considerably longer outages, averaging 23.8, 21.2, and 51.5 hours, respectively. More details about the survey including demographic information of the participants are given in\u00a0.</p><p>Analyzing survey results</p><p>The family of distributions of the responses obtained from our survey was generally unknown, which suggested the use of non-parametric tests for analysis. For analyzing the correlations between ordinal variables obtained from the survey, e.g., responses on fairness and WTS, we used the Spearman Test. When correlations were observed, we also employed linear regression to fit the relationship between the variables under study. To analyze the impact of the blackout duration on the WTS, we employed the paired two-sample test to check whether the WTS for the same respondent changes when the perceived blackout duration is longer. Meanwhile, analyzing the impact of storage capacity involved comparisons across the different cohorts. Therefore, we used the two-sample KS test to compare the distributions.</p><p>Reporting summary</p><p>Further information on research design is available in the\u00a0 linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>The research was conducted at Future Resilient Systems at the Singapore-ETH Center, which was established collaboratively between ETH Zurich and the National Research FoundationSingapore.

(QHR) (China).</p><p><br/><br/>The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.<br/><br/>The ratings reflect QHR's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.<br/><br/>QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), remained at the strongest level as of year-end 2021. The capital and surplus increased by 7.1% to RMB 3.3 billion in 2021, underpinned by full retention of net profit. Going forward, AM Best expects the company to continue to receive financial support from its major shareholders and explore opportunities in capital markets to enrich its capital structure. Other supportive factors to the balance sheet strength include the prudent retrocession arrangements and the diversified investment portfolio focused on cash and fixed-income securities, albeit with a moderate exposure to debt-type alternative investments.<br/><br/>The company extended the profitable trend in 2021 with a return on equity of 6.5%, compared with the five-year (2017-2021) average of 2.1%. The company continues to commit resources and strengthen its business relationships with Chinese insurers and distribution partners to tap growth potential in traditional protection products and opportunities in financial reinsurance solutions to improve capital efficiency, while adjusting its risk appetite in long-term savings products in view of heightened challenges in asset-liability matching risk. The life reinsurance segment remains as the major driver of underwriting results. On the other hand, the non-life combined ratio increased in 2021, partially attributed to several large losses during the year, including the Henan floods and some commercial fire events in the overseas portfolio. Interest income from deposits, coupled with returns from bonds, equities and financial products, has continued to support the overall investment results over the past three years. Notwithstanding, unfavourable capital market conditions in the first three quarters of 2022 have put pressure on the valuations of the company's invested assets, albeit its investment yield remained on par with domestic reinsurer peers.<br/><br/>QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone. Over the past five years, the company has continued to strengthen its market presence. The non-life underwriting portfolio is diversified by product lines with a focus on Chinese risks as the company rebalanced the overseas book to improve business quality.<br/><br/>Negative rating actions could occur if QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation declines significantly due to adverse deviation from its business and capital plan, for example, much faster-than-expected expansion in underwriting and investment risks. Negative rating actions also could occur if the company demonstrates a sustained deteriorating trend in its operating performance.<br/><br/>Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication. Unless stated otherwise, the ratings were not amended subsequent to that communication.<br/><br/>This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best's website.

(QHR) (China).</p><p><br/><br/>The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.<br/><br/>The ratings reflect QHR's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management.<br/><br/>QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), remained at the strongest level as of year-end 2021. The capital and surplus increased by 7.1% to RMB 3.3 billion in 2021, underpinned by full retention of net profit. Going forward, AM Best expects the company to continue to receive financial support from its major shareholders and explore opportunities in capital markets to enrich its capital structure. Other supportive factors to the balance sheet strength include the prudent retrocession arrangements and the diversified investment portfolio focused on cash and fixed-income securities, albeit with a moderate exposure to debt-type alternative investments.<br/><br/>The company extended the profitable trend in 2021 with a return on equity of 6.5%, compared with the five-year (2017-2021) average of 2.1%. The company continues to commit resources and strengthen its business relationships with Chinese insurers and distribution partners to tap growth potential in traditional protection products and opportunities in financial reinsurance solutions to improve capital efficiency, while adjusting its risk appetite in long-term savings products in view of heightened challenges in asset-liability matching risk. The life reinsurance segment remains as the major driver of underwriting results. On the other hand, the non-life combined ratio increased in 2021, partially attributed to several large losses during the year, including the Henan floods and some commercial fire events in the overseas portfolio. Interest income from deposits, coupled with returns from bonds, equities and financial products, has continued to support the overall investment results over the past three years. Notwithstanding, unfavourable capital market conditions in the first three quarters of 2022 have put pressure on the valuations of the company's invested assets, albeit its investment yield remained on par with domestic reinsurer peers.<br/><br/>QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone. Over the past five years, the company has continued to strengthen its market presence. The non-life underwriting portfolio is diversified by product lines with a focus on Chinese risks as the company rebalanced the overseas book to improve business quality.<br/><br/>Negative rating actions could occur if QHR's risk-adjusted capitalisation declines significantly due to adverse deviation from its business and capital plan, for example, much faster-than-expected expansion in underwriting and investment risks. Negative rating actions also could occur if the company demonstrates a sustained deteriorating trend in its operating performance.<br/><br/>Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication. Unless stated otherwise, the ratings were not amended subsequent to that communication.<br/><br/>This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best's website.

The company's capital and surplus increased moderately from organic growth in net profit since 2019. Going forward, AM Best expects the company to continue to benefit from financial support from its shareholders and maintain its capital strength to support business expansion over the short to intermediate term. Other supportive factors to the balance sheet strength include the prudent retrocession arrangements and the diversified investment portfolio focused on cash and fixed-income securities, albeit with a moderate exposure to debt-type alternative investments.<br/><br/>QHR's net profit surged significantly in 2020 as a combined result of improved underwriting margin, and growth in investment income, as well as favourable capital gains. Return on equity improved to 6.9% in 2020 from 1.8% in 2019. The company continues to tap on growth potential in traditional yearly renewable-term business with underlying risks mainly in medical and critical illness products, while dynamically adjusting its risk appetite in long-term savings and financial reinsurance businesses in view of changes in the operating environment. Notwithstanding, AM Best expects the company's non-life underwriting result to face negative pressure from some major catastrophe and risk losses in 2021, including the Henan floods in China. However, the growing stream of investment income has contributed to support overall earnings over the past few years.<br/><br/>QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises, and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone. Despite its short operating history, the company has established diversified non-life underwriting portfolios in the domestic China market and several markets in Asia Pacific.<br/><br/>The stable outlooks reflect AM Best's expectation that the new management team will lead the company successfully to execute its business plan and capital management plan without material adverse deviation. It also is expected that QHR will maintain its solid risk-adjusted capitalisation with continued strong shareholder support.<br/><br/>Negative rating actions could occur if the company's risk-adjusted capitalisation declines significantly due to adverse deviation from its business plan, or if the company demonstrates a sustained deteriorating trend in its operating performance.<br/><br/>Ratings are communicated to rated entities prior to publication.

some that racked up tens of billions of dollars in damage, a charity has warned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A report from Christian Aid, which highlights 15 of the worst weather extremes including floods, storms and droughts this year, warns they caused death and displacement around the world, as well as financial costs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as the impacts of rising temperatures on more extreme weather become ever clearer, people in the UK think climate change should be a top priority for the Government in 2022, above healthcare and the economy, according to a poll for the aid agency.</p><p>The report says 10 of the extreme events each cost more than 1.5 billion US dollars (\u00a31.1 billion), including Hurricane Ida in the US in August which cost 65 billion dollars (\u00a349 billion) and July's floods across parts of Europe which totalled 43 billion dollars (\u00a333 billion) of damage.</p><p>Most of the estimates for financial costs only include insured losses, so the real price is likely to be much higher, Christian Aid said.</p><p>Financial costs of disasters are usually greater in rich countries which have higher property values and can afford insurance.</p><p>But some of the most devastating extremes in 2021 have hit poor nations which have contributed little to the problem of climate change, and where the disasters cause food shortages and force thousands to flee their homes, such as floods in South Sudan which displaced more than 850,000 people.</p><p>Four of the 10 most expensive disasters were in Asia, with floods and cyclones causing damage totalling 24 billion US dollars (\u00a318 billion).</p><p>These included torrential rains in the Chinese province of Henan, which caused massive floods, the death of 302 people and damage amounting to 17.6 billion dollars (\u00a313.3 billion), the report said.</p><p>A warming world is driving more intense rainstorms and making Pacific typhoons and Indian Ocean cyclones more extreme, the report said.</p><p>Europe's extreme rainfall in July, which caused floods in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg that killed at least 240 people and cost more than 43 billion dollars, was made more likely and heavier because of climate change, scientists have found.</p><p>Climate change could even be having an effect on extreme cold spells, such as the one in Texas in February which may have been influenced by a rapidly warming Arctic, and cold weather in April in France which wreaked havoc on vineyards that are coming into bud earlier in the year because of rising temperatures.</p><p>Insurer Aon has said that 2021 is expected to be the sixth time global natural catastrophes have crossed the 100 billion dollar insured loss threshold, with all six happening since 2011, the report said.</p><p>Polling by Savanta ComRes, released alongside the report, asked 2,197 people what the UK Government's new year resolution for 2022 should be focused on.</p><p>Climate change and the environment topped the list with 27% of people opting for it, ahead of healthcare on 23% and the economy on 19%, the poll found.</p><p>Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's climate policy lead and report author, said: ``The costs of climate change have been grave this year, both in terms of eye-watering financial losses but also in the death and displacement of people around the world.</p><p>``Be it storms and floods in some of the world's richest countries or droughts and heatwaves in some of the poorest, the climate crisis hit hard in 2021.''</p><p>She said that while there was some progress on tackling climate change at UN Cop26 talks in Glasgow in November, the world was not on track to ensure a safe and prosperous future.</p><p>Dr Kramer added: ``It's striking that, despite being in the middle of a pandemic, the public view this issue as a greater policy priority than both healthcare and the economy.</p><p>``If the Prime Minister wants to build on the legacy of Cop26 he needs to ensure climate change is a Government priority in 2022,'' she urged.</p><p>- Here are 10 of the most expensive climate-related disasters in 2021, according to the report:</p><p>February: Texas winter storm in the US, 23 billion dollars;</p><p>March: Australian floods, 2.1 billion dollars;</p><p>April: French cold wave, 5.6 billion dollars;</p><p>May: Cyclone Tauktae which hit India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, 1.5 billion dollars;</p><p>May: Cyclone Yaas hit India and Bangladesh, three billion dollars;</p><p>July: European floods in Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, 43 billion dollars;</p><p>July: Henan floods in China, 17.6 billion dollars;</p><p>July: Typhoon In-fa caused floods in China, Philippines and Japan, two billion dollars;</p><p>August-September: Hurricane Ida, a tropical cyclone which hit the US, 65 billion dollars;</p><p>November: British Columbia floods in Canada, 7.5 billion dollars.</p><p>Other damaging extreme events highlighted include the South Sudan floods, displacing more than 850,000 people, the Pacific northwest heatwave in the US which killed more than 1,000 people and the Parana river drought which has affected parts of Argentina, Paraguay and Brazil since 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It is an absence that undermines the climate negotiations, given that the global battle against climate change hinges heavily on the biggest emitter kicking its fossil fuel addiction.</p><p>Xi\u2019s no-show also highlights the dire state of China\u2019s relations with the US and its allies in the west. Climate talks were, until recently, a rare bright spot \u2014 even between Washington and Beijing.</p><p>However, geopolitical tension has increased dramatically in the past year, fuelled by China\u2019s aggressive stance on Taiwan and refusal to condemn Russian\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, as well as US president Joe Biden\u2019s rallying of allies against China\u2019s rise and denial of access to critical technologies.</p><p>Despite that backdrop, however \u2014 and perhaps because of it \u2014 there are signs that China will meet Xi\u2019s key climate change promises.</p><p>His targets include hitting peak coal consumption around 2025 and reaching peak carbon emissions five years later. By 2030, China has also promised to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP \u2014 its carbon intensity \u2014 by around two-thirds compared with 2005 levels. By 2060, it will become carbon neutral, meaning cutting its carbon dioxide emissions to nearly zero.</p><p>To do all that, the challenge ahead for Xi and his lieutenants is immense. China accounts for about 30 per cent of global greenhouse gases, and fossil fuels make up 85 per cent of the country\u2019s energy mix. The World Bank estimates that $14tn of investments are needed in power and transport to achieve the carbon neutrality goal.</p><p>Over the past two years though, most international commentary on China\u2019s climate change performance has focused on signs of backtracking on commitments.</p><p>Beijing has doubled down on coal and gas in response to domestic energy crises. Last year, central China was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/0c914dde-19ed-43c0-af80-7b92d7372828\"> hit by severe floods</url> followed by crippling power shortages in key manufacturing hubs. This year, there has been a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/24c51304-ce7d-4df9-815d-52d14e23fa32\"> record heatwave in the country\u2019s south</url> and pressure from rising commodity prices after Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.</p><p>Many are now concerned that as growth slows in the world\u2019s second-biggest economy, Xi will further revert to cheap energy production \u2014 namely coal \u2014 to arrest the decline.</p><p>But Sophie Lu, a China director with research firm Rhodium Group, warns against the \u201cmisconception\u201d that Beijing\u2019s responses to short-term inflationary and energy stability problems reflect a U-turn on its climate change commitments.</p><p>Lu says that longer-term metrics across emissions, emissions intensity and coal power generation, as well as the installation of new coal-fired power plants, appear to be heading in the right direction\u00a0in 2022.</p><p>\u201cWhat the international climate community is disappointed with is that China did not immediately go to zero new coal build from 2020 onwards,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a fair criticism that China could and should be building less new coal earlier. But what we need to remember is, Xi never promised this. That was never the plan.\u201d</p><p>In a review of the first year since Xi unveiled his carbon neutrality pledge, China Dialogue, a nongovernmental organisation, noted that carbon intensity fell 3.8 per cent in 2021 compared with GDP growth of 8.1 per cent. While coal use has nudged higher again, investments in solar, hydro and wind have boomed.</p><p>With Xi having just secured an unprecedented third five-year term as head of the ruling Communist party \u2014 stacking the top echelons of the party-state with loyalists \u2014 his central focus, many China watchers believe, will be ensuring security while avoiding economic and external shocks.</p><p>This is underpinning a drive towards energy independence and shifting from fossil fuel imports to domestically produced renewables. Xi\u2019s industrial policy, Lu says, is \u201ccore\u201d to China meeting its carbon commitments.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about transitioning the country in a steady and orderly fashion away from low value-added heavy industries\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and transitioning China into newer, \u2018strategic\u2019 industries which are mostly lower in emissions intensity.\u201d</p><p>Around the world, environmentalists hope that public outcry over the gathering pace and intensity of natural disasters attributed to climate change will force governments to take bolder action to cut emissions.</p><p>Even in China, where public discourse and online debate is ruthlessly controlled by Beijing, ignoring the obvious is becoming harder to do.</p><p>Li Shuo, Beijing-based policy adviser for Greenpeace, says there has long been a reluctance among the tightly controlled state media to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between extreme weather events and government policy. \u201cThere is just such a strong hesitance to highlight anything that is beyond the control of the regime,\u201d Li says.</p><p>However, as the frequency of such events increases so too will pressure on Beijing to act.</p><p>Li points to last year\u2019s Henan floods. More than a year\u2019s worth of rain fell in 24 hours. Nearly 400 people were killed, and direct economic damage was estimated at just shy of $20bn. \u201cIf you have such a situation, can you not afford to ask why?\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-6cf54ab72172415796b641a097e86925</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66TF-DK31-JB77-K1X1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"905\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 8, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

But the compound is just one of his extensive land holdings in the city.</p><p>\u201cHis nickname is \u2018half of the city Ma\u2019,\u201d said a retired government official in the city of 10m who worked with Alibaba for more than decade. He noted that Ma\u2019s holdings were partly purchased and partly received as gifts from the government following donations.\u00a0</p><p>For years the excess of China\u2019s tycoons has been legend. From Hong Kong\u2019s Victoria Peak to London\u2019s Kensington Palace Gardens and New York\u2019s Upper East Side, they snatched up the world\u2019s most expensive properties. Many have collected an array of prestigious acquisitions from English football clubs and Bordeaux vineyards to Hollywood studios and international newspapers.</p><p>Now <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/1fe0559f-de6d-490e-b312-abba0181da1f\"> Ma</url> and his clique of billionaire tech titans are on an urgent mission to display their socialist spirit through a spree of public charitable donations and pledges.</p><p>A sudden burst of benevolence has seen billions of dollars redirected from company coffers and personal bank accounts to state-linked causes over recent months, as the country\u2019s richest and most powerful corporate elites try to appease Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.</p><p>However, inside China\u2019s growing philanthropy sector, the donation drive has been met with scepticism as fears of tightening state control mount.</p><p>The deluge of generosity follows a barrage of tech-focused regulatory and policy curbs from Beijing, a broad crackdown that has knocked tens of billions of dollars off the value of some of the country\u2019s biggest businesses and hammered the personal wealth of their founders.</p><p>\u201cThe scary part [for donors] is that they don\u2019t know how much is enough,\u201d said the executive of a big Beijing charity. \u201cAll they can do is look at how much their peers have given and try to match it.\u201d</p><p>The Chinese Communist party\u2019s focus on wealth redistribution intensified this month after Xi called for stronger regulation of \u201cexcessively high incomes\u201d and moves to \u201cencourage high-income groups and enterprises to return more to society\u201d.</p><p>The Chinese leader, whose comments were carried by state media after a high-level economic planning meeting last week, also reiterated that China\u2019s realisation of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ft.com/content/87c3aa02-f970-48c8-b795-82768c9f7634\"> \u201ccommon prosperity</url>\u201d was the essential requirement of socialism.</p><p>Days after Xi\u2019s comments were published last week, Tencent, one of China\u2019s biggest social media, gaming and fintech groups, announced it would set aside Rmb50bn ($7.7bn) for a \u201ccommon prosperity programme\u201d.</p><p>This week Chen Lei, chief executive of Pinduoduo, one of China\u2019s biggest ecommerce platforms, joined the pledge drive, promising to contribute $1.5bn of the company\u2019s future earnings to support agricultural modernisation and rural vitalisation. </p><p>Others to announce new social contributions in recent weeks include Zhang Lei\u2019s private equity group Hillhouse Capital and Xing Wang, founder of food delivery company Meituan. </p><p>In the wake of the deadly Henan floods last month, a clutch of tech groups including Alibaba, ride-hailing group Didi, Tencent and Pinduoduo all donated tens of millions of dollars to recovery efforts. </p><p>Over the past 10 years the amount of cash donated annually by China\u2019s top 10 entrepreneurs rose nearly threefold, according to data from the Hurun Research Institute, a China-based research group. Bloomberg-compiled data suggests that Chinese billionaires\u2019 giving this year is already 20 per cent higher than all of 2020.</p><p>Now, however, pressure appears to be increasing on companies and tycoons to shift their charitable activities in-step with the Chinese Communist party, a change that experts said threatened to undermine their good intentions. \u00a0</p><p>According to one senior Chinese financial executive, while officials have long encouraged charitable giving \u2014 often referred to as the third or \u201ctertiary\u201d distribution of income \u2014 it was now at the forefront of the party\u2019s policy agenda.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cTertiary distribution has been referred to in government documents for 30 years,\u201d said the executive, who asked not to be named. \u201cBut until last week nobody read those documents. Now everybody is reading every word.\u201d</p><p>The executive added that his own company was expanding its charitable activities: \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. We created all this wealth thanks to the China market. It\u2019s only fair for us to contribute to society as well.\u201d</p><p>The Beijing charity executive said that since China\u2019s revamped charity laws took effect five years ago, non-governmental organisations have fallen under \u201cheavy scrutiny\u201d as authorities sought to curb the runaway growth of private sector groups that were perceived as eroding party control.</p><p>Instead, the donations are set to benefit state-linked initiatives at the expense of grassroots groups.</p><p>\u201cIt is very difficult to gain approval to set up new private charity groups. For example, there wasn\u2019t a single newly approved NGO in Haidian last year,\u201d he said, referring to one of Beijing\u2019s most developed districts.</p><p>\u201cGovernment-backed charity groups will become the main beneficiary of the latest policy initiative. Private firms will gain political credit for funding government projects.\u201d</p><p>Scott Kennedy, an expert on Chinese economic policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think-tank, noted that many of China\u2019s top executives have established reputations for their individual philanthropy, especially after Alibaba\u2019s Ma led a wave of entrepreneurs to create private trusts.</p><p>Kennedy warned that Beijing\u2019s efforts to turbocharge charitable donations risked having \u201cthe opposite effect\u201d, reducing \u201cgenuine enthusiastic support\u201d and accentuating state-directed philanthropy.</p><p>\u201cThat\u2019s consistent with the broader trend under Xi Jinping of reducing the influence of civil society. The party is extremely uncomfortable with independent public behaviour that provides public goods or holds the state accountable,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cBut at the end of the day, the party\u2019s primary goal is trying to assert its dominance and control over all aspects of life in China.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Edward White in Seoul, Tom Mitchell in Singapore, Sun Yu, Christian Shepherd, Ryan McMorrow, Sherry Fei Ju, Nian Liu in Beijing and Wang Xueqiao in Shanghai </emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FTCOMH-c89594c11d854dda9e6755c775bd6c9a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FTCOMH2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63GF-YV11-JB77-K2W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408337</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1064\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Financial Times Limited All Rights Reserved Please do not cut and paste FT articles and redistribute by email or post to the web.</copyright><publicationName>FT.com Headlines</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 29, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000D7G3</classCode><className>ALIBABA GROUP HOLDING LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS454110 ELECTRONIC SHOPPING AND MAIL-ORDER HOUSES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>BABA (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Wetlands Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzY2NjI1NjQ3Qzk2NDE5NzlGQjFDNTkzQjg5QTAyMkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001822</classCode><className>WEALTHY PEOPLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DQNG</classCode><className>SOCIALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00632417</classCode><className>FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DQQA</classCode><className>POLITICAL &amp;
