From the European Union's Fit for 55 Package, which aims to reduce carbon emissions drastically by 2030, to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s roadmap targeting carbon neutrality in shipping, logistics companies worldwide must 'green' their operations. </p><p>The green transformation in logistics has moved from being a mere trend to an unavoidable imperative. It affects not only a company's competitiveness, but also its very survival. </p><p>According to Koen Soenens, board member of the Transportation and Logistics Sector Committee at the European Chamber of Commerce (EuroCham) in Viet Nam, the sector is under considerable pressure, especially as companies seek deeper integration with the European market.</p><p>As a representative from DEEP C Industrial Park and also representing the European business community operating in Viet Nam, Soenens also said logistics serves as the heart of the economy, connecting production, circulation and distribution. Yet, the industry must evolve rapidly to meet sustainable development goals. </p><p>European businesses operating in Viet Nam have begun adopting green initiatives, such as solar power installations in warehouses, eco-friendly delivery fleets and digital tools that optimise routes to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.</p><p>These efforts are not just temporary trends; they are strategic choices aimed at long-term efficiency and competitiveness, Soenens said.</p><p>However, challenges remain. Viet Nam's logistics infrastructure is still fragmented, and inconsistent policies complicate widespread adoption of green practices.</p><p>Soenens has also stressed the importance of coordinated efforts among businesses, Government agencies and stakeholders to build a sustainable logistics ecosystem. With increased awareness, financing, skills development and policy alignment, Viet Nam can accelerate its green logistics transformation and establish a competitive edge internationally.</p><p>Hai Ph\u00f2ng, northern Viet Nam's major customs gateway, illustrates how green logistics can drive regional economic growth. The city has sustained customs clearance growth above 10 per cent, positioning it as a crucial hub for future trade routes, including direct connections to northern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p><p>Tran Tien Dung, deputy chairman of the Vietnam Logistics Services Association and chairman of Hai Ph\u00f2ng Logistics Association, highlights the untapped potential of sea and rail transport in the region. </p><p>At present, road transport dominates, accounting for nearly 99 per cent of cargo movement and leading to inefficiencies and higher emissions.</p><p>To address this, Macstar Group has launched inland waterway transport routes linking Hai Ph\u00f2ng to Ninh B\u00ecnh, significantly reducing transit times and expanding cargo capacity via the Nghia Hung Canal, dubbed the 'Panama Canal of Viet Nam'. This waterway offers an open-airspace advantage, allowing larger vessels and more environmentally friendly transport options.</p><p>Macstar is also pioneering research into sustainable fuels like solar energy and green hydrogen for its fleet. Still, Dung notes that Government support is crucial in issuing technical standards and guidelines to enable businesses to adopt these technologies on a larger scale.</p><p>Expanding beyond the Hai Ph\u00f2ng-Ninh B\u00ecnh corridor, Macstar has introduced routes to Nghi Son and Vung \u00c1ng, and plans to connect with Quang Tri Province to facilitate trade with Laos via border gates. These initiatives represent a growing regional network prioritising efficiency and sustainability.</p><p>Australia's green logistics journey also provides valuable insights for Viet Nam. Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce (AusCham) in Viet Nam Edwin Law explains that in Australia, green logistics is mandatory, not optional. Companies embed sustainability goals into their core strategies, investing in green transportation, renewable energy and environmentally friendly supply chains.</p><p>Technology plays a pivotal role. Australian firms use advanced digital platforms and automation to reduce energy consumption and costs while improving service quality. Many of these innovations have been successfully transferred to Viet Nam through partnerships and joint ventures.</p><p>Moreover, Vietnamese factories' recent adoption of energy-saving measures and environmental standards signals a growing commitment to sustainability. </p><p>Law emphasised that such progress demonstrates Viet Nam's dedication to net zero emissions, a goal achievable only through a collaborative ecosystem involving businesses, government and civil society.</p><p>Yap Kwong Weng, CEO of Vietnam SuperPort, a joint venture between Singapore's YCH Group and Vietnam's T and T Group, advocates for a multimodal, integrated logistics model to accelerate the green transformation. </p><p>Vietnam SuperPort combines air cargo terminals, bonded warehouses and cross-border transportation services to optimise efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.</p><p>Unlike conventional mass industrial parks, this approach leverages existing assets to create a structural advantage within regional supply chains.

Trade routes are being restructured, supply chains reshaped and the demand for faster, more efficient logistics is growing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Meanwhile, international regulations are tightening rapidly. From the European Union's Fit for 55 Package, which aims to reduce carbon emissions drastically by 2030, to the International Maritime Organization (IMO)'s roadmap targeting carbon neutrality in shipping, logistics companies worldwide must 'green' their operations.</p><p>The green transformation in logistics has moved from being a mere trend to an unavoidable imperative. It affects not only a company's competitiveness, but also its very survival.</p><p>According to Koen Soenens, board member of the Transportation and Logistics Sector Committee at the European Chamber of Commerce (EuroCham) in Viet Nam, the sector is under considerable pressure, especially as companies seek deeper integration with the European market.</p><p>As a representative from DEEP C Industrial Park and also representing the European business community operating in Viet Nam, Soenens also said logistics serves as the heart of the economy, connecting production, circulation and distribution. Yet, the industry must evolve rapidly to meet sustainable development goals.</p><p>European businesses operating in Viet Nam have begun adopting green initiatives, such as solar power installations in warehouses, eco-friendly delivery fleets and digital tools that optimise routes to reduce fuel consumption and emissions.</p><p>These efforts are not just temporary trends; they are strategic choices aimed at long-term efficiency and competitiveness, Soenens said.</p><p>However, challenges remain. Viet Nam's logistics infrastructure is still fragmented, and inconsistent policies complicate widespread adoption of green practices.</p><p>Soenens has also stressed the importance of coordinated efforts among businesses, Government agencies and stakeholders to build a sustainable logistics ecosystem. With increased awareness, financing, skills development and policy alignment, Viet Nam can accelerate its green logistics transformation and establish a competitive edge internationally.</p><p>Hai Ph\u00f2ng, northern Viet Nam's major customs gateway, illustrates how green logistics can drive regional economic growth. The city has sustained customs clearance growth above 10 per cent, positioning it as a crucial hub for future trade routes, including direct connections to northern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p><p>Tran Tien Dung, deputy chairman of the Vietnam Logistics Services Association and chairman of Hai Ph\u00f2ng Logistics Association, highlights the untapped potential of sea and rail transport in the region.</p><p>At present, road transport dominates, accounting for nearly 99 per cent of cargo movement and leading to inefficiencies and higher emissions.</p><p>To address this, Macstar Group has launched inland waterway transport routes linking Hai Ph\u00f2ng to Ninh B\u00ecnh, significantly reducing transit times and expanding cargo capacity via the Nghia Hung Canal, dubbed the 'Panama Canal of Viet Nam'. This waterway offers an open-airspace advantage, allowing larger vessels and more environmentally friendly transport options.</p><p>Macstar is also pioneering research into sustainable fuels like solar energy and green hydrogen for its fleet. Still, Dung notes that Government support is crucial in issuing technical standards and guidelines to enable businesses to adopt these technologies on a larger scale.</p><p>Expanding beyond the Hai Ph\u00f2ng-Ninh B\u00ecnh corridor, Macstar has introduced routes to Nghi Son and Vung \u00c1ng, and plans to connect with Quang Tri Province to facilitate trade with Laos via border gates. These initiatives represent a growing regional network prioritising efficiency and sustainability.</p><p>Australia's green logistics journey also provides valuable insights for Viet Nam. Executive Director of the Australian Chamber of Commerce (AusCham) in Viet Nam Edwin Law explains that in Australia, green logistics is mandatory, not optional. Companies embed sustainability goals into their core strategies, investing in green transportation, renewable energy and environmentally friendly supply chains.</p><p>Technology plays a pivotal role. Australian firms use advanced digital platforms and automation to reduce energy consumption and costs while improving service quality. Many of these innovations have been successfully transferred to Viet Nam through partnerships and joint ventures.</p><p>Moreover, Vietnamese factories' recent adoption of energy-saving measures and environmental standards signals a growing commitment to sustainability.</p><p>Law emphasised that such progress demonstrates Viet Nam's dedication to net zero emissions, a goal achievable only through a collaborative ecosystem involving businesses, government and civil society.</p><p>Yap Kwong Weng, CEO of Vietnam SuperPort, a joint venture between Singapore's YCH Group and Vietnam's T&amp;T Group, advocates for a multimodal, integrated logistics model to accelerate the green transformation.</p><p>Vietnam SuperPort combines air cargo terminals, bonded warehouses and cross-border transportation services to optimise efficiency and reduce environmental impacts.</p><p>Unlike conventional mass industrial parks, this approach leverages existing assets to create a structural advantage within regional supply chains. For example, where regulations permit, goods can be shipped directly from warehouse to aircraft, cutting transport time and emissions.</p><p>Vietnam SuperPort aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 through a roadmap that includes deploying renewable energy, automated warehouses, carbon-neutral materials and emissions-free operations. The company is partnering with international organisations like the International Finance Corporation to develop green infrastructure financing models, blending public and private funding sources.</p><p>However, Yap stressed that policy support and financial incentives are essential.

The long-term goal is to transition H\u00e0 Noi into a greener city by drastically cutting emissions from transportation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The backbone of this ambitious policy is Directive 20, which was issued on July 12. It specifies a series of urgent tasks to curb air pollution, which has reached alarmingly high levels in the capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The directive outlines a phased approach to banning fossil fuel-powered motorcycles, gradually expanding the scope of the ban across the city.</p><p>The overarching objective is to significantly reduce traffic-related emissions, improve air quality and ease congestion. By the time the full policy is implemented, the city will transition to cleaner energy vehicles, with the ultimate goal of becoming a zero-emissions city by 2050.</p><p>The motorcycle ban will be enforced over several stages, beginning with a pilot period and culminating in a citywide restriction. Here's a breakdown of the timeline:</p><p>\u00b7 Pilot Phase (January-July 2026): H\u00e0 Noi will begin limiting petrol-powered motorcycles in certain urban areas. This phase will serve as a test period, allowing the city to assess the policy's effect and gather feedback before proceeding with broader enforcement.</p><p>\u00b7 Phase 1 (From July 2026): A full ban on all fossil fuel-powered motorcycles will come into effect in the area inside Ring Road 1, which includes major streets such as Tran Kh\u00e1t Ch\u00e2n, Dai Co Viet and D\u00ea La Th\u00e0nh. This will be the first area to experience the full scope of the policy.</p><p>\u00b7 Phase 2 (From January 2028): The ban will extend to the entire area inside Ring Road 2, covering a wider swath of H\u00e0 Noi. This phase will also see restrictions on personal cars powered by fossil fuels within both Ring Roads 1 and 2.</p><p>\u00b7 Phase 3 (From 2030): The final phase will extend the restrictions to all vehicles using fossil fuels, including motorcycles and cars, within the area bounded by Ring Road 3.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi's long-term plan aims for a complete transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and other clean energy alternatives by 2050. This will include phasing out hybrid and compressed natural gas vehicles, making the city's transportation sector fully green.</p><p>The roadmap set out by the Government is in line with Viet Nam's commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, positioning H\u00e0 Noi as a leader in the country's drive towards sustainability.</p><p>Why the ban is necessary</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi faces a significant air pollution crisis, with the city regularly ranking among the most polluted cities in the world. Reports show that traffic is responsible for up to three-quarters of H\u00e0 Noi's total air pollution, with motorcycles being one of the largest sources of emissions.</p><p>The city currently has around 6.9 million registered motorcycles, many of which are old and poorly maintained. As much as 72 per cent of these motorcycles are considered 'high polluters', making them a major target for the city's new policy.</p><p>In addition to air pollution, H\u00e0 Noi struggles with severe traffic congestion. The city's roads are often clogged with traffic, particularly in the central wards. The Ring Road 1 area sees traffic volumes of up to 1.3 million vehicles daily, which causes massive bottlenecks at key intersections. By removing the most polluting vehicles from the roads, the city hopes to alleviate congestion and improve the overall flow of traffic.</p><p>To ensure that the motorcycle ban is successfully implemented, H\u00e0 Noi will introduce a range of enforcement measures. The city will install clear signage around the restricted areas, marking the boundaries of the no-go zones with visible 'motorcycle prohibited' signs.</p><p>Traffic police will be deployed at key intersections to monitor violations and manage traffic flow.</p><p>During the initial phase, enforcement will focus on education and warnings. However, once the policy is in full swing, violators will face fines that could range from VND2,000,000 to VND3,00,000 (US$76-115) for entering restricted zones.</p><p>Additionally, the city plans to install surveillance cameras at strategic points throughout the city to detect and fine offenders remotely. The use of this technology is designed to ensure that the ban is enforced consistently and fairly.</p><p>Financial support</p><p>One of the challenges of this transition will be the financial burden on residents, particularly those who own petrol-powered motorcycles. To mitigate this, H\u00e0 Noi is proposing several financial support measures to ease the shift towards EVs.</p><p>These measures are expected to be discussed and approved in September 2025. The proposal includes cash subsidies for individuals who exchange their petrol motorcycles for electric ones, as well as exemptions from registration and licence plate fees for EVs.</p><p>The cash subsidies are structured in different tiers: VND3 million ($115) for regular individuals, VND4 million ($150) for near-poor households and VND5 million ($190) for poor households.</p><p>However, these subsidies come with certain conditions: residents must own a petrol or diesel motorcycle (registered before the resolution takes effect) in low-emission zones and they must convert it to a green vehicle worth at least VND15 million ($570).</p><p>\"H\u00e0 Noi will provide maximum support to the right groups, ensuring that its residents and those who frequently travel into the Ring Road 1 area will benefit from these changes,\" stated Duong Duc Tuan, Vice Chairman of H\u00e0 Noi People's Committee.</p><p>Each individual can only receive this financial support once for one vehicle, with the policy running through to 2030.</p><p>The city is also considering proposals from Vingroup, which has put forward financing options for residents looking to purchase EVs, including instalment loan packages with low-interest rates ranging from 3 to 5 per cent annually to make the transition to EVs more affordable.</p><p>Additionally, the city plans to roll out a series of other incentives, including subsidies for businesses investing in charging station infrastructure. They will receive up to 70 per cent interest rate support for the first five years, and projects that include parking lots with at least 30 per cent charging spots will receive 50 per cent support for land clearance costs, as well as 100 per cent of land rental fees for five years.</p><p>Businesses in passenger transport and freight and those involved in the recycling and refurbishment of old vehicles will also be eligible for preferential loans with interest rates ranging from 3 per cent to 5 per cent annually, with loan terms of up to five years.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi is also strongly encouraging private investors to participate in the development of clean energy transport infrastructure through public-private partnerships. Investors will receive priority for land allocation and will be supported with 100 per cent land rental subsidies for development in designated areas until 2033.</p><p>The goal is to make it easier for residents and businesses to make the switch to green vehicles, ensuring that the infrastructure to support EVs is in place before the restrictions are fully implemented.</p><p>Infrastructure for EVs</p><p>An essential part of H\u00e0 Noi's green transition is the development of a robust electric vehicle infrastructure. Currently, the city's charging network is underdeveloped and unable to meet the growing demand.</p><p>To address this, the city plans to expand the number of charging stations across key areas, including high-density residential neighbourhoods and major transport corridors.</p><p>By the end of 2026, at least 30 per cent of parking spaces in new construction projects and 10 per cent in existing buildings will be required to be equipped with charging stations.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi is also working to establish clear standards for charging stations to ensure interoperability across different types of EVs. The city has identified strategic locations along Ring Road 1 for the installation of public parking lots with integrated charging stations.</p><p>These new stations will be vital in supporting the growing number of EVs on the road.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi is not the first city to embark on such a bold plan. Guangzhou in China implemented a ban on motorcycles in 2006, which was expanded to the entire city centre the following year. The city replaced motorcycles with electric buses on narrow streets, helping to improve air quality and reduce congestion.</p><p>European cities, such as Paris and London, are also taking steps towards eliminating fossil-fuel-powered vehicles, but with more gradual approaches.</p><p>For example, Paris plans to ban petrol cars by 2030 and has already started restricting diesel vehicles. London, on the other hand, has introduced a Ultra Low Emission Zone in which non-compliant vehicles are charged a daily fee to enter the city centre.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi's transition to a zero-emissions city, while challenging, represents a significant step towards addressing the pressing environmental challenges of the 21st century.</p><p>By targeting the most polluting vehicles, providing financial support for residents and businesses and investing in green infrastructure, the city hopes to create a cleaner urban environment for its residents.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["London, on the other hand, has introduced a Ultra Low Emission Zone in which non-compliant vehicles are charged a daily fee to enter the city centre.

However, few may realise that over 44 per cent of the city's total land area remains agricultural - a significant advantage if harnessed through proper planning and strategic development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Nguyen Xu\u00e2n Dai, director of the H\u00e0 Noi Department of Agriculture and Environment, the city has for many years pursued a comprehensive restructuring of its agricultural sector along the principles of 'green - efficient - sustainable'. In this approach, agriculture is no longer viewed solely as an economic activity, but also as a cornerstone of environmental protection, food security and ecological balance within the city.</p><p>Restructuring production zones is not merely about rearranging farmland. It represents a broader strategy to preserve soil and water resources, safeguard natural habitats, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve resilience to climate change. In recent years, H\u00e0 Noi has achieved positive results in this direction, especially in crop and livestock production.</p><p>Crop cultivation has undergone a transformation toward organic and high-tech methods. The city currently has over 523 hectares of vegetables grown under organic or near-organic practices, achieving average yields of 50 tonnes per hectare per year, 15-20 per cent higher than conventional methods. In addition, 908 hectares of vegetable farms now apply high-tech solutions such as greenhouse systems and drip irrigation, helping to improve product quality while conserving natural resources.</p><p>In the livestock sector, H\u00e0 Noi has adopted circular farming practices that emphasise emission reductions and environmental safety. Many farms operate with closed-loop barn systems, automated feeding technologies, and biological waste treatment measures.</p><p>Notably, 95 per cent of large-scale pig farms use biogas systems, while 65 per cent of livestock facilities apply biological agents to treat waste. These innovations help ensure compliance with technical standards while supporting the transition away from small-scale backyard farming in densely populated areas.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi is also developing a model of urban agriculture that integrates high-tech farming with experiential tourism in peri-urban areas. This is part of the city's broader strategy to transform agricultural land in urbanising zones into smart ecological spaces - enhancing local food production, boosting farmers' incomes, and meeting the consumption demands of a growing urban population.</p><p>According to B\u00f9i Van S\u00e1ng, Party Secretary of Tam Hung Commune, his commune, under the two-tier local governance model, is not only expanding in terms of population and land area but also possesses great potential for the development of green, ecological and circular agriculture.</p><p>With its deep-rooted farming traditions, the commune is well-positioned to establish specialised production areas for vegetables, ornamental plants, fruit trees, and aquaculture. The local government is restructuring its agricultural space with a focus on concentrated, eco-friendly, and high-tech models, while enhancing land-use management and aligning planning with socio-economic development.</p><p>In Hong V\u00e2n Commune, local authorities are leveraging the area's natural advantages to promote agriculture as part of the cultural and tourism fabric.</p><p>L\u00ea Tuan Dung, Chairman of the People's Committee of Hong V\u00e2n, emphasised that the commune was already a recognised tourism destination and had developed flower-lined roads and green corridors that support agri-tourism models. These initiatives catered to the tastes of urban residents and aligned with global trends in sustainable tourism.</p><p>Agriculture in Hong V\u00e2n is seen not only as a productive sector but also as a key element in shaping the landscape, preserving cultural identity, and laying the 'ecological foundation' for integrated development in tourism, services, and culture, according to the chairman.</p><p>The commune's strategy focuses on three main pillars: restructuring cultivation zones toward organic and circular models; developing experiential tourism destinations; and building value chains for local agricultural products tied to regional branding.</p><p>Nguyen Manh Quyen, Vice Chairman of the H\u00e0 Noi People's Committee, emphasized that the city was aligning its green agricultural zoning efforts with key legal and strategic frameworks.</p><p>These include the Capital Law, passed by the National Assembly on June 28, 2024, and Decision No. 1668/QD-TTg dated December 27, 2024, issued by the Prime Minister to approve adjustments to H\u00e0 Noi's General Planning toward 2045 with a vision to 2065.</p><p>Based on these frameworks, H\u00e0 Noi has reviewed, adjusted, and supplemented designated zones for crop cultivation, livestock farming, and aquaculture to better reflect real-world conditions, according to Quyen. The capital is re-establishing its ecological spatial system, positioning agriculture as a form of green infrastructure - serving both as a food belt and an ecological buffer zone.</p><p>It is clear that H\u00e0 Noi's agricultural restructuring, integrated with green zoning and the ecological urban strategy, is a necessary pathway to ensure agricultural economic development, maintain ecological landscapes, improve quality of life and strengthen climate resilience.</p><p>The city has set a target for the 2030-2045 period: to become a fully green urban area with ecological agriculture forming the backbone of an interconnected system that sustainably unites land, people, and nature.</p><p>According to Director Nguyen Xu\u00e2n Dai, H\u00e0 Noi is restructuring agricultural production across all sectors. In crop cultivation, the city will optimise land use, adopt advanced technologies and develop high-value products. Irrigation-challenged rice fields will be converted to more economically viable crops, and focus will be placed on crop varieties and technologies suitable for the unique conditions of peri-urban soils.</p><p>In livestock, H\u00e0 Noi will continue developing strategic zones for concentrated animal farming. The city is reviewing plans to establish large-scale livestock areas in rapidly urbanising districts, while phasing out small-scale operations in residential zones. In compliance with Resolution No. 02/2020/NQ-HDND of the H\u00e0 Noi People's Council, H\u00e0 Noi is ending livestock farming in certain areas and supporting the relocation of facilities located in restricted zones.</p><p>Aquaculture is also being developed along sustainable lines, with a focus on high productivity and quality. H\u00e0 Noi's strategy includes the protection of aquatic ecosystems, environmental safeguards, climate change adaptation, disease prevention, environmental monitoring, and food safety from the outset of production.</p><p>Simultaneously, the city is integrating green, clean, and sustainable agricultural methods into training programs that link theoretical learning with local practice - helping farmers improve their knowledge, technical skills and capacity to participate in the new agricultural economy.</p><p>Regional zoning tied to green agricultural development is a timely and strategic initiative for H\u00e0 Noi in the face of new challenges. Beyond enhancing production efficiency and ensuring food safety, this approach fosters the creation of ecological zones, improves living conditions and contributes directly to the city's broader goal of sustainable urban development.</p><p>With forward-looking vision and methodical implementation, H\u00e0 Noi is steadily shaping a new agricultural identity that is modern, environmentally responsible and rich in potential.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["1668/QD-TTg dated December 27, 2024, issued by the Prime Minister to approve adjustments to H\u00e0 Noi's General Planning toward 2045 with a vision to 2065.

According to Chairman of LuxGroup Dr Pham Ha, investing in energy-efficient equipment, waste treatment systems, and environmentally friendly materials is extremely costly. Small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, struggle to tap into the green tourism market due to high investment costs, long payback periods, and a lack of tax or credit incentives.</p><p>Ha underlined that to go green, businesses must do more than scratching the surface.

The use of the latest technologies, like blockchain, would serve to enhance the operation of a new IFC.</p><p>Lottner added that TCBS is pursuing a 'Wealthtech' strategy, pioneering the use of blockchain and smart contracts in bond issuance, transaction management and corporate bond ownership for Vietnamese clients.

The government is committed to enhancing the competitiveness of Thai entrepreneurs and preparing them to cope with changes in technology and production structure. Cooperation from all sectors will be an important foundation to create opportunities for sustainable development of the country. The Ministry of Industry has set the policy of 'Industrial Reform to a New Economy: Clean, Convenient, Transparent' with 5 important driving mechanisms and urgent missions to be implemented, such as managing industrial waste, reducing air pollution, driving future industries, promoting green industries, developing Halal industry centers, developing infrastructure, and upgrading services. Climate change is a major factor that will affect future business operations. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry is committed to developing Thai industries into sustainable low-carbon industries. The urgent mission is to support Thai industries to adapt to a new economic model that is environmentally friendly (Green Transition to New Economy) by managing the entire supply chain (Greening Supply Chain) to be an industry with low greenhouse gas emissions (Low Carbon Industry) and being responsible to society and the environment as a whole.</p><p>Mr. Nattapol Rangsitpol, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Industry, said that the ministry is aware of the important role of the industrial sector in reducing greenhouse gases to create a sustainable future. The ministry aims for Net Zero Emissions by 2065 by upgrading green industry standards, enforcing new criteria in 2025, promoting environmentally friendly production, reducing waste, and supporting clean technology. In addition, 7 greenhouse gas reduction standards will be announced, guidelines will be developed to be in line with international standards, and mechanisms will be created to make it easier for businesses to access carbon-reducing technologies. The ministry will also promote clean energy, cooperate with the Ministry of Energy to solve obstacles, support renewable energy, reduce dependence on fossil fuels, and promote efficient energy use. It will also develop sustainable industrial standards, set over 55 new standards, promote New S-Curve industries, and drive the MIND (Move to Net Zero, Innovation, Digitalization) policy, which aims to cover the economy, society, and the environment. The ministry is confident in the potential and cooperation of Thai entrepreneurs towards sustainable business development.</p><p>Mr. Sumet Tangprasert, IEAT board member and acting governor, added that the IEAT is committed to supporting entrepreneurs towards a 'low-carbon industry' to cope with challenges in digital, technology, and sustainability by setting risk analysis, guidelines to support sustainable businesses, promoting a green economy through low-carbon industrial estates under the guidelines, upgrading green infrastructure, increasing energy efficiency, supporting clean energy, managing waste through the 'Map Ta Phut Sandbox', and developing carbon capture technology. The IEAT has created a Carbon Finance mechanism in collaboration with the World Bank, developing a carbon credit market, and establishing CME as a center for public-private sector cooperation.

Transformational changes initiated within the capital markets will enable Singapore enterprises to align with these shifts, fostering their growth and driving Singapore's collaborative, long-term ambitions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A key component of this vision is enhancing corporate governance standards to build investor confidence, positioning enterprises as global benchmarks for integrity and transparency. By nurturing trust and accountability across the business ecosystem - from multinational corporations to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) - Singapore can lay the foundation for inclusive, sustained growth. In addition, we recommend stimulating greater organic innovation through research and development, supported by incentives and green financing, to further drive this transformation.</p><p>Our Budget 2025 Proposal also introduces recommendations designed to create a \"fast pass\" approach for businesses, providing quick assistance, ready-to-use templates, and a swift start for those eager to embark on complex and long journeys in areas like sustainability and technology. This approach aims to accelerate their transformation through well-structured support systems facilitated by the government, enabling companies to adopt innovative solutions and sustainable practices more effectively, while elevating Singapore's global reputation as a hub for value creation.</p><p>The Proposal focuses on these key areas of value creation:</p><p>Advancing ESG Priorities - Empowering Singapore enterprises to adopt sustainable practices through national frameworks, targeted grants, and reporting guidance. A dedicated industry hub will offer crucial support, ensuring businesses can align with international ESG standards and contribute to Singapore's sustainability transition.</p><p>Driving Innovation - Harnessing blended finance and green financing initiatives to support businesses, particularly those in \"hard to abate\" industries, in their decarbonisation efforts. These grants and incentives help mitigate investment risks, encouraging the participation of a more diverse spectrum of funding stakeholders and cultivating a robust ecosystem of financing options. Furthermore, leveraging carbon tax revenues and enhanced government subsidies can complement these efforts, spurring further research and development efforts in sustainable technologies and accelerating the creation of commercially viable carbon reduction solutions.</p><p>Enhancing Talent Development - Strengthening workforce capabilities through leadership benchmarks and targeted professional growth initiatives, such as micro-credentialling, while aligning with the Forward Singapore agenda. By focusing on building globally and regionally capable talent, these measures ensure Singapore's workforce is prepared to meet evolving challenges and further solidify the nation's position as a talent hub in the region.</p><p>Supporting International Growth - Singapore can reinforce its position as a global hub by introducing strategic measures to enable businesses to excel internationally while addressing emerging challenges. Enhancing grants and financing schemes will encourage cross-border partnerships in high-growth areas such as the digital and green economies, fostering regional collaboration and supporting Singapore companies in diversifying across ASEAN. A government-backed transfer pricing advisory programme can provide consultation and financial support to small enterprises, helping them align with international standards, reduce compliance risks, and enhance operational efficiency in complex tax environments.</p><p>Highlights of Our Recommendations</p><p>1. Ready: Leading with Sustainable Impact Regionally and Into the Future</p><p>The rising global emphasis on sustainability positions Singapore to lead by example. By establishing robust frameworks and standards, the nation can solidify its climate resilience and reinforce its role as a trusted hub for sustainable business practices and long-term economic growth.</p><p>KPMG and SID recommend:</p><p>a) Increase transparency in the allocation of carbon tax revenues (page 8) to strengthen clarity in the industry to undertake green initiatives. Detailed disclosures on the use of these funds can enable businesses to align their investments with Singapore's climate agenda.</p><p>b) Develop a centralised ESG reporting hub to guide businesses in adopting consistent sustainability practices (page 12). This hub, established through government and industry collaboration, would help businesses navigate reporting requirements and align themselves with international sustainability standards.</p><p>c) Deploy incentives for blended finance to accelerate Singapore's green transition (pages 17 and 18). Strategic grants and first-loss guarantees could enhance the funding landscape for large-scale sustainable projects while supporting programmes that mitigate climate risks for vulnerable communities such as low-income groups.</p><p>d) Launch a decarbonisation assistance facility (page 19) that provides long-term financial support for businesses in hard-to-abate sectors. Grants and competitively priced loans would facilitate energy efficiency, clean energy adoption, and the exploration of innovative solutions across challenging industries.</p><p>2. Refreshed: Uplifting Tomorrow's Workforce</p><p>Singapore's workforce is integral to sustaining its competitive edge. To remain a top destination for global talent and leadership, Singapore must equip its workforce with the skills and capabilities needed to drive innovation and address future challenges.</p><p>KPMG and SID recommend:</p><p>a) Establish a National Leadership Competency Index (page 23) to help organisations evaluate and grow their leadership pipeline. This index would serve as a benchmark to track and enhance essential competencies, building a talent pool that supports local and regional growth.</p><p>b) Expand investments in micro-credentialling and increase accessibility to SkillsFuture funding (page 24). Short-term certifications in high-demand areas such as AI, sustainability, and cybersecurity would address immediate skills gaps, while tax incentives and grants can encourage businesses to sponsor such upskilling programmes.</p><p>c) Mandate regular, robust board evaluations conducted by external facilitators (page 28). By adopting rigorous performance reviews similar to the UK's standards, companies can enhance governance and transparency across sectors. Encouraging companies to develop the competencies of their directors and adopt an unbiased, objective perspective to the review process will strengthen governance and performance.</p><p>3. Resilient: Driving Innovation in a Dynamic Global Business Landscape</p><p>To stay ahead in a rapidly evolving global economy, Singapore must strengthen its position as a leading innovation hub to help businesses excel on the global stage. By leveraging its open ecosystem and providing adequate consultation and financial support, businesses can adopt cutting-edge technologies, enhance their digital capabilities and better navigate the increasingly complex tax landscape.</p><p>KPMG and SID recommend:</p><p>Increase funding for the development of AI governance and standards (page 32) and training initiatives to encourage ethical AI deployment (page 34). Allocating funds to R and D in AI governance technologies, such as bias detection and transparent decision-making, can address technical complexities, while introducing grants can help companies boost the adoption of responsible AI practices through continuous learning opportunities provided to their employees.</p><p>Develop company director capabilities in ESG navigation and innovative strategies (page 37). Firms can be incentivised to provide ongoing professional development for their directors, elevating governance excellence and thought leadership across organisations, from startups to established corporations.</p><p>Strengthen corporate governance through enhanced tax governance practices (page 38). Tax governance can be incorporated as an integral part of corporate governance requirements, especially for companies benefitting from tax incentives or grants.</p><p>Lee Sze Yeng, Managing Partner, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"As Singapore enters SG60, we must focus on developing leaders with foresight and expertise in sustainability and technology to drive ambitions across sectors and secure a competitive edge in a rapidly changing global landscape.

In addition, we recommend stimulating greater organic innovation through research and development, supported by incentives and green financing, to further drive this transformation.</p><p>Our Budget 2025 Proposal also introduces recommendations designed to create a \"fast pass\" approach for businesses, providing quick assistance, ready-to-use templates, and a swift start for those eager to embark on complex and long journeys in areas like sustainability and technology. This approach aims to accelerate their transformation through well-structured support systems facilitated by the government, enabling companies to adopt innovative solutions and sustainable practices more effectively, while elevating Singapore's global reputation as a hub for value creation.</p><p>1. Ready: Leading with Sustainable Impact Regionally and Into the Future</p><p>The rising global emphasis on sustainability positions Singapore to lead by example. By establishing robust frameworks and standards, the nation can solidify its climate resilience and reinforce its role as a trusted hub for sustainable business practices and long-term economic growth.</p><p>KPMG and SID recommend:</p><p>a) Increase transparency in the allocation of carbon tax revenues (page 8) to strengthen clarity in the industry to undertake green initiatives. Detailed disclosures on the use of these funds can enable businesses to align their investments with Singapore's climate agenda.</p><p>b) Develop a centralised ESG reporting hub to guide businesses in adopting consistent sustainability practices (page 12). This hub, established through government and industry collaboration, would help businesses navigate reporting requirements and align themselves with international sustainability standards.</p><p>c) Deploy incentives for blended finance to accelerate Singapore's green transition (pages 17 and 18). Strategic grants and first-loss guarantees could enhance the funding landscape for large-scale sustainable projects while supporting programmes that mitigate climate risks for vulnerable communities such as low-income groups.</p><p>d) Launch a decarbonisation assistance facility (page 19) that provides long-term financial support for businesses in hard-to-abate sectors. Grants and competitively priced loans would facilitate energy efficiency, clean energy adoption, and the exploration of innovative solutions across challenging industries.</p><p>2. Refreshed: Uplifting Tomorrow's Workforce</p><p>Singapore's workforce is integral to sustaining its competitive edge. To remain a top destination for global talent and leadership, Singapore must equip its workforce with the skills and capabilities needed to drive innovation and address future challenges.</p><p>KPMG and SID recommend:</p><p>a) Establish a National Leadership Competency Index (page 23) to help organisations evaluate and grow their leadership pipeline. This index would serve as a benchmark to track and enhance essential competencies, building a talent pool that supports local and regional growth.</p><p>b) Expand investments in micro-credentialling and increase accessibility to SkillsFuture funding (page 24). Short-term certifications in high-demand areas such as AI, sustainability, and cybersecurity would address immediate skills gaps, while tax incentives and grants can encourage businesses to sponsor such upskilling programmes.</p><p>c) Mandate regular, robust board evaluations conducted by external facilitators (page 28). By adopting rigorous performance reviews similar to the UK's standards, companies can enhance governance and transparency across sectors. Encouraging companies to develop the competencies of their directors and adopt an unbiased, objective perspective to the review process will strengthen governance and performance.</p><p>3. Resilient: Driving Innovation in a Dynamic Global Business Landscape</p><p>To stay ahead in a rapidly evolving global economy, Singapore must strengthen its position as a leading innovation hub to help businesses excel on the global stage. By leveraging its open ecosystem and providing adequate consultation and financial support, businesses can adopt cutting-edge technologies, enhance their digital capabilities and better navigate the increasingly complex tax landscape.</p><p>KPMG and SID recommend:</p><p>Increase funding for the development of AI governance and standards (page 32) and training initiatives to encourage ethical AI deployment (page 34). Allocating funds to R D in AI governance technologies, such as bias detection and transparent decision-making, can address technical complexities, while introducing grants can help companies boost the adoption of responsible AI practices through continuous learning opportunities provided to their employees.</p><p>Develop company director capabilities in ESG navigation and innovative strategies (page 37). Firms can be incentivised to provide ongoing professional development for their directors, elevating governance excellence and thought leadership across organisations, from startups to established corporations.</p><p>Strengthen corporate governance through enhanced tax governance practices (page 38). Tax governance can be incorporated as an integral part of corporate governance requirements, especially for companies benefitting from tax incentives or grants.</p><p>Lee Sze Yeng, Managing Partner, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"As Singapore enters SG60, we must focus on developing leaders with foresight and expertise in sustainability and technology to drive ambitions across sectors and secure a competitive edge in a rapidly changing global landscape. A cohesive national strategy, aligned with the Forward SG agenda, is vital for nurturing future leaders. Leveraging Singapore's educated workforce and initiatives like SkillsFuture, a National Leadership Competency Index would help strengthen leadership pipelines and drive local and regional growth.</p><p>\"Leadership development must emphasise two critical strategies. First, micro-credentialling will play a pivotal role in equipping individuals with industry-recognised qualifications, creating leaders who are not only well-educated but professionally competent to deliver value and impact across sectors. Second, structured apprenticeships and meaningful learning exchanges will foster collaboration, mentorship, and the refinement of practical skills. These engagements - across all leadership tiers - offer emerging leaders invaluable opportunities to broaden their perspectives and master the art of value creation.\"</p><p>Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, Partner, Head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"Value creation is a significant challenge for Singapore amid a volatile global economy and growing concerns over digital trust, particularly with generative AI's rapid rise. The government must take the lead in driving transformation by using systemic levers, engaging industry stakeholders and implementing impactful strategies through enterprises to catalyse widespread impact.</p><p>\"Key areas of focus must include accelerating green infrastructure development through diverse green financing instruments, beyond traditional blended finance. Furthermore, a fast-track (or fast-pass) approach is required to support enterprises in their sustainability and technology transitions. This must involve clear standards, ready-made templates, actionable guidance and targeted funding. Partnerships with industry to co-create these tools will be vital.</p><p>\"Tax policies should strategically incentivise R D and drive organic innovation, ensuring Singapore leads in ESG and technological advancements through sustainable and innovative growth.\"</p><p>Terence Quek, CEO of SID, said:</p><p>\"As stewards of the organisation, directors are uniquely positioned to champion the integration of ESG principles into the core of business strategies. By fostering a culture of sustainability and innovation, directors can ensure long-term value creation, driving both responsible growth and competitive advantage. Board leadership is essential in setting the tone and aligning business models with evolving societal expectations, shaping a future where profitability and positive social impact go hand in hand.\"</p><p>Neil Parekh, Governing Council Member, SID, said:</p><p>\"Public capital markets, along with the fast-growing private financing markets, are a very powerful engine for value creation, enabling companies to access the funding needed for innovation, expansion and sustainable growth. Directors play a crucial role in guiding businesses to strategically leverage these markets, ensuring that investments are channelled towards initiatives that not only deliver financial returns but also contribute to long-term value creation for all stakeholders.\"</p><p>Hashtag: #KPMG</p><p>The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.</p><p>About KPMG in Singapore</p><p>KPMG in Singapore is part of a global organization of independent professional services firms providing Audit, Tax and Advisory services.

However, to make this smoke-free industry truly green, numerous tasks need to be accomplished, by the Government and local authorities as well as businesses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr Nguyen Anh Tuan, Director of Tourism Development Research Institute (Viet Nam National Administration of Tourism - VNAT), shared insights with Vietnam News Agency about green transformation.</p><p>How do you evaluate the strong efforts of the Vietnamese tourism industry towards sustainable green transformation?</p><p>Tourism is an economic sector, so it is natural that tourism should take the lead in implementing green transformation according to the national strategy for green growth and the circular economy development project approved by the Prime Minister.</p><p>In other words, green transformation is the task and responsibility of the tourism industry because tourism is a sector that extensively utilises resources. Resource exploitation and utilisation must follow the direction of green growth and circular economy to accomplish sustainable development goals, fulfilling Viet Nam's commitments to international sustainable development programmes.</p><p>At the moment, the number of players in the field implementing green tourism transformation remains few and far between. What do you think are the reasons for this?</p><p>The first reason is insufficient and incorrect awareness about green growth and circular economy in the tourism sector. Many tourism businesses see green tourism as simply visiting natural areas and fail to grasp the concept behind it, which is green growth, meaning to exploit and use resources in a reasonable, effective manner with conservation efforts in mind, for the sake of sustainable development.</p><p>Green tourism must entail respect towards natural resources, protection of the environment, the application of measures using clean energy, renewable energy, resource-saving solutions - especially wastewater treatment systems to ensure no discharge into the environment, building a clean environment and safe ecological destinations. In addition, businesses need to apply technological measures in the production of environmentally friendly products and services that meet the needs of tourists.</p><p>Clearly, many businesses still have insufficient and incorrect understanding of these principles, so the implementation of green tourism within the Vietnamese business community is still limited. And the State and relevant authorities are also partially responsible for this deficiency; they must step up disseminating and propagating green transformation policies to the business community and the public.</p><p>From awareness to action, implementation also requires impetus in terms of finance alongside encouraging policies and support. But currently, the tourism sector does not have any support, and even guiding documents and policies are incomplete. What suggestions do you have for businesses looking to implement sustainable green transformation effectively?</p><p>Recently, the Government and the Prime Minister have heavily emphasised businesses implementing green growth and circular economy. However, to go forward with this, one of the limitations and challenges is financial issues, as green growth implementation can be costly and the State needs to put in place resources to support and prioritise green transformation in tourism.</p><p>The national green growth plan mentions that the tourism sector has become a highly prioritised group so the State will undoubtedly allocate resources for development. However, the responsibility here lies not only with the central government but also with local authorities, who need to prioritise and have the correct understanding of green growth and circular economy, allocating resources and directing optimal budget support for infrastructure investment while enhancing awareness.</p><p>For example, investing in green infrastructure with modern wastewater and waste treatment systems at tourist areas is a must, especially at national-level tourist destinations such as Ph\u00fa Quoc Island (Ki\u00ean Giang Province) and C\u00f4n Dao (B\u00e0 Ria-Vung T\u00e0u).</p><p>The State needs to encourage businesses to invest in producing and using renewable energy to replace fossil fuels. The State, people and the business community need to work together while calling for support from international organisations, similar to projects the United Nations Development Programme are doing in Viet Nam.</p><p>Many other international organisations are also interested in green growth and sustainable development, and they are willing to allocate resources. The issue is how we approach international organisations, how we attract resources from them for the tourism sector.</p><p>Do you have policy recommendations regarding green tourism development in Viet Nam?</p><p>For the tourism sector, there needs to be State-level policies on tax exemptions or reductions for businesses investing in renewable energy, using clean water sources, and treating wastewater and waste in tourist areas.</p><p>For example, Ph\u00fa Quoc Island is a major tourist destination but lacks wastewater and waste treatment systems. If under the current conditions the State does not have the resources to build one, then the State needs specific mechanisms, policies on taxes and credit, something that will encourage businesses to invest in new fields, helping to implement the national strategy for green growth or the circular economy plan approved by the Prime Minister.</p><p>There is another outstanding issue related to civilised behaviour in tourism. Despite the significant increase in international visitors coming to Viet Nam in the first quarter, which is a promising sign, there is still a phenomenon where tourists are being overcharged at famous destinations, like the incidents taking place at Ho\u00e0n Kiem Lake (H\u00e0 Noi) recently. In your opinion, what responsibilities should management agencies take to make tourist environments green and clean, and to regain a positive image in the eyes of tourists?</p><p>The onus is on local government management agencies, as they must maintain and protect the tourist destination environment. Building a civilised, friendly environment requires the role and responsibility of functional agencies in strictly enforcing measures when detecting organisations or individuals responsible for negative incidents.</p><p>It is necessary to establish tourist information reception centres, with a 24/7 hotline in tourist areas for tourists - or even local residents - to report immediately to local authorities when they see any problems such as overcharging or harassment of tourists. Therefore, the responsibility of agencies on duty is very important; complaints and reports must be received and handled in a timely manner.</p><p>In this way, I believe issues will be resolved, contributing to creating a good image for the destination as well as building a green, clean, beautiful, safe brand for Vietnamese tourism.</p><p>Are the current sanctions for violations strong enough to deter violators?</p><p>I believe not yet. I think the tourism industry needs to propose stricter sanctions. Like drunk driving, for example, has been subject to much more severe punishment. Similarly, I think heavier penalties are needed for behaviours such as overcharging, harassment or scamming tourists, both domestic and international.</p><p>Of course, it's not just about issuing regulations, the most important thing is that management agencies need to enforce these regulations and handle offences strictly. If functional agencies fail to do this, and fail to fulfil their roles and responsibilities, it will not bring effective results.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["The national green growth plan mentions that the tourism sector has become a highly prioritised group so the State will undoubtedly allocate resources for development.

Although cities occupy only 2% of land area, they consume over two-thirds of the world's energy and account for over 70% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Cities are also the world's major growth engine, generating more than 80% of global GDP, while helping millions of people lift themselves out of extreme poverty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban centers' share of emissions is only expected to grow, as urban areas accommodate 2.5 billion additional inhabitants by 2050 including rural-to-urban migrants in search of better livelihoods and quality of life -- or those who are forced to migrate due to  conflict and increasingly frequent climate disasters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When planned for and managed well, urbanization contributes to economic growth and poverty alleviation, as well to sustainability and climate change mitigation. Unplanned growth, however, results in a proliferation of slums, congestion, pollution, lack of affordable housing, poor access to sanitation and waste management, and vulnerability to natural hazards, which are exacerbated by climate change.</p><p>An estimated 1 billion people live in informal settlements. In addition, the number of people affected by natural hazards tripled to two billion in the past decade - impacting the poor disproportionately. Global average annual losses from disasters in the built environment are now estimated at $314 billion and could rise to $415 billion by 2030, pushing 77 million more urban residents into poverty.</p><p>If managed well, the physical and economic density of cities can provide the impetus for technological change and infrastructure investments that support low-carbon development. The built environment of cities shapes the preference for public transit use, which is essential to reduce GHG emissions.</p><p>When cities grow vertically rather than sprawl horizontally, floor space per inhabitant increases, avoiding crowding while offering densities that justify public transport investments.</p><p>Retrofitting buildings to lower energy use and resource consumption, and redesigning cities to increase green spaces and promote walking and biking, will generate savings over time, create jobs and yield long-term climate benefits. In addition to enhancing livability and sustainability, investments in public spaces, sidewalks and bicycle lanes at the expense of vehicular (road and parking) space require relatively limited public outlays at a time where municipal revenues are constrained.</p><p>World Bank Strategy</p><p>As the world continues to urbanize, how cities are built and managed will determine the trajectory of GHG emissions. By making the right low-carbon investments and tackling deep-seated inequalities, especially in terms of access to land, housing, infrastructure and municipal services, governments and city leaders can avoid locking-in unsustainable infrastructure, create much-needed jobs and transform their economies so that they are more inclusive, resilient and sustainable.</p><p>The World Bank's work in urban development aims to support this objective, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable as well as the World Bank's goals to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Transforming cities is a key component of the Bank's first Climate Change Action Plan (2016-2020) and forthcoming update covering 2021-2025.</p><p>The Bank works with countries to integrate or enhance low-carbon considerations into urban planning, policy and investment. This approach includes investments that improve urban air quality, promote green buildings, support solid-waste management and circular-economy approaches, and provide clean and active urban mobility, open green spaces and nature-based solutions for urban cooling, wastewater management and urban biodiversity.</p><p>Several partnerships and collaborative initiatives are also geared toward this common goal:</p><p> The World Bank and the European Investment Bank are implementing the?City Climate Finance Gap Fund, a new partnership supporting the development of a pipeline of climate-smart investment projects to enable green, inclusive, resilient, creative, and competitive cities in developing countries. Through donor support, technical assistance, and targeted finance of at least pound 100 million (approx. $117 million), the Gap Fund aims to unlock an estimated pound 4 billion ($4.7 billion) to help cities transform climate ambition into finance-ready projects.</p><p> The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a global partnership and grant-funding mechanism managed by the World Bank, supporting disaster risk management projects worldwide and helping developing countries better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. GFDRR works with over 400 local, national, regional, and international partners, to build resilience, by providing knowledge, funding, and technical assistance.</p><p> The?City Resilience Program (CRP)?- a partnership between the Bank and GFDRR - is a multi-donor initiative for mainstreaming risk considerations in planning and increasing financing for urban resilience. As a starting point for engaging with cities to support them in effectively planning for resilience, the CRP has delivered 55 City Scans which provide a series of maps, visualizations, and analysis which spatially lay out the city's risk information and the built environment.</p><p> The Bank's?Global Platform for Sustainable Cities?is a partnership and knowledge platform to promote integrated solutions and cutting-edge knowledge for cities seeking to improve their resilience and overall urban sustainability. It includes 28 cities across 11 countries that have received $151 million from the Global Environment Facility and leveraged $2.4 billion in project co-financing.</p><p>Recent World Bank analytical work in this area includes:</p><p> What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050</p><p> The Hidden Wealth of Cities: Creating, Financing, and Managing Public Spaces</p><p> The State of City Climate Finance Report</p><p> Greening Africa's Cities</p><p>Project Results:</p><p> Using low-cost digital tools, the Tanzania Urban Resilience Program,  a DfID-funded initiative jointly implemented by the World Bank and the Government of Tanzania, was able to conduct flood modelling for the city at a fraction of the cost and with greater accuracy than traditional surveys.  The program has also created an innovative Resilience Academy, where students learn practical digital skills while working to make their countries safer from climate change. Using drones and household surveys, students mapped the whole island of Zanzibar, for example.</p><p> The Mozambique Cities and Climate Change Project includes a stormwater drainage system whose 11 kilometers of canals and flood control systems to prevent the city from flooding, strengthening the city's resilience to weather-related hazards. Soon after cyclones Idai and Kenneth hit and affected millions of people, the port of Beira was back in operation and the city was cleaned up, partly thanks to this project which also includes solar-powered street lighting, which at one point was the only source of light in the city.</p><p> In Belize, the Bank supported the national government in developing and implementing the National Climate Resilient Investment Plan (NCRIP) through the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project, which helped position the country to leverage additional climate financing from international financing institutions.</p><p> An estimated 10 million tons of CO2 emissions will be avoided over the next 20 years as a result of a World Bank-supported national waste management project in Azerbaijan. In addition to investments to improve the environmental conditions of the existing waste disposal sites in the capital city, including landfill gas capture, the project has supported measures to increase waste collection and reduce indiscriminatory dumping, the development of the National Waste Management Strategy, institutional and capacity building activities to improve operations, management, communication, data collection and planning.</p><p> In Eastern Caribbean countries, the Bank has mobilized over $200 million to enhance climate resilience and strategically reducing their vulnerability to climate change and disasters caused by natural hazards, including $83 million from the Strategic Climate Fund, and immediately following disasters (e.g., Saint Lucia Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project).</p><p> The Indonesia National Slum Upgrading Program  supports community-led planning and infrastructure delivery in 6,000 slums across the country. The project has mainstreamed disaster risk reduction at the community level, focusing on flood and fire prevention.

The key challenge ahead, particularly with economic headwinds expected worldwide, will be in financing the green agenda.</p><p>A strategy KPMG recommends is for the Government to implement a national framework to spur the growth of blended finance to address the trilemma of security, affordability, and sustainability.

This will attract talents who may not wish to relocate but are still eager to be based in Singapore on a short-term basis.\"</p><p>(b) Strengthen hybrid and remote working regime (p.18, 19)</p><p>As more Singapore businesses leverage talents overseas to grow, Singapore is likely to benefit from the higher corporate tax revenue generated. In step with this, Singapore should initiate at least an ASEAN-wide framework to address tax issues that may arise for Singapore companies with remote workers in another country. Potential challenges to be addressed under the framework include the creation of a Permanent Establishment in an overseas jurisdiction and the taxing rights over the salaries and related remuneration of remote workers.</p><p>Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, Partner, Head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"Companies are building a future-forward workforce, where hybrid or remote work is now a long-term option for many.

This pool of funds can provide flexibility to economic agencies to provide targeted programmes to both global and local multinationals.</p><p>\"There can also be an increase in the number of expenditure-based tax incentives (offered in the form of Qualified Refundable Tax Credits rather than enhanced tax deductions). These can take the form of expanding the list of intellectual property categories that can qualify for writing down allowances. Existing R&amp;D tax incentives should also be redesigned to a Qualified Refundable Tax Credit scheme so that there will be minimal impact under the rules, alongside the increase in grant caps of existing programmes.\"</p><p>(b) Boost Singapore's digital asset ecosystems (p.29)</p><p>KPMG's research has shown promising use cases and innovation of digital assets, including non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and Decentralised Finance (DeFi), to boost digital connectivity and economic integration. Singapore should carefully study the changing landscape and look at providing certainty on the regulatory and tax treatments of these new investment products to strengthen its digital asset ecosystems. To further fuel growth, Singapore should also promote the use of digital accelerators or hackathons that allow industry advisory boards to guide and sponsor fintechs to solve industry-wide problems.</p><p>(c) Targeted grants for GST-registered businesses (p.27)</p><p>Some businesses are likely to be impacted by the staggered Goods &amp; Services Tax (GST) hike over the next two years, with top concerns on compliance costs. The Government can offer grants to specific businesses, such as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) which are more concerned about the cost of complying with the two-step GST rate hike.</p><p>(d) Provide certainty on new wealth taxes (p.27)</p><p>Ongoing speculations on whether Singapore will see new forms of wealth taxes have led to market uncertainty, in particular for the wealth management sector and high-net-worth individuals contemplating if they should move their assets here. The Government should clarify if it will be introducing wealth taxes in the near future, and what this might mean for the country.</p><p>Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, Partner, Head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"Singapore has been raising the progressivity of its tax policies in a calibrated manner. However, the market continues to have concerns over the possibility of a new wealth tax or a reintroduction of estate duty or inheritance tax. Budget 2023 will need to be decisive in addressing these speculations.\"</p><p>(e) Tax rebates and incentives to cope with rising costs</p><p>Amid concerns over inflation and rising costs, enterprises will benefit from support as they strive to be more innovative and future ready. We recommend the following measures:</p><p>A one-off 10 percent corporate income tax rebate and an increase in the number of installments that companies can take to pay their income tax liabilities (p.32)</p><p>Expand coverage of the enhanced R&amp;D tax deduction to include costs incurred for overseas R&amp;D activities, beyond its current scope of activities performed in Singapore only (p.32)</p><p>Help businesses invest in the local talent pool with an additional 100 percent deduction on training expenses, with similar conditions to the Productivity and Innovation Credit (PIC) scheme for qualifying training expenditure (p.32)</p><p>Increase Enterprise Development Grant support for overseas mergers &amp; acquisition activities to up to 90 percent for SMEs and up to 70 percent for non-SMEs for an initial period of two years to drive internalisation efforts (p.31)</p><p>Up to 80 percent of funding support under the Productivity Solutions Grant for companies to adopt advanced manufacturing solutions, along with a two-year extension of the 100 percent investment allowance to encourage the sector to shift towards automation. (p.31)</p><p>(f) Enable businesses to transform supply chains and embed ESG (p.30)</p><p>Ong Pang Thye, Managing Partner, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"Beyond economic factors, Singapore has also had to contend with climate change. However, even as carbon markets are set to expand significantly, carbon trading is not a long-term solution to reducing carbon emissions. Ultimately, large emitters will need to adopt greener and more cost-efficient solutions and the Government has a critical role in driving a mindset change.\"</p><p>That said, in response to supply chain disruptions and the push towards ESG, more companies are looking to invest in digital transformation to be more efficient and sustainable, and could benefit from these measures:</p><p>Enhanced deductibility of expenses incurred on supply chain digitalisation and transformation</p><p>Special taxation regime and/or financing for companies involved in investment, development and trade of renewable energy, hydrogen and carbon credits.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["c) Intensify green investments (p. 11)To tap the potential of green bonds in energy transition, KPMG proposes to set frameworks for analysing a project's qualification for green investments, including introducing a green credit scoring system with new environment and energy factors.

Highlights are summarised below.</p><p>(1) Powering Sustainability (p. 4 of proposal)</p><p>(a) Implement a National Blended Finance Framework to spur green financing (p.6)</p><p>Singapore has taken steps on its climate commitments through its Singapore Green Plan and its recent appointment of a Government Chief Sustainability Officer. The key challenge ahead, particularly with economic headwinds expected worldwide, will be in financing the green agenda.</p><p>A strategy KPMG recommends is for the Government to implement a national framework to spur the growth of blended finance to address the trilemma of security, affordability, and sustainability. This framework can include broad-based schemes with low entry thresholds and targeted initiatives for emissions-intensive industries or transition projects.</p><p>Ong Pang Thye, Managing Partner, KPMG in Singapore said:</p><p>\"A national blended finance framework can be pivotal for sustainable change to happen at-scale nationally and regionally. Countries and companies in the region are also keeping sustainable development on top of their agendas. However, securing funding can be challenging with individual countries facing ongoing economic headwinds, while dealing with domestic developments and priorities.</p><p>\"As part of this framework, the Government could encourage financial institutions (FIs) to step up their involvement in the climate transition (through incentives) - this can involve FIs redirecting the necessary capital to areas with the highest needs. At the same time, authorities can also extend access to Singapore's Sustainable Bond Grant Scheme to a wider audience of issuers that need financing for green projects. The successful implementation of such a blended finance framework in the longer term will position Singapore as a leading green finance hub to anchor ASEAN's green and just energy transition.\"</p><p>(b) Spearhead asset recycling mechanisms and alternate funding options (p.10)</p><p>Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, Partner, Head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore added:</p><p>\"Singapore can lead the development and implementation of asset recycling frameworks to refinance brownfield infrastructure, while achieving Singapore and ASEAN's broader Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) objectives. These mechanisms will optimise private sector innovation, investment and efficiency in operating infrastructure assets, while freeing up capital that can be deployed to other priority greenfield infrastructure projects. An Energy Transition Mechanism involving early retirement of coal-fired power projects is one area with high potential and impact.\"</p><p>(c) Intensify green investments (p.11)</p><p>To tap the potential of green bonds in energy transition, KPMG proposes to set frameworks for analysing a project's qualification for green investments, including introducing a green credit scoring system with new environment and energy factors. As renewable energy technologies begin to mature in this decade, investments into green infrastructure projects and research and development (R and D) capabilities will be critical. The Government can consider pumping investments into large-scale alternative energy projects in ASEAN countries under a \"generate and transfer model\" to accelerate the nearshore import of renewable energy and decarbonise the grid at a quicker pace.</p><p>Other measures to further drive the decarbonisation agenda include:</p><p>Working with industry bodies to boost support for FIs, such as setting up a new subset of qualifying activities under the Financial Sector Incentive scheme which provides for concessionary tax rates, enhanced deductions or cash grant schemes</p><p>Extending consumer tax incentives, such as the EV Early Adoption Incentive and the Vehicular Emissions Scheme to further bridge price differentials between electric vehicles and internal combustion engine vehicles (p.14)</p><p>Incentives to bridge the green building demand-supply gap, including a 200 percent tax deduction on financing costs and rental of green properties, a 30 percent property tax rebate and a 50 percent exemption on taxable gains from green building sales. (p.13)</p><p>2. Opening Doors to Opportunity (p. 15 of proposal)</p><p>(a) Attract top talents to augment Singapore's economy amid a talent war (p.18)</p><p>With a global war for talent and an ever-evolving business landscape, Singapore must continue to attract the best minds to its shore, while ensuring that policies to facilitate new ways of working remain robust. At the same time, these new challenges have prompted Singapore's leaders to refresh the country's social compact and foster renewed resilience, led by its Forward Singapore roadmap.</p><p>Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, Partner, Head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"To be a global leader in attracting and retaining talent, Singapore should extend the tax exemption days for foreign employees working in priority sectors of the economy to 90 days. This will attract talents who may not wish to relocate but are still eager to be based in Singapore on a short-term basis.\"</p><p>(b) Strengthen hybrid and remote working regime (p.18, 19)</p><p>As more Singapore businesses leverage talents overseas to grow, Singapore is likely to benefit from the higher corporate tax revenue generated. In step with this, Singapore should initiate at least an ASEAN-wide framework to address tax issues that may arise for Singapore companies with remote workers in another country. Potential challenges to be addressed under the framework include the creation of a Permanent Establishment in an overseas jurisdiction and the taxing rights over the salaries and related remuneration of remote workers.</p><p>Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, Partner, Head of Tax, KPMG in Singapore, said:</p><p>\"Companies are building a future-forward workforce, where hybrid or remote work is now a long-term option for many. However, safeguards against income tax leakages need to be strengthened. This means reviewing underlying policies and setting the relevant guidelines for remote-working employees based in Singapore, to provide more clarity to foreign employers and employees.</p><p>(c) Catalyse private and public capital to build Singapore's social compact (p.22)</p><p>Singapore has been reviewing its tax system to boost revenue generation potential, but any enhancements should be carefully considered in terms of rate and scope to remain fair and progressive. Alongside this, KPMG recommends for the Government to catalyse private and public capital for social spending through innovative blended finance structures and social bonds - as already seen in several Asia Pacific countries. Early-stage grants to support the design of social bonds as well as partial guarantees to bond holders to lower investment risks and bring in private investors should be explored. Additionally, platforms such as social stock exchanges can also attract new investment.</p><p>3. Strength in Adversity (p. 23 of proposal)</p><p>Singapore will need to demonstrate how it can bolster its fiscal resources while protecting prospects for growth as it enters challenging times.

To date, 193 states have agreed to keep the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to well below 2\u2070C and preferably 1.5\u2070C. At COP26, Viet Nam joined more than 70 other countries to commit to a net-zero emissions target by 2050 and coal phase-out in the 2040s. Accelerating the race to net-zero requires concerted efforts by all stakeholders, especially the private sector.</p><p>Viet Nam's successful development of solar power between 2017-2020 and some wind over the past year is notable. However, shifting to net-zero requires that whole industries and sectors transform for scaling which in turn needs a commensurate expansion of professional human resources across sectors. FDI can play an important accelerating role through technology transfer and human resource training.</p><p>Critical to building on this initial success is developing a long-term policy, and predictable FIT for renewables that will allow investors to commit to long-term investments in renewable energy, enabling more stable long-term energy development of Viet Nam. Operationalising full wholesale and retail power markets by 2024 is expected to provide transparent, fair, and competitive environments for investors, suppliers, service providers and end-users. This in turn would enable more buyers of renewable energy leading to greater efficiencies.</p><p>We hope that the upcoming power development plans No.8 will provide a clear roadmap for the development of renewable energy and predictable FITs so that investors can plan and make long-term commitments to invest in renewable energy in Viet Nam which will significantly boost investments. Making the shift to green production and consumption will also take a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach for a sustainable future in Viet Nam. There are many investments that are needed over the long run, but it is very important to get policy and regulatory frameworks correct now so that we can crowd in the investment Viet Nam needs at this time for renewable energy. The good thing is that so many private sector entities, both national and international, are keen to invest in Viet Nam. If governance bottlenecks are addressed, it will help the country go a long way in its energy transition.</p><p>Alain Cany, Chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Viet Nam</p><p>Alain Cany, Chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Viet Nam</p><p>For Viet Nam to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, an integrated public-private effort must be coordinated across all aspects of society, the economy, and the government. Collaboration with foreign companies and institutions can help reach this goal. In particular, European FDI firms have extensive experience with eco-friendly initiatives and best practices, making them uniquely positioned for collaboration with Vietnam.</p><p>A transition to a clean energy economy will also require significant financial resources. Funds are needed to phase out carbon-intensive industries, promote green businesses, and increase renewable energy access. Mechanisms for public-private partnerships and private investment in green energy projects need to be adjusted to avoid roadblocks in the development of necessary renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p>To meet the demand for human capital, the government must provide workers with training, recruit high-skilled workers, and provide favourable visa and work permit policies to attract international experts for the purpose of developing Vietnamese talent.</p><p>Following the pandemic, recovery solutions are crucial in the short term, while an energy transition will require decades of sustained funding and support. In comparison with urgently needed pandemic recovery policies, an energy transition may seem more distant, and more difficult to justify. In addition, the ongoing instability resulting from the war in Ukraine has made short-term economic remedies even more critical, requiring world leaders to allocate limited resources to combat inflation, repair supply chains, and stabilise commodity prices. Due to these dual crises, governments and businesses have had a difficult time finding funding for long-term but essential changes such as cutting fossil fuel consumption and producing more renewable energy.</p><p>Despite all the challenges, an energy transition is critical and urgent. Energy transition should be pursued together with pandemic recovery measures since doing too little will cost more than it will benefit. The government of Viet Nam recognises that the two cannot be separated. As a result, it is leading an economic recovery alongside an energy transition as outlined in Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's COP26 commitments and its National Green Growth Strategy.</p><p>Through post-pandemic recovery policy interventions, the implementation of incentives, and financing mechanisms to promote green initiatives, Viet Nam's economy can be rebuilt more effectively than ever before based on a green, sustainable basis. Viet Nam can eventually become Southeast Asia's leader in green energy by following this path.</p><p>Dr. Do Nam Thang, a research fellow at Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University</p><p>Dr. Do Nam Thang, a research fellow at Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National University</p><p>There are various ways in which FDI and foreign companies can involve. They can invest in green infrastructure such as transmission grids. Viet Nam now needs sizeable investments in upgrading the grid systems to accommodate renewable energy and also to meet increasing electricity demand. The investments can also be directed to energy storage, to help the uptake of renewable energy. The storage can be in terms of batteries or off-river pumped hydro energy storage.</p><p>The energy transition is a relatively new concept everywhere, especially in Viet Nam. The pace of the booming of renewable energy worldwide is much faster than the pace of the development of domestic regulations and administrative procedures to keep up. No process can happen overnight. It takes time to transit to renewable energy.</p><p>The policy is the key. If the policy is clear and stable, then the investors will have trust and take action. For example, Viet Nam could set a clear renewable energy target and the target needs to be stable. It could be changed, but at least in negotiation with those who have taken action, those who have built the plans and invested. That's important.</p><p>The energy transition is the world's future trend. The trend will involve opportunities and challenges. The government alone may not be adequate to go far enough. Community and industry are the key partners. I think for every transition and development, there are challenges, and even failures, especially at the beginning. If people are open to opportunities and failure, then I think the process will be made forward. If we don't want to change, we may not be able to go very far.</p><p>Stuart Livesey, CEO of La G\u00e0n Offshore Wind Farm Project</p><p>Stuart Livesey, CEO of La G\u00e0n Offshore Wind Farm Project</p><p>The offshore wind industry in Viet Nam is nearing a turning point to start the process, however, there are several aspects that need to be resolved to allow this. A robust, suitable and practical regulatory and policy framework needs to be created and enforced to allow developers a route to market. This needs to be equally supported by a bankable power purchase agreement (PPA) so it is clear how costs can be covered for this high-cost industry in the early stages of its maturation.</p><p>Experience in relation to installing offshore wind in Viet Nam is limited to nearshore wind projects only (most being established within three nautical miles). Offshore wind farms are installed in a completely different manner, with much more complexity in terms of the vessels used and infrastructure installed, and the risks involved with establishing these high-cost projects.</p><p>While it is true to say the infrastructure, human resources, and finance for offshore wind now are limited, there is a significant potential for Viet Nam to very quickly resolve this by transitioning skills from similar industries (such as offshore oil and gas), considering the ability to adapt the local supply chain in the long term, and encouraging experienced foreign developers to participate in the early stages of the industry to allow a stable growth and lessons learnt to be shared with suppliers and local Vietnamese companies, in addition to the ministries and provinces that will be associated with such projects.</p><p>Other markets have shown that by supporting the growth of a new offshore wind industry with the introduction of demonstration projects, feed-in tariffs, transition mechanisms, among others.</p><p>Taiwan has shown consistent reductions over the past six years from initial feed-in tariffs (FITs), to transitional mechanisms, and now to competitive auctions, with approximately 60 per cent cost reduction over the past six years. Taiwan's ability to attract foreign investment, which ultimately has led to massive reductions in subsidy levels has only been possible by recognising the demand for energy would increase, as would the demand for green energy based on domestic and international policies and regulations for local generators/consumers and associated requirements for import and export tax on good manufactured in Taiwan.</p><p>The development of multiple projects in the same area will require active and continuous government coordination, but this ability to have a clear sight of future opportunities will provide reassurance for developers and suppliers to invest and commit further in their offshore wind activities within Viet Nam.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["Do Nam Thang, a research fellow at Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National UniversityDr. Do Nam Thang, a research fellow at Crawford School of Public Policy, Australian National UniversityThere are various ways in which FDI and foreign companies can involve.
