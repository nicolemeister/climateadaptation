Leading it is 34-year-old Nguyen L\u00ea Ngoc Linh, a woman from the Tho ethnic group, who walked away from a promising career in the city to reforest degraded land and re-imagine sustainable livelihoods for her community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What began as a dream has grown into Vuon rung ban Tho (Tho Village Forest Garden), a pioneering agro-ecology initiative covering over six hectares. The initiative has brought verdant life back to barren hills and changed how rural development is approached.</p><p>From PR pro to forest restorer</p><p>Born in the district of Nhu Xu\u00e2n, Linh knew firsthand the challenges facing her community: poor soil, deforestation, and a lack of economic opportunity. After graduating from a university in H\u00e0 Noi with a degree in public relations, Linh landed a coveted role at a major publishing company.</p><p>Yet something tugged at her. Each visit home reminded her of the vanishing forest and the people left behind.</p><p>In 2020, she made the improbable choice to leave the city and invest her savings, nearly US$39,000, into a three-hectare barren hillside with no access to electricity, water or roads.</p><p>Family and friends called it a mistake. But Linh saw something different: the potential to heal the land and the people.</p><p>Rewilding through local wisdom</p><p>Unlike monoculture forestry projects, 'Vuon rung ban Tho' is an agro-ecological marvel designed to mimic a natural forest ecosystem. Linh planted multi-layered vegetation: fruit trees, medicinal herbs, native timber species, and nitrogen-fixing plants. The goal was to rebuild biodiversity and let nature guide the regeneration process.</p><p>No synthetic fertilisers, pesticides or herbicides are used. Instead, composted organic matter and biofertilisers produced on-site nourish the soil. Grasses are not uprooted, but are left to protect against erosion and water loss - a critical approach in this erosion-prone landscape.</p><p>\"Nhu Xu\u00e2n is an arid region with little rain. If the land is not well covered, it will easily lose water, leading to soil degradation,\" Linh explained, noting that more than 100 species thrive in her forest-farm system today.</p><p>Cooperative model for community prosperity</p><p>Recognising that personal action was not enough, Linh founded Hop t\u00e1c x\u00e3 Ban Tho (the Tho Village Cooperative) in late 2020. Starting with just seven members, it now includes over 20, mainly ethnic minority women from impoverished households. They share land, tools, knowledge and profits.</p><p>Through the cooperative, Linh introduced value-added processing to the local economy. Her standout product - fermented forest honey infused with herbs like ginger and turmeric - has earned a three-star OCOP certification, Viet Nam's national standard for rural products.</p><p>The cooperative's reach has expanded beyond the province. Products are sold online via websites, distributed through regional fairs, and shared on social media - all skills Linh carried over from her previous career in media.</p><p>Reviving more than the land</p><p>The social impact is tangible. Dozens of villagers now have stable incomes. Women previously confined to household labour are earning money, gaining confidence, and taking leadership roles within the cooperative. Linh also trains locals in sustainable farming, often hosting students and volunteers from across Viet Nam.</p><p>\"Thanks to working here, I have a stable monthly income of VND5 million ($193) and have learned about afforestation, plant protection, and not using chemical fertilisers,\" said Truong Thi Hien, a local worker.</p><p>National recognition and growing ambitions</p><p>Her work has earned national acclaim. In 2020, she won the Special Prize at the National Rural Youth Start-up Contest. In 2021, her honey product topped Thanh H\u00f3a's Innovation Awards. In 2022, she received the prestigious Luong Dinh Cua Award for outstanding young farmers.</p><p>The following year, she was awarded the Vu A D\u00ednh Prize, recognising ethnic minority youth for contributions to community development.</p><p>Her long-term vision? A complete sustainable food ecosystem rooted in the forest. She plans to expand into community-based tourism, showcasing local Tho culture through craft workshops, traditional foods and eco-lodging, as well as scale up organic production with new forest plots in the neighbouring Ngoc Lac District.</p><p>\"I don't just sell honey; I sell the story behind it, a story about the forest,\" Linh stated, emphasising her role as a storyteller connecting values.</p><p>Reforestation, climate adaptation and indigenous pride</p><p>Beyond economic success, Linh's model has become an environmental case study. Her reforestation has improved groundwater retention and soil fertility.</p><p>Trees once absent from the region are now attracting birds and insects, boosting pollination and wildlife diversity.</p><p>Perhaps more critically, the forest serves as a cultural anchor for the Tho people, reconnecting them with their roots through medicinal plants, ancestral stories, and traditional land-use practices.</p><p>\"If there are no more forests, our world will have nothing left,\" Linh said.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["She plans to expand into community-based tourism, showcasing local Tho culture through craft workshops, traditional foods and eco-lodging, as well as scale up organic production with new forest plots in the neighbouring Ngoc Lac District.

Launched on May 6, the HDR examines what the AI age could mean for human development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It argues that the impact of AI on people's well-being and societal progress is far from inevitable and that choices humans make today will shape the future - for better or worse. It demonstrates how choices that ensure AI deployment is ethical, inclusive and sustainable can support countries to reap the full benefit of AI, and avoid a deepening of existing divides.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2023, Viet Nam's Human Development Index (HDI) score rose to 0.766, from 0.726 one year earlier. This improvement is to be recognised and celebrated. Yet, like many other countries, the HDI score conceals persistent inequalities. When adjusted for inequality, the HDI for Viet Nam drops to 0.641, representing a 16.3 per cent loss due to disparities in health, education and income dimensions. This loss is similar to the average inequality loss across East Asia and the Pacific. Understanding the drivers of these inequalities and taking them into consideration will be key to ensuring that the deployment of AI considers the differentiated needs of all.</p><p>AI and inequality</p><p>Globally, there is an 'AI equity gap' that threatens to increase existing inequalities and undermine the ability of low- and middle-income countries to harness AI for public goods (e.g. improving health care, climate adaptation, or digital governance). This goes well beyond access to the internet. While one in every three people worldwide don't have internet access, only two per cent of the world's data centres are in Africa, meeting the computing power needs of only five per cent of AI innovators.</p><p>New GenAI technologies, like ChatGPT, are seeing growth and adoption at rates unlike anything else we've seen before, reaching 100 million users in only two months. Compare that with fixed phone lines, which took 75 years to achieve the same. Digital technology and AI have the potential to contribute US$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030, but only 10 per cent of this will be in the Global South.</p><p>Making AI work for human development</p><p>We need to design our policy choices with a conscious goal to leverage AI's potential to enhance human capabilities and quality of life.</p><p>AI can be deployed in sectors where positive spillovers can be leveraged, augmenting rather than replacing jobs, increasing productivity and developing strategies to maximise impact, while mitigating potential adverse effects.</p><p>AI has also enabled innovations in assistive and accessible technologies that can expand choices and opportunities for people with disabilities, technologies such as live captioning and translation of sign language into voice or text. Beyond individual stories, AI holds immense potential for reshaping public services, healthcare systems, agricultural productivity and disaster preparedness, underscoring its critical role in inclusive socio-economic development. If human development elements are central in the design stage, the deployment of AI can increase human agency and quality of life.</p><p>As Viet Nam scales up its AI ambitions, it must do so with a critical eye on environmental sustainability. AI systems, particularly large language models and data-intensive applications, consume vast amounts of energy-raising concerns about carbon emissions and environmental impact. Policy efforts must integrate environmental assessments into digital infrastructure planning, promote renewable energy adoption in AI deployments, and incentivise green innovation. AI should not just be smart-it must be sustainable.</p><p>Investing in capabilities</p><p>Education systems must equip learners with future-relevant skills to thrive in an AI-driven world. Preparing the future workforce for AI demands holistic, adaptive education systems. Education will need to move beyond increasing years of schooling, to focus on quality of education and skill enhancements. AI's flexibility and adaptability could be used to tailor learning in different contexts to achieve suitable learning outcomes.</p><p>AI governance</p><p>Researchers reveal that while AI holds undeniable promise for sustainable development, there is an imbalance in representation in global AI governance discourse that often reflects Global North concerns (e.g., algorithmic bias, privacy) while neglecting systemic disparities between countries. A study analysing prominent global AI ethics documents found that the majority comes from Global North, with 40 per cent originated from just two countries: the US and the UK, with very limited contributions from the Global South. Moreover, answers generated by AI are largely blind to the perspectives of people in the Global South.</p><p>This dominance may lead to a distortion in AI policy development and the design of ethics frameworks.</p><p>Harnessing AI in Viet Nam</p><p>Viet Nam's national AI vision, articulated in Decision No 127/QD-TTg and supported by Resolution No 57-NQ/TW on breakthroughs in Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) development, prioritises significant investment in STI.</p><p>At the 2025 AI Semiconductor Conference (AISC) Prime Minister Pham Minh Ch\u00ednh called for \"a comprehensive, global, and inclusive approach in AI development that emphasises international solidarity and cooperation to collectively build a better world.\" He announced plans for training 100,000 engineers in semiconductor and AI technology and pledged to protect people's safety, security and mitigate potential technological risks.</p><p>In UNDP's recent Viet Nam AI Landscape assessment (AILA), we shared how this vision is being translated through action, including through local AI Champions who used AI to improve delivery of public services.</p><p>Yet, institutional frameworks continue to be both a bottleneck and a potential breakthrough area for Viet Nam's AI and semiconductor ambitions.

As a result, many countries, including Vietnam, are observing a demographic shift toward an ageing population, which means people are living longer. That's a positive outcome of development. Demographic shifts, in particular ageing populations, and responding to climate change are interlinked priorities. Older persons are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, in particular ill-health effects, and are often overlooked when it comes to disaster response. For this reason, climate action in many countries is increasingly promoting lifelong investments in climate knowledge and adaptation, as well as housing and care facilities for older persons who are climate resilient. In addition, older people have much knowledge about how to prepare for extreme weather events and are an important resource for building resilience within communities.</p><p>We know that Vietnam entered the phase of population ageing in 2011, with 10% of its population over 60 years old. Today, this figure has reached 16% and is expected to surpass 20% by 2036, marking Vietnam's transition into an 'aged' society. Population aging reflects positive development, showcasing advancements in socio-economic conditions, healthcare and living standards. In a society with an increasing number of elderly people, this demographic shift presents a golden opportunity for economic growth, particularly in the expanding care market catering to the needs and aspirations of older persons. The rapid ageing process also demands greater efforts to address challenges faced by the elderly.</p><p>Vietnam has made significant strides in promoting policies and programmes to prepare for population ageing. The draft Population Law, currently under public consultation, includes proposals from the Ministry of Health to adapt to an aging society. Alongside policies for elderly care and health packages, there is a strong need for policies that harness the values of the elderly, creating suitable employment opportunities and increasing their income.</p><p>Moreover, to address the challenges of population ageing, Vietnam recognises the importance of investing in its young population. Efforts have been made to provide comprehensive sexuality education, improve access to reproductive health services, and create opportunities for youth engagement in climate action. By empowering young people with knowledge and skills, Vietnam aims to build a resilient and adaptive society capable of addressing future challenges.</p><p>One example is UNFPA's partnership with the government and stakeholders to develop an Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) model that is based at the community level. This initiative supports caregivers and addresses societal challenges by providing comprehensive care services for an ageing society. With a community-based approach, ICOPE reduces pressure on public healthcare systems and households by encouraging local engagement and shared responsibility in elderly care.</p><p>Preparing for an older population includes many areas such as health insurance, pension systems and preparing the health care system as well as promoting labour market engagement among older persons. Vietnam is already making strides in many of these areas as well as tapping into policy exchanges and learning from other countries in the region and beyond.</p><p>The preparation begins with the systematic use of population data to help plan and adapt infrastructure and policies to the realities of demographic change. Understanding data such as how many people live in each location, their socioeconomic characteristics and the age structure of the local population is essential to ensure people-centred governance. Data on climate change and climate risk is also a key tool in developing effective and targeted plans for disaster risk reduction and responding to climate-induced extreme weather events. These plans also help to ensure the continuation of key services for example, essential sexual and reproductive health services and services for older people; and, of course, plans that include investing in young people are crucial for every country on the journey to climate adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Reporter: Typhoon Yagi and floods caused significant loss of life and property in Vietnam, especially among vulnerable groups. What recommendations do you have for Vietnam to help these groups cope with the impacts of climate change?</p><p>Matt Jackson: Typhoon Yagi and its devastating aftermath highlight the urgent need to enhance resilience and support for adolescent girls, women, children, the elderly and marginalised groups such as PwD, migrants, ethnic minority communities in remote areas. These populations often bear the brunt of disasters and emergencies as well as face increasing risks.</p><p>Efforts must focus on improving forecasting and early warning capacities, ensuring timely, accessible and comprehensive disaster warnings for all communities, especially those in remote areas and minority populations. These groups often lack the resources or infrastructure to respond swiftly to emergencies. Early warning systems should be tailored to effectively reach these communities by utilising local networks and digital platforms and be in accessible formats such as sign language and radio broadcasts.</p><p>UNFPA and the Vietnam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority (VDDMA) will continue collaboration to strengthen Vietnam's resilience against disasters and climate change while improving the health and quality of life for affected populations. As the UN agency specialising in sexual and reproductive health (SRH), UNFPA remains present before, during and after crises to ensure SRH services and gender-based violence responses are integrated into emergency response programmes. Evidence shows that disasters often exacerbate gender-based violence as women face caregiving burdens, economic losses and heightened vulnerability in overcrowded shelters with limited resources.</p><p>In responding to the devastation of Typhoon Yagi across northern Vietnam, UNFPA mobilised over 16 billion VND to support vulnerable groups affected by the storm. These efforts reaffirm UNFPA's commitment to disaster response and recovery, especially for women, children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups. UNFPA allocated essential resources to ensure short- and long-term benefits for affected groups, including:</p><p>3,000 dignity kits for women,</p><p>Cash support for 1,250 pregnant women to ensure safe deliveries at healthcare facilities,</p><p>Cash assistance for 835 elderly individuals in remote and ethnic minority areas, and</p><p>$500,000 in support for gender-based violence services in Quang Ninh province.</p><p>Through partnerships with the Vietnam Farmers' Union, dignity kits have become an essential part of UNFPA's comprehensive humanitarian support package. These kits protect women's and girls' reproductive health and rights, maintain hygiene and preserve dignity in disaster contexts. They include information on reproductive health and guidance on preventing and responding to gender-based violence. UNFPA calls on all partners to ensure that climate adaptation strategies are gender-sensitive and integrated into national and local plans. Policies should address long-term climate change challenges, ensuring that women, children and minorities are central to decision-making processes.</p><p>Moreover, to ensure permanent preparedness for natural disasters such as typhoons, it is essential to provide comprehensive training for local communities, with a particular focus on young people. Empowering local youth is crucial for developing long-term solutions for climate change adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Reporter: What are UNFPA's cooperation projects and programmes in Vietnam in 2025?</p><p>Matt Jackson: In 2025, UNFPA will continue its efforts through various cooperation projects and programmes to address Vietnam's pressing needs in partnership with the government of Vietnam and aligned with Vietnam's national priorities and global commitments.</p><p>As the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA is making every effort around the world to end preventable maternal deaths, end the unmet need for family planning, and end gender-based violence (GBV) and harmful practices by 2030. Ensuring rights and choices for all such as bodily autonomy is a major principle of population-centred development because people who can make choices about their bodies often have more and better options throughout their lives. These three goals are part of UNFPA's corporate strategic plan worldwide, including in Vietnam where they are also included in the 10th UNFPA Country Programme for Vietnam 2022-2026.</p><p>In the upcoming year, we will continue to support the government of Vietnam's work in strategic areas including sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR); youth empowerment; population ageing; evidence-based policy making and ending gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls.</p><p>Some of the areas that I am most excited about are working with government Ministries, Departments and other partners to develop plans to scale up the One Stop Service Centres (Ngoi nha Anh Duong) and National Hotline to support survivors of GBV. Recently, a new Anh Duong House was opened in January in Hoa Binh with plans for additional centres to open in An Giang, Khanh Hoa and Ha Tinh. We also support life skills and comprehensive sexuality education for young people, and enable robust population data for effective policy making.</p><p>UNFPA is also supporting the government of Vietnam and the General Statistics Office in conducting important surveys such as the mid-decade census, and studies on issues like migration, population ageing and ethnic minority communities. This data will help the government to understand population trends and plan accordingly.</p><p>Also, we will continue to support Vietnam's population ageing process by supporting an integrated and coherent social protection system and applying a life-cycle and gender-transformative approach to ageing to address inequalities, enhance the resilience of the most vulnerable groups, pilot and scale up integrated care for older persons through the intergenerational self-help clubs.</p><p>Furthermore, we will collaborate with the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Vietnam and many different stakeholders and partners to ensure universal access to an integrated package of quality sexual and reproductive health information and services, this includes: Data generation, analysis, and transformation for policies, guidelines, and tools that address the special needs of vulnerable populations; elaboration of innovative financing mechanisms including private sector financing and sub-national public financing, particularly to address emerging SRHR issues such as cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus vaccinations.</p><p>We will also continue to increase equitable access to comprehensive and gender-transformative SRHR information and services and to create and support comprehensive youth development and participation with a focus on vulnerable and marginalised groups including ethnic minorities, adolescents and youth, people with disabilities LGBTQI+ and migrant workers.</p><p>In addition, we will continue to support Vietnam's aims to promote gender equality, prevent and respond to GBV and address gender-biased sex selection and other harmful practices. One concrete area of work we are committed to is supporting the Government's ambition to develop a multi-sectoral GBV coordination mechanism at national and provincial levels, ensuring alignment with global standards and leaving no one behind. This will ensure that all survivors of GBV can access timely and quality support services regardless of their location or situation.</p><p>These are just some examples of UNFPA's work to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled. By addressing demographic change and social challenges UNFPA reaffirms our commitment to supporting Vietnam's sustainable development goals and the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is an exciting year ahead for the UNFPA - government of Vietnam partnership.</p><p>Reporter: What are your thoughts on the country's strategic directions to usher Vietnam into a new era, and how will UNFPA support Vietnam in this process?</p><p>Matt Jackson: The transition emphasises Vietnam's commitment to building a resilient, inclusive nation that leaves no one behind. This aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Achieving this vision requires an integrated approach, leveraging resources, fostering innovation and addressing challenges such as gender inequality, population ageing and barriers to quality education and healthcare.</p><p>To support this vision, UNFPA in Vietnam looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Government of Vietnam to implement the agenda of the International Conference of Population and Development (ICPD) agreed upon in Cairo in 1994, and to achieve UNFPA's three transformational goals which, by 2030, are to reach:</p><p>Zero preventable maternal deaths,</p><p>Zero unmet family planning needs, and</p><p>Zero gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls.</p><p>UNFPA is committed to supporting Vietnam's population and development priorities, from improving access to quality reproductive healthcare to addressing son preference and gender imbalances at birth. We are dedicated to promoting the collection and use of reliable population data to inform evidence-based policies and programmes, helping Vietnam to harness opportunities that stem from demographic shifts. Additionally, UNFPA aims to fulfill the potential of the Vietnamese young people who currently account for 21% population of Vietnam, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary skills and opportunities to contribute to the nation's development.

In addition, older people have much knowledge about how to prepare for extreme weather events and are an important resource for building resilience within communities.</p><p>We know that Vietnam entered the phase of population ageing in 2011, with 10% of its population over 60 years old. Today, this figure has reached 16% and is expected to surpass 20% by 2036, marking Vietnam's transition into an 'aged' society. Population aging reflects positive development, showcasing advancements in socio-economic conditions, healthcare and living standards. In a society with an increasing number of elderly people, this demographic shift presents a golden opportunity for economic growth, particularly in the expanding care market catering to the needs and aspirations of older persons. The rapid ageing process also demands greater efforts to address challenges faced by the elderly.</p><p>Vietnam has made significant strides in promoting policies and programmes to prepare for population ageing. The draft Population Law, currently under public consultation, includes proposals from the Ministry of Health to adapt to an aging society. Alongside policies for elderly care and health packages, there is a strong need for policies that harness the values of the elderly, creating suitable employment opportunities and increasing their income.</p><p>Moreover, to address the challenges of population ageing, Vietnam recognises the importance of investing in its young population. Efforts have been made to provide comprehensive sexuality education, improve access to reproductive health services, and create opportunities for youth engagement in climate action. By empowering young people with knowledge and skills, Vietnam aims to build a resilient and adaptive society capable of addressing future challenges.</p><p>One example is UNFPA's partnership with the government and stakeholders to develop an Integrated Care for Older People (ICOPE) model that is based at the community level. This initiative supports caregivers and addresses societal challenges by providing comprehensive care services for an ageing society. With a community-based approach, ICOPE reduces pressure on public healthcare systems and households by encouraging local engagement and shared responsibility in elderly care.</p><p>Preparing for an older population includes many areas such as health insurance, pension systems and preparing the health care system as well as promoting labour market engagement among older persons. Vietnam is already making strides in many of these areas as well as tapping into policy exchanges and learning from other countries in the region and beyond.</p><p>The preparation begins with the systematic use of population data to help plan and adapt infrastructure and policies to the realities of demographic change. Understanding data such as how many people live in each location, their socioeconomic characteristics and the age structure of the local population is essential to ensure people-centred governance. Data on climate change and climate risk is also a key tool in developing effective and targeted plans for disaster risk reduction and responding to climate-induced extreme weather events. These plans also help to ensure the continuation of key services for example, essential sexual and reproductive health services and services for older people; and, of course, plans that include investing in young people are crucial for every country on the journey to climate adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Reporter: Typhoon Yagi and floods caused significant loss of life and property in Vietnam, especially among vulnerable groups. What recommendations do you have for Vietnam to help these groups cope with the impacts of climate change?</p><p>Matt Jackson: Typhoon Yagi and its devastating aftermath highlight the urgent need to enhance resilience and support for adolescent girls, women, children, the elderly and marginalised groups such as PwD, migrants, ethnic minority communities in remote areas. These populations often bear the brunt of disasters and emergencies as well as face increasing risks.</p><p>Efforts must focus on improving forecasting and early warning capacities, ensuring timely, accessible and comprehensive disaster warnings for all communities, especially those in remote areas and minority populations. These groups often lack the resources or infrastructure to respond swiftly to emergencies. Early warning systems should be tailored to effectively reach these communities by utilising local networks and digital platforms and be in accessible formats such as sign language and radio broadcasts.</p><p>UNFPA and the Vietnam Disaster and Dyke Management Authority (VDDMA) will continue collaboration to strengthen Vietnam's resilience against disasters and climate change while improving the health and quality of life for affected populations. As the UN agency specialising in sexual and reproductive health (SRH), UNFPA remains present before, during and after crises to ensure SRH services and gender-based violence responses are integrated into emergency response programmes. Evidence shows that disasters often exacerbate gender-based violence as women face caregiving burdens, economic losses and heightened vulnerability in overcrowded shelters with limited resources.</p><p>In responding to the devastation of Typhoon Yagi across northern Vietnam, UNFPA mobilised over 16 billion VND to support vulnerable groups affected by the storm. These efforts reaffirm UNFPA's commitment to disaster response and recovery, especially for women, children, the elderly and other vulnerable groups. UNFPA allocated essential resources to ensure short- and long-term benefits for affected groups, including:</p><p>3,000 dignity kits for women,</p><p>Cash support for 1,250 pregnant women to ensure safe deliveries at healthcare facilities,</p><p>Cash assistance for 835 elderly individuals in remote and ethnic minority areas, and</p><p>500,000 USD in support for gender-based violence services in Quang Ninh province.</p><p>Through partnerships with the Vietnam Farmers' Union, dignity kits have become an essential part of UNFPA's comprehensive humanitarian support package. These kits protect women's and girls' reproductive health and rights, maintain hygiene and preserve dignity in disaster contexts. They include information on reproductive health and guidance on preventing and responding to gender-based violence. UNFPA calls on all partners to ensure that climate adaptation strategies are gender-sensitive and integrated into national and local plans. Policies should address long-term climate change challenges, ensuring that women, children and minorities are central to decision-making processes.</p><p>Moreover, to ensure permanent preparedness for natural disasters such as typhoons, it is essential to provide comprehensive training for local communities, with a particular focus on young people. Empowering local youth is crucial for developing long-term solutions for climate change adaptation and resilience.</p><p>Reporter: What are UNFPA's cooperation projects and programmes in Vietnam in 2025?</p><p>Matt Jackson: In 2025, UNFPA will continue its efforts through various cooperation projects and programmes to address Vietnam's pressing needs in partnership with the government of Vietnam and aligned with Vietnam's national priorities and global commitments.</p><p>As the United Nations sexual and reproductive health agency, UNFPA is making every effort around the world to end preventable maternal deaths, end the unmet need for family planning, and end gender-based violence (GBV) and harmful practices by 2030. Ensuring rights and choices for all such as bodily autonomy is a major principle of population-centred development because people who can make choices about their bodies often have more and better options throughout their lives. These three goals are part of UNFPA's corporate strategic plan worldwide, including in Vietnam where they are also included in the 10th UNFPA Country Programme for Vietnam 2022-2026.</p><p>In the upcoming year, we will continue to support the government of Vietnam's work in strategic areas including sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR); youth empowerment; population ageing; evidence-based policy making and ending gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls.</p><p>Some of the areas that I am most excited about are working with government Ministries, Departments and other partners to develop plans to scale up the One Stop Service Centres (Ngoi nha Anh Duong) and National Hotline to support survivors of GBV. Recently, a new Anh Duong House was opened in January in Hoa Binh with plans for additional centres to open in An Giang, Khanh Hoa and Ha Tinh. We also support life skills and comprehensive sexuality education for young people, and enable robust population data for effective policy making.</p><p>UNFPA is also supporting the government of Vietnam and the General Statistics Office in conducting important surveys such as the mid-decade census, and studies on issues like migration, population ageing and ethnic minority communities. This data will help the government to understand population trends and plan accordingly.</p><p>Also, we will continue to support Vietnam's population ageing process by supporting an integrated and coherent social protection system and applying a life-cycle and gender-transformative approach to ageing to address inequalities, enhance the resilience of the most vulnerable groups, pilot and scale up integrated care for older persons through the intergenerational self-help clubs.</p><p>Furthermore, we will collaborate with the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Vietnam and many different stakeholders and partners to ensure universal access to an integrated package of quality sexual and reproductive health information and services, this includes: Data generation, analysis, and transformation for policies, guidelines, and tools that address the special needs of vulnerable populations; elaboration of innovative financing mechanisms including private sector financing and sub-national public financing, particularly to address emerging SRHR issues such as cervical cancer screening and human papillomavirus vaccinations.</p><p>We will also continue to increase equitable access to comprehensive and gender-transformative SRHR information and services and to create and support comprehensive youth development and participation with a focus on vulnerable and marginalised groups including ethnic minorities, adolescents and youth, people with disabilities LGBTQI+ and migrant workers.</p><p>In addition, we will continue to support Vietnam's aims to promote gender equality, prevent and respond to GBV and address gender-biased sex selection and other harmful practices. One concrete area of work we are committed to is supporting the Government's ambition to develop a multi-sectoral GBV coordination mechanism at national and provincial levels, ensuring alignment with global standards and leaving no one behind. This will ensure that all survivors of GBV can access timely and quality support services regardless of their location or situation.</p><p>These are just some examples of UNFPA's work to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person\"s potential is fulfilled. By addressing demographic change and social challenges UNFPA reaffirms our commitment to supporting Vietnam's sustainable development goals and the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is an exciting year ahead for the UNFPA - government of Vietnam partnership.</p><p>Reporter: What are your thoughts on the country\"s strategic directions to usher Vietnam into a new era, and how will UNFPA support Vietnam in this process?</p><p>Matt Jackson: The transition emphasises Vietnam's commitment to building a resilient, inclusive nation that leaves no one behind. This aligns with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Achieving this vision requires an integrated approach, leveraging resources, fostering innovation and addressing challenges such as gender inequality, population ageing and barriers to quality education and healthcare.</p><p>To support this vision, UNFPA in Vietnam looks forward to continuing to work closely with the Government of Vietnam to implement the agenda of the International Conference of Population and Development (ICPD) agreed upon in Cairo in 1994, and to achieve UNFPA's three transformational goals which, by 2030, are to reach:</p><p>Zero preventable maternal deaths,</p><p>Zero unmet family planning needs, and</p><p>Zero gender-based violence and harmful practices against women and girls.</p><p>UNFPA is committed to supporting Vietnam's population and development priorities, from improving access to quality reproductive healthcare to addressing son preference and gender imbalances at birth. We are dedicated to promoting the collection and use of reliable population data to inform evidence-based policies and programmes, helping Vietnam to harness opportunities that stem from demographic shifts. Additionally, UNFPA aims to fulfill the potential of the Vietnamese young people who currently account for 21% population of Vietnam, ensuring they are equipped with the necessary skills and opportunities to contribute to the nation\"s development. UNFPA stands ready to support Vietnam's journey toward sustainable development by leveraging population data, fostering strong partnerships and building resilience in a rapidly changing world.</p>", "publisher": "Vietnam Plus", "instances": ["Understanding data such as how many people live in each location, their socioeconomic characteristics and the age structure of the local population is essential to ensure people-centred governance.

That stable nature was underscored in 2024 when its price shot upward, gaining over $700 per ounce. This amounted to a 34% increase since January. The vibrant price increase has gotten traders and investors all jazzed up again about gold, with the most pressing question among them being: could gold exceed the $3,000 price point by 2025? Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa broker, delves into the topic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inflation, interest rates, and geopolitics</p><p>Inflation and interest rates influence gold prices. When inflation soars, investors tend to buy gold to protect their purchasing power. They view it as a much safer investment than stocks or bonds because stocks are prone to sudden price drops, and bonds can lose value when interest rates rise due to high inflation. Historically, though, when real interest rates (which are inflation-adjusted) have declined, gold has just soared. As some would say, 'There is no better buy'.</p><p>By 2024, the percentage of overall reserves held in gold by central banks had reached 10%, a significant climb from the 3% level recorded just 10 years earlier. Although we are still in an era where most reserve currencies are fiat (for example, paper with little intrinsic value), an increasing number of central banks seem to believe that holding gold adds an element of prudence to their reserve diversification strategy. Emerging economies, especially in Asia, are seeing their central banks take on an increasingly important role in the gold market. China (which now holds 5% of its reserves in gold), along with India, has emerged as one of the preeminent buyers of gold.</p><p>Moreover, the central banks of the emerging economies have, since 2022, stepped up their pace of gold buying. The catalyst for this last development was the unprecedented freezing of Russian assets, which prompted multiple nations to reconsider the makeup of their reserves.</p><p>Furthermore, the global shift towards a more sustainable economy, including investment in renewable energy and green technologies, is driving limited demand for certain commodities, such as precious metals that include gold. Gold plays an important role in clean energy technologies, including solar panels and electronics for energy-efficient systems. This increased demand for technological gold is exacerbated by growing concerns about the lack of resources necessary for the green transition.</p><p>Moreover, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty further underscore the attractiveness of gold as a safe asset, attracting investors seeking relief amid rapid changes in global markets. The Ukraine conflict, strained US-China relations, and unrest in the Middle East have sent investors scurrying to safe-haven assets. And when it comes to safe havens, gold is a time-tested destination. Its record of price stability in an unstable world at present stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of the stock market and other assets. An instance of this is China's recent accumulation of gold, which now makes up 5% of its foreign exchange reserves. This is yet another sign of a shift towards resilience in a global economy fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>Technical analysis: key levels to watch</p><p>According to the technical analysis, the asset's price is still in the uptrend, even on a high timeframe. The long-term bullish trend also hasn't changed for a bearish one. The $3,000 target, which aligns with the 4.236 Fibonacci extension level, is pretty real. However, this level may be too ambitious for the moment of publication.</p><p>Prospects for 2025 - factors shaping gold's future</p><p>According to the Chief Economists' Survey from the World Economic Forum, economists are uncertain about global economic stability. 54% of respondents forecast a steady outlook and 37% project further deterioration. Future fiscal policies targeting climate adaptation, a shifting demographic landscape, and ramped-up defence spending are set to push inflation upwards. All these look to gold as an inflation hedge\u200b; however, it's not just private investors: central banks are in on the gold thing, too. They are expected to keep topping up their gold reserves and, in the face of all these other demands, are likely to maintain long-term demand.</p><p>So will gold hit the $3,000-per-ounce price in 2025? The scenario seems very possible. However, for the asset's price to reach a rather ambitious target, favourable market conditions are required. They include both macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. For example, the re-election of Donald Trump introduces additional variables into the equation. Trump's geopolitical stance, particularly regarding global trade and conflict resolution, could influence investor sentiment and safe-haven demand.

They are expected to keep topping up their gold reserves and, in the face of all these other demands, are likely to maintain long-term demand."]}, {"relevance_score": 42, "title": "Gold's road to $3,000: expert analysis by global broker Octa", "published": "2024-12-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Gold has been valued for its stability when the financial fires are raging. That stable nature was underscored in 2024 when its price shot upward, gaining over $700 per ounce. This amounted to a 34% increase since January. The vibrant price increase has gotten traders and investors all jazzed up again about gold, with the most pressing question among them being: could gold exceed the $3,000 price point by 2025? Kar Yong Ang, a financial market analyst at Octa broker, delves into the topic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inflation, interest rates, and geopolitics</p><p>Inflation and interest rates influence gold prices. When inflation soars, investors tend to buy gold to protect their purchasing power. They view it as a much safer investment than stocks or bonds because stocks are prone to sudden price drops, and bonds can lose value when interest rates rise due to high inflation. Historically, though, when real interest rates (which are inflation-adjusted) have declined, gold has just soared. As some would say, 'There is no better buy'.</p><p>By 2024, the percentage of overall reserves held in gold by central banks had reached 10%, a significant climb from the 3% level recorded just 10 years earlier. Although we are still in an era where most reserve currencies are fiat (for example, paper with little intrinsic value), an increasing number of central banks seem to believe that holding gold adds an element of prudence to their reserve diversification strategy. Emerging economies, especially in Asia, are seeing their central banks take on an increasingly important role in the gold market. China (which now holds 5% of its reserves in gold), along with India, has emerged as one of the preeminent buyers of gold.</p><p>Moreover, the central banks of the emerging economies have, since 2022, stepped up their pace of gold buying. The catalyst for this last development was the unprecedented freezing of Russian assets, which prompted multiple nations to reconsider the makeup of their reserves.</p><p>Furthermore, the global shift towards a more sustainable economy, including investment in renewable energy and green technologies, is driving limited demand for certain commodities, such as precious metals that include gold. Gold plays an important role in clean energy technologies, including solar panels and electronics for energy-efficient systems. This increased demand for technological gold is exacerbated by growing concerns about the lack of resources necessary for the green transition.</p><p>Moreover, geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainty further underscore the attractiveness of gold as a safe asset, attracting investors seeking relief amid rapid changes in global markets. The Ukraine conflict, strained US-China relations, and unrest in the Middle East have sent investors scurrying to safe-haven assets. And when it comes to safe havens, gold is a time-tested destination. Its record of price stability in an unstable world at present stands in stark contrast to the behaviour of the stock market and other assets. An instance of this is China's recent accumulation of gold, which now makes up 5% of its foreign exchange reserves. This is yet another sign of a shift towards resilience in a global economy fraught with uncertainty.</p><p>Technical analysis: key levels to watch</p><p>According to the technical analysis, the asset's price is still in the uptrend, even on a high timeframe. The long-term bullish trend also hasn't changed for a bearish one. The $3,000 target, which aligns with the 4.236 Fibonacci extension level, is pretty real. However, this level may be too ambitious for the moment of publication.</p><p>Prospects for 2025 - factors shaping gold's future</p><p>According to the Chief Economists' Survey from the World Economic Forum, economists are uncertain about global economic stability. 54% of respondents forecast a steady outlook and 37% project further deterioration. Future fiscal policies targeting climate adaptation, a shifting demographic landscape, and ramped-up defence spending are set to push inflation upwards. All these look to gold as an inflation hedge\u200b; however, it's not just private investors: central banks are in on the gold thing, too. They are expected to keep topping up their gold reserves and, in the face of all these other demands, are likely to maintain long-term demand.</p><p>So will gold hit the $3,000-per-ounce price in 2025? The scenario seems very possible. However, for the asset's price to reach a rather ambitious target, favourable market conditions are required. They include both macroeconomic and geopolitical factors. For example, the re-election of Donald Trump introduces additional variables into the equation. Trump's geopolitical stance, particularly regarding global trade and conflict resolution, could influence investor sentiment and safe-haven demand. If his promises regarding the resolution of numerous conflicts are fulfilled, investors may partially abandon safe-haven assets for the riskier ones.</p>", "publisher": "Bizhub", "instances": ["Prospects for 2025 - factors shaping gold's futureAccording to the Chief Economists' Survey from the World Economic Forum, economists are uncertain about global economic stability. 54% of respondents forecast a steady outlook and 37% project further deterioration.

Firstly, selecting suitable species based on climate conditions to help agricultural enterprises build climate resilience through contract farming. Secondly, through climate disaster adaptive procurement, providing rapid response and maximum assistance to farmers to minimize their losses. Finally, implementing climate disaster adaptive agriculture, which will support contract farmers to resume production following climate disasters.</p><p>Shen Li, Co-founder and Head of Sustainable Development at Freshippo, gave a speech at the COP28 China Corner's Side Event and said, \"Climate change is a shared global challenge, and enhancing climate resilience and the consensus in the agriculture, industrial and retail sectors is our collective responsibility. Agriculture will continue to be heavily impacted by climate change, making it the common mission of global agriculture practitioners to address climate resilience in agriculture. We have explored various ways to enhance the climate resilience of agriculture sector and industry through practical experience. Freshippo is committed to leveraging the advantages of a retail enterprise to promote better climate consensus among the public, using products as a vehicle for climate education and helping consumers develop climate awareness in their daily lives.\"</p><p>Freshippo highlighted a number of cases of climate adaptation at the event. For example, several peach farms in Beijing were unexpectedly hit by a hailstorm in 2022, resulting in direct economic losses of over RMB6 million. In response, Freshippo graded visually damaged peaches as \"hail-damaged peaches\" and processed those peaches into freeze-dried peach crisps. This initiative helped farmers sell the hail-damaged peaches, reducing waste by 200 kilograms per mu. Additionally, it enabled peach farmers to increase their income by RMB1,200 per mu.</p><p>Freshippo has also been working to overcome the extreme effects of the hot climate by opening up a 200-mu Freshippo desert organic base in the Ulan Buh Desert in Inner Mongolia.

The third phase of the Water Environment Improvement Project in the basin, starting in 2022, is part of the city\u2019s efforts to stem urban flooding.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \u2013 VNS Photo Dip Phan  HCM City \u2013 To mitigate the impact of flooding caused by heavy rains and high river tides, HCM City has invested heavily in flood-prevention works, including drainage system improvement, dredging of canals and wastewater treatment systems. Under a city plan, 80 per cent of the urban population is expected to have access to water drainage services by 2025, and the city will have over 80 per cent of its urban sewage water treated.</p><p> The city aims to have no flooding in the city centre of 106,41sq.km and solve flooding problems in remaining areas over the next five years.</p><p> The flood-prone Nguyn Hu Cnh Street in Binh Thnh District, for example, is being upgraded to prevent flooding, and pumps have been installed. The work is expected to be completed in April.</p><p> The city has been urged to improve the drainage capacity of southern city districts and build drainage systems in areas with none, especially in the east. The municipal Department of Construction is working with the Department of Planning and Architecture, the Management Board Construction Investment Projects and related authorities to draw up an adjusted drainage master plan for the HCM City Zone to 2030 with a vision to 2050. The department is also in charge of inspections and will ensure that investors install water drainage systems at their projects.</p><p> The city needs up to VN107.2 trillion (US$4.6 billion) for flood-prevention projects by 2025, including 115 projects to improve water drainage systems and seven regulating lakes, officials have said. Drainage projects will use official development assistance (ODA) and private capital from public-private partnerships.</p><p> Projects to handle tidal floods and lessen climate change consequences will be given priority. Over the long term, the city will allocate capital from the State budget to urgent small-scale projects and important construction works to improve drainage systems and prevent flooding.</p><p> Key projects to dredge canals and upgrade sewer systems will be funded by ODA. Private capital will be used for projects that solve both urban flooding and environmental pollution and help with urban embellishment.</p><p> A dredging and urban renewal project in Xuyen Tam Canal through Binh Thnh and G\u00f2 Vp districts and a water drainage and pollution reduction project in the Tham Lng\u2013Bn Cat\u2013Nc Len canal basin will kick off this year. The two projects are scheduled to be completed in 2025. The Water Environment Improvement Project in the T\u00e0u H\u2013Bn Nghe\u2013\u00f4i\u2013T canal basin will start its third phase in 2022 and wrap up in 2027. In the 2026-30 period, the city will have seven more sewage treatment plants, including the Nhieu Lc\u2013Th Ngh\u00e8, Tay S\u00e0i G\u00f2n, Bc S\u00e0i G\u00f2n 1, Bc S\u00e0i G\u00f2n 2, Cu Da, Tay Bc, Sui Nhum plants.</p><p> When these new plants start operating, the city\u2019s treatment rate is expected to reach 88.3 per cent. Climate-adaptation plans  Because of high tides in the S\u00e0i G\u00f2n and ng Nai rivers, heavy rains and land subsidence, HCM City is included on a list of 10 cities worldwide that are most vulnerable to sea-level rise.</p><p> According to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, the city\u2019s rivers could rise by about 30cm by 2050 and 75cm by the end of the 21st century. By 2050 the number of communes and wards affected by tidal flooding would rise to 177, equivalent to 61 per cent of the city's total area.</p><p> With such serious consequences, HCM City needs to make plans to adapt to climate change, Dr H Long Phi, the director of the Water Management and Climate Change Centre under the National University\u2013HCM City, has said. The city has been encouraged to ensure space for water in urban areas and strengthen flood resilience through regulating lakes.</p><p> Phi said that flood-prevention works such as new dykes and drainage culverts, street upgrades, and pumping water would not be effective in the long run. The city People's Committee has noted that it is impossible to completely control flooding, so sustainable, eco-friendly and economical flood-control strategies are needed.</p><p> Flooding risks in HCM City may grow 10 times more intense by 2050, given the current prevalence of poorly regulated construction projects and economic activities, according to a study by the international consulting firm McKinsey in 2020. According to the findings, the city may lose billions of US dollars to sea-level rise, and a majority of its area may become vulnerable to extreme weather events if there are no serious climate-adaptation efforts and systemic reform of urban planning. \u2013 VNS</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 35, "title": "The Netherlands andViet Namcelebrate unity in diversity: ambassador", "published": "2022-04-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">To celebrate the Dutch national day, the birthday of His Majesty King Willem-Alexander of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Ambassador Elsbeth Akkerman writes to Vit Nam News.

We have developed the first Urban Food Production Masterplan, a framework which we are using to help cities globally create more resilient food strategies and design low-carbon food masterplans. Decarbonising food production - one of biggest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world - while strengthening food supply chain resilience will be a balance that cities must achieve in the coming decade.</p><p>The Future of Mobility</p><p>The Arup-led study, initiated with the Singapore Government and leading academic research institute partners, is a first-of-its-kind research project in Southeast Asia. Arup used an outcome-led approach that brought people-first design principles to the centre of decisions defining Singapore's urban future. Arup's research showcases new planning and design strategies including design ideas for future town configurations, future streets and future mobility hubs.</p><p>Circular Building Design Toolkit</p><p>Buildings account for 37% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with construction materials losing around 95% of their value during demolition. Arup and the Ellen MacArthur Foundation developed the Circular Building Design Toolkit which brings strategies, case studies and tools for designing more circular buildings to reduce waste and carbon. The Toolkit provides a practical framework and tools to enable stakeholders across the building lifecycle to optimise assets for circularity.</p><p>Terrain - Arup's Artificial Intelligence and Land-use Analysis Tool</p><p>Cities face increasing threats from climate change such as heavy rainfall and extreme heat waves. Using Artificial Intelligence and land use analysis tool called Terrain, Arup has developed the Global Sponge Cities Snapshot. The term \"Sponge City\" was coined in 2013 by Professor Kongjian Yu of Peking University to describe cities that work with nature to absorb rainwater beyond concrete solutions. Using Terrain, Arup calculated the amount of green and blue areas in the urban centres of each city. It then factored in the impact of soil types and vegetation and calculated the rainfall runoff potential.

Between 2010 and 2020, Asia and the Pacific accounted for three-quarters of the 122 million people that were affected by disasters. With Asia-Pacific being the most disaster-prone region in the world, we cannot ignore the disproportionate effects of climate change on women and girls.</p><p>Gender-based violence and harmful practices, including child marriage and female genital mutilation, increase among climate-affected populations. Climate-related emergencies also cause major disruptions in access to essential sexual and reproductive health services and life-saving medicines, including for maternal health care, contributing to a higher risk of maternal and newborn deaths.</p><p>Forty-three year old Adelina from Dinagat, the Philippines, illustrates how climate change affects women as they seek maternal health care.

This will ensure that women have access to sexual and reproductive services and information, including maternal health, family planning, and protection services. This in turn will empower women and girls to protect their rights, make choices and realize their potential, as well as strengthen climate change-affected communities' ability to adapt.</p><p>During the Fourth World Conference held in Beijing in 1995, the global community agreed to promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective into all policies and programmes. More than 25 years later, we see that progress towards achieving gender equality and women's empowerment has been slow.

What are the challenges facing Viet Nam in biodiversity conservation?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The natural world is at a breaking point, plagued by the two biggest existential crises in our lifetime: biodiversity loss and climate change. With the CBD COP15 taking place in Montreal, Canada, the world looks back with deep regret and serious concern that not one of the 20 targets set at Aichi, Japan, back in 2010 during COP10, have been fulfilled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Viet Nam, unfortunately, shares a similar trend in biodiversity degradation as with many parts of the world, with an increasing number of threatened species, and degraded ecosystems of forests, wetlands, marine areas, among other issues.</p><p>Reports have shown that the number of threatened species in Viet Nam has risen sharply in recent years, and for several species, time has already run out and they have become extinct, including the Javan rhinoceros and the Giant ibis. In addition, the Indochinese tiger is considered functionally extinct, with other large mammal species such as the Asian elephant, many big cats (Felidae spp.), bears (Ursus spp.), pangolins (Manis spp.) not far behind.</p><p>The first National Ecosystem Assessment report by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) has shown that over the past two decades, the area of seagrass has decreased by 45.4 per cent and the average annual reduction rate was 4.4 per cent. The live coral cover of coral reefs in coastal areas is decreasing rapidly over time. Only about 1 per cent of the reefs have a high coverage while the number of reefs with low coverage reefs accounts for over 31 per cent, and the rest is for medium to slight coverage coral reefs. For terrestrial forests, while the overall forest coverage is reported to remain at roughly 42 per cent, deforestation and forest degradation are still rampant, with biodiversity-rich natural forests being replaced with monoculture planted forests that have little to no biodiversity values.</p><p>Viet Nam is among the top 16 countries and territories with the richest biodiversity of global significance. Recognising the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services for sustainable economic development, the Government has made significant efforts to protect biodiversity, including the introduction of legal frameworks and the establishment of protected areas systems.</p><p>However, Viet Nam faces several challenges that could make it more difficult to halt and reverse the downward trends of biodiversity loss. First of all, while Viet Nam has developed a relatively comprehensive legal framework for environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, including the latest Law on Environmental Protection 2020, the enforcement of the laws and sub-laws is still low due to many reasons, including unclear division of responsibilities among ministries and agencies, low-deterrence penalty schemes, insufficient capacities and low commitment on the part of central and local decision-makers.</p><p>Second, it is necessary for Viet Nam to transform its business-as-usual development modality into a more sustainable, resource-efficient, and nature-positive one. Examples of business-as-usual development include overexploitation of natural resources and overconsumption. Overfishing and destructive fishing methods have resulted in destroyed or depleted natural ecosystems. Also, over-and-unsustainable tourism causes negative impacts on biodiversity from direct tourists' sightseeing activities, infrastructure-related developments, and pollution.</p><p>Last, being one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change puts more pressure on the already vulnerable ecosystems in Viet Nam and hinders the national efforts in reversing the biodiversity declination trend. For example, the increase in average temperature will change many ecosystems' geographic distribution and population structure and exacerbate other threats such as forest fires, droughts and tropical storms.</p><p>Could you please suggest some solutions to promote biodiversity conservation in Viet Nam?</p><p>While much needs to be done to overcome the first challenge of ineffective law enforcement, we believe one of the keys is that main-streaming biodiversity conservation in all sectors may be done more systematically and effectively. For example, indicators for socio-economic development should be more biodiversity-specific. The current indicator of \"area of forest coverage\" does not tell us the quality of forests or their biodiversity levels. We could learn from the achievement of climate change main-streaming in Viet Nam, where climate mitigation and adaptation are quite systematically incorporated in socio-economic development plans and planning across many sectors. We need the same, if not more, awareness of and commitment to biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Transforming the country's business-as-usual development modality into a more sustainable, resource-efficient, and nature-positive one shall help Viet Nam take the leap in biodiversity and nature conservation. Our recommendations include materialising the targets of the Green Growth Strategy by embracing better the Circular Economy model, in which sustainable natural resources exploitation, resource-efficient production and moderate consumption will be put at the centre.</p><p>The system of protected areas in Viet Nam needs to be improved in both quantity and quality. Comprehensive planning, capacity building and financial allocation for protected area (PA) management should be prioritised in the biodiversity agendas. Most financing allocated for PAs has not been prioritised for biodiversity conservation work itself. Therefore, in the coming time, apart from financial mobilisation from the international community, the Government needs to allocate more budget for biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Indigenous and local communities are often the best guardians of forests and natural ecosystems, where successive generations call home. At the same time, local communities often face disproportionate impacts of biodiversity loss given the interdependence of health environments that crucially underpin their lives and livelihoods. Therefore, ensuring indigenous and local people's voices in the debate on biodiversity conservation and improvement of livelihoods will help preserve traditional knowledge in conserving nature and reduce the pressure on the environment.</p><p>The Government of Viet Nam has made commendable efforts in improving the well-being of ethnic minority people and other vulnerable groups through poverty reduction and social protection programmes, and in the context of increased threats from climate change and biodiversity loss, this should be continually put at the centre of the government's development agendas.</p><p>What is the link between biodiversity and climate change? How does biodiversity impact climate change and vice versa?</p><p>Climate change and biodiversity are interconnected. Climate change drives biodiversity loss, and in return, ecosystem degradation exacerbates climate change. For example, sea level rise would severely affect 78 out of 286 critical habitats (equivalent to 27 per cent), 46 protected areas (equivalent to 33 per cent), nine biodiversity areas of national and international value (23 per cent) and 23 other biodiversity areas in Viet Nam according to MONRE's report. Loss of biodiversity and degraded ecosystems also accelerate climate change processes due to the reduced capacity of ecosystems to assimilate and store CO2 as well as the loss of critical barriers reducing sea level rise's impacts (e.g. mangrove forests).</p><p>In contrast, biodiversity resources can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and allow for climate adaptation. In terms of mitigation, trees and sea water are silent heroes in CO2 sequestration. In other words, their natural mechanisms help absorb and store carbon naturally, thus relieving gas emissions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's important to not over-rely on sea water for carbon sequestration since CO2 excess can impact marine life for many species. For adaptation, coral reefs and mangroves are nature's incredible endowed assets that can shield the coast against inundation and protect vulnerable communities most affected by the risk of catastrophic sea level rise and its aftermath. Since these natural resources are on the decline, restoring and conserving them will aid the world's collective fight for our survival against climate change.</p><p>Which activities has UNDP been doing to help promote biodiversity conservation in Viet Nam?</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been doing a lot of projects and programmes to promote nature and biodiversity conservation in Viet Nam.</p><p>We have supported the establishment of Th\u00e1i Thuy Wetland PA in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh and Tam Giang-Cau Hai Wetland PA in Thua Thi\u00ean Hue, together with formulating and promulgating policies, regulations and planning frameworks for wetland conservation (Decree No.66/2019/ND-CP) and supporting the integration of wetland conservation and management into the plans of the two provinces. This contributes to Viet Nam's continued efforts in expanding PA areas, as set forth in the new National Biodiversity Strategy to 2030, a vision towards 2050.</p><p>We have been supporting the strengthening of the legal framework and management of Biosphere Reserves in Viet Nam through the Biosphere Reserves (BR) project, which sets out to promote cross-sectoral management of BRs, facilitate the conservation of ecosystems in C\u00f9 Lao Ch\u00e0m-Hoi An, Dong Nai, Western Nghe An BRs, and foster local livelihoods, through improved legal and institutional framework, with cross-sectoral actions on the grounds to deliver the restoration and better management of degraded forest land, and improvement of economic livelihoods for local households.</p><p>Our upcoming nature-based tourism project will aim to promote responsible ecotourism in National Parks (NP) in Viet Nam through effective public-private partnership between NPs and tourism operators and identified mechanism to channel more tourism revenues to fund biodiversity conservation at NPs. This project is one of the efforts to tackle over- and unsustainable tourism in Viet Nam, which is one of the main drivers for biodiversity loss in the country.</p><p>In addition, UNDP has been working under the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN) to pilot several financial solutions, including Payment for Ecosystem Services, marine resource protection fee to mobilise more funding for PA. Also, BIOFIN project helps preparation of fundamental reports for identifying increased biodiversity finance including the Biodiversity Finance Plan for Viet Nam.</p><p>We are working on developing projects that aim to deliver innovative nature-based solutions that contribute to the restoration of degraded ecosystems along major river basins and coastal areas. Nature-based solutions are giving us high hopes in achieving dual/triple targets in ecosystem restorations and climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>At the same time, we remain acutely aware of the biodiversity-climate change nexus where interventions on biodiversity and climate change are mutually reinforcing. Biodiversity should be a high priority for the global community and be on par with climate change as part of a win-win complimentary approach. Viet Nam has been particularly resourceful in its endeavours to forge pathways for a green prosperous future and the hope now rests in our local actions to align with the global targets.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["g. mangrove forests).

Vit Nam has gainedpositive renewable energy policy developments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">  VNA/VNS Photo  EU Ambassadors to Vit Nam Last Saturday, on the day that marked the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, a number of world leaders came together to celebrate and recognise the resolve of so many in working towards a safer, more resilient climate neutral world. A world we can be proud to leave to our grandchildren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> During the past five years, the determination of the international community has certainly been tested and our global community has been hit by a virus which has had long-lasting seismic impacts on our society and economies. In the midst of the pandemic, is it realistic to call for stronger global action to fight against climate change? And why is all this relevant for Vit Nam? We say the case is now more pertinent than ever.</p><p> Looking at the droughts and devastating swarms of locusts in Africa, massive fires in Australia, infrastructure collapsing in Siberia as permafrost melts, intense hurricanes in America and typhoons in Asia, with particularly dramatic effects in the central part of VitNam, a more pertinent question might be: Can we afford to let things worsen? Even before the pandemic, the European Union committed to leading a green transition. Back in December 2019, the European Commission launched the European Green Deal, a new growth model and roadmap to achieve climate neutrality in the EU by 2050. Now, a year later, we are aligning our policies in areas ranging from energy to industry, farming, food, or biodiversity with our sustainability goals.</p><p> This is now the EU's action plan for recovery from the pandemic. Our \"Next Generation EU\" recovery financial package and our next long-term budget earmark more than half a trillion euros to address climate change.</p><p> The science is irrefutable. For future prosperity, we must move beyond the harmful carbon economy and invest in greening the global economy.</p><p> We cannot afford not to. To reach climate neutrality by 2050, this past Friday, December 11, EU leaders unanimously agreed on our 2030 target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55per centcompared to 1990 levels.</p><p> It will provide predictability for our businesses, industry and citizen. It will further accelerate the fast decrease in the costs of low carbon technologies, for example, the cost of solar photovoltaics declined by 82per centbetween 2010 and 2019. Achieving the 55per centtarget will even help us to save 100 billion euros in the next decade and up to 3 trillion euros by 2050. We know our good intentions for a green recovery in Europe won't suffice if we fail to convince others to join us.</p><p> Not only must we in Europe press ahead with our own ambitious plans for a green transition, but bring international partners on board too. No government can tackle climate change alone.</p><p> This is why we will pursue all avenues of co-operation and diplomacy through instruments such as strategic partnership agreements, trade policy, development assistance and other external financing tools. We need a virtuous circle for ambition and we need good partners.</p><p> Vit Namhas definitely the potential to be one of those. The Government of Vit Namhas actually already submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contribution to the UNFCCC in July 2020 projecting an increase of ambition to reach a reduction of 9per centof emissions unconditionally (up to 27per centwith international aid) in 2030 compared to business as usual, taking 2014 as the baseline year.</p><p> We welcome this important step and now with the inclusion of industrial processes into the mitigation equation. And yet Vit Namhas much more potential to be a climate champion and a leader in the region.</p><p> The recent positive renewable energy policy developments, on solar and wind power production, are an example. The potential regarding renewable energy expansion is still vast and could replace fossil-based energies on a very large scale.</p><p> Other areas with major mitigation potential, and linked with increased energy efficiency, include industry, construction and buildings, agriculture and forestry, waste management and mobility. Vit Nam's investment in green growth could yield future great economic and social benefits.</p><p> Already, the ranks of the \"climate neutrality club\" are growing. Japan has joined the EU and has adopted the 2050 climate neutrality goal, and others aim to achieve climate neutrality around mid-century (South Africa, South Korea and China), with important details to be further clarified.</p><p> Canada announced a new law on climate neutrality and president-elect Biden has indicated that the US will move in the same direction. There is finally a sense of a global momentum emerging towards keeping the promise of the Paris Agreement and securing our future on this planet.</p><p> Climate neutrality is becoming the new normal mid-century outlook for countries with very different historical and geographical circumstances. Together with the delivery of the US$100 billionof climate financing to developing countries, these must be the deliverables for the climate negotiations when they resume at COP26 in Glasgow next November.</p><p> We can avoid the most dramatic impacts of climate change on our societies. Our global, regional, national, local and individual recovery plans are an opportunity to 'build back better'.</p><p> We owe it to next generation: major victims of social and economic consequences of the pandemic, they will have to bear the burden of climate change and pay off the debt of the recovery. And this is all very relevant for Vit Nam, currently one the 10 most vulnerable countries to climate change.</p><p> Vit Namand its approach to climate adaptation, especially in the Mekong Delta, will feature prominently at the Climate Adaptation Summit in January 2021 that focusses on the prevention of climate-related disasters in the future. The summit aims to mobilise international finance for adaptation action plans.</p><p> These last years, the EU continued to lead the fight against climate change, but five years after the signing of the Paris Agreement, it is more important than ever that we all come forward with clear strategies for climate neutrality and enhance our level of ambition for 2030. And we stand ready to continue to assist Vit Namin doing so. The COVID-19 pandemic has made us aware that good public policies alone are not enough.</p><p> We will also need to foster small individual actions to attain a big collective impact. This is the snowball effect we need starting from the Paris Agreement.</p><p> With climate neutrality as the direction of travel, the world can mobilise its best engineers, businesspeople, policymakers, artists, academics, NGOs and citizens to protect together something we all share beyond borders and species: our planet.

I would like to take you on a short journey through a few of many Dutch-Vietnamese co-operation projects and activities in the spirit of this joyous day. Vi\u1ec7t Nam and the Netherlands enjoy strong ties, built on a solid foundation of economic co-operation. Did you know that Netherlands is the largest European investor in Vi\u1ec7t Nam? And the second largest European trading partner?</p><p>But there is more than trade and investment only. We also enjoy strong cultural ties. I would like to highlight one project in particular: The World Press Photo. Every year, thousands of photographers from all over the world, including Vi\u1ec7t Nam and the Netherlands, submit beautiful photos and stories that matter from the Andes Mountains in Latin America to the Mekong Delta in Vi\u1ec7t Nam to the World Press Photo Foundation. The most meaningful photos and stories are then selected by an independent jury. The Netherlands Embassy and Consulate General in HCMC have both, in close co-operation with the local government and People\u2019s Party, shown the exhibition in public spaces in both cities. We will continue to do so in future years, so the people of Viet Nam get to enjoy the same beautiful exhibition that is shown in Amsterdam and many other cities in the world. The exposition helps to create a deeper understanding for different people from diverse cultures all around the world.</p><p>The Netherlands and Vi\u1ec7t Nam share a long history with each other, and we also share part of our geography. Both countries are rich in deltas and have long-standing strategic partnerships to collaborate on climate adaptation and water management. That is both a blessing and a risk. Floods can bring many benefits such as fertile sediment, pest control and fish. The Netherlands, therefore, works closely with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment to develop a strategy for living with water in Vi\u1ec7t Nam by creating space for water and floods.</p><p>When water and floods are not managed and contained, storms and heavy rainfall will continue to produce disasters like the past year in the central provinces. Such disasters expose the vulnerabilities of coasts and deltas that both Vi\u1ec7t Nam and the Netherlands face. The aim of our co-operation is to turn vulnerabilities along the coast and in the Mekong Delta into resilience and sustainable, inclusive development.</p><p>Apart from our structural support to improve water security and water safety, the Kingdom of the Netherlands has granted 2 million euros in disaster relief funds for the victims of the recent disasters in central Vi\u1ec7t Nam, on top of EU funds. This additional fund was provided to the Dutch Relief Alliance, a coalition of fifteen NGOs, who then disbursed the funds through their local offices and partners. The role of civil society organisations proved to be pivotal and contributed to an effective distribution to Vietnamese people in need of support.</p><p>Being the second-largest agricultural exporter in the world, the Netherlands is eager to support the development of the agricultural sector in Vi\u1ec7t Nam. Vi\u1ec7t Nam and the Netherlands have signed a Strategic Partnership Agreement in the field of agriculture of which an Agricultural Transformation Programme (ATP) is an integral part. The programme aims to mobilise and co-ordinate international assistance to support Viet Nam in speeding up its agricultural development. The objective is to move Vietnamese agriculture up in the value chain, provide access to the world market and contribute to the global sustainable development goals by promoting sustainable and climate-resilient agriculture.</p><p>Part of the solution to combat climate change is to reduce our carbon footprint by making our economies more circular. The Netherlands economy is currently 24.5 per cent circular, where the worldwide figure is 8.6 per cent. The Netherlands aims to realise a 100 per cent circular economy by 2050. Most Dutch companies in Vi\u1ec7t Nam, like Dutch Lady, Heineken and Unilever, work hard to make their product cycles more circular. The Netherlands Embassy supports the ambition of Viet Nam to make its overall economy more circular by sharing best practices from the Netherlands.</p><p>The celebration of King\u2019s Day in the Netherlands fits very well in a circular economy. Did you know that every year on King\u2019s Day, Amsterdam and other cities, towns and villages turn into one big flea market? One man\u2019s trash is another\u2019s treasure and King\u2019s Day is certainly a day for treasure hunting. Millions of people (including children) set up stalls and become entrepreneurs for one day.</p><p>Entrepreneurship is the lifeblood of every economy and benefits from the participation of as many entrepreneurs as possible, regardless of ethnicity, race, culture, age, or gender. Therefore, we are working with Viettrade and SheTrades on a project aiming to enhance the competitiveness of Vietnamese women-owned enterprises. E-learning courses for women entrepreneurs will be developed and multiplied via Train the Trainer activities to reach a wider community of women in localities. E-women participants to the courses can take part in a competition for The Best Business Plan, with a cash award of VN\u0110100 million (US$4,357) for the first prize winner. We hope that many Vietnamese women will develop their entrepreneurial skills, will write a business plan to improve their business and will join the competition!</p><p>As Ambassador of the Kingdom of the Netherlands to Vi\u1ec7t Nam, I look forward to continuing our co-operation in the realms of trade and investment, water, agriculture, sustainability and culture. But also hope that our understanding of one another will continue to grow and allow for our King\u2019s Day, Vietnamese National Day and all national days over the world to soon be celebrated in person again.</p>", "publisher": "Ovietnam", "instances": ["The exposition helps to create a deeper understanding for different people from diverse cultures all around the world.

Can you give us some most important missions that will be carried out in the next few years?  There are threegroups of important missions and tasks that must be carried out in the course of implementing the Government Resolution No 93 which is in line with Paris Agreement on the climate change.</p><p> They are as follows:  First, to improve the adaptability of climate change into the national strategy and plans with specific missions and solutions.In particular, we need to focus onreviewing, updating and building new socio-economic development plans on the basis of climate change scenarios and assessment of climate change impacts monitoring and evaluatingthese plans to improve the effectiveness of climate change adaptation periodically updatingclimate change scenariosestablishing a national database and support tools for climate change policy management and planning.</p><p> It's also important to work on mobilising and distributing financial resources for the task.

In the 2021-25 period, Vit Nam will focus on further completion of the policies on climate changes and then reflect these policies in the national strategy to respond to the natural calamity.  In the 2026-25 periodwith lessons learned from the previous fiveyears, Vit Nam will make adjustments to improve the capacity of industries, sectors, communities and ecosystems to increase their resilience to climate change andthe readiness to adapt to changes in climate.</p><p> We will also work to improve the resilience of infrastructure systems, the ecosystems and biodiversity and protect and conserve biodiversity from climate change impacts.Promotingadaptation actions that bring benefits in mitigating risks caused by climate change and efficiency in terms of economy, society and environment is also encouraged.</p><p>  In the period after 2030 to 2050, Vit Namwill promote the results achieved in the 2021-30 period, further strengthening human capacity to adapt to climate change, infrastructure and natural systems.

Amid rapidly shifting and complex developments in the global scene, the Party Platform continues to serve as the ideological flag to gather the collective strength of united peoples for the goal of a \"prosperous-people, strong-nation, democratic, equitable, and civilised\" Vit Nam.</p><p>  Development vision and orientations  In the coming years, the challenges and opportunities of a complicated world demand the entire Party and Vietnamese people to \u201cunite\u201d and continue to have major changes in mindset and make correct and timely forecasts of the situation to prepare and deal with any circumstance, to \u201cbring the country forward on the path of rapid, sustainable development\u201d and the attainment of many orientations, goals, and tasks.  The Resolution lists major guiding orientations of the years forward, including \u201cpersistent and innovative\u201d implementation of Marxist-Leninism and H Ch\u00ed Minh ideology, persistent pursuit of socialism and independence and upholding national interests based on the principles of the United Nations\u2019 Charter and international law and the spirit of equal and win-win co-operation, with national defence and security in mind.</p><p>  It also aims to enhance patriotism, the spirit of resilience, national unity and people\u2019s aspirations to develop a prosperous and happy nation, promoting socialist democracy, enhancing the quality of human resources and promoting innovation and science and technology \u2013 especially the achievements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution \u2013 in service of the country\u2019s sustainable and rapid development.  In addition, Party building and governance are goals, working towards a streamlined and effective Party system with quality cadres and civil servants.</p><p>  The \u201cgeneral objectives\u201d are identified as improving the Party\u2019s leadership and ruling capacity; building a pure, strong and comprehensive Party and political system; consolidating and raising people\u2019s confidence in the Party, the State and the socialist regime; fomenting aspirations to develop a prosperous and happy country; promoting the will and strength of national solidarity; promoting comprehensive and synchronous i mi (reforms), industrialisation, and modernisation; building and firmly defending the Fatherland, maintaining a peaceful and stable environment; and striving to become a developed country with socialist orientations by the middle of the 21st century.  The \u201cparticular objectives\u201d are set on Vit Nam becoming a developed nation with a modern industrial base and leaving the ranks of lower-middle-income countries by 2025 - the year marking the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the south and national reunification.</p><p> By 2030, when the Party celebrates its 100th founding anniversary, Vit Nam is hoped to become a developing country with a modern industrial base and upper-middle incomes. By 2045, the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vit Nam, now the Socialist Republic of Vit Nam, Vit Nam is hoped to become a developed, industrialised nation with high income.</p><p>  In 2021-25, the Resolution sets a target for average GDP growth of 6.5-7 per cent, GDP per capita by 2025 reaching $4,700-5,000, the contributions of total factor productivity (TFP) in economic growth reaching 45 per cent, the labour productivity increase hitting 6.</p><p>5 per cent a year, urbanisation reaching 45 per cent, the ratio of processing and manufacturing industries in the GDP exceeding 25 per cent, and the digital economy accounting for 20 per cent of the country\u2019s GDP.  In this time frame, the Resolution aims for agricultural labour ratio staying at 25 per cent, the ratio of trained labour reaching 70 per cent, urban unemployment kept at below 4 per cent, the rate of multidimensional poverty maintaining a decrease of 1-1.5 per cent year-on-year, aiming for 10 doctors and 30 hospital beds for every 10,000 people, striving towards 95 per cent of the Vietnamese population being covered under the State\u2019s health insurance, life expectancy reaching 74.5 years, and the ratio of communes obtaining new rural standards reaching at least 80 per cent, including 10 per cent meeting the requirements of exemplary new rural standards.</p><p>  In terms of environment, by 2025, the goals are to have 95-100 per cent of the urban population and 93-95 per cent of rural population having access to clean and hygienic water, 90 per cent of urban waste properly collected and treated, 92 per cent of active industrial-processing zones outfitted with proper wastewater treatment facilities; 100 per cent of all businesses polluting the environment punished; and upholding the national forest coverage at 42 per cent.  The 13th tenure has \"six central tasks\", with the first being Party building, building rules-based socialist State, with effective, corruption-free governance.</p><p> The second task is controlling the COVID-19 pandemic, ensuring COVID-19 vaccination coverage, while engaging in economic recovery, pursuing the transformation of growth model and economic restructuring, implementing national digital transformation strategy, raising labour productivity and innovation, and third is upholding independence, improving the effectiveness of foreign affairs and international integration, building modern and elite armed forces, and maintaining peaceful and stable environment for development.  The fourth central task is inspiring patriotism among the people to develop a prosperous and happy nation, promoting the role of cultural values and the strength of Vietnamese people in nation-building and defence, with detailed policies to develop the culture of ethnic minority groups, carrying out social policies and ensuring social security for the people, raising living standards and happiness indexes of the Vietnamese people.</p><p> Fifth is perfecting the legal system, institutions, and policies to promote socialist democracy. The final central task is to strictly manage, reasonably and effectively use land and natural resources, protecting the environment, and implementing adaptation measures to cope with climate change and natural disasters.</p><p>  Breakthrough strategies  To achieve the goals, the Party sets three major breakthrough strategies \u2013 completing development institutions, developing human resources, and building modern infrastructure.  Regarding institutions, the Party identifies the need to improve development institutions for a socialist-oriented market economy; reforming State governance towards modernity and competitiveness; improving the legal system and institutions to create a favourable, healthy, and fair business and investment environment for all sectors of the economy where innovation can foster; mobilising, managing and using all resources \u2013 especially land, finance, public-private partnership \u2013 for development purposes; bolstering reasonable decentralisation, while enhancing inspections and keeping powers in check via the legal system.</p><p>  For human resources, the Party wants a priority on high-quality human resources for leadership and management and key positions, based on \u201ccomprehensive and radical transformation of education and training quality in tandem with recruitment and incentive policies\u201d; promoting research, transfer, application and development of science and technology, innovation; promoting the aspirations for national development, people\u2019s sense of unity and national pride in nation-building and defence efforts.  The Resolution also states the demand for \"modern and synchronous\" social and economic infrastructure, with a focus on national key transport projects, climate adaptation projects, and information and communications projects to serve national digital transformation and the development of a digital economy and society.</p><p> -- VNS</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["Regarding institutions, the Party identifies the need to improve development institutions for a socialist-oriented market economy; reforming State governance towards modernity and competitiveness; improving the legal system and institutions to create a favourable, healthy, and fair business and investment environment for all sectors of the economy where innovation can foster; mobilising, managing and using all resources \u2013 especially land, finance, public-private partnership \u2013 for development purposes; bolstering reasonable decentralisation, while enhancing inspections and keeping powers in check via the legal system.
