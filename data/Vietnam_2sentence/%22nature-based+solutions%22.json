For centuries, the sea has shaped Viet Nam's identity and supported millions through fisheries, tourism and coastal livelihoods. But overfishing, pollution, and climate change are pushing this critical resource to a tipping point. The question is no longer whether to develop the marine economy, but how to do so sustainably before the damage becomes irreversible.</p><p>A new World Bank report, 'Boosting Viet Nam's Sustainable Marine Economy - A Public Expenditure &amp; Investment Review' (PEIR), is the first global review of its kind to focus specifically on the marine economy. The analysis offers Viet Nam a data-driven roadmap to develop its ocean wealth responsibly. Prepared in partnership with the Ministry of Finance, the report is closely aligned with Resolution No. 36 (2018) of the Party Central Committee, which sets out Viet Nam's strategic vision for sustainable marine economic development through 2045, and Resolution No. 26 (2020) of the Government, which translates this vision into concrete policies and action plans. The report highlights both the opportunities and risks across Viet Nam's marine sectors and outlines a clear path toward long-term, sustainable growth.</p><p>A vision rooted in ecosystems and culture</p><p>At the recent 3rd United Nations Ocean Conference in Nice, France, Prime Minister Pham Minh Ch\u00ednh emphasised the need to deepen understanding of marine ecosystems and draw on indigenous wisdom. He called for harmony between economic development, biodiversity protection, and the preservation of cultural traditions. This aligns squarely with the approach outlined in the report: sustainable growth must integrate ecological health and local knowledge, not just GDP targets. Recognising the wisdom of coastal communities fosters stewardship and ensures development honours both nature and heritage.</p><p>A prosperous but fragile marine economy</p><p>Viet Nam's marine economy spans 20 ecosystems - from coral reefs to mangroves - and has been growing rapidly. Before the pandemic, it contributed nearly 6 per cent of GDP and 8 per cent of employment. Tourism made up 45 per cent of the marine economy in 2019. Beyond direct activity, healthy ecosystems deliver essential services like storm protection and carbon storage, conservatively adding another 0.6 per cent to GDP. Mangroves alone account for 94 per cent of this hidden value, highlighting that nature protection is also an economic policy.</p><p>Yet this bounty is under threat. Fish stocks are collapsing under intense pressure. An estimated 730,000 tonnes of plastic waste enter Viet Nam's waters annually, suffocating marine life. Disasters like the 2016 Formosa spill show the devastating cost of insufficient regulatory vigilance. Internationally, the EU's 'yellow card' for illegal fishing illustrates how poor governance can damage Viet Nam's global reputation and trade.</p><p>Climate change adds urgency. Over 11 million coastal residents face flooding. More than a third of shoreline communities are affected by erosion. Warming seas are killing coral reefs and threatening shellfish populations, jeopardising fisheries and tourism. The risks to livelihoods, ecosystems and resilience are growing.</p><p>Big goals, weak foundations</p><p>Viet Nam's ambitions, enshrined in Resolutions 36 and 26, are bold: to grow the marine economy to 10 per cent of GDP by 2030, with a focus on sectors like tourism, renewables, and new blue industries. But achieving this will require more than vision. It calls for an overhaul of how the marine sectors are classified, financed, and governed.</p><p>The investment and expenditure review identifies several key gaps. Current classifications exclude emerging industries and overlook the value of ecosystem services. Investment in coastal provinces dropped from 27.2 per cent to 22.6 per cent between 2016 and 2022. Governance remains fragmented. Roughly 80 per cent of marine-related public spending still goes to transport, while sectors like offshore wind, sustainable aquaculture, and blue carbon remain underfunded.</p><p>A blueprint for sustainable ocean growth</p><p>To move forward, Viet Nam can benefit from integrating ecosystem services, like mangroves' role in storm buffering and carbon capture, into its economic planning. Treating natural assets as critical infrastructure in national accounting and investment decisions could help align development with long-term resilience.</p><p>Shifting public funding toward high-impact areas, such as offshore wind research, sustainable aquaculture pilots, and blue carbon initiatives, can unlock innovation and create jobs. Sectoral support can also be realised by mobilising private capital through guarantees, blended finance, and simplified regulations.</p><p>Nature-based solutions, in particular, offer some of the most cost-effective and high-impact opportunities. Restoring mangroves and wetlands, expanding marine protected areas, and rehabilitating degraded coastal zones not only buffer climate impacts but also safeguard livelihoods and support fisheries, tourism and disaster risk reduction.</p><p>Empowering local governments with the tools and authority to plan and implement marine strategies tailored to their ecosystems can also enhance effectiveness. Decentralised approaches often enable more responsive, place-based solutions, particularly when combined with community engagement and local knowledge.</p><p>Sector-specific strategies will need to evolve. In the short term, improving near-shore aquaculture standards and value is key. In the longer term, offshore aquaculture can be developed through pilot projects. For tourism, shifting toward high-value, low-impact models, such as eco-resorts and community-led experiences governed by strong environmental safeguards, can contribute to sustainable growth.</p><p>Governance reform: A turning point</p><p>Strengthening governance will be critical to delivering on Viet Nam's blue economy ambitions. The recent creation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Environment (MAE) from the two entities, formed through the merger of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) and the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), presents a unique opportunity to streamline marine governance. This presents a timely opportunity to enhance coordination across marine sectors and bring greater coherence to policy and implementation. With appropriate authority, capacity, and inter-agency collaboration, MAE could serve as a central driver of integrated blue economy development.</p><p>Three priorities, where MAE's leadership will be essential, include: (1) addressing illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing to lift the EU yellow card; (2) implementing marine spatial planning to resolve competing uses of coastal and ocean space; and (3) enforcing environmental regulations with real penalties to deter pollution and degradation.</p><p>The report's broader reform agenda, cutting waste, aligning budgets with outcomes, and using performance metrics, is vital to ensuring that well-intended policies translate into real results.</p><p>The tide will not wait</p><p>Viet Nam is at a turning point. It can unlock a new era of sustainable marine prosperity - or watch its blue assets slip away. The choice is stark: continue fragmented, short-term exploitation, or embrace a \"blue revolution\" that values ecosystems, invests wisely, empowers communities, and insists on sustainability.</p><p>As Prime Minister Ch\u00ednh has highlighted, understanding marine ecosystems and honouring local traditions are key to balancing growth with conservation.

Both countries share a wealth of tropical ecosystems, rich biodiversity and the challenge of promoting inclusive development while protecting nature, making them natural partners in the global climate and environment agenda.</p><p>One key area is the development of innovative finance mechanisms to support forest conservation and sustainable use. Efforts are underway to design and structure new instruments that recognize the value of conserved forests and provide long-term incentives. A notable example is the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF), an international proposal to create a stable funding mechanism for tropical forest countries. The fund will provide direct payments per hectare of conserved or restored forest, offering predictable, performance-based support for countries that commit to long-term forest protection. Viet Nam, with its significant tropical forest cover, could be a strong partner and beneficiary of such mechanisms.</p><p>Another strategic area is ecosystem restoration. Brazil has committed, as part of its NDC, to restore 12 million hectares of degraded land by 2030. This ambitious effort sets opportunities for local development, job creation, and the promotion of sustainable, nature-based solutions. Vietnam's leadership and best practices related to restoration interest Brazil and could be further explored bilaterally.</p><p>Brazil is also advancing forest concession models that allow for the restoration and productive recovery of degraded public lands. These models involve partnerships that combine environmental responsibility, long-term stewardship, and carbon credit generation. One example is the Bom Futuro National Forest, in the Brazilian Amazon, where ecological restoration is integrated with sustainable forest management. Vietnam's own experiences with sustainable forestry could complement these efforts and foster valuable technical exchange.</p><p>In addition, Brazil holds important comparative advantages that can contribute to the global decarbonization effort. With 93% of its electricity matrix powered by renewables, Brazil has enormous potential to become a major producer of green hydrogen. In the field of biofuels, Brazil combines technological expertise in both metallic and biological engineering, allowing it to scale production without triggering new deforestation or undermining food security. This is yet another sector where Brazil and Viet Nam could expand bilateral cooperation, advancing climate goals while supporting inclusive economic growth.</p><p>Looking ahead to COP30, to be hosted by Brazil in 2025, there is a growing need for all countries to present enhanced, ambitious NDCs aligned with the 1.5 \u00b0C goal.

At a time when the world faces the escalating impacts of climate change, biodiversity loss and desertification, land degradation, and droughts (DLDD) - alongside persistent poverty and inequality -, the Summit offers an opportunity to promote inclusive, science-based, and equity-driven transitions.</p><p>On the road to COP30 in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil invites all countries and stakeholders to engage not only in dialogue, but in the implementation of actions. The P4G Summit aligns closely with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and can help advance synergies among the three Rio Conventions on climate, biodiversity, and desertification, ensuring that integrated solutions are placed at the heart of the ecological transition.</p><p>In this context, it is essential to give greater prominence to adaptation, which speaks directly to the protection of life and the reduction of vulnerabilities at the local level. We must ensure that the communities most affected by climate impacts have access to resources and technology to build resilience. The transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient economy must be not only rapid, but also just, ensuring sustainable economic alternatives and the means of implementation, particularly for the most vulnerable populations and ecosystems.

Are there specific projects or policies aimed at promoting renewable energy, conservation, or climate resilience?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ADB, as the Climate Bank of the Asia Pacific, is well-positioned to support Viet Nam in addressing climate change risks and impacts and in transitioning to a green economy aligned with the country's net-zero by 2050 target. This is outlined in the ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2023-26 for Viet Nam, in which one of the two strategic pillars is transitioning to a green economy. For this purpose, ADB has a full suite of services to offer Viet Nam, namely project financing both in public and private sector investment, technical assistance for policy advice and project preparation, relevant expertise and capacity development and transaction advisory services for public-private partnerships.</p><p>ADB is already assisting the Vietnamese government in several areas, including climate adaptation and mitigation and strengthening the Paris Agreement. On climate change adaptation, ADB's projects are promoting climate-resilient agriculture through the upgrading of the irrigation systems for more efficient water use and improved water resource planning, along with mainstream climate-proofing into critical rural, transport and urban infrastructure investments. On climate change mitigation, ADB's ongoing support for green growth in Viet Nam is contributing to the attainment of the country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets through investments in renewable energy and power systems for energy transition, green city development and a low-carbon public transport system.</p><p>ADB is also supporting Viet Nam to put climate change adaptation and mitigation into mainstream national policies and with its plans to accelerate green growth transition.</p><p>ADB has facilitated knowledge sharing, policy formulation, capacity building and regional co-operation on climate change topics, as well as preparing projects on climate change, through the implementation of technical assistance projects amounting to around US$32 million.</p><p>ADB has also identified a sizable pipeline of climate-positive projects which was agreed with the Government to be approved during 2024-26, but progress has not been to our satisfaction to say the least. The indicative sovereign lending pipeline will focus on climate-resilient urban and infrastructure, climate adaptation water resources management and agriculture and nature-based solutions. Should we be able to accelerate their approval and implementation, they will make significant contributions to Viet Nam's green growth transition.</p><p>How is ADB collaborating with Viet Nam to accelerate investment in renewable energy?</p><p>ADB adopted a new Energy Policy in 2021 reflecting the changing contexts and responding to the need to expand access to reliable, affordable energy and work toward the clean energy transition. ADB's new energy policy is aligned with global climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement. ADB's Climate Change Action Plan approved in November 2023 also helped guide our climate shift to better support our developing member countries.</p><p>ADB is spearheading the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) initiative to facilitate the transition to sustainable, lower-carbon, and resilient energy systems.</p><p>ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism has the potential to be one of the biggest carbon reduction programs in the world. ETM is a scalable, collaborative initiative developed in partnership with development member countries that will leverage a market-based approach to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. ADB is presently piloting ETM in five countries: Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Viet Nam.</p><p>In 2023, in the whole Asia Pacific region, ADB committed a record $9.8 billion of climate finance.</p><p>In Viet Nam, ADB's support for energy transition focuses on improving market-based policy and regulatory environments as well as developing new infrastructure required for accelerating renewable energy deployment.</p><p>Could you elaborate on ADB's role in promoting green finance within Viet Nam? Are there mechanisms to incentivise private sector investments in sustainable projects?</p><p>As earlier mentioned, ADB has initiated a major reform to become the climate bank of Asia and the Pacific, with an increased ambition to provide $100 billion of its own funds, across public and private sector operations, for climate finance from 2019 to 2030.</p><p>ADB is a major participant in sustainable capital markets as an issuer itself, we have issued a total of $10 billion equivalent of green bonds and have also issued our first blue bond of $300 million in 2021.</p><p>ADB has allocated about $300 million of its recent green bonds proceeds to eligible low-carbon transport and climate adaptation projects in Viet Nam. To support Viet Nam's green finance development, ADB can leverage its extensive experience in the region supporting developing member countries to develop green finance including developing the green frameworks, issue green bonds (government and state-owned enterprises) and investment in green bonds.</p><p>Viet Nam can also explore innovative modalities for green public finance, including the potential issuance of green government bonds, and the possible establishment of a green finance scheme or facility to be a catalyst for investments in green infrastructure projects. If operational it could become a policy vehicle for incentivising both public and private investment in green and sustainable projects.</p><p>In addition to providing public sector financing, ADB is also proactively exploring innovative ways to mobilise private sector climate financing, as the estimated needs are beyond the capacity of the public sector alone to raise climate finance scale from billions to trillions of dollars.</p><p>ADB is spearheading the Innovative Financing for Climate in Asia and the Pacific or IF-CAP, which will use guarantees of ADB's sovereign loan portfolios to leverage billions of dollars for much-needed climate change investments. With a model of '$1 in, $5 out', the initial ambition of $3 billion in guarantees could create up to $15 billion in new loans for much-needed climate projects across Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>In Viet Nam, ADB has committed some green loan transactions (including those certified by Climate Bond Initiatives) for Vietnamese enterprises, particularly in renewable energy and electric vehicles. We expect the Viet Nam market has strong potential for green finance development aligning with the government's strong focus on green growth.</p><p>Viet Nam is striving for a circular economy.

Are there specific projects or policies aimed at promoting renewable energy, conservation, or climate resilience?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ADB, as the Climate Bank of the Asia Pacific, is well-positioned to support Viet Nam in addressing climate change risks and impacts and in transitioning to a green economy aligned with the country's net-zero by 2050 target. This is outlined in the ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2023-26 for Viet Nam, in which one of the two strategic pillars is transitioning to a green economy. For this purpose, ADB has a full suite of services to offer Viet Nam, namely project financing both in public and private sector investment, technical assistance for policy advice and project preparation, relevant expertise and capacity development and transaction advisory services for public-private partnerships.</p><p>ADB is already assisting the Vietnamese government in several areas, including climate adaptation and mitigation and strengthening the Paris Agreement. On climate change adaptation, ADB's projects are promoting climate-resilient agriculture through the upgrading of the irrigation systems for more efficient water use and improved water resource planning, along with mainstream climate-proofing into critical rural, transport and urban infrastructure investments. On climate change mitigation, ADB's ongoing support for green growth in Viet Nam is contributing to the attainment of the country's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets through investments in renewable energy and power systems for energy transition, green city development and a low-carbon public transport system.</p><p>ADB is also supporting Viet Nam to put climate change adaptation and mitigation into mainstream national policies and with its plans to accelerate green growth transition.</p><p>ADB has facilitated knowledge sharing, policy formulation, capacity building and regional co-operation on climate change topics, as well as preparing projects on climate change, through the implementation of technical assistance projects amounting to around US$32 million.</p><p>ADB has also identified a sizable pipeline of climate-positive projects which was agreed with the Government to be approved during 2024-26, but progress has not been to our satisfaction to say the least. The indicative sovereign lending pipeline will focus on climate-resilient urban and infrastructure, climate adaptation water resources management and agriculture and nature-based solutions. Should we be able to accelerate their approval and implementation, they will make significant contributions to Viet Nam's green growth transition.</p><p>How is ADB collaborating with Viet Nam to accelerate investment in renewable energy?</p><p>ADB adopted a new Energy Policy in 2021 reflecting the changing contexts and responding to the need to expand access to reliable, affordable energy and work toward the clean energy transition. ADB's new energy policy is aligned with global climate commitments such as the Paris Agreement. ADB's Climate Change Action Plan approved in November 2023 also helped guide our climate shift to better support our developing member countries.</p><p>ADB is spearheading the Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) initiative to facilitate the transition to sustainable, lower-carbon, and resilient energy systems.</p><p>ADB's Energy Transition Mechanism has the potential to be one of the biggest carbon reduction programs in the world. ETM is a scalable, collaborative initiative developed in partnership with development member countries that will leverage a market-based approach to accelerate the transition from fossil fuels to clean energy. ADB is presently piloting ETM in five countries: Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, the Philippines and Viet Nam.</p><p>In 2023, in the whole Asia Pacific region, ADB committed a record $9.8 billion of climate finance.</p><p>In Viet Nam, ADB's support for energy transition focuses on improving market-based policy and regulatory environments as well as developing new infrastructure required for accelerating renewable energy deployment.</p><p>Could you elaborate on ADB's role in promoting green finance within Viet Nam? Are there mechanisms to incentivise private sector investments in sustainable projects?</p><p>As earlier mentioned, ADB has initiated a major reform to become the climate bank of Asia and the Pacific, with an increased ambition to provide $100 billion of its own funds, across public and private sector operations, for climate finance from 2019 to 2030.</p><p>ADB is a major participant in sustainable capital markets as an issuer itself, we have issued a total of $10 billion equivalent of green bonds and have also issued our first blue bond of $300 million in 2021.</p><p>ADB has allocated about $300 million of its recent green bonds proceeds to eligible low-carbon transport and climate adaptation projects in Viet Nam. To support Viet Nam's green finance development, ADB can leverage its extensive experience in the region supporting developing member countries to develop green finance including developing the green frameworks, issue green bonds (government and state-owned enterprises) and investment in green bonds.</p><p>Viet Nam can also explore innovative modalities for green public finance, including the potential issuance of green government bonds, and the possible establishment of a green finance scheme or facility to be a catalyst for investments in green infrastructure projects. If operational it could become a policy vehicle for incentivising both public and private investment in green and sustainable projects.</p><p>In addition to providing public sector financing, ADB is also proactively exploring innovative ways to mobilise private sector climate financing, as the estimated needs are beyond the capacity of the public sector alone to raise climate finance scale from billions to trillions of dollars.</p><p>ADB is spearheading the Innovative Financing for Climate in Asia and the Pacific or IF-CAP, which will use guarantees of ADB's sovereign loan portfolios to leverage billions of dollars for much-needed climate change investments. With a model of '$1 in, $5 out', the initial ambition of $3 billion in guarantees could create up to $15 billion in new loans for much-needed climate projects across Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>In Viet Nam, ADB has committed some green loan transactions (including those certified by Climate Bond Initiatives) for Vietnamese enterprises, particularly in renewable energy and electric vehicles. We expect the Viet Nam market has strong potential for green finance development aligning with the government's strong focus on green growth.</p><p>Viet Nam is striving for a circular economy.

What are the challenges facing Viet Nam in biodiversity conservation?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The natural world is at a breaking point, plagued by the two biggest existential crises in our lifetime: biodiversity loss and climate change. With the CBD COP15 taking place in Montreal, Canada, the world looks back with deep regret and serious concern that not one of the 20 targets set at Aichi, Japan, back in 2010 during COP10, have been fulfilled.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Viet Nam, unfortunately, shares a similar trend in biodiversity degradation as with many parts of the world, with an increasing number of threatened species, and degraded ecosystems of forests, wetlands, marine areas, among other issues.</p><p>Reports have shown that the number of threatened species in Viet Nam has risen sharply in recent years, and for several species, time has already run out and they have become extinct, including the Javan rhinoceros and the Giant ibis. In addition, the Indochinese tiger is considered functionally extinct, with other large mammal species such as the Asian elephant, many big cats (Felidae spp.), bears (Ursus spp.), pangolins (Manis spp.) not far behind.</p><p>The first National Ecosystem Assessment report by the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) has shown that over the past two decades, the area of seagrass has decreased by 45.4 per cent and the average annual reduction rate was 4.4 per cent. The live coral cover of coral reefs in coastal areas is decreasing rapidly over time. Only about 1 per cent of the reefs have a high coverage while the number of reefs with low coverage reefs accounts for over 31 per cent, and the rest is for medium to slight coverage coral reefs. For terrestrial forests, while the overall forest coverage is reported to remain at roughly 42 per cent, deforestation and forest degradation are still rampant, with biodiversity-rich natural forests being replaced with monoculture planted forests that have little to no biodiversity values.</p><p>Viet Nam is among the top 16 countries and territories with the richest biodiversity of global significance. Recognising the importance of biodiversity and ecosystem services for sustainable economic development, the Government has made significant efforts to protect biodiversity, including the introduction of legal frameworks and the establishment of protected areas systems.</p><p>However, Viet Nam faces several challenges that could make it more difficult to halt and reverse the downward trends of biodiversity loss. First of all, while Viet Nam has developed a relatively comprehensive legal framework for environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, including the latest Law on Environmental Protection 2020, the enforcement of the laws and sub-laws is still low due to many reasons, including unclear division of responsibilities among ministries and agencies, low-deterrence penalty schemes, insufficient capacities and low commitment on the part of central and local decision-makers.</p><p>Second, it is necessary for Viet Nam to transform its business-as-usual development modality into a more sustainable, resource-efficient, and nature-positive one. Examples of business-as-usual development include overexploitation of natural resources and overconsumption. Overfishing and destructive fishing methods have resulted in destroyed or depleted natural ecosystems. Also, over-and-unsustainable tourism causes negative impacts on biodiversity from direct tourists' sightseeing activities, infrastructure-related developments, and pollution.</p><p>Last, being one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change puts more pressure on the already vulnerable ecosystems in Viet Nam and hinders the national efforts in reversing the biodiversity declination trend. For example, the increase in average temperature will change many ecosystems' geographic distribution and population structure and exacerbate other threats such as forest fires, droughts and tropical storms.</p><p>Could you please suggest some solutions to promote biodiversity conservation in Viet Nam?</p><p>While much needs to be done to overcome the first challenge of ineffective law enforcement, we believe one of the keys is that main-streaming biodiversity conservation in all sectors may be done more systematically and effectively. For example, indicators for socio-economic development should be more biodiversity-specific. The current indicator of \"area of forest coverage\" does not tell us the quality of forests or their biodiversity levels. We could learn from the achievement of climate change main-streaming in Viet Nam, where climate mitigation and adaptation are quite systematically incorporated in socio-economic development plans and planning across many sectors. We need the same, if not more, awareness of and commitment to biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Transforming the country's business-as-usual development modality into a more sustainable, resource-efficient, and nature-positive one shall help Viet Nam take the leap in biodiversity and nature conservation. Our recommendations include materialising the targets of the Green Growth Strategy by embracing better the Circular Economy model, in which sustainable natural resources exploitation, resource-efficient production and moderate consumption will be put at the centre.</p><p>The system of protected areas in Viet Nam needs to be improved in both quantity and quality. Comprehensive planning, capacity building and financial allocation for protected area (PA) management should be prioritised in the biodiversity agendas. Most financing allocated for PAs has not been prioritised for biodiversity conservation work itself. Therefore, in the coming time, apart from financial mobilisation from the international community, the Government needs to allocate more budget for biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Indigenous and local communities are often the best guardians of forests and natural ecosystems, where successive generations call home. At the same time, local communities often face disproportionate impacts of biodiversity loss given the interdependence of health environments that crucially underpin their lives and livelihoods. Therefore, ensuring indigenous and local people's voices in the debate on biodiversity conservation and improvement of livelihoods will help preserve traditional knowledge in conserving nature and reduce the pressure on the environment.</p><p>The Government of Viet Nam has made commendable efforts in improving the well-being of ethnic minority people and other vulnerable groups through poverty reduction and social protection programmes, and in the context of increased threats from climate change and biodiversity loss, this should be continually put at the centre of the government's development agendas.</p><p>What is the link between biodiversity and climate change? How does biodiversity impact climate change and vice versa?</p><p>Climate change and biodiversity are interconnected. Climate change drives biodiversity loss, and in return, ecosystem degradation exacerbates climate change. For example, sea level rise would severely affect 78 out of 286 critical habitats (equivalent to 27 per cent), 46 protected areas (equivalent to 33 per cent), nine biodiversity areas of national and international value (23 per cent) and 23 other biodiversity areas in Viet Nam according to MONRE's report. Loss of biodiversity and degraded ecosystems also accelerate climate change processes due to the reduced capacity of ecosystems to assimilate and store CO2 as well as the loss of critical barriers reducing sea level rise's impacts (e.g. mangrove forests).</p><p>In contrast, biodiversity resources can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and allow for climate adaptation. In terms of mitigation, trees and sea water are silent heroes in CO2 sequestration. In other words, their natural mechanisms help absorb and store carbon naturally, thus relieving gas emissions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Nonetheless, it's important to not over-rely on sea water for carbon sequestration since CO2 excess can impact marine life for many species. For adaptation, coral reefs and mangroves are nature's incredible endowed assets that can shield the coast against inundation and protect vulnerable communities most affected by the risk of catastrophic sea level rise and its aftermath. Since these natural resources are on the decline, restoring and conserving them will aid the world's collective fight for our survival against climate change.</p><p>Which activities has UNDP been doing to help promote biodiversity conservation in Viet Nam?</p><p>The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been doing a lot of projects and programmes to promote nature and biodiversity conservation in Viet Nam.</p><p>We have supported the establishment of Th\u00e1i Thuy Wetland PA in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh and Tam Giang-Cau Hai Wetland PA in Thua Thi\u00ean Hue, together with formulating and promulgating policies, regulations and planning frameworks for wetland conservation (Decree No.66/2019/ND-CP) and supporting the integration of wetland conservation and management into the plans of the two provinces.

The Netherlands and Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam have supported each other in good and in bad times and became trusted partners. 50 years ago, we started as your development partner and now the Netherlands is the biggest trade and investment partner of Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam in Europe.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam and the Netherlands have a lot in common. Both our countries depend on international trade and investment, have large deltas, face serious water and climate challenges, and are home to an export oriented agriculture sector. Being small, we both have learned to build on the international rule of law and the multilateral system.</p><p>Our cooperation does not stop at the government level (with the most recent high-level visits of the Netherlands Prime Minister Mark Rutte to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam in 2019 and Vietnamese Prime Minister Pha\u0323m Minh Chi\u0301nh to the Netherlands in 2022), but it is strong and deep between universities/research institutions, businesses and CSOs. I am proud to see the sustainable and significant Dutch footprints in different areas, from the flagship Ha\u0300 N\u00f4\u0323i Amsterdam High School to cooperation in water, agriculture and climate between universities in Ha\u0300 N\u00f4\u0323i, Mekong provinces, and HCM City, and those in the Netherlands, from the inspirational Dutch delta plan to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam Government's Resolution 120 and later the Mekong Delta Regional Master Plan.</p><p>Dutch companies also bring 'quality investment' to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam, such as six Heineken Vietnam breweries and its circular waste water system, animal feed factories and research centre of DeHeus Vietnam, the world's first fully electric tug from Damen Song Cam, not to mention Friesland Campina Vietnam and its famous milk brand 'C\u00f4 ga\u0301i Ha\u0300 Lan' (Dutch Lady).</p><p>The year 2023 marks 50 years of bilateral relations between Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam and the Netherlands. In this special year, we wish to celebrate our strong relationship by exploring how we can further cooperate - both in terms of innovative technological solutions in the fields of agriculture, water and logistics, high tech, green energy and circular economy as well as in terms of cultural exchanges and people-to-people ties.</p><p>Do you have any recommendations for the two countries to utilise opportunities that the EU-Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) brings to boost their trade and investment ties?</p><p>The Netherlands is the largest export destination of Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam in the EU, where Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam enjoys a large trade surplus. And the two-way trade continues to grow thanks to the favourable conditions offered by the EVFTA and EVIPA. Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam and Singapore are the only two countries in the ASEAN region could be the signatories together with the EU in such trade and investment agreements, which are the modern and ambitious instruments to fostering sustainable trade and investment, as well as advancing human rights, and environmental and labour standards.</p><p>On top of that, other EU regulations are about to enter into forces which require exporters to comply with the ESG (Environmental - Social - Governance) criteria. So to say, the wellbeing of the environment and employees should be taken into account, and not only in your own factory, but also in your value chain. That is an important factor. That might not always be easy. The Dutch Business Association in Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam, supported by the Netherlands and Vietnamese government, implements the \"Ready to Export\" programme to enhance the capacity of Vietnamese SMEs to do business in Europe.</p><p>In terms of investment, the Netherlands currently is the largest European investor in Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam with total projects worth US$14 billion. Dutch companies, as I mentioned, bring sustainable innovations and solutions to contribute to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam's green economic transformation. For Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam to capitalise on new ties of investment, it is crucial that Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam could offer favourable business climate to foster sustainable foreign investors as well as develop green mechanisms such as the DPPA or the domestic carbon trading market soon to be in line with the international carbon trading market.</p><p>Students at the Ha\u0300 N\u00f4\u0323i-Amsterdam High School.

In 2014, the two countries established a Strategic Partnership in Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security. How do you evaluate cooperation projects between the two countries in these fields in the past and prospects in the future?</p><p>Like Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam, the Netherlands faces numerous water challenges such as too much, too little, too dirty and too salty water and is severely affected by the rising sea levels as a result of climate change. Our economies for an important part rely on a backbone of agriculture sector and hardworking farmers. The SPAs are commitments of Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam and the Netherlands to work together in response to water and climate challenges and to jointly develop sustainable agriculture. I am a proud Dutch ambassador to see the Mekong Delta Plan, which was developed with support of Dutch experts and is a source of inspiration to the establishment of Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam's Government Resolution 120 and later the Mekong Delta Regional Master Plan. These directives and governing documents present the Vietnamese Government's strong commitment to employ the nature-based and integrated solutions and call for the coordination of the national and local government to develop a healthy and sustainable Mekong Delta.</p><p>I think it is also important to make more use of nature-based solutions. By working with nature instead of against it, our solutions are more sustainable in the long run. Coastal erosion in the Mekong Delta is a very good example. You know, if you want to protect the coast, then you should actually cut back of what you took away. These are the mangrove forests, and you should get the shore and the forest back. And the mangrove forest is an ideal and effective environment for shrimp farming. And a great way to store carbon and to achieve your climate targets at the same time.</p><p>The cooperation between our two countries continues to grow and develop and goes way beyond just agro-water nexus, connecting other dots such as smart logistics, circular solutions, waste treatment, inland waterway transport, seaport development to enable better and faster access for products from the Mekong Delta to other parts of Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam and international markets. On top of that, Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam will need to develop its own mechanism to finance the resilience of the Mekong Delta, and the Netherlands is willing to inspire Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam by its examples on financing and to collaborate with the government to improve public funding and attract private funding.</p><p>What are major events in the series of activities celebrating the 50th anniversary of the bilateral diplomatic ties this year?</p><p>The celebration of the 50th anniversary of the diplomatic ties between our countries started since last year, with the visit to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam of the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation Liesje Schreinemacher and the visit to the Netherlands of Prime Minister Pha\u0323m Minh Chi\u0301nh, along with the large trade missions. We will continue our full and meaningful economic agenda with activities and events in water and waste management, aquaculture, horticulture, high tech, logistics, green energy, to name just a few.</p><p>Naturally, our relationship comprises a lot more than just trade and investment. There has also been a lot of cultural exchanges between Viet Nam and the Netherlands, most notably in the fields of music and photography. One of our flagship projects in recent years has been the World Press Photo exhibition. We hope to be able to continue our cooperation with Vietnamese partners in bringing such important exhibitions to Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam in the future. Naturally, in the framework of celebrating 50 years of bilateral relations, we hope to further strengthen and deepen these cultural ties.</p><p>We have very interesting and exciting years ahead in our bilateral cooperation. We look forward to working together with Vi\u00ea\u0323t Nam to the benefit of our countries and peoples. To do so, we will continue to engage and work with each other, involving our government agencies, our businesses, our knowledge institutes and, most importantly, our citizens.

Our lives and our economies rely heavily on a healthy, richly biodiverse environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Therefore, to care for ourselves, we must care for nature. The good news is that the United Nations has declared that 2021-2030 as the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.</p><p> In the lead up to the new decade, 2020 was an important year preparing a new global biodiversity framework, however these plans have been disrupted by the current crisis triggered by COVID-19 pabdemic. Yet the issues they address are more relevant as ever.</p><p> Vit Nam has provided exemplary leadership in the successful containment of COVID-19 pandemic by putting the health and lives of people first. It now has the opportunity as a global front runner in opening to a 'new normal' to lead with solutions that are nature based and sustainable.</p><p> Vit Nam has important foundations to build on. Vit Namranks16th out of the 25countrieswhich have therichest biodiversityin theworld.</p><p> Dozens of different ecosystems and habitats  including forests, grasslands, mountains, rivers, peat swamps, coastal mangroves, and coral reefs  all play host to thousands of native and migratory species, hundreds of which can only be found within the country's borders. At present, Vit Nam has one of the highest proportions of threatened species in the world, including over 500 that may be risking extinction.</p><p> Vit Nam's nature provides strong foundation for sustainable economic growth, especially the sectors of agriculture, forestry, fisheries, tourism and hospitality, medicinal, renewable energy, and textile and apparel. There are promisingrecent developments in the fisheries, agriculture and textile and apparel that point to clear evidence of successful nature-based development in Vit Nam.</p><p> Vit Nam has made many efforts to protect natural resources and biodiversity, such as by establishing a comprehensive natural conservation sites and protected areas. The people of Vit Nam also engage in local-level conservation work, such as the Dao ethnic minority, who continue to practice traditional lifestyles that involve the sustainable extraction of non-timber products from their community forests.</p><p> Unfortunately, nature, biodiversity and ecosystems in Vit Nam are increasingly threatened by unsustainable business practices, depleting soil, water and degrading ecosystems driven by population growth, urbanization, industrial expansion, infrastructure development and pollution. We will only be able to continue benefiting from natural resources for as long as we can protect them.</p><p> If we are to find a long-term solution for dealing with biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation, it will lie in an integrated approach to socio-economic development of significant scope, ambition and speed. As we see with the current COVID-19 pandemic and other communicable diseases, the imbalance of the natural environment due to human actions is creating more opportunities for such global health problems to emerge.</p><p> According to Kate Jones, chair of ecology and biodiversity at University College London, \"simpler systems get an amplification effect. Destroy landscapes, and the species you are left with are the ones humans get the diseases from.</p><p>\" We should not forget that humans interact with the ecosystems around them to form a self-regulated system to maintain the balance of nature, as such, a well-BALANCED ecosystem can play a role in limiting the transmission of new diseases. Although the current COVID-19 crisis caused unpreceded impacts, it is also presenting an unprecedented opportunity to rebuild in a sustainable, environmentally harmonious way.</p><p> The so-called \"dividend for nature\" precipitated by the pandemic over the past few months has been the result of a radical restructuring of our lives and societies. The International Energy Agency estimates that the impact of the virus may cause a drop in total global emissions of up to 8 per cent this year, a reduction twice as large as the combined summation of all previous drops since 1945. A critical question at this time is how can we shape the pandemic recovery towards sustainable, resilient pathways that will also preserve the nature that is essential to Vit Nam's future? While the challenges are undeniably daunting, we already have an array of promising options, some of which are already being implemented, others need new thinking and design.</p><p>  First, conservation and protection are essential measures to ensure the balance of nature. It is essential to enhance actions to create and maintain natural protected areas systems here in Vit Nam and around the world.</p><p> Vit Nam has been making significant efforts in establishing a comprehensive protected areas system with 16 marine protected areas, more than 126 terrestrial protected areas, 9 biosphere sites, and new wetland protected areas. UNDP provided support to the establishment of two new wetland protected areas of Thai Thu in Thai Banh in 2019 and today, on World Environment Day, we are delighted that Tam Giang-Cu Hai Lagoon in the central province of Tha Thian-Hu has been officially declared a protected area.</p><p> This is a commendable progress, but continued effort is needed to ensure effective management and development of the Protected Area system and to increase finance for biodiversity to bring about sustainable benefits for local communities and the economy of Vit Nam. Second, the acceleration of the transformation towards low-carbon and green economy is vital to ensure future sustainable development is within planetary boundaries.</p><p> Vit Nam has made significant efforts in introducing necessary policies for green growth, but everyone has a role to play. Whether directly or indirectly, our decisions all have an impact on nature, from the clothes we wear to the way in which we design and power our homes.</p><p> A shift towards sustainable production and consumption and lifestyles through raising awareness and promoting social norms on using environmentally friendly products is needed to change our behaviours toward environmental protection. The role of the private sector is paramount: if there is consumer demand for eco-friendly products and services, business must rise to meet the market.</p><p> Vit Nam is also endowed with significant exploitable renewable energy has major unused opportunities for energy savings. As Vit Nam is currently revising its 8th Power Development Plan and is preparing the next 10-year SEDS, the accelerating the deployment of full renewable energy potentials, especially solar and wind energy, and scaling up energy efficiency measures throughout all sectors of the economy will avoid future GHG emissions that is accelerating climate change and destroying vital ecosystems.</p><p> Solar energy and wind energy systemsinstalled on NaiLe Island in Trng Sa (Spratly) archipelago, Khanh Hoa Province.

For example, mangrove forests and wetland ecosystems have special roles in filtering pollution, supporting livelihoods for local communities, and protecting the infrastructure and lives of people who live in or near them.</p><p> In Vit Nam, 12 million hectares of wetlands nationwide provide primary livelihoods and additional income for around 20 million Vietnamese people, but they also act as storm surge buffer zones, carbon sinks and also work towards reducing saline intrusion prevention. UNDP, through its GCF coastal resilience project, is supporting the rehabilitating and regenerating 4,000 hectares of coastal mangroves to protect vulnerable communities whose lives and livelihoods are being impacted by the climate crisis.</p><p> Vit Nam has a history of living in harmony with nature that needs to be recognised and harnessed, and its ethnic minorities are keepers of an accumulation of valuable traditional knowledge and nature-based solutions that should be nurtured. As we move forward into the Decade of Restoration, it is time we look beyond merely coexisting with nature, to fully acknowledging our place in nature as part of a larger, harmonious whole.</p><p> Our health for current and future generations and the health of our planet depend on it.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["As Vit Nam is currently revising its 8th Power Development Plan and is preparing the next 10-year SEDS, the accelerating the deployment of full renewable energy potentials, especially solar and wind energy, and scaling up energy efficiency measures throughout all sectors of the economy will avoid future GHG emissions that is accelerating climate change and destroying vital ecosystems.

Although cities occupy only 2% of land area, they consume over two-thirds of the world's energy and account for over 70% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Cities are also the world's major growth engine, generating more than 80% of global GDP, while helping millions of people lift themselves out of extreme poverty.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Urban centers' share of emissions is only expected to grow, as urban areas accommodate 2.5 billion additional inhabitants by 2050 including rural-to-urban migrants in search of better livelihoods and quality of life -- or those who are forced to migrate due to  conflict and increasingly frequent climate disasters.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When planned for and managed well, urbanization contributes to economic growth and poverty alleviation, as well to sustainability and climate change mitigation. Unplanned growth, however, results in a proliferation of slums, congestion, pollution, lack of affordable housing, poor access to sanitation and waste management, and vulnerability to natural hazards, which are exacerbated by climate change.</p><p>An estimated 1 billion people live in informal settlements. In addition, the number of people affected by natural hazards tripled to two billion in the past decade - impacting the poor disproportionately. Global average annual losses from disasters in the built environment are now estimated at $314 billion and could rise to $415 billion by 2030, pushing 77 million more urban residents into poverty.</p><p>If managed well, the physical and economic density of cities can provide the impetus for technological change and infrastructure investments that support low-carbon development. The built environment of cities shapes the preference for public transit use, which is essential to reduce GHG emissions.</p><p>When cities grow vertically rather than sprawl horizontally, floor space per inhabitant increases, avoiding crowding while offering densities that justify public transport investments.</p><p>Retrofitting buildings to lower energy use and resource consumption, and redesigning cities to increase green spaces and promote walking and biking, will generate savings over time, create jobs and yield long-term climate benefits. In addition to enhancing livability and sustainability, investments in public spaces, sidewalks and bicycle lanes at the expense of vehicular (road and parking) space require relatively limited public outlays at a time where municipal revenues are constrained.</p><p>World Bank Strategy</p><p>As the world continues to urbanize, how cities are built and managed will determine the trajectory of GHG emissions. By making the right low-carbon investments and tackling deep-seated inequalities, especially in terms of access to land, housing, infrastructure and municipal services, governments and city leaders can avoid locking-in unsustainable infrastructure, create much-needed jobs and transform their economies so that they are more inclusive, resilient and sustainable.</p><p>The World Bank's work in urban development aims to support this objective, in line with the UN's Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11 to make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable as well as the World Bank's goals to end extreme poverty and boost shared prosperity. Transforming cities is a key component of the Bank's first Climate Change Action Plan (2016-2020) and forthcoming update covering 2021-2025.</p><p>The Bank works with countries to integrate or enhance low-carbon considerations into urban planning, policy and investment. This approach includes investments that improve urban air quality, promote green buildings, support solid-waste management and circular-economy approaches, and provide clean and active urban mobility, open green spaces and nature-based solutions for urban cooling, wastewater management and urban biodiversity.</p><p>Several partnerships and collaborative initiatives are also geared toward this common goal:</p><p> The World Bank and the European Investment Bank are implementing the?City Climate Finance Gap Fund, a new partnership supporting the development of a pipeline of climate-smart investment projects to enable green, inclusive, resilient, creative, and competitive cities in developing countries. Through donor support, technical assistance, and targeted finance of at least pound 100 million (approx. $117 million), the Gap Fund aims to unlock an estimated pound 4 billion ($4.7 billion) to help cities transform climate ambition into finance-ready projects.</p><p> The Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) is a global partnership and grant-funding mechanism managed by the World Bank, supporting disaster risk management projects worldwide and helping developing countries better understand and reduce their vulnerability to natural hazards and climate change. GFDRR works with over 400 local, national, regional, and international partners, to build resilience, by providing knowledge, funding, and technical assistance.</p><p> The?City Resilience Program (CRP)?- a partnership between the Bank and GFDRR - is a multi-donor initiative for mainstreaming risk considerations in planning and increasing financing for urban resilience. As a starting point for engaging with cities to support them in effectively planning for resilience, the CRP has delivered 55 City Scans which provide a series of maps, visualizations, and analysis which spatially lay out the city's risk information and the built environment.</p><p> The Bank's?Global Platform for Sustainable Cities?is a partnership and knowledge platform to promote integrated solutions and cutting-edge knowledge for cities seeking to improve their resilience and overall urban sustainability. It includes 28 cities across 11 countries that have received $151 million from the Global Environment Facility and leveraged $2.4 billion in project co-financing.</p><p>Recent World Bank analytical work in this area includes:</p><p> What a Waste 2.0: A Global Snapshot of Solid Waste Management to 2050</p><p> The Hidden Wealth of Cities: Creating, Financing, and Managing Public Spaces</p><p> The State of City Climate Finance Report</p><p> Greening Africa's Cities</p><p>Project Results:</p><p> Using low-cost digital tools, the Tanzania Urban Resilience Program,  a DfID-funded initiative jointly implemented by the World Bank and the Government of Tanzania, was able to conduct flood modelling for the city at a fraction of the cost and with greater accuracy than traditional surveys.  The program has also created an innovative Resilience Academy, where students learn practical digital skills while working to make their countries safer from climate change. Using drones and household surveys, students mapped the whole island of Zanzibar, for example.</p><p> The Mozambique Cities and Climate Change Project includes a stormwater drainage system whose 11 kilometers of canals and flood control systems to prevent the city from flooding, strengthening the city's resilience to weather-related hazards. Soon after cyclones Idai and Kenneth hit and affected millions of people, the port of Beira was back in operation and the city was cleaned up, partly thanks to this project which also includes solar-powered street lighting, which at one point was the only source of light in the city.</p><p> In Belize, the Bank supported the national government in developing and implementing the National Climate Resilient Investment Plan (NCRIP) through the Climate Resilient Infrastructure Project, which helped position the country to leverage additional climate financing from international financing institutions.</p><p> An estimated 10 million tons of CO2 emissions will be avoided over the next 20 years as a result of a World Bank-supported national waste management project in Azerbaijan. In addition to investments to improve the environmental conditions of the existing waste disposal sites in the capital city, including landfill gas capture, the project has supported measures to increase waste collection and reduce indiscriminatory dumping, the development of the National Waste Management Strategy, institutional and capacity building activities to improve operations, management, communication, data collection and planning.</p><p> In Eastern Caribbean countries, the Bank has mobilized over $200 million to enhance climate resilience and strategically reducing their vulnerability to climate change and disasters caused by natural hazards, including $83 million from the Strategic Climate Fund, and immediately following disasters (e.g., Saint Lucia Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project).</p><p> The Indonesia National Slum Upgrading Program  supports community-led planning and infrastructure delivery in 6,000 slums across the country. The project has mainstreamed disaster risk reduction at the community level, focusing on flood and fire prevention. About 1.5 million meters of drainage have been built through the project, in addition to improved road access for emergency vehicles. It has also scaled up its cash for works program, creating two million work days of employment benefiting 1,000 poor communities to support the country's post-COVID-19 recovery efforts.</p><p> The $120 million IDA-funded Sindh Resilience Project in Pakistan helped mitigate flood and drought risks in selected areas and strengthened the Government of Sindh's capacity to manage natural disasters. About 3.3 million people across the province have benefitted from project interventions till date.</p><p> The $784 million Sustainable Cities Program in Turkey is working with diverse municipalities in mainstreaming sustainability and climate and disaster resilience in both city planning and a range of sustainable city infrastructure needed to mitigate and adapt to climate change, such as stormwater, emergency response, solid waste, renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable urban transport, and social amenities. The Turkish government is also looking to scale up ways to enhance the resilience of cities. With World Bank support, the government carried out three citywide disaster and climate risk assessments to identify key infrastructure and housing that require urban resilience investments - such as housing retrofitting, drainage improvements, public space, and social infrastructure, among others.</p><p> The Scaling-up Urban Upgrading Project in Vietnam's Mekong Delta Region has brought innovations to urban upgrading approaches through mainstreaming green infrastructure and universal accessibility in its sub-investments financed under the project. The region is highly impacted by climate change and suffers from intense flooding along with other major natural disasters, and also is known for its high incidence of disabilities, mobility challenges and a lack of accessibility, which is gaining importance in the context of its rapidly aging population. In consultation with the national and local governments, a series of hands-on technical assistance on green infrastructure and universal accessibility was offered to clients over the course of three years: improvement for investment designs in roads, canals, resettlement sites, development of Green Infrastructure and Universal Accessibility Design Guidelines for national-scale application and through a series of training courses for Government officials.</p>", "publisher": "Vietnam News Gazette", "instances": ["Transforming cities is a key component of the Bank's first Climate Change Action Plan (2016-2020) and forthcoming update covering 2021-2025.
