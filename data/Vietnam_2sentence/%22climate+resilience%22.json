They also agreed to accelerate the implementation of the ASEAN Community Vision 2045 and associated strategies, calling on all ASEAN sectoral bodies to identify priorities and translate high-level directions into concrete actions.</p><p>Particular emphasis was placed on enhancing intra-regional trade and investment, facilitating trade, expanding connectivity in infrastructure, energy grids, digital networks and diversifying external partnerships.

This involves deepening intra-regional economic integration and effectively implementing the upgraded ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), while leveraging existing FTAs with partners and expanding inter-regional linkages, particularly through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). ASEAN should also capitalise on e-commerce to unlock internal trade potential and expand into new markets and supply chains.</p><p>Second, ASEAN should accelerate negotiations on a Digital Economy Framework Agreement that meets real-world needs, especially for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises. New growth drivers like digital transformation and innovation ecosystems should be embedded into ASEAN's cooperation frameworks with external partners to attract resources and technical support. These efforts must also be reflected in ASEAN's own programmes and subregional cooperation initiatives. As Chair of the ASEAN Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Task Force, Viet Nam will coordinate the implementation of these initiatives under the next IAI Work Plan.</p><p>Third, ASEAN must deepen its engagement with the people. Beyond high-level declarations, ASEAN's presence must be felt through concrete and meaningful actions.

Viet Nam will soon develop a national implementation plan for ASEAN's strategic 2045 documents to bring ASEAN closer to its citizens, businesses, and localities.</p><p>Son also reaffirmed Viet Nam's support for Timor-Leste's accession to ASEAN and its readiness to assist the country in fulfilling membership criteria, including participation in legal instruments.

However, few may realise that over 44 per cent of the city's total land area remains agricultural - a significant advantage if harnessed through proper planning and strategic development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Nguyen Xu\u00e2n Dai, director of the H\u00e0 Noi Department of Agriculture and Environment, the city has for many years pursued a comprehensive restructuring of its agricultural sector along the principles of 'green - efficient - sustainable'. In this approach, agriculture is no longer viewed solely as an economic activity, but also as a cornerstone of environmental protection, food security and ecological balance within the city.</p><p>Restructuring production zones is not merely about rearranging farmland. It represents a broader strategy to preserve soil and water resources, safeguard natural habitats, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve resilience to climate change. In recent years, H\u00e0 Noi has achieved positive results in this direction, especially in crop and livestock production.</p><p>Crop cultivation has undergone a transformation toward organic and high-tech methods. The city currently has over 523 hectares of vegetables grown under organic or near-organic practices, achieving average yields of 50 tonnes per hectare per year, 15-20 per cent higher than conventional methods. In addition, 908 hectares of vegetable farms now apply high-tech solutions such as greenhouse systems and drip irrigation, helping to improve product quality while conserving natural resources.</p><p>In the livestock sector, H\u00e0 Noi has adopted circular farming practices that emphasise emission reductions and environmental safety. Many farms operate with closed-loop barn systems, automated feeding technologies, and biological waste treatment measures.</p><p>Notably, 95 per cent of large-scale pig farms use biogas systems, while 65 per cent of livestock facilities apply biological agents to treat waste. These innovations help ensure compliance with technical standards while supporting the transition away from small-scale backyard farming in densely populated areas.</p><p>H\u00e0 Noi is also developing a model of urban agriculture that integrates high-tech farming with experiential tourism in peri-urban areas. This is part of the city's broader strategy to transform agricultural land in urbanising zones into smart ecological spaces - enhancing local food production, boosting farmers' incomes, and meeting the consumption demands of a growing urban population.</p><p>According to B\u00f9i Van S\u00e1ng, Party Secretary of Tam Hung Commune, his commune, under the two-tier local governance model, is not only expanding in terms of population and land area but also possesses great potential for the development of green, ecological and circular agriculture.</p><p>With its deep-rooted farming traditions, the commune is well-positioned to establish specialised production areas for vegetables, ornamental plants, fruit trees, and aquaculture. The local government is restructuring its agricultural space with a focus on concentrated, eco-friendly, and high-tech models, while enhancing land-use management and aligning planning with socio-economic development.</p><p>In Hong V\u00e2n Commune, local authorities are leveraging the area's natural advantages to promote agriculture as part of the cultural and tourism fabric.</p><p>L\u00ea Tuan Dung, Chairman of the People's Committee of Hong V\u00e2n, emphasised that the commune was already a recognised tourism destination and had developed flower-lined roads and green corridors that support agri-tourism models. These initiatives catered to the tastes of urban residents and aligned with global trends in sustainable tourism.</p><p>Agriculture in Hong V\u00e2n is seen not only as a productive sector but also as a key element in shaping the landscape, preserving cultural identity, and laying the 'ecological foundation' for integrated development in tourism, services, and culture, according to the chairman.</p><p>The commune's strategy focuses on three main pillars: restructuring cultivation zones toward organic and circular models; developing experiential tourism destinations; and building value chains for local agricultural products tied to regional branding.</p><p>Nguyen Manh Quyen, Vice Chairman of the H\u00e0 Noi People's Committee, emphasized that the city was aligning its green agricultural zoning efforts with key legal and strategic frameworks.</p><p>These include the Capital Law, passed by the National Assembly on June 28, 2024, and Decision No. 1668/QD-TTg dated December 27, 2024, issued by the Prime Minister to approve adjustments to H\u00e0 Noi's General Planning toward 2045 with a vision to 2065.</p><p>Based on these frameworks, H\u00e0 Noi has reviewed, adjusted, and supplemented designated zones for crop cultivation, livestock farming, and aquaculture to better reflect real-world conditions, according to Quyen. The capital is re-establishing its ecological spatial system, positioning agriculture as a form of green infrastructure - serving both as a food belt and an ecological buffer zone.</p><p>It is clear that H\u00e0 Noi's agricultural restructuring, integrated with green zoning and the ecological urban strategy, is a necessary pathway to ensure agricultural economic development, maintain ecological landscapes, improve quality of life and strengthen climate resilience.</p><p>The city has set a target for the 2030-2045 period: to become a fully green urban area with ecological agriculture forming the backbone of an interconnected system that sustainably unites land, people, and nature.</p><p>According to Director Nguyen Xu\u00e2n Dai, H\u00e0 Noi is restructuring agricultural production across all sectors. In crop cultivation, the city will optimise land use, adopt advanced technologies and develop high-value products. Irrigation-challenged rice fields will be converted to more economically viable crops, and focus will be placed on crop varieties and technologies suitable for the unique conditions of peri-urban soils.</p><p>In livestock, H\u00e0 Noi will continue developing strategic zones for concentrated animal farming. The city is reviewing plans to establish large-scale livestock areas in rapidly urbanising districts, while phasing out small-scale operations in residential zones. In compliance with Resolution No. 02/2020/NQ-HDND of the H\u00e0 Noi People's Council, H\u00e0 Noi is ending livestock farming in certain areas and supporting the relocation of facilities located in restricted zones.</p><p>Aquaculture is also being developed along sustainable lines, with a focus on high productivity and quality. H\u00e0 Noi's strategy includes the protection of aquatic ecosystems, environmental safeguards, climate change adaptation, disease prevention, environmental monitoring, and food safety from the outset of production.</p><p>Simultaneously, the city is integrating green, clean, and sustainable agricultural methods into training programs that link theoretical learning with local practice - helping farmers improve their knowledge, technical skills and capacity to participate in the new agricultural economy.</p><p>Regional zoning tied to green agricultural development is a timely and strategic initiative for H\u00e0 Noi in the face of new challenges. Beyond enhancing production efficiency and ensuring food safety, this approach fosters the creation of ecological zones, improves living conditions and contributes directly to the city's broader goal of sustainable urban development.</p><p>With forward-looking vision and methodical implementation, H\u00e0 Noi is steadily shaping a new agricultural identity that is modern, environmentally responsible and rich in potential.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["Based on these frameworks, H\u00e0 Noi has reviewed, adjusted, and supplemented designated zones for crop cultivation, livestock farming, and aquaculture to better reflect real-world conditions, according to Quyen.

Viet Nam joined the Colombo Plan in 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Jessep noted, these connections are strengthened through educational exchanges, capacity-building programmes, short-term work opportunities and professional networks that foster mutual understanding and respect. The fact that around 40,000 New Zealanders visited Viet Nam in 2024 alone reflects the growing interest in the Southeast Asian nation.</p><p>According to Jessep, shared values and multilateral cooperation have also significantly advanced the bilateral partnership.</p><p>\"Both Viet Nam and New Zealand are active participants in regional and global institutions. We share a strong commitment to international law, an open and rules-based trading system and regional peace and stability,\" she said, adding that these shared values have helped shape collaboration and build strategic trust.</p><p>The Asia New Zealand Foundation has maintained a long-standing and close partnership with the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, which Jessep described as \"one of our most valued partnerships,\" allowing both sides to exchange perspectives and learn from each other's experiences.</p><p>Trade is another key driver in the relationship, supported by natural economic complementarities. New Zealand exports high-quality dairy, fruit, timber and processed foods, while Viet Nam supplies electronics, machinery, footwear and textiles.</p><p>\"This provides a strong foundation for continued trade growth and mutual benefit - especially at a time of deep disruption to the international trading system,\" Jessep said.</p><p>She also pointed to growing cooperation in areas like defence and maritime security. The 2023 port calls by New Zealand Navy vessels HMNZS Te Mana and HMNZS Aotearoa demonstrated a shared interest in upholding regional stability and a rules-based maritime order.</p><p>Looking to the future, Jessep expects several dynamics will shape the next phase of cooperation.

That research shows that over two-thirds of New Zealanders now see Viet Nam as important to New Zealand's future, and half view Viet Nam as a friend of New Zealand - an increase of eight percentage points between November 2023 and 2024 alone. Despite these increasingly positive feelings, there is still a lot of potential to scale up engagement, according to the executive director.</p><p>Despite this progress, Jessep acknowledged that some practical challenges remain. \"The long distance and limited direct flights can make travel more expensive for business and tourism. Visa processing could be streamlined further. There is still more work to be done to familiarise sector leaders with each other's market conditions and rules to build confidence,\" she said.</p><p>In terms of solutions, Jessep believes that deepening practical connections and knowledge sharing among post-graduate students, scientists, businesspeople, and government officials will be the key. \"More people-to-people exchange programmes, including professional development and industry-specific partnerships, will help us build greater familiarity,\" she suggested.</p><p>On a broader scale, she expressed optimism about the potential for expanded cooperation both bilaterally and in multilateral forums. Fields such as digital technology, high-tech agriculture, climate action and the blue economy offer significant opportunities. She also praised the Vietnamese community in New Zealand, particularly those in tech and business, for serving as a cultural and commercial bridge.</p><p>Programmes such as the Asia New Zealand Foundation's Young Business Leaders Initiative, backed by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, help connect young entrepreneurs from both countries and develop a group of innovators with shared values and professional networks.</p><p>Jessep underlined that both internal and external factors will shape the relationship in the years ahead.</p><p>Domestically, she stressed the importance of continued government support and active engagement from the private sector and civil society.

Vietnam joined the Colombo Plan in 2003.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Jessep noted, these connections are strengthened through educational exchanges, capacity-building programmes, short-term work opportunities, and professional networks that foster mutual understanding and respect. The fact that around 40,000 New Zealanders visited Vietnam in 2024 alone reflects the growing interest in the Southeast Asian nation. According to Jessep, shared values and multilateral cooperation have also significantly advanced the bilateral partnership. 'Both Vietnam and New Zealand are active participants in regional and global institutions. We share a strong commitment to international law, an open and rules-based trading system, and regional peace and stability,' she said. These shared values, she added, have helped shape collaboration and build strategic trust.</p><p>The Asia New Zealand Foundation has maintained a long-standing and close partnership with the Diplomatic Academy of Vietnam, which, Jessep described as 'one of our most valued partnerships,' allowing both sides to exchange perspectives and learn from each other's experiences.</p><p>Trade is another key driver in the relationship, supported by natural economic complementarities. New Zealand exports high-quality dairy, fruit, timber and processed foods, while Vietnam supplies electronics, machinery, footwear and textiles. 'This provides a strong foundation for continued trade growth and mutual benefit - especially at a time of deep disruption to the international trading system,' Jessep said.</p><p>She also pointed to growing cooperation in areas such as defence and maritime security. The 2023 port calls by New Zealand Navy vessels HMNZS Te Mana and HMNZS Aotearoa demonstrated a shared interest in upholding regional stability and a rules-based maritime order.</p><p>Looking to the future, Jessep expects several dynamics will shape the next phase of cooperation. Vietnam's economic dynamism and regional leadership, coupled with New Zealand's strategic priority of deepening engagement in Asia, are key factors. She also highlighted emerging areas for future collaboration such as green technology, agricultural technology and green energy for climate resilience.</p><p>For 28 years, the Asia New Zealand Foundation has been tracking New Zealanders' perceptions of Asia. That research shows that over two-thirds of New Zealanders now see Vietnam as important to New Zealand's future, and half view Vietnam as a friend of New Zealand - an increase of 8 percentage points between November 2023 and 2024 alone. Despite these increasingly positive feelings, there is still a lot of potential to scale up our engagement, according to the Executive Director.</p><p>Despite the progress, Jessep acknowledged some practical challenges remain. 'The long distance and limited direct flights can make travel more expensive for business and tourism. Visa processing could be streamlined more. There is still more work to be done for familiarising sector leaders with each other's market conditions and rules to build confidence,\" she said.</p><p>In terms of solutions, Jessep believes that deepening practical connections and knowledge sharing among post-graduate students, scientists, businesspeople, and government officials will be the key. 'More people-to-people exchange programmes, including professional development and industry-specific partnerships, will help us build greater familiarity,' she suggested.</p><p>On a broader scale, she expressed optimism about the potential for expanded cooperation both bilaterally and in multilateral forums. Fields such as digital technology, high-tech agriculture, climate action and the blue economy offer significant opportunities. She also praised the Vietnamese community in New Zealand, particularly those in tech and business, for serving as a cultural and commercial bridge.</p><p>Programmes such as the Asia New Zealand Foundation's Young Business Leaders Initiative, backed by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, help connect young entrepreneurs from both countries and develop a group of innovators with shared values and professional networks.</p><p>Jessep underlined that both internal and external factors will shape the relationship in the years ahead.</p><p>Domestically, she stressed the importance of continued government support and active engagement from the private sector and civil society. Externally, regional stability and the two countries' relations with major powers will also influence the depth and pace of cooperation.</p><p>'Vietnam and New Zealand have a lot to learn from each other. It is a challenging time for small and middle-sized powers, and the more we're able to share experiences, support each other and collaborate, the better,' she said.</p><p>On the recent upgrade of ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, Jessep noted that the new framework reflects deep mutual trust, shared values and long-term commitment. 'It provides a structured framework for our two countries to expand cooperation across key areas such as trade, security, innovation, and people-to-people links, and to resolve issues and develop solutions faster,' she explained.</p><p>For businesses, the upgraded relationship signals long-term government backing, which can encourage larger investments and partnerships. For New Zealand exporters, it also creates opportunities to boost market engagement through clearer government support and enhanced diplomatic facilitation, she added.</p>", "publisher": "Vietnam Plus", "instances": ["Looking to the future, Jessep expects several dynamics will shape the next phase of cooperation.

We're very grateful to the Government of Viet Nam for hosting it.</p><p>From IFAD's perspective, what we think we can commit to is we have a lot of experience in how to ensure you build resilient and inclusive food systems.</p><p>If you want food security, if you want sustainable food systems, you also very much need to include small farmers.</p><p>When you look at places like Asia, even more of it is produced by small farmers, so ensuring that the voice and the perspectives of small farmers and rural communities are part of this discussion, bringing our experiences is our key contribution.</p><p>In IFAD, we talk about the first mile. What we mean is that development starts with the small farmers in the first mile. What we try and do is make sure the first mile and their voice is involved in that side of things.</p><p>The other thing that we bring is IFAD has a particular type of partnership, which we think is very relevant.</p><p>You may have heard internationally, people talk about the 3Ps - Public Private Partnership. IFAD talks about the 4Ps - Public Private Producer Partnership. Those 4Ps for us is crucial, ensuring the producer is part of that Public Private Partnership.</p><p>How does IFAD see the role of 4Ps in transforming food systems, especially in developing countries like Viet Nam?</p><p>In a country like Viet Nam, with a very strong Government, with a very vibrant and growing private sector, you could see a lot of progress around food.</p><p>Much of Viet Nam's agriculture comes from small farmers. You need to ensure that small farmers are also at the centre of food systems in Viet Nam.</p><p>We believe very much in inclusive development, so that everyone benefits, targeting the poorer households and ensuring they benefit from this.</p><p>One of key P4G cooperation areas is climate-resilience smart agriculture. How do you define the agricultural innovation? Could you give us some examples and some experience that is applicable in Viet Nam?</p><p>In a country like Viet Nam, innovation is very important, trying to ensure that that there is the cutting edge technology to improve agriculture.</p><p>Part of what IFAD's role is to bring ideas, innovations that we've seen in other countries. As a global organisation, one of IFAD's advantages is we can share experiences across countries.</p><p>Some examples would be things like the use of digital solutions in Viet Nam. Working on things like mobile applications, for example, to guide irrigation and fertiliser use, we call it precision agriculture, so you can be much more precise with your management of these resources.</p><p>It means you do not waste the resources, but things like fertiliser is expensive, so for small farmers, if they're going to use fertiliser, you want to make it the most efficient use possible.</p><p>Having apps that have analysed the soil health and tell you exactly which sort of fertiliser to use where. For example, the fertiliser treatment in one place can be very different 100m away, so it allows that precision.</p><p>By taking experiences from other countries, bringing them in here and also taking experiences from Viet Nam, you have some very interesting experiences in Viet Nam and taking them to other countries.</p><p>What challenges does Viet Nam's agriculture face towards ensuring climate-resilient smart agriculture?</p><p>The challenge for Viet Nam is balancing fast growth with sustainable growth, particularly with the management of your natural resources and the environment, so that you can use the land, the resources you have, use the water in Viet Nam well, for very good growth.</p><p>The challenge for Viet Nam is to get that balance between strong agricultural production and at the same time supporting the environment.</p><p>It's even more important with climate change. We saw with the recent typhoon here, climate change is real. You need to make farming more resilient and that's where you need to protect your resources.</p><p>I think my concern in Viet Nam is to get the balance right, which is why many of the new projects coming from IFAD are looking at climate resilient agriculture and strengthening climate resilience, more generally, to look after the natural resources.</p><p>Most farmers in Viet Nam are small households. This year's P4G theme is 'Sustainable and People-Centred Green Transition'. What do small farming households in Viet Nam need the most for themselves to be positioned as the centre of Viet Nam's sustainable agriculture?</p><p>It's not just particular to Viet Nam, but small farmers, rural communities need a number of things.</p><p>They are some of the poorest, so they need access to appropriate technologies, as we've just been talking about innovations that work for small farmers, not for big farmers and that are also cheap because they don't have the resources.</p><p>They need access to new and improved seed technologies</p><p>They need support in strengthening the organisations. Strengthening farmer organisations, strengthening cooperatives is an important part of our work, because the more organised they can get, the better they can produce, but also the better price they can get for their products and also links to markets.</p><p>If you're a small farmer, you will become very difficult to link your products to an export market where you get a good price. But if you work through a cooperative, the cooperative can act as an intermediary, not only in organising the inputs, but in organising the marketing.</p><p>The next important area is access to infrastructure. I know that's a big priority for the Government.</p><p>You often have big irrigation projects, big road projects, but small farmers and rural communities that IFAD serves are often quite remote.</p><p>What we try and do is connect them to the bigger infrastructure projects - we call it tertiary or feeder roads.</p><p>The last important area is rural finance. Farmers, particularly small farmers, find it very difficult to access finance. Everyone needs finance. Small farmers need finance to pay for inputs, to pay for improvements, to pay for equipment.</p><p>And the world over, it's often difficult for small farmers to access finance, so we look at specific schemes that help small farmers to access finance.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["We saw with the recent typhoon here, climate change is real.

Only around 25 per cent of Vietnamese exporters are familiar with sustainable trade finance tools, limiting adoption. Regulatory gaps persist, as Viet Nam lacks comprehensive guidelines for sustainable trade finance, unlike the EU.</p><p>Despite these hurdles, green financial products including green bonds have gained attention. In 2023, green bond issuance reached S$1 billion, highlighting strong expansion potential. Technological advances such as blockchain are also improving transparency, while 40 per cent of Vietnamese banks have begun integrating ESG into lending practices, to support sustainable trade.</p><p>EuroCham and partners like IFC are providing technical and financial support to expand the use of green trade finance products and develop local capacity. EuroCham recommends expanding green instruments like sustainable letters of credit and insurance products, while also building a national green export strategy.</p><p>\"Viet Nam can base its criteria on the EU's green taxonomy and learn from Singapore's Green and Sustainable Trade Finance Framework (GTF),\" EuroCham suggested.</p><p>The group also called for tax incentives, subsidies or preferential interest rates for major banks to promote digital platforms and green fintech applications that align with export growth and job creation.</p><p>Green bonds and investor confidence</p><p>To fill the investment gap, green bonds are gaining traction.

At UNESCO, this must be reflected not only in how we set priorities, but in how we listen, collaborate and lead together.</p><p>I don't believe in a world of competing blocs. I believe in a world of shared responsibility. Inclusivity isn't about drawing lines between North and South, East and West - it's about building a more balanced centre. That is what UNESCO must be: a meeting point for ideas, experiences and solutions that reflect the richness of our global diversity.</p><p>If entrusted with the role of Director-General, I am committed to creating a culture of active listening and genuine co-creation. That's why I've pledged to engage in discussions with all Member States within my first 100 days in office - not simply as a symbolic gesture, but to listen, learn and open channels for long-term cooperation. Asia, with its many voices and perspectives, has a central role to play in shaping UNESCO's future - not as a peripheral actor, but as a core architect of the multilateral system we need today.</p><p>Your campaign slogan is 'UNESCO for the People'. What does that mean in practice, and how would you bring it to life if elected?</p><p>'UNESCO for the People' is more than a slogan - it is a vision. It reflects my firm belief that UNESCO must be deeply connected to the lives, hopes and realities of the communities it serves. And this vision aligns closely with the spirit I witnessed in Viet Nam: a country where education, culture and community are not abstract ideals, but lived commitments.</p><p>To realise this vision, I will focus on strengthening UNESCO's presence and impact at the local level - starting with empowering our field and regional offices. These offices are closest to the people and best positioned to understand the real needs on the ground. Viet Nam has shown the world how community-based heritage preservation and education reforms can inspire national pride and sustainable growth. That's the kind of locally rooted success UNESCO must support and scale globally.</p><p>I also see digital technology as a key ally. In a country like Viet Nam - dynamic, young and increasingly tech-driven - we have enormous potential to use digital tools to connect, listen and act more quickly. By making sure knowledge flows from the field to UNESCO headquarters and back, we can respond more effectively to real-world challenges.</p><p>Finally, 'UNESCO for the People' means speaking with people, not just about them. We must communicate more clearly, more openly - especially with young people. That means celebrating local stories, listening to communities and ensuring that UNESCO is not just an international institution, but a partner in people's lives.</p><p>UNESCO has a wide mission-from protecting heritage to promoting education and science. How would you help the organisation become more proactive and impactful in these areas?</p><p>UNESCO's broad mandate is not a weakness - it's a unique strength. Education, culture, science and information are not separate silos; they are deeply interconnected pillars that serve one shared goal: building peace and resilience by shaping minds, empowering communities and preserving humanity's common legacy.</p><p>Viet Nam understands this better than most. From its commitment to inclusive education and scientific innovation, to its leadership in safeguarding intangible cultural heritage, Viet Nam has shown how integrated, community-driven approaches can make global principles locally meaningful.</p><p>To make UNESCO more impactful, we must first ensure these areas work in harmony - guided by a shared strategy, supported by strong partnerships and aligned with national priorities. I believe the organisation must also strengthen its place within the broader United Nations system, becoming a more agile and collaborative actor for sustainable development.</p><p>A key part of this is reinforcing UNESCO's financial foundation. We need to diversify how we mobilise resources - reaching beyond traditional donors to engage private sector actors, philanthropic foundations and civil society. And we need more flexible funding - resources that can support long-term priorities and adapt to urgent needs, not just pre-defined projects.</p><p>But funding is only one side of the equation. The other is trust. That's why I will prioritise transparency, efficiency and clear impact. People - including the people of Viet Nam - must be able to see how their support for UNESCO translates into real outcomes: schools that are more inclusive, heritage sites that are protected and revitalised and scientific knowledge that serves climate resilience.</p><p>As an Egyptologist and former Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, how has your background shaped your leadership style and vision for UNESCO?</p><p>I started my career as a tour guide, so promoting culture has always been at the heart of my work. That's where my connection with UNESCO began -- in front of the Abu Simbel temples, which were saved from destruction thanks to a global campaign led by UNESCO. For me, that moment captured what UNESCO is all about: protecting heritage so it can be shared, understood and passed on.</p><p>Later, as Minister of Tourism and Antiquities, I carried that same conviction into public service. I led a sector with over 2,000 archaeological sites, 40 museums and a tourism industry employing over one million Egyptians. We merged two ministries into one to align heritage preservation with economic development, introduced performance-based planning and launched major projects like the Grand Egyptian Museum. We also built new funding models and expanded access to culture through digital platforms - not just to increase visibility, but to involve communities and reach wider audiences, including educators and people with disabilities.</p><p>This experience shaped a leadership style rooted in proximity, accountability and results. At UNESCO, I would bring that same approach - reform-minded, focused on impact and grounded in the realities of the field.</p><p>If you had one message for the people of Viet Nam, especially the younger generation, what would it be?</p><p>Viet Nam is a key partner for Egypt, and I was deeply impressed by the country's dynamism and openness to the world. If I were to offer one message to Viet Nam's younger generation, it would be this: do not hesitate to think ambitiously about your role in shaping the future. Viet Nam is a country of resilience, culture and innovation. You are at the heart of a new era - one where the wisdom of your history blends with the energy of your youth. As a nation, you have so much to offer the world, and UNESCO can be the platform where your voice, your values and your aspirations are heard. Your youth - creative, driven and full of potential - are the key to shaping the future, and UNESCO can be the partner that amplifies your ideas, energy and dreams.</p><p>Together, we can ensure that the next generation of Vietnamese leaders isn't just prepared to face the future but is leading it. If elected Director-General, I will ensure that UNESCO works closely with Viet Nam to help realise your vision for a more sustainable, inclusive and connected world.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["The other is trust.

This marks a nine-fold increase since 2015, with an average annual growth rate of nearly 100 per cent. Medium and long-term loans account for 77 per cent of this total green debt.</p><p>Green credit is primarily directed to renewable energy (47 per cent), green agriculture (32 per cent), clean water (11 per cent), and forestry. Despite this growth, the scale remains modest compared to the capital needed for a comprehensive green transformation.</p><p>Deputy Governor of the SBV D\u00e0o Minh T\u00fa said that many banks have begun building internal frameworks to manage environmental and social risks, supported by green capital sources and international technical assistance.</p><p>\"The SBV will continue improving the legal framework to promote green credit and integrate ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) factors across the banking system,\" he said.</p><p>According to the SBV, 80-90 per cent of commercial banks have adopted ESG criteria in some form, while nearly 50 per cent have established environmental risk management departments.

Only around 25 per cent of Vietnamese exporters are familiar with sustainable trade finance tools, limiting adoption. Regulatory gaps persist, as Viet Nam lacks comprehensive guidelines for sustainable trade finance, unlike the EU.</p><p>Despite these hurdles, green financial products including green bonds have gained attention. In 2023, green bond issuance reached S$1 billion, highlighting strong expansion potential. Technological advances such as blockchain are also improving transparency, while 40 per cent of Vietnamese banks have begun integrating ESG into lending practices, to support sustainable trade.</p><p>EuroCham and partners like IFC are providing technical and financial support to expand the use of green trade finance products and develop local capacity. EuroCham recommends expanding green instruments like sustainable letters of credit and insurance products, while also building a national green export strategy.</p><p>\"Viet Nam can base its criteria on the EU's green taxonomy and learn from Singapore's Green and Sustainable Trade Finance Framework (GTF),\" EuroCham suggested.</p><p>The group also called for tax incentives, subsidies or preferential interest rates for major banks to promote digital platforms and green fintech applications that align with export growth and job creation.</p><p>Green bonds and investor confidence</p><p>To fill the investment gap, green bonds are gaining traction.

Benjamin is an experienced pharmaceutical executive who has over 20 years of experience in the pharmaceutical space working in roles of increasing responsibilities over various cities like Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong (China) and most recently Dubai. As Viet Nam experiences an era of national rise, he is committed to supporting the government's push to advance healthcare and meet patient needs by bringing Takeda's life-transforming medicine and vaccine portfolio to the Vietnamese population.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Viet Nam News reporter Nguyen Diep speaks with Benjamin Ping about his leadership approach of fostering innovation and collaboration aimed at ensuring Takeda's positive impactful presence in Viet Nam's healthcare landscape, as well as bringing meaningful improvements in patient care across the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Welcome to Viet Nam at your new role as General Manager of Takeda Vietnam. We would like to first understand what inspired you to join the country team, and what are your initial impressions of the country?</p><p>On a personal basis, having visited Viet Nam many times in the past, the culture, people and food were something I could relate to. In addition, as a Singaporean who has been based overseas over the past three years, coming back to Southeast Asia was similar to coming home.</p><p>On a professional perspective, Viet Nam's economic development and growth have been nothing short of astounding and the opportunity to be part of this growth and bringing Takeda's portfolio of innovative medical and vaccines to its population was very attractive.</p><p>As I read more into Viet Nam's culture, Viet Nam's bamboo trees highly resonated with me, symbolising resilience, strength, and adaptability-a reflection of both the country's spirit and our corporate philosophy.</p><p>In my view, bamboo represents the strong foundation of values akin to its roots, the pivotal role of our people comparable to its sturdy trunk, and strategic flexibility much like its bending branches. This metaphor encapsulates the essence of how I envision leading Takeda Vietnam, ensuring we remain rooted in our core mission and values while adapting to evolving healthcare needs.</p><p>What is Takeda's corporate philosophy from your perspective?</p><p>Takeda has a strong foundation for delivering long-term value and our philosophy is passed down through generations.</p><p>Our history began in 1781 with the sale of traditional Japanese and Chinese medicines in Japan, guided by the principle of SANPO-YOSHI. A principle first practiced by a prominent group of Japanese merchants, it means good for the seller, good for the buyer and good for society. Our successive CEOs have remained true to SANPO-YOSHI in both word and action for more than 240 years while articulating their own way to bring it to life.</p><p>Today, Takeda's corporate philosophy articulates why we exist (our purpose), where we are going (our vision) and how we deliver on our vision (our values). Our corporate philosophy imperatives - Patient, People and Planet - bring our corporate philosophy to life and guides where Takeda must invest to deliver on our purpose.</p><p>More importantly, we cannot do this alone, thus Takeda looks to work with relevant stakeholders in Viet Nam to bring these imperatives to fruition, ensuring that we continue the principles of SANPO-YOSHI by bringing values to the country, its people and Takeda.</p><p>How does Takeda's global corporate philosophy guide your commitments to patients, and how is this philosophy implemented in Viet Nam?</p><p>Takeda's global corporate philosophy is centred around our commitment to delivering life-transforming treatments to patients. We prioritise patient-centric innovation, ensuring that our drug and vaccine development processes are aligned with the needs of patients.</p><p>In Viet Nam, we tailor this philosophy to address local health challenges by enhancing access to our innovative therapies in rare diseases, oncology, neuroscience, plasma-derived therapies and vaccine. For instance, the introduction of dengue vaccine in the country exemplifies our commitment to addressing vector-borne diseases exacerbated by climate change.</p><p>Another key area of focus for Takeda is ensuring patient's access to healthcare, medicines and vaccines; this is where Takeda has introduced tiered pricing of our products. At its heart, Tiered Pricing is a framework designed to differentiate price levels based on a country's economic development and health care system maturity.</p><p>Takeda places significant emphasis on people within its corporate philosophy. How does this translate into strategies for employee development and diversity in Viet Nam?</p><p>At Takeda, we believe that our people are our greatest asset, and our corporate philosophy reflects this through our commitment to fostering a culture of life-long learning, diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I).</p><p>Takeda people live our values every day which are guided by Takeda-ism, that incorporates Integrity, Fairness, Honesty and Perseverance, with Integrity at the core. They are brought to life through actions based on Patient-Trust- Reputation-Business, in that order.</p><p>To me, the last three words \"in that order\" are very powerful and truly reflect how we prioritise patients in our decision making at Takeda, and which is something I proudly remind the team regularly.</p><p>Every employee, wherever they are in the organisation, has a responsibility to meet the highest standards of ethical behavior at all times because everything we do impacts the most vital aspect of people's lives - their health.</p><p>Planet is also a key pillar of Takeda's corporate philosophy. Can you elaborate on Takeda's sustainability goals and how they are adapted to the Vietnamese context?</p><p>Takeda's commitment to environmental sustainability is reflected in our ambitious goals to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our operations by 2035 and across our value chain by 2040. We integrate environmental considerations into product development and operations through initiatives like the Sustainability by Design programme.</p><p>For example, Takeda is committed to scaling its Plasma-Derived Therapies (PDT) business while reducing its environmental footprint. Notable achievements include opening a zero-GHG emissions BioLife donation center in Linz, Austria, and significant reductions in emissions, water consumption, and energy use across U.S. BioLife centres.</p><p>In Viet Nam, we are aligning our local strategies with these global goals by assessing options to reduce our environmental footprint across the country's value chain. The deployment of the dengue vaccine is an example of how we are addressing health issues linked to climate change. By collaborating with the Vietnamese government and local partners, we aim to contribute to national solutions for climate resilience and environmental sustainability. Takeda's office was also specifically selected as it met both LEED (Leadership in energy and environmental design) and WELL (supporting health and well-being of its tenants).</p><p>We hear a lot about Takeda digital dexterity. Could you explain this concept and how does Takeda leverage data, digital, and technology to enhance its operations and patient engagement globally, and what are the specific applications in Viet Nam?</p><p>Takeda is at the forefront of harnessing data, digital, and technology to drive innovation and improve patient outcomes. Our global digital transformation initiatives include virtual clinical trials, AI-driven drug discovery, and digital patient support programmes. These efforts are designed to increase accessibility and diversity in clinical research while optimising our operations.</p><p>In Viet Nam, we are applying these technologies to enhance patient engagement and support. For example, we are exploring and applying digital tools to provide educational resources and personalised support to patients, ensuring they can manage their health effectively.</p><p>By leveraging technology, we aim to create a seamless experience for patients and healthcare providers, ultimately improving health outcomes in the region and Viet Nam.</p><p>In addition, we are exploring various digital tools to augment our employees to do their work more efficiently and productively so that they can focus on more value-added work to better serve patients.</p>", "publisher": "Viet Nam News", "instances": ["In Viet Nam, we are aligning our local strategies with these global goals by assessing options to reduce our environmental footprint across the country's value chain.

Passing of Party General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">General Secretary Nguyen Phu Trong passed away on July 19, leaving a legacy of invaluable thought and theory on Vietnam's revolutionary path. His dedication to the nation and people earned him respect from Vietnamese and international communities alike. His life exemplified the virtues of studying and following the ideology, morality, and style of President Ho Chi Minh, inspiring future generations to strive for Vietnam's development and uphold its revolutionary ideals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Key leadership restructuring</p><p>To Lam was elected Party General Secretary, Tran Thanh Man became National Assembly Chairman, and Luong Cuong assumed the role of State President. These leadership changes were made during pivotal sessions of the National Assembly, reflecting the unity and resolve of the Party and the people to maintain stability and foster national progress. The Politburo also issued rare disciplinary warnings to high-profile leaders, showcasing a commitment to accountability and ethical governance in Vietnam's political system.</p><p>3. Streamlining the political system</p><p>Following Resolution 18, Vietnam began restructuring its political system to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. Agencies across Party, State, and socio-political organisations developed plans for streamlined operations. Under the principle of \"The central level sets an example,\" the new apparatus aims to be \"elite, streamlined, strong, efficient, valid, and effective.\" This ongoing reform highlights the Party's dedication to modernising governance and strengthening public trust while addressing challenges to meet the demands of a new era.</p><p>4. 70th anniversary of Dien Bien Phu Victory</p><p>On May 7, Vietnam marked the 70th anniversary of the Dien Bien Phu Victory with a grand ceremony in Dien Bien province. The event celebrated the historic triumph that \"shook the globe\" and reinforced patriotism and national unity. It highlighted the Vietnam People's Army's evolution over eight decades, underscoring its commitment to safeguarding the country's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity. The victory remains a symbol of resilience and a source of inspiration for future generations.</p><p>5. Economic growth amid challenges</p><p>Despite global uncertainties and the devastation of Typhoon Yagi, Vietnam achieved GDP growth exceeding 7% in 2024, surpassing targets. Trade turnover neared $800 billion, FDI inflows exceeded $31 billion, and inflation remained below 4%. Tourism rebounded, with international arrivals up 40% from 2023. Vietnam's national brand value reached $507 billion, ranking 32nd globally. These achievements underscore the country's resilience and potential as a thriving economy amidst global challenges and natural disasters.</p><p>6. Impact of Super Typhoon Yagi</p><p>Typhoon Yagi, the most powerful storm in decades, caused severe destruction in Vietnam, leaving 345 dead or missing and 3.2 billion USD in damages. Entire villages were flattened, and thousands were injured. The government's swift response, combined with national solidarity and international support, ensured effective recovery efforts. People quickly resumed their lives, with significant progress in rebuilding infrastructure and restoring livelihoods. The tragedy highlighted the importance of disaster preparedness and climate resilience in Vietnam.</p><p>7.

The success sets a benchmark for future national projects, demonstrating Vietnam's ability to implement large-scale infrastructure efficiently and effectively under tight deadlines.</p><p>9. Revised Land Law passed</p><p>The National Assembly passed the amended Land Law, along with revised Housing and Real Estate Business laws. These updates aim to synchronise legal frameworks, foster a sustainable real estate market, and enhance land resource management. Taking effect earlier than planned, the new laws address long-standing institutional bottlenecks and create a favourable environment for socio-economic development. They mark a significant step toward modernising Vietnam's legal landscape and ensuring efficient land use.</p><p>10. 5G network launched</p><p>Viettel officially launched Vietnam's 5G network on October 15, marking a milestone in the country's digital transformation journey. As a pillar of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, the 5G network is expected to boost innovation and productivity across industries.

Today, this means supporting Vi?t Nam in the promotion of a dynamic and expanding economy. An economy that is inclusive, environmentally sustainable, and effectively governed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we move into the second quarter of the 21st century, the challenges Vi?t Nam faces are increasingly complex, reflecting a world economy that is becoming ever more competitive, interdependent, and dynamic. Geopolitical tensions and uncertainties around trade add a further layer of complexity.</p><p>Following several years of slower economic growth, General Secretary T\u00f4 LSm has brought a new energy and urgency to Vi?t Nam's socioeconomic development agenda, including the dual goals of becoming a high-income economy and reaching net zero emissions by 2050. During his October meetings with UNDP's global leadership in New York, the General Secretary notably recognised UNDP's past contributions to Vi?t Nam's development, as well as its potential for future contributions, underscoring the significance of the partnership.</p><p>Looking more closely, we see an alignment between many of UNDP's global objectives and Vi?t Nam's development priorities. These include the further reduction of poverty, expanding access to decent work, increasing economic resilience to climate change, strengthening effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, and advancing gender equity across all sectors. Currently, UNDP works with national authorities across many of these policy areas, including the promotion of inclusive economic growth, innovation, digitalisation, climate resilience, energy transition, the rule of law, development finance, and strengthening of essential social services. As Vi?t Nam embarks on a new development phase, UNDP looks forward to deepening this partnership and addressing the country's most pressing challenges together.</p><p>In what ways can UNDP support Vi?t Nam in achieving the sustainable development goals outlined in this vision, with a particular focus on environmental sustainability and social equity?</p><p>While Vi?t Nam's economy has regained momentum, sustaining rapid growth will require deliberate measures to achieve significant transformations across an array of key areas, including institutional reforms, technological upgrading, the movement into higher-value manufacturing and service activities, and long-overdue breakthroughs in the development of private enterprises. All of this will occur within an economy that is and will continue to undergo rapid spatial and socio-demographic transformations, owing to a confluence of factors, including climate change, migration, urbanisation, and population aging.</p><p>For Vi?t Nam to achieve inclusive and sustainable growth in this context, it needs to invest in the development of managerial and technological capacities within and outside the state, develop a green growth model that creates equitably shared benefits for the population, and promote a more open and inclusive governance system. The latter includes further strengthening Vi?t Nam's socialist rule of law state, to ensure vulnerable populations can access justice and have their rights protected at a time of rapid - and at times disruptive - transformation.</p><p>As Vi?t Nam's leaders have pointed out, now is the time for the country to address longstanding bottlenecks in infrastructure and energy, to promote the development of a more skilled workforce, and to develop social policies that better support the socioeconomic security and development capabilities of the country's population. The recent flurry of activity around the promotion of science, technology, innovation, and digitalisation indicates that there is recognition of the need for swift action across a range of critical fields.</p><p>Sustainability, energy transition, and resilience in the face of climate change further illustrate UNDP's assistance to Vi?t Nam. In alignment with Vi?t Nam's climate commitments under the Paris Agreement, UNDP is focused on promoting Vi?t Nam's green energy transition, enhancing natural resources management, and strengthening community resilience. These efforts are essential. To grow its economy sustainably and remain internationally competitive, Vi?t Nam must rapidly expand its supply of energy from renewable, low-carbon sources, such as wind and solar. While moving toward a carbon net-zero economy by 2050 is an ambitious goal, Vi?t Nam is well placed to realise it and to become a regional and world leader in sustainable development. Correspondingly, our focus is on how we can support Vi?t Nam's efforts in this direction right now.</p><p>The transition to green growth requires coordination of transformations across a range of sectors and industries. To diversify and strengthen its energy system, Vi?t Nam must facilitate the development of green industries, integrate renewable solutions -- such as solar, wind, hydrogen, and energy storage, and make use of other measures - such as carbon taxes and incentives - to promote movement toward a greener economy. To improve its economic performance and sustainability, Vi?t Nam must undertake the structural transformation of its export-led economy and seek investment from and partnership with firms at the cutting edge of sustainable growth. In infrastructure, Vi?t Nam requires a more integrated approach to transport and logistics, spatial planning, energy, water management and storm resilient housing. Finally, Vi?t Nam can seize competitive advantage in the region and beyond by embracing sustainable business models and regulatory practices that will help the country build a reputation for producing increasingly high-quality and sustainable export produces.</p><p>While it is impossible to know how this might play out and how Vi?t Nam's energy mix will take shape, it is clear Vi?t Nam must meet its present and medium-term energy challenges, and UNDP is actively supporting the country in expanding, accelerating, and financing its transition to a more sustainable mix of energy sources.</p><p>In parallel, Vi?t Nam must enhance its national preparedness and resilience to climate change impacts. Again, UNDP is well positioned to assist, as was demonstrated in our strong technical leadership and effective coordination in the post-Yagi response effort. Additionally, UNDP continues to assist the government in policy making for green growth strategies, circular economy development and environmental regulations to ensure compliance with international commitments. Finally, to expand and sophisticate its economy in a way that supports and protects the wellbeing of the country's population, Vi?t Nam must also develop a 21st century system of social protection and supports, enabling its citizens to both drive and benefit from the nation's growth. UNDP remains as a strong partner in helping Viet Nam build a future that is inclusive, resilient, and sustainable ensuring that no one is left behind.</p><p>What primary challenges does the UNDP anticipate during Vi?t Nam's transition in this 'rising era'? How does UNDP plan to address these challenges, particularly in fostering digital and green transformations? Could you highlight potential collaborative projects that might help Vi?t Nam harness these technologies for socio-economic development?</p><p>One of Vi?t Nam's primary challenges is that it must successfully undertake large-scale economic restructuring while promoting the development of an economy that produces benefits for all of Vi?t Nam's people, including those at risk of being left behind, such as rural populations, ethnic groups and labor migrants. There is indeed justifiable optimism in Vi?t Nam about the country's economic prospects and increasing indications that Vi?t Nam's economic transformation has entered a new era. However, addressing the country's development challenges will require focused improvements in the inclusive design and implementation of policies that are responsive to diverse needs and vulnerabilities across geographies and populations groups. In the past, development efforts were frequently focused on specific sectors. By contrast, many of the challenges Vi?t Nam faces today require an ability to address large-scale, multi-sectoral challenges involving multiple domestic and foreign development partners.</p><p>State policies must catalyse and coordinate action across sectors and across central and local levels of governance in ways that past policies have sometimes struggled to do. In the field of digital transformation, a whole-of-government approach is needed to steer, finance, incentivise, and support digital transformation across all sectors and at all levels of governance, even as specific aims and challenges of digitalisation will vary across sectors.</p><p>UNDP programmes are currently supporting digitalisation in areas such as public administration, social protection, and sustainable environment development and management. Building robust legal and policy frameworks that safeguard the rights of citizens and prevent inadvertent patterns of exclusion, inequality and abuse unleashed by artificial intelligence and new technologies is also critical. The rise of cybercrime, issues around digital privacy, the role of social media in human trafficking and the persistence of digital divides are examples of the risks and threats that will need to be managed to ensure a safe and equitable digital transformation.</p><p>With respect to Vi?t Nam's green transformation, Vi?t Nam faces the challenge of diversifying its sources of energy and energy finance but also harnessing domestic sources of finance and ensuring that energy policy benefits all of Vi?t Nam's people. UNDP will continue to help Vi?t Nam develop and monitor policies and work with its international development partners. A good example of this is UNDP 's facilitation and coordination role in the Just Energy Transition Partnership- a multi-billion multilateral initiative that aims to assist Vi?t Nam finance its green energy transition and access technologies. Alongside this, UNDP's approach includes empowering local communities and women-led enterprises, piloting green technologies and circular economy models, promoting sustainable land-use practices, and collaborating on conservation projects. There are digital aspects, as well. Leveraging digital tools for real-time monitoring of environmental and socio-economic indicators, for example, promotes more effective policy management and accountability.</p><p>Could you elaborate on specific programmes or initiatives UNDP is implementing to strengthen Vi?t Nam's governance and institutional capacities in this new era? How does the UNDP view its role in fostering governmental transparency and efficiency, particularly in addressing issues such as wastefulness and corruption highlighted by General Secretary T\u00f4 LSm?</p><p>Sustainable Development Goal 16, which is focused on building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions, is central to UNDP's partnership with the Government of Vi?t Nam. Cognizant that sustainable and equitable development cannot be achieved without responsive institutions that deliver for all citizens, UNDP continues to work closely with several government partners at central and provincial level to increase transparency, efficiency and inclusion. Founded in 2009, the Provincial Governance and Public Administration Performance Index (PAPI) is a key example of those efforts. The index measures and benchmarks the performance of provincial authorities in citizen participation, transparency, accountability, control of corruption, public service delivery, and environmental and e-governance. It is the largest social survey-based governance assessment tool in Viet Nam, gathering feedback from over 16,000 citizens annually.</p><p>In annually capturing citizen perceptions on local government performance, PAPI provides invaluable data for policymakers and civil servants to strengthen public sector responsiveness and efficiency. Crucially, PAPI allows national and local leaders to gauge how different demographic groups - women, youth, the elderly, ethnic groups, persons with disabilities, migrants - are experiencing governance and where potential gaps may exist.</p><p>UNDP also has longstanding programming aimed at advancing the implementation of the UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC), ratified by Vi?t Nam in 2009. Adopting a multisector approach, UNDP supports a wide range of government partners to advance both corruption prevention - for example, through digitisation in service delivery, which reduces opportunities for corruption - and by strengthening law enforcement capacities. Strengthening systems to more effectively manage conflict of interests in the public sector and to bolster authorities' capacities in asset recovery remain top priorities.</p><p>Finally, the National Assembly and Provincial People's Councils also play an important role in promoting transparency and efficiency. As Vi?t Nam prepares for the 2026 elections, UNDP is hoping to see a greater number of women representatives, in line with Viet Nam's National Strategy on Gender Equality and Communist Party Resolution 26-NQ/TW. Across the world, the increased participation of women in politics - especially in parliaments - has been linked to more representative, transparent, and inclusive institutions and in policies that result in a more equitable distribution of resources. UNDP looks forward to working with national partners to enhance the role of elected women representatives to that end.</p><p>How does the UNDP plan to monitor and evaluate Vi?t Nam's progress toward achieving the goals outlined in the vision for the rising era?</p><p>Vi?t Nam's socioeconomic development goals have many strengths, especially for their commitments to promoting rapid, equitable, sustainable growth. In our work, we regularly collaborate with government partners to better understand the effectiveness of Vi?t Nam's development policies.

Could you please share with us the context of the relationship between the two countries and the significances of the visit?</p><p>Ambassador Deirdre N\u00ed Fhall\u00fain: Ireland's Embassy in Vietnam was established in 2005 and since then our two countries have shared a warm relationship, underpinned by our development cooperation programme. Much of our focus has been on supporting ethnic minority communities in Vietnam and on humanitarian mine assistance - working with partners to clear affected land, raise awareness of mines in schools, and support people who have been disabled by unexploded ordnance.</p><p>Recently, as Vietnam's economy has continued its impressive growth, we have increased our bilateral cooperation in the areas of agriculture, food systems, and higher education, focusing on technical support and capacity building, and on building institutional links between our two countries.</p><p>Our President, Michael D. Higgins, undertook a State visit to Vietnam in 2016. I know that this visit is still fondly remembered in both countries, so we are delighted that the return State visit of General Secretary, President To Lam to Ireland is now taking place, marking our countries' deepening relationship.</p><p>Reporter: It is said that Ireland has strengths in many areas such as education and training, financial services, insurance, information technology, green technology, renewable energy, etc. What are your comments on the potentials for cooperation between the two countries in the coming time?</p><p>Ambassador Deirdre N\u00ed Fhall\u00fain: Ireland was not a developed country until relatively recently - we experienced rapid development and economic growth in the latter half of the last century. We're now often called 'The Silicon Valley of Europe', recognised globally as a centre for pharmaceuticals, technology (Ireland is home to the European headquarters of many big tech companies such as Meta and Google), and high quality education.</p><p>From our own development journey, we know how important education is for a country's development. We have supported Vietnamese students to undertake fully-funded Masters degrees in Ireland under our scholarship scheme the Ireland Fellows Programme. These students return to Vietnam with high quality education and experience, and hopefully a lifelong connection to Ireland.</p><p>The Embassy is also increasing cooperation between universities and institutes in our two countries to share experience and build capacity in areas such as agriculture and agrifood, which are priority fields for both Ireland and Vietnam. The Ireland Vietnam Agrifood Partnership (IVAP) is a great example of our strong collaboration in this area.</p><p>Ireland is a small island - we also face the growing and urgent challenge of climate change. We must tackle this challenge together and we are increasing our climate resilience work in rural communities in Vietnam and to deepening university cooperation and research in the areas of climate change and sustainability.</p><p>Reporter: After nearly 30 years of establishing diplomatic relations, the two countries have seen many positive results in bilateral cooperation. What are notable highlights in the cooperative relationship between the two countries in recent times?</p><p>Ambassador Deirdre N\u00ed Fhall\u00fain: At the Embassy, we're very proud of our long development cooperation programme with Vietnam, particularly our focus on working with ethnic minorities, and humanitarian mine assistance, and also our programmes on nutrition and maternal health, and our growing work on increasing resilience to climate change. We were proud recently to be able to provide 250,000 EUR in humanitarian funding for the response to the impact of Typhoon Yagi, which has had a devastating impact in northern Vietnam. That funding is supporting the work of UNICEF providing immediate assistance in the form of clean water and hygiene to affected families.</p><p>It is great to see the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Vietnam evolving in the years since we established our Embassy, as we seek to increase our cooperation in other areas such as education and agrifood, as well as to increase trade between our two countries. The relationship between Ireland and Vietnam will continue to evolve and develop with a positive trajectory. The State visit of President Michael D. Higgins to Vietnam nearly a decade ago was an important milestone in our bilateral relationship. Party General Secretary and President To Lam's visit marks another significant step, and I am delighted that this return visit is now taking place.
