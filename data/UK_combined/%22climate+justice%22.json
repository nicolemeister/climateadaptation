As climate risks and costs rise, fossil fuel companies and their boards will find legal liabilities and commercial risks increasing. New research in the journal Nature makes this clear. The authors used companies- own data and recognised models to illustrate the trillions in economic losses attributable to the extreme heat caused by emissions from individual companies.", "Like Mike, in Hemmingway-s tale, the end of fossil fuel companies denying climate reality will be gradual, then sudden. Trillions of dollars in stranded assets will be seen. Vast quantities of oil and gas will be left in the ground - as they must be if climate crises are to be averted. For the sake of all our futures, we should support these legal cases. As global CO2 levels reach 429ppm, a number last recorded between 14-16 million years ago, and temperatures exceed 1. 5C above pre-industrial times, we need to reach a climate justice breakpoint before the planet hits climate tipping points of no return.

Public attitudes towards justice are reflected in several ways: through endorsement and understanding of the concept of environmental justice, the recognition of existing inequalities in carbon emissions and impacts, and the perception of policy fairness. In this issue of Nature Climate Change, Charles Ogunbode and colleagues present a study spanning both the global north and the global south that reveals the widespread public endorsement of climate justice beliefs. The findings show that the public acknowledge the disproportionate impact of climate change on impoverished communities and underscore the roles of capitalism and colonialism in the climate crisis. Despite strong support for climate justice principles, they find that global awareness of climate justice remains low, with two-thirds of respondents indicating they had never heard of climate justice. Also in the issue, Kristian Nielsen and colleagues investigate the perceptions of carbon footprint inequality across four diverse countries and show that the public often underestimate the extent of inequality, particularly the footprints of the top income groups.</p><p>Such underestimations can be due to a lack of information or awareness of inequality, or the complexity of estimating inequality. Perceived inequality is also influenced by ideologies, social norms and individual beliefs, as well as socioeconomic and contextual issues,. For example, women are more likely than men to view a given distribution of resources, opportunities or burdens as unfair. Age may also be an influential factor as adolescents might not yet have fully developed the cognitive skills needed to process complex information effectively. In addition, the wealthy often perceive themselves as poorer than they actually are, while the less wealthy tend to believe they are better off than they actually are.</p><p>Public perception of equity and justice matter for climate change mitigation objectives. Climate justice perceptions are associated with increased engagement in online activism, pro-environmental behaviours and support for climate policies. Perceptions of the fairness of specific policies are a strong determinant of acceptability of the policy. Similarly, underestimating carbon footprint inequality can lead to reduced support for climate policies (as shown by Nielsen and colleagues). Ethical responsibility is another reason to promote climate justice, to ensure that the most vulnerable and least responsible for climate change are treated fairly in both its impacts and the solutions developed to address it. Therefore, it is important to encourage inclusive mitigation and adaptation policies that recognize and address climate justice, while also improving public understanding and awareness of justice. Climate science education in schools as well as social media, online platforms and community events that offer greater exposure to information can help foster awareness of climate justice (as discussed by Ogunbode and colleagues).</p><p>To reach climate goals, governments need to gain support from the public for policy interventions. Consequently, there is a growing literature that examines public perceptions of climate change. These studies have focused on broad questions such as whether the public acknowledges climate change, supports related policies and how the associated risks are perceived. However, psychological processes are complex and dynamic. To fully understand these dynamics and disentangle the drivers of public support for climate policies, it is important for research to include diverse perceptions, such as justice, heterogeneity, vulnerability, adaptive capacity and moral and ethical aspects.</p>", "publisher": "Nature Climate Change", "instances": ["Extensive literature has documented the disproportionate emissions generated by different population groups and the varying threats climate change poses to these groups,.

This has been the go-to for every failing business, politician and cultural enterprise for the past decade.

For starters, the idea that Erasmus kids were what was holding the Tate's attendance fgures together is ludicrous - Brexit hasn't stopped youngsters from holidaying in the UK. What is revealing is the fact that Balshaw seems more concerned with attracting members of the European Union than addressing the nonchalance of punters from her own isle.</p><p>But aside from the Remaniac whining that is typical in arts circles, why are Tate's numbers so low? A clue might be found in another event in 2016 - not Brexit, but the revamping of Tate Modern as a \"museum for the 21st century\". There was a reorientation towards a focus on the political - think decolonisation, deconstruction, and lots of woke little plaques.</p><p>At one point, an accompanying explanation next to Tate Britain's early 17th-century The Cholmondeley Ladies informed the public of a possible lesbian subtext - something which might have alarmed the sisters who feature in the work. One section of the Tate called \"Performer and Participant\" informs viewers that they will be \"directed by an artist and political activism\". For your average Goldsmiths student this might be exciting, but most ordinary museum-goers are there to see the great art - never mind the politics.</p><p>Perhaps the Tate's failures are down to its own institutional cowardice. Over the years, both Tate Modern and Tate Britain have acted like museums that are embarrassed, not only of their own collections but by their own existence. The formerly famous Tate restaurant was not reopened after the pandemic thanks to criticism of the murals on the wall by Rex Whistler that included images of slave boys. Despite explanatory plaques, booklets and other apologetic scripts being produced around the mural for years, the museum decided that hungry members of the public simply couldn't be trusted to eat next to such art.

The university is practising what it preaches, committing to giving more than 42% of the land on its Sir Basil Spence-designed campus, which borders the South Downs, over to nature by 2027. One of the 1960s generation of universities, Sussex has plenty of the distinctive architecture for which the period was renowned, but there are also 2,000 new student rooms under development to help keep the university fresh and modern. A beefed-up student support model recently won recognition from the UK Advising and Tutoring Association. The university&amp;apos;s Brighton location is a hit with students, putting them at the heart of one of the country&amp;apos;s most fashionable seaside resorts yet less than an hour from the capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Paying the bills</p><p>The university has raised the income eligibility threshold for its key means-tested bursary by \u00a310,000 this year. This should extend the reach of the Sussex bursary considerably, with all students from homes with an income of less than \u00a335,000 now eligible for \u00a31,000 of support in the first year (including foundation years) and \u00a3500 in each subsequent year of study. Currently, 2,200 students are in receipt of the bursary - a number that will now rise greatly. More niche are the five \u00a35,000-per-year Climate Leaders scholarships open to undergraduate, masters and PhD students who can show a track record of bringing about real-world change in relation to the climate crisis. Scholarship recipients will be supported to develop a high-level project plan and provided with mentoring support. The Andrew Rudd scholarship helps students who have been in care and is worth \u00a35,000 per year across all years of study. There are also other smaller subject-specific scholarships on offer. There are just under 4,900 places available in the university-owned student residences. These are priced between \u00a34,805 and \u00a38,378 for 39-week undergraduate tenancies. While no decision had been taken for the 2026-27 academic year at the time of writing, rent reductions have been offered to first years in receipt of the Sussex bursary and those from homes with less than \u00a325,000 of annual income in recent years.</p><p>What&amp;apos;s new?</p><p>Sussex has developed a &amp;apos;doughnut model&amp;apos; of student support, which was deemed outstanding by the UK Advising and Tutoring Association recently. The university will hope this translates into improved scores in the annual National Student Survey, where Sussex has underperformed for some years. The support model now in place deploys active outreach to students from academic advisers who assess student wellbeing regularly within an interconnected circle of assistance spanning academic, careers and emotional support. The aim is to stop students &amp;apos;falling through the hole&amp;apos; either by not seeking support or their need for help not being detected. With students&amp;apos; consent, information can be shared with other named individuals within the &amp;apos;doughnut&amp;apos; support circle to ensure an integrated approach is taken. Continuing this focus on student support, a new health and wellbeing centre at the heart of campus will open in spring 2026. Housing all services from wellbeing advice and therapy through to an NHS GP practice, the new centre has been designed to have a non-clinical feel to make the atmosphere more welcoming and accessible. A revamp of student catering on campus has yielded more fresh meal options, better carbon labelling and an improved focus on sustainability, too. The \u00a32 Sussex Saver meal initiative has helped cut the cost of living, with 87,000 saver meals eaten in the past 12 months. A further 2,000 discounted meals - such as free breakfasts during exam time - have also been served. In the same vein as the new degree in climate justice, sustainability and development (see Overview above), a BSc in economics and sustainable development is also being offered for the first time in 2026. This will explore the dynamics of environmental change, human wellbeing and economic growth.</p><p>Admissions, teaching and student support</p><p>More than one in five students gaining places at Sussex last September did so with a contextual offer.

Support for students more generally is delivered through a comprehensive network of mental health and wellbeing support, which includes therapists and psychologists providing short-term cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic counselling and psychotherapy delivered online, in person or by phone. The university also runs psycho-educative workshops and support groups covering topics such as homesickness, race and identity, low mood and anxiety, and long-term health conditions.

This should extend the reach of the Sussex bursary considerably, with all students from homes with an income of less than \u00a335,000 now eligible for \u00a31,000 of support in the first year (including foundation years) and \u00a3500 in each subsequent year of study. Currently, 2,200 students are in receipt of the bursary - a number that will now rise greatly. More niche are the five \u00a35,000-per-year Climate Leaders scholarships open to undergraduate, masters and PhD students who can show a track record of bringing about real-world change in relation to the climate crisis. Scholarship recipients will be supported to develop a high-level project plan and provided with mentoring support. The Andrew Rudd scholarship helps students who have been in care and is worth \u00a35,000 per year across all years of study. There are also other smaller subject-specific scholarships on offer. There are just under 4,900 places available in the university-owned student residences. These are priced between \u00a34,805 and \u00a38,378 for 39-week undergraduate tenancies. While no decision had been taken for the 2026-27 academic year at the time of writing, rent reductions have been offered to first years in receipt of the Sussex bursary and those from homes with less than \u00a325,000 of annual income in recent years.</p><p>What&amp;apos;s new?</p><p>Sussex has developed a &amp;apos;doughnut model&amp;apos; of student support, which was deemed outstanding by the UK Advising and Tutoring Association recently. The university will hope this translates into improved scores in the annual National Student Survey, where Sussex has underperformed for some years. The support model now in place deploys active outreach to students from academic advisers who assess student wellbeing regularly within an interconnected circle of assistance spanning academic, careers and emotional support. The aim is to stop students &amp;apos;falling through the hole&amp;apos; either by not seeking support or their need for help not being detected. With students&amp;apos; consent, information can be shared with other named individuals within the &amp;apos;doughnut&amp;apos; support circle to ensure an integrated approach is taken. Continuing this focus on student support, a new health and wellbeing centre at the heart of campus will open in spring 2026. Housing all services from wellbeing advice and therapy through to an NHS GP practice, the new centre has been designed to have a non-clinical feel to make the atmosphere more welcoming and accessible. A revamp of student catering on campus has yielded more fresh meal options, better carbon labelling and an improved focus on sustainability, too. The \u00a32 Sussex Saver meal initiative has helped cut the cost of living, with 87,000 saver meals eaten in the past 12 months. A further 2,000 discounted meals - such as free breakfasts during exam time - have also been served.

Support for students more generally is delivered through a comprehensive network of mental health and wellbeing support, which includes therapists and psychologists providing short-term cognitive behavioural therapy and psychodynamic counselling and psychotherapy delivered online, in person or by phone. The university also runs psycho-educative workshops and support groups covering topics such as homesickness, race and identity, low mood and anxiety, and long-term health conditions.

For your average Goldsmiths student this might be exciting, but most ordinary museum-goers are there to see the great art - never mind the politics.</p><p>Perhaps the Tate's failures are down to its own institutional cowardice. Over the years, both Tate Modern and Tate Britain have acted like museums that are embarrassed, not only of their own collections but by their own existence. The formerly famous Tate restaurant was not reopened after the pandemic thanks to criticism of the murals on the wall by Rex Whistler that included images of slave boys.

Meanwhile, the industries making the most money, onshore and offshore wind, continue to create relatively few jobs for the scale of their turnover, while far too much of the profit leaves Scotland entirely.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2023, total jobs in Scotland-s low carbon economy rose from 26,000 to 33,500, the highest level since ONS began collecting this data in 2014. That-s a headline ministers will happily boast about. But let-s look at the detail.</p><p>Most of those new jobs came in sectors like low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, energy-efficient lighting and energy-efficient products.</p><p>By contrast, the offshore and onshore wind industries, which dominate the Scottish Government-s green industrial strategy, saw jobs barely move. Offshore wind added just 100 jobs in a year. Onshore wind added 200. Combined, they now account for just over 6,800 jobs, or about 20% of all low carbon employment, despite generating more than half of all turnover and exports in the sector.</p><p>Put bluntly, for every million pounds of turnover, offshore wind creates just 1.3 jobs; onshore wind creates less than one. Compare that to low-emission vehicle manufacturing at over 21 jobs per million, or energy-efficient lighting at almost 19.</p><p>The root problem is simple: Scotland still lacks a serious, joined-up green industrial strategy that links climate targets to secure, skilled, unionised jobs.</p><p>Too much of our policy has been designed to maximise deployment of renewable energy without securing the domestic manufacturing base needed to turn that investment into lasting employment. As of 2024, Scotland has 12.4GW of installed onshore and offshore wind, compared to just 7.5GW in Denmark. Yet the Danes show what-s possible when you do this right: they-ve captured 40% of the European wind market.</p><p>Our report shows Scotland would need 19 major manufacturing sites for nacelles, blades, towers and more to fully capture the economic opportunity from ScotWind. So far, only two cable manufacturing sites have been announced. Without that domestic production capacity, developers will continue importing vast amounts of equipment and the jobs will stay overseas.</p><p>Even when these huge projects come online, the picture gets even more skewed. Take Seagreen, now the world-s sixth-largest offshore wind farm. In its first year of operation, it generated 449 million in revenue and produced a profit of 127 million. The entire operations and maintenance centre employs just 80 people. As new wind farms become operational and begin to generate electricity and therefore income for the developer, their spending falls dramatically, including for labour.</p><p>Therein lies the palpable frustration felt by many local residents. They-re not anti-renewables, per se. They-re anti-rip off and want to see a real community benefit to the inevitable disruption that comes with large scale renewable projects.</p><p>The Scottish Government-s 2024 Green Industrial Strategy names wind as a -priority area- but fails to address the real barriers: lack of manufacturing capacity, lack of community benefit, lack of job creation proportional to turnover. Even worse, it barely mentions the energy-efficiency sectors that already employ more than a third of all workers in the low carbon economy.</p><p>The solution is apparent: the Scottish Government must reform their approach to the development of offshore wind if there is to be any meaningful and last economic footprint from these natural resources. That includes setting Fair Work and Just Transition conditions across leasing, planning applications and public investment projects. This can be achieved, in part, through negotiations between trade unions and wind industry representatives and finally giving unions a seat at the table of the Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council (SOWEC).</p><p>Secondly, we need to put communities at the heart of our national strategy, building greater public ownership of energy at a local level including with binding targets for community and local authority ownership of renewables.</p><p>Lastly supporting reform of employment law to establish universal standards and minimum wage floors in the energy sector and clearer structures for collective bargaining.</p><p>As the trade unionist Jimmy Reid once said, the untapped resources of Scotland-s North Sea are as nothing compared to the untapped resources of our people.</p><p>The answer isn-t blowing in the wind, it's lying in our communities.</p><p>Roz Foyer is the general secretary of the STUC</p>", "publisher": "The Herald (Scotland) Online", "instances": ["But in practice, many projects fall short and these funds pale in comparison to what community ownership can deliver.

It's a system where our natural resources generate massive wealth for private companies, with a trickle of jobs and community benefit in return and even then, those jobs are laced with precarity and insecure conditions.</p><p>For example, developers are meant to provide Community Benefit Funds, with the Scottish Government recommending a baseline of \u00a35,000 per megawatt. But in practice, many projects fall short and these funds pale in comparison to what community ownership can deliver.</p><p>Contrast two wind projects in Argyll &amp; Bute: Beinn an Tuirc, owned by Scottish Power Renewables, returns about \u00a32,500 per megawatt to the community whilst Tilley, a single turbine owned by the Tiree Community Development Trust, returns over \u00a3263,000 per megawatt.</p><p>That difference is transformative. That's true community wealth building. Yet in 2024, less than 1% of new renewable capacity in Scotland was under local or community ownership.</p><p>When ministers first marketed Scotland as the \"Saudi Arabia of renewables\", it was sold as the prize for embracing the low carbon transition, with an alleged wave of well-paid, high-quality jobs spread across our communities, delivering both climate justice and economic renewal.</p><p>But if we strip away the spin and look at the hard data from the latest Office for National Statistics analysis of Scotland's Low Carbon and Renewable Energy Economy, as the STUC has done in our new report, that prize has yet to arrive.</p><p>In fact, the growth we've seen is concentrated in a handful of areas and in the case of nuclear power, jobs are already disappearing. Meanwhile, the industries making the most money, onshore and offshore wind, continue to create relatively few jobs for the scale of their turnover, while far too much of the profit leaves Scotland entirely.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2023, total jobs in Scotland's low carbon economy rose from 26,000 to 33,500, the highest level since ONS began collecting this data in 2014. That's a headline ministers will happily boast about. But let's look at the detail.</p><p>Most of those new jobs came in sectors such as low-emission vehicles and infrastructure, energy-efficient lighting and energy-efficient products.</p><p>By contrast, the offshore and onshore wind industries, which dominate the Scottish Government's green industrial strategy, saw jobs barely move. Offshore wind added just 100 jobs in a year. Onshore wind added 200.Combined, they now account for just over 6,800 jobs, or about 20% of all low carbon employment, despite generating more than half of all turnover and exports in the sector.</p><p>Put bluntly, for every million pounds of turnover, offshore wind creates just 1.3 jobs; onshore wind creates less than one.Compare that to low-emission vehicle manufacturing at over 21 jobs per million, or energy-efficient lighting at almost 19.</p><p>The root problem is simple: Scotland still lacks a serious, joined-up green industrial strategy that links climate targets to secure, skilled, unionised jobs.</p><p>Too much of our policy has been designed to maximise deployment of renewable energy without securing the domestic manufacturing base needed to turn that investment into lasting employment. As of 2024, Scotland has 12.4GW of installed onshore and offshore wind, compared to just 7.5GW in Denmark. Yet the Danes show what's possible when you do this right: they've captured 40% of the European wind market.</p><p>Our report shows Scotland would need 19 major manufacturing sites for nacelles, blades, towers and more to fully capture the economic opportunity from ScotWind. So far, only two cable manufacturing sites have been announced. Without that domestic production capacity, developers will continue importing vast amounts of equipment and the jobs will stay overseas.</p><p>Even when these huge projects come online, the picture gets even more skewed. Take Seagreen, now the world's sixth-largest offshore wind farm. In its first year of operation, it generated \u00a3449 million in revenue and produced a profit of \u00a3127m. The entire operations and maintenance centre employs just 80 people. As new wind farms become operational and begin to generate electricity and therefore income for the developer, their spending falls dramatically, including for labour.</p><p>Therein lies the palpable frustration felt by many local residents. They're not anti-renewables, per se. They're anti-rip off and want to see a real community benefit to the inevitable disruption that comes with large scale renewable projects.</p><p>The Scottish Government's 2024 Green Industrial Strategy names wind as a \"priority area\" but fails to address the real barriers: lack of manufacturing capacity, lack of community benefit, lack of job creation proportional to turnover. Even worse, it barely mentions the energy-efficiency sectors that already employ more than a third of all workers in the low carbon economy.</p><p>The solution is apparent: the Scottish Government must reform their approach to the development of offshore wind if there is to be any meaningful and last economic footprint from these natural resources. That includes setting Fair Work and Just Transition conditions across leasing, planning applications and public investment projects. This can be achieved, in part, through negotiations between trade unions and wind industry representatives and finally giving unions a seat at the table of the Scottish Offshore Wind Energy Council (SOWEC).</p><p>Secondly, we need to put communities at the heart of our national strategy, building greater public ownership of energy at a local level including with binding targets for community and local authority ownership of renewables.</p><p>Lastly, supporting reform of employment law to establish universal standards and minimum wage floors in the energy sector and clearer structures for collective bargaining.</p><p>As the trade unionist Jimmy Reid once said, the untapped resources of Scotland's North Sea are as nothing compared to the untapped resources of our people.</p><p>The answer isn't blowing in the wind, it's lying in our communities.</p><p>Roz Foyer is the general secretary of the STUC</p>", "publisher": "The Herald (Scotland) Print", "instances": ["But in practice, many projects fall short and these funds pale in comparison to what community ownership can deliver.

Investor members collectively oversee $80trn of assets under management.<br/>Read on for Ridwaan's answers to our questions.<br/>How I got to where I am now:<br/>\"I spent part of my childhood visiting family in the Horn of Africa, where conversations often centred on the harvest: whether rain would come, if the drought would last, or how crops were holding up. From a young age, I saw how climate shocks like droughts and floods were part of daily life, not distant risks, and how much they disrupted communities who relied on agriculture for both income and food security. It made me ask why this was happening. The more I learned about climate change, the clearer it became that those who contributed least were paying the highest price. That early understanding shaped how I see sustainability and why I chose to work in it.<br/>\"I joined FAIRR in 2024. At FAIRR, I work across climate, equity, and investment strategy to ensure sustainability transitions deliver for the people most affected by them. I help shape FAIRR's approach to a Just Transition, defining what it means for the global food system and demonstrating how it can add value across climate, nature, and social workstreams. The goal is to build a shared understanding internally and provide investors with practical ways to engage on transition risks and equity.<br/>\"Right now, I am helping update FAIRR's regenerative agriculture framework to reflect real-world complexity. That includes the financial realities farmers face, whether related to income stability, access to fair labour conditions, or resilience against economic shocks.<br/>\"The transition to a low-carbon food system is already underway. The question is whether it will be designed to include everyone.\"<br/>My biggest career achievement to date has been:<br/>\"Helping to drive a multi-stage project at FAIRR that culminated in a high-level roundtable at biodiversity COP16 in Cali, Colombia, last year. The aim was to explore how investors can finance a Just Transition to regenerative agriculture.<br/>\"We brought together global food companies, financial institutions, and civil society to discuss how capital can support farmer livelihoods while reducing environmental impact. I helped shape the research, stakeholder engagement, and design of the roundtable itself, which turned months of background work into meaningful action with global stakeholders.\"<br/>The biggest challenge I have encountered has been:<br/>\"Showing that a Just Transition isn't a 'nice-to-have' - it is essential for resilience and long-term value. Many companies prioritise decarbonisation but overlook how these shifts affect livelihoods, incomes, and communities. When transition plans exclude people, the result can be disruption, unrest and rising future costs.<br/>\"That's why my work focuses on grounding Just Transition in data, risk and materiality, not sentiment. It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about ensuring supply chains remain stable, business models remain viable, and transitions are delivered effectively.<br/>\"For this to happen, we need more than climate ambition. We need real financial flows, not just loans, and practical support for those delivering change on the ground.\"<br/>I would describe my generation as:<br/>\"Carrying the costs of inaction.\"<br/>For me, a successful 12 months ahead looks like:<br/>\"Laying the foundation for a Just Transition strategy at FAIRR that integrates across internal workstreams such as regenerative agriculture, antimicrobial resistance, and protein diversification.<br/>\"The goal is to ensure transition planning reflects both climate ambition and the real-world social and economic conditions facing farmers, workers, and Indigenous communities.<br/>\"I'll also contribute to the refresh of FAIRR's Four Labours of Regenerative Agriculture\u00a0report.

The sustainability world is complex, spanning climate, food systems, equity, and nature. It's all connected, and no one makes sense of it alone. It took me a while to realise how important community is, but having people who challenge and support you makes all the difference.<br/>\"Learn from your peers. Find a mentor. Reach out to someone whose work you admire and ask for advice. The best guidance often comes from a single honest conversation.<br/>\"And hold onto your 'why'.

Prosecutor Corjan Kroon says such operations aim to \"cause unrest and destabilise\".</p><p>A new law introduced in May enables prosecution for secret collusion with foreign powers, carrying a sentence of up to eight years. Previously, the Netherlands lacked legal tools found in neighbouring countries.</p><p>Authorities want to raise public awareness and encourage vigilance, while also distinguishing foreign interference from ordinary incidents.

The agreement was reached at Trump's golf resort in Scotland following direct talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.</p><p>Under the deal, the EU accepted a 15% US import tariff on most goods, averting higher duties previously threatened by Trump. This includes reduced tariffs on cars, chips and pharmaceuticals. However, the US will maintain a 50% tariff on steel and aluminium. Some goods, such as agricultural products and aircraft parts, will be exempt from tariffs altogether.</p><p>To appease Washington, the EU has also pledged 600bn euros in new investment and committed to purchasing 750bn euros worth of US energy and weapons.</p><p>Von der Leyen called it \"a huge deal\", though European officials remain cautious. One EU diplomat warned: \"There will be less transatlantic trade. Period.\"</p><p>Negotiations, marked by social media threats and shifting US demands, deviated from standard trade practices.

Their support centres on a LinkedIn post by senior diplomat Jaco Beerends, who recently served in the West Bank and described feeling \"powerless and angry\" over the lack of condemnation of the humanitarian crisis.</p><p>Beerends accused the Dutch government of maintaining \"double standards when it comes to defending the principles of international humanitarian law\" and warned that history \"will not judge this lightly\". Nearly 40 colleagues and ex-colleagues expressed support, with many thanking him for articulating their own frustrations.</p><p>Among the supporters are the Dutch ambassadors to Qatar and Cyprus, as well as senior officials in South Africa, France and New York. Several former ambassadors also voiced approval. Many of those speaking out described the situation as a \"moral and political failure\".</p><p>Responding to the criticism, a spokesperson for outgoing Foreign Minister Caspar Veldkamp acknowledged the emotional impact of the war and stated the cabinet is working \"behind the scenes\" to push for a ceasefire and humanitarian relief.

Many feared that difference and edginess was under attack as the university was forced to make hefty savings by a decline in income and student numbers. Those student numbers remain at their lowest point in the past decade with just 1,635 students admitted via Ucas to courses beginning in September 2024, down from 2,780 as recently as 2017. Applications are at a low ebb, too, but at least the university&amp;apos;s Transformation Programme has moved the university on to a sustainable footing. </p><p>Based on an attractive campus in a happening part of London (New Cross Gate), Goldsmiths has a reputation for turning out some of the country&amp;apos;s brightest young creatives. Nine alumni have won the Turner Prize, Britain&amp;apos;s premier arts award, since its inception in 1984; Mohammed Sami is the latest to be shortlisted for it. Might Goldsmiths have a 10th winner come December? The 58 degrees offered here don&amp;apos;t just span the creative and performing arts. You can study computing, artificial intelligence, politics, economics and marketing, too. A quarter of last year&amp;apos;s undergraduate intake came from overseas and a heavy majority of the domestic recruits come from the capital itself. It makes for a socially and ethnically diverse student population - another embodiment of different being what Goldsmiths does.</p><p>Paying the bills</p><p>The university targets its bursaries and scholarships on many of the minorities that help make its student population so distinctive. Up to 15 Access Programme scholarships worth \u00a31,000 per year are awarded to students who have gained their places via an Access to Higher Education course for learners without traditional qualifications. Equity Awards worth \u00a33,000 a year are made to up to 30 black, mixed race, Asian, Arab or traveller students from homes with less than \u00a335,000 annual income. Priority criteria that include living in Lewisham (Goldsmiths&amp;apos; home borough) for three years prior to coming to the university are also taken into consideration. Further support for students recruited locally is available via the Lewisham Borough fee waivers scheme, which sees up to five students from homes with an income of less than \u00a335,000 get full tuition-fee waivers of \u00a328,605, based on their application form answers. New Cross Fire bursaries are worth \u00a31,500 per year and are open to up to five Lewisham residents from minority ethnic backgrounds with household incomes of less than \u00a335,000. The bursaries, paid by Lewisham council, commemorate the 14 young people who died at a party in a suspected racially motivated arson attack in the borough in 1981. Travel bursaries covering the cost of commuting from students&amp;apos; homes to Goldsmiths are paid to up to 10 students. The 1,300 places in university-owned or Goldsmiths-reserved accommodation are priced from \u00a37,686 for the cheapest rooms in Surrey House on a 42-week contract, rising to \u00a317,157 for a large studio in Town Hall Camberwell, Goldsmiths&amp;apos; ritziest accommodation, over the same period.</p><p>What&amp;apos;s new?</p><p>Just in time for its 120th birthday this autumn, Goldsmiths has reorganised and come up with a new strategic direction under warden Professor Frances Corner. No matter that this was forced on Goldsmiths by an acute financial crisis, Goldsmiths promises that the upshot will be an enhanced student experience. Personal tutoring will now provide a wrap-around approach with staff teams working together to deliver high quality academic and wellbeing support to students throughout their studies. An upgraded virtual learning environment is being rolled out over summer 2025 and the university is creating a single student digital access point to answer student enquiries. A full academic review is being undertaken to ensure Goldsmiths courses reflect key national and global challenges where they intersect with the university&amp;apos;s sphere of influence and expertise - encompassing climate justice, mental health, social inequality and the impact of artificial intelligence on the creative and cultural industries. To broaden the university&amp;apos;s ability to attract students who might lack the level of qualifications to move straight on to a three-year honours degree programme, it is adding seven integrated degrees to its course portfolio this year - those that include a foundation year and require lower grades for entry - in English, history, journalism, sociology, social work, promotional media, and politics and international relations.</p><p>Admissions, teaching and student support</p><p>After a number of years where Goldsmiths returned the worst or among the worst scores in the annual National Student Survey, the institution turned a corner in 2024 with improved NSS results. The university is building on that with a revamped student support structure that brings academic and wellbeing support closer together through dedicated personal tutors who both monitor academic progress and provide the first point of contact if a student needs welfare support. Senior tutors in each academic department support personal tutors with more complex situations. Some departments, such as art and visual cultures, run their own neurodiversity and mental health support groups that students in any subject can access. A wellbeing team, mental health advisers and counsellors are available, with students able to access up to six sessions of various therapies, including art therapy. Goldsmiths also offer one-to-one wellbeing mentoring and study skills sessions covering time management, essay planning and writing, and motivation strategies. For the first time this year, Goldsmiths has introduced a contextual offer scheme to help maintain the student diversity for which it is known. Open only to care leavers and students estranged from their parents, offers are lowered by two grades (equivalent to 16 Ucas tariff points) compared to standard entry requirements. However, Goldsmiths stresses that it takes a holistic approach to all admissions decisions looking not just at predicted or attained grades, but also portfolios where relevant; personal statements; and other educational or personal information disclosed on Ucas forms.</p>", "publisher": "MailOnline", "instances": ["What&amp;apos;s new?

A stalwart supporter of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA), Afreximbank has launched a Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) that was adopted by the African Union (AU) as the payment and settlement platform to underpin the implementation of the AfCFTA. Working with the AfCFTA Secretariat and the AU, the Bank has set up a US$ 10 billion Adjustment Fund to support countries effectively participating in the AfCFTA. At the end of December 2024, Afreximbank's total assets and contingencies stood at over US$ 40.1 billion, and its shareholder funds amounted to US$ 7.2 billion. Afreximbank has investment grade ratings assigned by GCR (international scale) (A), Moody's (Baa2), China Chengxin International Credit Rating Co., Ltd (CCXI) (AAA), Japan Credit Rating Agency (JCR) (A-) and Fitch (BBB-). Afreximbank has evolved into a group entity comprising the Bank, its equity impact fund subsidiary called the Fund for Export Development Africa (FEDA), and its insurance management subsidiary, AfrexInsure (together, \"the Group\").

Growing up, I loved geography lessons and cared about the environment, but I wasn't sure what a career path in that looked like. My dad introduced me to an Environmental Science degree, which felt like the perfect fit.<br/>\"The course was diverse-I gained hands-on experience, from fieldwork on volcanic beaches in Tenerife, to lab work studying gemstones under a microscope. Still, I was most drawn to topics on climate change and sustainability within urban settings.<br/>\"I then went on to complete a master's in global energy and climate policy. While studying, I developed a particular interest in transport decarbonisation. It's a complex, multidisciplinary challenge that touches on urban planning, climate action, behaviour change, and public health. I liked that transport connects people and communities. At the same time, vehicle electrification was picking up pace, so I focused on understanding electric vehicle technology, its opportunities and challenges.<br/>\"After graduating, I completed a couple of internships that combined electrification with climate action planning. Since then, I've worked exclusively in climate-related roles in the public sector: first with a local authority, then Transport for London, and now the Mayor of London's office. These roles have deepened my expertise in climate mitigation, the energy transition and zero-emission transport, all within the urban context.<br/>\"I currently work in the Mayor's green finance team, understanding how we can bring in third-party finance to London's decarbonisation and adaptation goals.\"<br/>My biggest career achievement to date has been:<br/>\"Navigating uncertainty and driving progress in emerging fields. When I first began working on electric vehicle deployment in 2017, the sector was still in its infancy and only a handful of us across London were addressing the challenge.<br/>\"Amid rapidly evolving policies and technology, I helped shape London's electric vehicle policy and pioneer new design standards for charging infrastructure, laying the groundwork for future growth.<br/>\"Similarly, the green finance sector in London is still a nascent policy area. Drawing on my experience, I've been able to help shape this emerging space by identifying foundational building blocks, convening critical players and articulating a clear, collaborative path forward which previously didn't exist.<br/>\"More broadly, I'm proud to contribute to the Mayor's net-zero ambitions from multiple angles, gaining a holistic perspective on the city's climate action journey.\"<br/>The biggest challenge I have encountered has been:<br/>\"When I first started my career, I struggled with impostor syndrome.<br/>\"As a young South Asian woman in a field largely dominated by white men, it was hard to reconcile that with the diverse social circles I'd grown up in. I knew I had the knowledge, but I often doubted myself.<br/>\"It took a good few years of unlearning those feelings to build the confidence to share my ideas openly. Having supportive colleagues along the way made a huge difference in helping me find my voice.\"<br/>If I had to describe my generation in a word or phrase, I would say:<br/>\"Bold and unafraid!\"<br/>My focus areas for the coming 12 months are:<br/>\"Over the past few months, I've collaborated with colleagues across London to develop a net-zero project pipeline valued at \u00a335bn.

We need business leaders to do the same. That means moving beyond quarterly thinking and investing in business models that support both environmental limits and social equity.<br/>\"Businesses have the resources and influence to drive systemic change, but only if they're willing to lead with integrity and take a whole-systems view. Aligning with public sector goals like net-zero and climate adaptation goes beyond ethics - it's good strategy for a liveable, stable future for all.\"<br/>My advice to young people considering a sustainability career is:<br/>\"Climate change is a vast and multifaceted field, touching everything from finance to infrastructure to social justice. My advice to someone starting out is to take time to explore and find the areas you're genuinely passionate about. Be intentional about the projects and roles you take on, ensuring they align with your values and interests.

It's about restoring justice and facilitating the ability of all people to live in dignity,\" stated UN chief Ant\u00f3nio Guterres as the fourth Financing for Development Summit began.<br/>The US participated in the lead-up to the Summit but skipped out on the event itself, after the Trump Administration withdrew support for the UN's sustainable development agenda earlier this year. It has stated that it has a mandate to put national interests above international interests.<br/>that the summit demonstrated \"optimism for multilateralism\" in the face of \"massive headwinds\" undermining international cooperation.<br/>But NGOs have said that the formal agreement, is strong on rhetoric but short on new actions.<br/>Instead, they have pointed out leadership elsewhere. Spain, Brazil, Chile and South Africa launched a new global coalition to advocate for an end to tax loopholes for the ultra-rich. Their priorities are improving data to expose gaps in tax systems and combat evasion and avoidance. They are also advocating for a global wealth registry, to create transparency around who the world's 1% are.<br/>Brazil's Minister-Counsellor to the UN, Jos\u00e9 Gilberto Scandiucci, said that the ideas should not be considered extremely leftist. He said: \"This is a moderate initiative to confront a very radical reality.\"<br/>The coalition builds on an agreement struck by the G20 last year to develop a joint tax agenda for high-net-worth individuals.<br/>Oxfam's global policy lead Hernan Saenz said:\u00a0\"Despite the lacklustre ambition of the Sevilla Commitment, where\u00a0rich countries shirked their responsibility to act on the debt crisis and continued to embrace the private finance first approach to development, this conference also showed what international cooperation can achieve when there is political will for it.\u00a0<br/>\" found that the new wealth of the top 1% surged by over 33.9$ trillion since 2015. This is enough to end annual poverty 22 times over, yet over three billion people still live in countries that spend more on debt repayments than on education or health.\"<br/>What's in the Sevilla Commitment?<br/>The Sevilla Commitment document states that the world is \"falling short\" on much of the sustainable development agenda, including financing for climate mitigation, adaptation and loss and damage.<br/>It stipulates that national governments should account for environmental issues including food security and extreme weather when planning national budgets.<br/>Internationally, they should work towards more pre-arranged financing to be released before extreme weather events hit, based on improved early warnings. Leaders further agreed that there is a need for international financing to comprise less high-interest loans, and more grants and low-interest options. They promised to promote pauses to debt repayments when countries are hit by climate disasters.<br/>International efforts to help highly indebted countries that often face disasters, the Commitment document stipulates, could be centralised at the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. These channels could facilitate the scaling of debt swaps.<br/>The Commitment further states that the \"means of implementation\" to scale up climate finance and loss and damage funding needs to be improved.<br/>Bronwen Tucker, finance manager at Oil Change International said that \"much stronger government investment and co-ordination is needed\", and rich nations cannot keep \"pedalling the idea\" that the private sector can manage the low-carbon transition in and of itself.<br/>Tucker said: \"We need to see rich countries like the EU, Canada, Japan, and the UK agree to a UN debt workout mechanism and pay their fair share of public grant-based climate finance.<br/>\"In a shifting geopolitical order, anything else is not just immoral but incredibly short-sighted.

Anderson Foundation. Taking inspiration from Project Drawdown\u00ae, the world's leading resource for taking action on climate change, Drawdown Georgia localized that work by identifying the 20 highest-impact solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in our state over the next decade.<br/><br/>This framework focuses on climate solutions in five sectors: transportation, buildings  materials, food  agriculture, electricity, and land sinks. It considers how these solutions can reduce emissions and advance \"beyond carbon\" priorities, including equity, economic development, public health, and nurturing the larger environment.<br/><br/>Drawdown Georgia has grown into a \"leader-full\" movement, bringing together many organizations, universities, companies, leaders, and funders who are working to advance climate solutions in Georgia, including members of the Drawdown Georgia Business Compact, Drawdown Georgia Congregations, and Drawdown Georgia Higher Education.

Both sides held cordial meetings on moving forward with the technical works on the border, according to an official attending the meeting, expected to conclude on 29 July. Nepal and India formed the BWG in 2014 to resolve border disputes and address future problems. The sixth meeting of the BWG was held in (northern Indian city) Dehradun in 2019. It has been tasked to construct, repair, restore boundary pillars, clear the no man's land, and undertake global positioning of the border pillars. It has also been tasked to maintain a joint record of nationals of one country farming on land on the other side of the border and resolve such problems.

However, the committee could not finish its work in areas such as Susta, Lipu Lekh, Limpiyadhura and Kalapani. The boundary demarcation work was suspended in December 2007.

Through this bill, the government seeks to undermine the autonomy of the council, with the National Assembly [upper house of parliament] playing a contributing role. The government's primary aim appears to be gaining influence over the appointment and dismissal of the council's chairman and other officials. Unless such provisions - intended to transform a quasi-judicial body into a tool of serving government interests - are removed, the notion of 'full press freedom' risks being relegated to a mere preamble in the constitution. The bill, which has already been passed by the Assembly, is now under consideration in the House of Representatives' [lower house of parliament] Education, Health and Information Technology Committee. This represents a critical opportunity to revise and rectify the controversial provisions. The committee must defend press freedom to uphold the spirit of the constitution. &amp;#8230;Reporters without Borders, which assesses press freedom through political, economic, legal, sociocultural and security perspectives, has concluded that the press freedom in Nepal continues to deteriorate. In its 2025 report, Nepal ranked 90th out of 180 countries with a score of 55.2 - down from 74th place with a score of 60.52 in 2024. In this context, legal measures should be taken to safeguard press freedom in Nepal. Any further attempts to restrict it will harm Nepal's international reputation. The government's role in the appointment of officials in oversight bodies that are meant to monitor and scrutinise its own actions must be curtailed. Instead, the parliament should be actively involved in the appointment process, and the council should be made accountable to it.

The interest rates are being revised amid the rising per capita income of the Nepalese, the news report noted. The Ministry of Finance announced that, beginning 1 July, the World Bank has revised the interest rates from 0.75% to 1.5%. The bank has also reduced the repayment period from the current 40 years to 30 years. According to the Economic Survey for the fiscal year 2024-25, the per capita income of Nepalese has increased to $1,496. Dhani Ram Sharma, head of the International Economic Cooperation Coordination Division (IECCD) of the Ministry of Finance, said the bank decided to revise the interest rate based on the per capita income and the country's capacity for debt repayment. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) together provide 80% of development assistance to Nepal. Both banks have already announced their country partner framework or strategy. Japan, Nepal's major development partner, has increased the interest rate on loans from 0.1% to 2%, the news report noted.

During his visit to China in September 2024, Minister of Finance Bishnu Prasad Paudel requested the Chinese government to open the Olangchung Gola and Kimathanka routes. The Chinese government responded by asking for details on the project. However, the Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not been able to respond to the Chinese request for the plan yet. In November 2024, China's department of commerce wrote a letter addressed to the Nepalese Consulate General in Lhasa asking for details. \"Nepalese leaders visit China and request opening the trade routes\", an official in the ministry was quoted as saying. \"China takes an interest with alacrity.

In a unanimous decision, all 15 judges on the ICJ concluded that climate change poses a threat to the existence of human lives, ecosystems and the planet itself. The court called for concrete action by wealthy nations - who bear greater responsibility for excessive greenhouse gas emissions - to confront this urgent challenge. It further determined that those harmed by human-caused climate change may be entitled to repatriation. &amp;#8230;The ICJ verdict carries relevance and significance for each country. From the perspective of climate vulnerability, Nepal is among those most at risk. The issue is particularly pressing given the climate change impact on Nepal's economy and society. Nepal must prioritise implementing its climate policies, protecting marginalised communities - including indigenous nationalities, women, farmers and workers and oppressed communities - and pursuing climate-friendly and sustainable development goals. However, Nepal has yet to fully confront the gravity of the climate crisis. Strengthening legal frameworks, effective institutional structures, and strong political will are essential to meet these challenges.

The Himalayan Food International Private Limited, a private Nepalese company, will invest an additional 7bn rupees ($50.49m). The FDI will be the largest in the meat industry, producing annually 200,000 tons and 55,000 tons of byproducts such as leather. The industry will be in the Marin Rural Municipality in Sindhuli District, providing jobs for 5,156 people when it operates at full capacity. The meat export is expected to start after two years. \"Several Chinese companies wanted to collaborate for the meat export from Nepal\", said Navin Sharma, chairman of Himalayan Food International. \"We sought a partnership with a major Chinese company for collaboration on farming too,\" he added. At least 500,000 farmers are to be affiliated with the venture. China is the world's largest consumer of meat, which is imported from countries such as Australia, Argentina and Brazil. The two companies agreed to export meat from February 2026. However, the project has been delayed by six months due to land ceiling and other legal and technical issues.

Rabe quickly realized that a common thread among all participants was an interest in understanding and reducing e-waste and its impact on the environment.<br/><br/>'I came in with the idea of us co-authoring a case study,' Rabe said. However, the writing-intensive process was initially daunting to those students who were used to conducting applied research. Once Rabe created sub-groups with discrete tasks, the steps for researching, writing, and iterating a case study became more approachable.<br/><br/>For Ellie Bultena, an undergraduate student studying linguistics and philosophy and a contributor to the study, that meant conducting field research on the loading dock of MIT's Stata Center, where students and faculty go 'crufting' through piles of clunky printers, broken computers, and used lab equipment discarded by the Institute's labs, departments, and individual users.<br/><br/>Although not a formally sanctioned activity on-campus, 'crufting' is the act of gleaning usable parts from these junk piles to be repurposed into new equipment or art. Bultena's respondents, who opted to be anonymous, said that MIT could do better when it comes to the amount of e-waste generated and suggested that formal strategies could be implemented to encourage community members to repair equipment more easily or recycle more formally.<br/><br/>Rabe, now an education program director at the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, is hopeful that through the Zero-Carbon Campus Initiative, which commits MIT to eliminating all direct emissions by 2050, MIT will ultimately become a model for other higher education institutions.<br/><br/>Although the group lacked the time and resources to travel to communities in the Global South that they profiled in their case study, members leaned into exhaustive secondary research, collecting data on how some countries are irresponsibly dumping e-waste.

Once Rabe created sub-groups with discrete tasks, the steps for researching, writing, and iterating a case study became more approachable.<br/><br/>For Ellie Bultena, an undergraduate student studying linguistics and philosophy and a contributor to the study, that meant conducting field research on the loading dock of MIT's Stata Center, where students and faculty go 'crufting' through piles of clunky printers, broken computers, and used lab equipment discarded by the Institute's labs, departments, and individual users.<br/><br/>Although not a formally sanctioned activity on-campus, 'crufting' is the act of gleaning usable parts from these junk piles to be repurposed into new equipment or art. Bultena's respondents, who opted to be anonymous, said that MIT could do better when it comes to the amount of e-waste generated and suggested that formal strategies could be implemented to encourage community members to repair equipment more easily or recycle more formally.<br/><br/>Rabe, now an education program director at the MIT Environmental Solutions Initiative, is hopeful that through the Zero-Carbon Campus Initiative, which commits MIT to eliminating all direct emissions by 2050, MIT will ultimately become a model for other higher education institutions.<br/><br/>Although the group lacked the time and resources to travel to communities in the Global South that they profiled in their case study, members leaned into exhaustive secondary research, collecting data on how some countries are irresponsibly dumping e-waste. In contrast, others have developed alternative solutions that can be duplicated elsewhere and scaled.<br/><br/>'We source materials, manufacture them, and then throw them away,' Lelia Hampton says. A PhD candidate in electrical engineering and computer science and another co-author, Hampton jumped at the opportunity to serve in a writing role, bringing together the sub-groups research findings. 'I'd never written a case study, and it was exciting. Now I want to write 10 more.'<br/><br/>The content directly informed Hampton's dissertation research, which 'looks at applying machine learning to climate justice issues such as urban heat islands.' She said that writing a case study that is accessible to general audiences upskilled her for the non-profit organization she's determined to start. 'It's going to provide communities with free resources and data needed to understand how they are impacted by climate change and begin to advocate against injustice,' Hampton explains.<br/><br/>Dunca, Liu, Rabe, Bultena, and Hampton are joined on the case study by fellow authors Mrinalini Singha, a graduate student in the Art, Culture, and Technology program; Sungmoon Lim, a graduate student in urban studies and planning and EECS; Lauren Higgins, an undergraduate majoring in political science; and Madeline Schlegal, a Northeastern University co-op student.<br/><br/>Taking the case study to classrooms around the world<br/><br/>Although PhD candidates have contributed to previous case studies in the series, this publication is the first to be co-authored with MIT undergraduates. Like any other peer-reviewed journal, before publication, the SERC Scholars' case study was anonymously reviewed by senior scholars drawn from various fields.<br/><br/>The series editor, David Kaiser, also served as one of SERC's inaugural associate deans and helped shape the program. 'The case studies, by design, are short, easy to read, and don't take up lots of time,' Kaiser explained. 'They are gateways for students to explore, and instructors can cover a topic that has likely already been on their mind.' This semester, Kaiser, the Germeshausen Professor of the History of Science and a professor of physics, is teaching STS.004 (Intersections: Science, Technology, and the World), an undergraduate introduction to the field of science, technology, and society. The last month of the semester has been dedicated wholly to SERC case studies, one of which is: 'From Mining to E-Waste.'<br/><br/>Hampton was visibly moved to hear that the case study is being used at MIT but also by some of the 250,000 visitors to the SERC platform, many of whom are based in the Global South and directly impacted by the issues she and her cohort researched. 'Many students are focused on climate, whether through computer science, data science, or mechanical engineering. I hope that this case study educates them on environmental and climate aspects of e-waste and computing.'<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]     </p>", "publisher": "M2 PressWIRE", "instances": ["December 16, 2024Release date- 13122024 - rought together as part of the Social and Ethical Responsibilities of Computing (SERC) initiative within the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing, a community of students known as SERC Scholars is collaborating to examine the most urgent problems humans face in the digital landscape. Each semester, students from all levels from across MIT are invited to join a different topical working group led by a SERC postdoctoral associate. Each group delves into a specific issue - such as surveillance or data ownership - culminating in a final project presented at the end of the term. Typically, students complete the program with hands-on experience conducting research in a new cross-disciplinary field. However, one group of undergraduate and graduate students recently had the unique opportunity to enhance their resume by becoming published authors of a case study about the environmental and climate justice implications of the electronics hardware life cycle. Although it's not uncommon for graduate students to co-author case studies, it's unusual for undergraduates to earn this opportunity - and for their audience to be other undergraduates around the world. Our team was insanely interdisciplinary,' says Anastasia Dunca, a junior studying computer science and one of the co-authors. 'I joined the SERC Scholars Program because I liked the idea of being part of a cohort from across MIT working on a project that utilized all of our skillsets.

Life cycle assessment and circular economy are proposed as mechanisms for analyzing environmental and climate justice issues in the electronics life cycle. Rather than posing solutions, the case study offers readers entry points for further discussion and for assessing their own individual responsibility as producers of e-waste.
