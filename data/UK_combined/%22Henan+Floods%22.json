[{"relevance_score": 45, "title": "Emergency Deployment of Japanese F-15J Fighter Jets Against a Chinese GJ-2 Drone Off Coast of Okinawa", "published": "2025-03-04", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">On February 26, 2025, Japans Self-Defense Forces detected a Chinese GJ-2 reconnaissance and attack drone operating near Okinawa. This unprecedented event led to the immediate deployment of Japanese fighter jets. The incursion occurred amid rising tensions in the East China Sea, where Chinas military activities have been increasing, raising concerns about Beijings strategic objectives in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan identified the entry of a BZK-005 reconnaissance drone into its expanded airspace, along with a Chengdu GJ-2, also known as the Wing Loong 2, for the first time. These aircraft, originating from the East China Sea, passed through the airspace between Okinawas main island and Miyako Island before entering the Pacific Ocean. They continued south of Okinawa, flying near the Amami Oshima Islands in Kagoshima Prefecture, before reversing course and returning to the East China Sea via the same route. In response to this activity, Japans Air Self-Defense Force promptly scrambled fighter jets from the Southwestern Air Defense Command to intercept and monitor the drones. This command operates the 9th Air Wing, which fields Mitsubishi F-15J fighters, a Japanese variant of the F-15 Eagle, optimized for the country's air defense missions.</p><p>The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan represents a significant development. This Medium-Altitude, Long-Endurance (MALE) drone is designed for both reconnaissance and strike missions, enhancing China's ability to project power in contested areas. While the GJ-2 has previously been observed over the Taiwan Strait, its operation near Okinawa indicates an expansion of Chinas unmanned aerial operations in the region. The increasing use of drones by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) reflects a broader strategy to leverage these systems for advanced surveillance, targeting, and potentially precision strikes while reducing risks to human pilots.</p><p>The Wing Loong II, developed by the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), is an upgraded version of the Wing Loong I, offering improved payload capacity, endurance, and operational versatility. First unveiled at the 2015 Aviation Expo China, it was designed to meet the growing requirements of the Chinese military and international buyers. Measuring 11 meters in length with a 20.5-meter wingspan and a maximum speed of 370 km/h, it is powered by a turbocharged engine driving a three-bladed propeller. With an endurance of 32 hours and an operational range of 1,500 km, it is well-suited for extended surveillance missions in strategic areas.</p><p>Equipped with satellite communications and an electro-optical sensor suite that includes daylight and infrared cameras, the Wing Loong II can operate in both day and night conditions across various environments. It has a payload capacity of 400 kg, spread across six hardpoints, enabling it to carry guided bombs such as the FT-9/50, air-to-ground missiles like the TL-10, and GB3 250 kg bombs. Compared to its predecessor, which had a limited payload of 100 kg over two hardpoints, this expanded capability positions the Wing Loong II as a more advanced armed drone. Remotely piloted from a mobile ground control station, it provides real-time secure data transmission for operational flexibility.</p><p>Primarily developed for export, the Wing Loong II has been acquired by several countries, including Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Serbia. It is marketed as a cost-effective alternative to Western drones such as the U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper, with an estimated unit price between $1 million and $2 million, compared to approximately $30 million for a Reaper. This affordability and versatility make it an attractive option for militaries seeking to enhance their strike and surveillance capabilities. The drone has been used in various conflicts, including Libya, where it conducted airstrikes under Emirati control in 2020. It has also been deployed for non-military missions, such as disaster response during the 2021 Henan floods, where a modified Wing Loong II variant carried out reconnaissance and communication relay operations.</p><p>The presence of the GJ-2 near Japan aligns with broader regional tensions in the East China Sea. This area, particularly around the Senkaku Islandsadministered by Japan but claimed by China as the Diaoyu Islandshas seen frequent incursions by Chinese military aircraft. Just two days before the GJ-2 incident, Japan detected two Chinese Y-9 military aircraft flying a similar route between the East China Sea and the Pacific Ocean. The Y-9, a multi-role aircraft used for intelligence gathering and maritime patrol, is regularly involved in such operations, prompting Japan to deploy fighters in response.</p><p>Japans Ministry of Defense has raised concerns about China's increasing military presence and its potential impact on regional stability. Although the Chinese drones did not violate Japans sovereign airspace, their proximity is seen as a show of force and a possible attempt to test Japans air defense response. A spokesperson for Japans Joint Staff confirmed that the country is maintaining constant airspace surveillance and will take all necessary measures to ensure security.</p><p>This Chinese drone incursion coincides with the U.S.-Japan joint military exercise \"Iron Fist,\" which runs until March 7 and involves maneuvers across multiple locations, including Okinawa. During this exercise, the simultaneous presence of the GJ-2 and BZK-005 near Japanese islands raises questions about potential surveillance activities or strategic messaging from Beijing. The PLA has previously escalated operations in response to military exercises conducted by the U.S. and its allies, highlighting an ongoing competition for influence in the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>The growing integration of drones into China's military strategy presents a challenge for Japan and its partners, who must adapt their defense capabilities to counter these evolving threats. The potential use of armed drones near Japans territory raises considerations about strengthening detection, interception, and counter-drone measures. As China continues to expand its military presence in the region, Japan and its allies remain vigilant, closely monitoring any developments that could alter the strategic balance in the East China Sea and the broader Indo-Pacific.</p>", "publisher": "Defence Monitor Worldwide", "instances": ["It is marketed as a cost-effective alternative to Western drones such as the U.

Return on equity improved to 6. 9% in 2020 from 1. 8% in 2019. The company continues to tap on growth potential in traditional yearly renewable-term business with underlying risks mainly in medical and critical illness products, while dynamically adjusting its risk appetite in long-term savings and financial reinsurance businesses in view of changes in the operating environment. Notwithstanding, AM Best expects the company's non-life underwriting result to face negative pressure from some major catastrophe and risk losses in 2021, including the Henan floods in China. However, the growing stream of investment income has contributed to support overall earnings over the past few years. QHR is a composite reinsurer controlled by three Chinese state-owned enterprises, and plays a strategic role in the development of the Qianhai Free Trade Zone. Despite its short operating history, the company has established diversified non-life underwriting portfolios in the domestic China market and several markets in Asia Pacific. The stable outlooks reflect AM Best's expectation that the new management team will lead the company successfully to execute its business plan and capital management plan without material adverse deviation. It also is expected that QHR will maintain its solid risk-adjusted capitalisation with continued strong shareholder support."]}, {"relevance_score": 1, "title": "BBC row with China blows up as

racked up tens of billions of dollars in damage, a charity has warned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A report from Christian Aid, which highlights 15 of the worst weather extremes including floods, storms and droughts this year, warns they caused death and displacement around the world, as well as financial costs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And as the impacts of rising temperatures on more extreme weather become ever clearer, people in the UK think climate change should be a top priority for the Government in 2022, above healthcare and the economy, according to a poll for the aid agency.</p><p>The report says 10 of the extreme events each cost more than 1.5 billion US dollars (\u00a31.1 billion), including Hurricane Ida in the US in August which cost 65 billion dollars (\u00a349 billion) and July's floods across parts of Europe which totalled 43 billion dollars (\u00a333 billion) of damage.</p><p>Most of the estimates for financial costs only include insured losses, so the real price is likely to be much higher, Christian Aid said.</p><p>Financial costs of disasters are usually greater in rich countries which have higher property values and can afford insurance.</p><p>But some of the most devastating extremes in 2021 have hit poor nations which have contributed little to the problem of climate change, and where the disasters cause food shortages and force thousands to flee their homes, such as floods in South Sudan which displaced more than 850,000 people.</p><p>Four of the 10 most expensive disasters were in Asia, with floods and cyclones causing damage totalling 24 billion US dollars (\u00a318 billion).</p><p>These included torrential rains in the Chinese province of Henan, which caused massive floods, the death of 302 people and damage amounting to 17.6 billion dollars (\u00a313.3 billion), the report said.</p><p>A warming world is driving more intense rainstorms and making Pacific typhoons and Indian Ocean cyclones more extreme, the report said.</p><p>Europe's extreme rainfall in July, which caused floods in Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg that killed at least 240 people and cost more than 43 billion dollars, was made more likely and heavier because of climate change, scientists have found.</p><p>Climate change could even be having an effect on extreme cold spells, such as the one in Texas in February which may have been influenced by a rapidly warming Arctic, and cold weather in April in France which wreaked havoc on vineyards that are coming into bud earlier in the year because of rising temperatures.</p><p>Insurer Aon has said that 2021 is expected to be the sixth time global natural catastrophes have crossed the 100 billion dollar insured loss threshold, with all six happening since 2011, the report said.</p><p>Polling by Savanta ComRes, released alongside the report, asked 2,197 people what the UK Government's new year resolution for 2022 should be focused on.</p><p>Climate change and the environment topped the list with 27% of people opting for it, ahead of healthcare on 23% and the economy on 19%, the poll found.</p><p>Dr Kat Kramer, Christian Aid's climate policy lead

world.</p><p>``Be it storms and floods in some of the world's richest countries or droughts and heatwaves in some of the poorest, the climate crisis hit hard in 2021.''</p><p>She said that while there
