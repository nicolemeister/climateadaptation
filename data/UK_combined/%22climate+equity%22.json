Investor members collectively oversee $80trn of assets under management.<br/>Read on for Ridwaan's answers to our questions.<br/>How I got to where I am now:<br/>\"I spent part of my childhood visiting family in the Horn of Africa, where conversations often centred on the harvest: whether rain would come, if the drought would last, or how crops were holding up. From a young age, I saw how climate shocks like droughts and floods were part of daily life, not distant risks, and how much they disrupted communities who relied on agriculture for both income and food security. It made me ask why this was happening. The more I learned about climate change, the clearer it became that those who contributed least were paying the highest price. That early understanding shaped how I see sustainability and why I chose to work in it.<br/>\"I joined FAIRR in 2024. At FAIRR, I work across climate, equity, and investment strategy to ensure sustainability transitions deliver for the people most affected by them. I help shape FAIRR's approach to a Just Transition, defining what it means for the global food system and demonstrating how it can add value across climate, nature, and social workstreams. The goal is to build a shared understanding internally and provide investors with practical ways to engage on transition risks and equity.<br/>\"Right now, I am helping update FAIRR's regenerative agriculture framework to reflect real-world complexity. That includes the financial realities farmers face, whether related to income stability, access to fair labour conditions, or resilience against economic shocks.<br/>\"The transition to a low-carbon food system is already underway. The question is whether it will be designed to include everyone.\"<br/>My biggest career achievement to date has been:<br/>\"Helping to drive a multi-stage project at FAIRR that culminated in a high-level roundtable at biodiversity COP16 in Cali, Colombia, last year. The aim was to explore how investors can finance a Just Transition to regenerative agriculture.<br/>\"We brought together global food companies, financial institutions, and civil society to discuss how capital can support farmer livelihoods while reducing environmental impact. I helped shape the research, stakeholder engagement, and design of the roundtable itself, which turned months of background work into meaningful action with global stakeholders.\"<br/>The biggest challenge I have encountered has been:<br/>\"Showing that a Just Transition isn't a 'nice-to-have' - it is essential for resilience and long-term value. Many companies prioritise decarbonisation but overlook how these shifts affect livelihoods, incomes, and communities. When transition plans exclude people, the result can be disruption, unrest and rising future costs.<br/>\"That's why my work focuses on grounding Just Transition in data, risk and materiality, not sentiment. It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about ensuring supply chains remain stable, business models remain viable, and transitions are delivered effectively.<br/>\"For this to happen, we need more than climate ambition. We need real financial flows, not just loans, and practical support for those delivering change on the ground.\"<br/>I would describe my generation as:<br/>\"Carrying the costs of inaction.\"<br/>For me, a successful 12 months ahead looks like:<br/>\"Laying the foundation for a Just Transition strategy at FAIRR that integrates across internal workstreams such as regenerative agriculture, antimicrobial resistance, and protein diversification.<br/>\"The goal is to ensure transition planning reflects both climate ambition and the real-world social and economic conditions facing farmers, workers, and Indigenous communities.<br/>\"I'll also contribute to the refresh of FAIRR's Four Labours of Regenerative Agriculture\u00a0report. My focus is on strengthening the social dimension by supporting the inclusion of Just Transition best practices and indicators, as part of a broader team effort.\"<br/>Outside of my day job, I enjoy:<br/>\"Helping to lead Somalis for Sustainability, an initiative that I co-founded. It focuses on elevating climate issues in the Horn of Africa and creating space for young professionals to engage with climate justice. We work on building community, raising awareness, and connecting local challenges to global climate discussions. A highlight has been working with partners to deliver Somalia's first Local Conference of Youth (LCOY), which contributed to the country's first-ever National Youth Statement feeding into YOUNGO's Global Statement for the UNFCCC.<br/>\"Alongside this, I've picked up running as a new hobby and, as a beginner, have set myself the goal of completing at least two half marathons this year. Unfortunately, they're a week apart! But running with friends makes training enjoyable.<br/>\"I've also fallen into the padel craze and am enjoying the challenge of learning something new. These outlets help me stay balanced and recharged.\"<br/>My 'Mission Possible' message to business leaders is:<br/>\"We must move beyond seeing sustainability as simply reducing harm. The opportunity is to build systems that restore ecosystems, improve lives, and create shared value for people, nature, and business.<br/>\"So, sustainability must be holistic. It is not just about carbon or nature. Social impact, including livelihoods, fair work, and community resilience, is inseparable from environmental goals. One without the other is not sustainability. Climate justice must be central, especially as the Global South has long shouldered the consequences of a crisis it contributed least to.<br/>\"The first movers will be the businesses that act now. Do not wait for perfect data or outside pressure. Choose to lead. The cost of inaction will outweigh the investment in a planned, inclusive, and just transition. This is the chance to shape a future that is regenerative, resilient, and rooted in shared prosperity for people, communities, and planet.\"<br/>My advice for young people entering the sustainability profession is:<br/>\"Start by finding your people. The sustainability world is complex, spanning climate, food systems, equity, and nature. It's all connected, and no one makes sense of it alone. It took me a while to realise how important community is, but having people who challenge and support you makes all the difference.<br/>\"Learn from your peers. Find a mentor. Reach out to someone whose work you admire and ask for advice. The best guidance often comes from a single honest conversation.<br/>\"And hold onto your 'why'. It's easy to get swept up in frameworks, company assessments, and constant updates. When things feel overwhelming, return to that purpose. That's your anchor.\"<br/>To stay in the loop for the next round of annual nominations for the 30 Under 30,\u00a0.

The industry&amp;#8217;s annual CO2 emissions, contributing about 6-8% of the global total according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), must be tackled where textiles actually come to life: in manufacturing facilities across Asia, Africa, and Latin America.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The textile industry stands at a crossroads. The pressure to decarbonise is mounting as brands make bold commitments, regulations tighten, and consumers demand accountability. But the real work   implementing change   rests with suppliers who face unique operational and financial constraints that aren&amp;#8217;t always visible in sustainability discussions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This shift isn&amp;#8217;t about installing solar panels or tweaking a process here and there. It&amp;#8217;s about rethinking how textiles are made, questioning outdated systems, and addressing practical on-ground realities. The challenge isn&amp;#8217;t that solutions don&amp;#8217;t exist, it&amp;#8217;s that scaling them is an uphill battle.</p><p>The energy equation: who pays for decarbonisation?</p><p>Most of the industry&amp;#8217;s energy consumption is said to occur in dyeing and finishing, yet access to renewable energy remains inconsistent across manufacturing regions. Some have the infrastructure to support large-scale adoption, while others are still locked into fossil fuel dependency.</p><p>There&amp;#8217;s no debate that energy transition is necessary, but the approach raises questions: Who bears the cost? Should suppliers shoulder it alone? Why aren&amp;#8217;t brands investing more directly in supply chain decarbonisation beyond demanding emissions reductions? Meanwhile, suppliers operate on tight margins with limited access to capital for upgrades.</p><p>According to McKinsey, most decarbonisation actions in fashion manufacturing can be implemented at a cost of less than $50 per tonne of CO2, with limited impact on production costs. This finding presents an opportunity for strategic investment across the value chain, but requires thoughtful cost sharing between brands and suppliers.</p><p>Progressive manufacturers are making significant investments. Interloop Limited in Pakistan powers 51% of its energy through renewables, having phased out coal entirely. Pratibha Syntex in India, with support from Good Fashion Fund s $4.5m loan, is saving 50% in energy water, and materials.</p><p>While financing options are emerging, navigating them remains a challenge. In Pakistan, the State Bank&amp;#8217;s green schemes and NAMA Support Project&amp;#8217;s low-interest loans for textile SMEs, remain insufficient for the scale of transformation needed. The funding landscape is fractured, creating uneven access that disadvantages suppliers working across multiple brand portfolios.</p><p>Achieving net-zero industry-wide requires financing models that create equitable distribution of costs. What s missing is coordinated investment that matches the scale of our climate ambitions. Brands with decarbonisation funds tend to invest where they can book the maximum advantage for their product footprints. For multi-category suppliers working with several customers, this complicates funding access and slows progress.</p><p>Credit: Interloop.</p><p>Regulations: a compliance burden or an opportunity?</p><p>The wave of climate regulations, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD), the EU&amp;#8217;s Fit for 55 package, the US Inflation Reduction Act, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), is designed to drive accountability. But for suppliers, it often translates into another layer of complexity they must navigate alone. Many operate in regions where regulatory frameworks are still evolving, making compliance both a logistical and financial challenge.</p><p>Some might argue compliance is simply the cost of doing business today, but this overlooks major regional disparities in infrastructure, resources, and governmental support. While EU suppliers can access programmes like the Just Transition Fund to finance their green transition, manufacturers in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka often lack similar support mechanisms.

In addition, the rating incorporates IMEA's strong operating risk profile, stable financial performance trends, and very low leverage.<br/><br/>The strong operating risk profile is driven by a low-cost burden and diversifying resource base. While IMEA's resources are still predominantly coal-fired, the agency continues to add renewable resources and uses short-term agreements for capacity and energy, as well as market purchases to meet demand. Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources, which coupled with rate-raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-looking stress scenario.<br/><br/>The ratings also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net-zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant standards that require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032. IMEA, a partial owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA carbon reduction milestones. Additionally, the Trimble County coal units in northern Kentucky, in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards, should they be upheld by the current administration.<br/><br/>Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation. Fitch will monitor developments with respect to meeting statewide and federal carbon reduction targets and assess any potential impact on IMEA's future costs, capital needs or operations as they become known over time.<br/><br/>SECURITY<br/><br/>The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the power supply system after payment of operating and maintenance expenses. Net revenues consist primarily of payments received by IMEA pursuant to long-term take-and-pay all-requirements power sales contracts with 32 participating members.<br/><br/>KEY RATING DRIVERS<br/><br/>This is a text exhibit 'USPF - GRE KCD'. See instructions in side pane.<br/><br/>Revenue Defensibility - 'aa'<br/><br/>Long-Term Contracts, Strong Member Credit Quality<br/><br/>IMEA's revenue defensibility is very strong due to its long-term all-requirements power supply contracts with members, autonomous rate-setting authority, and strong underlying credit quality of its largest members. IMEA serves its 32 members across the state of Illinois, pursuant to all-requirements contracts that include provisions for an implied, unlimited step-up across members. Additionally, the IMEA board has full authority over rate setting. The agency initiated the contract renewal process in March 2024 to extend the power supply contracts' termination date from Sept. 30, 2035 to May 31, 2055. IMEA has secured extensions for 84%, or 27 of the 32 members, which equates to approximately 50% of member revenue.<br/><br/>Revenue defensibility also considers the strong purchaser credit quality of the largest members, the cities of Naperville and St. Charles, and the agency's very strong rate flexibility. The credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles is characterized by midrange and very strong net margins and cash cushion, respectively. Both cities have sound demographic and socioeconomic trends within the respective service areas and maintain rate setting autonomy. Naperville and St. Charles have yet to extend their power sales contracts beyond 2035 but are still considering a long-term extension.<br/><br/>Operating Risk - 'a'<br/><br/>Diverse, Low-Cost Resource Base<br/><br/>The strong operating risk assessment is driven by the agency's low operating cost burden of 6.7 cents/kWh and access to a diverse mix of available purchased power and generation resources to meet its almost 1,000 MW of load requirements and maintain at least a 15% operating reserve margin. Generation resources include ownership interests in the Trimble County units and PSEC. Both plants are coal-fired units that could be impacted by state and federal regulations. Favorably, IMEA is increasingly diversifying its resource base with the addition of low-cost wind and solar energy power purchase agreements (PPAs). IMEA will complete debt service payments for both plants by 2035 and has set up a decommissioning fund for both plants starting on May 1, 2025<br/><br/>The operating risk assessment also reflects the low Fitch-calculated age of plant of 12 years and manageable capital expenditures, as the agency primarily spends on plant upkeep. The capital plan anticipates approximately $ 92 million in spending through 2029, which is expected to be funded with cash flow from operations. While near-term capital requirements are limited, proposed federal regulations to limit carbon emissions could require significant capital spending over the long term or limit dispatch, increasing PSEC and Trimble County's operating costs.<br/><br/>Financial Profile - 'aa'<br/><br/>Stable Margins, Very Low Leverage<br/><br/>IMEA's very strong financial profile assessment reflects consistently healthy operating margins, robust liquidity levels, and very low leverage, measured as net adjusted debt to adjusted funds available for debt service (FADS). Leverage was 4.7x in fiscal 2024 (ended April 30) and averaged 5.8x between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2024. Coverage of full obligations has consistently exceeded the 1.0x threshold and was 1.3x in fiscal 2024. The liquidity profile is neutral to the assessment. Unrestricted cash equaled 197 days on hand, while the agency's liquidity cushion, which factors in IMEA's $ 50 million in available lines of credit, was 284 days.<br/><br/>Fitch's Analytical Stress Test (FAST) scenario analysis reflects leverage on a downward trend in each year of the base case. The stress case, which is considered Fitch's rating case, shows leverage is expected to trend around 5.0x over the next five years due to no planned sizable debt issuances, continued debt amortization, and expectations for generally stable FADS.<br/><br/>With a relatively limited amount of debt remaining that will mature by 2035, Fitch also believes IMEA to be relatively well-positioned to meet longer-term challenges related to carbon reduction mandates and potential resource transition over the medium term.<br/><br/>Asymmetric Additional Risk Considerations<br/><br/>There are no additional asymmetric risk considerations affecting the rating at this time.<br/><br/>RATING SENSITIVITIES<br/><br/>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade<br/><br/>Adoption and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations and emission limitations than those included in the CEJA;<br/><br/>A leverage ratio that consistently trends above 8.0x through Fitch's rating case scenario;<br/><br/>A meaningful weakening in purchaser credit quality that shifts the revenue defensibility assessment lower.<br/><br/>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade<br/><br/>Actual and projected leverage in Fitch's rating case scenario consistently below 5.0x;<br/><br/>An improvement in purchaser credit quality that leads to a stronger purchaser credit quality PCQ assessment.<br/><br/>PROFILE<br/><br/>IMEA is a joint action agency comprised of 32 members located throughout the state of Illinois. It supplies all-requirements power to its members through long-term take-and-pay power sales contracts (PSC) that will expire in 2035. IMEA's members serve approximately 145,000 residential and 21,000 commercial and industrial accounts.<br/><br/>IMEA's increased proportion of owned generation over the past decade affords it greater control over power supply, while reducing its historical dependence on purchased power and providing cost stability to its members. The share of IMEA's total planned capacity provided from purchased power has declined to about 25% from nearly 80% in 2010. An integral part of this process was the acquisition of an ownership share of PSEC and Trimble County Unit 2.<br/><br/>In late 2021, the state of Illinois passed CEJA, which requires all electric generators to provide 100% clean energy generation statewide by 2050. This is likely to be accomplished by phasing out fossil fuel power plants, like PSEC, over time. According to the legislation, PSEC must reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035,with a three-year grace period, and eliminate emissions totally by YE 2045.<br/><br/>While the law provides the framework for a significant shift in the generation and delivery of energy for utilities like IMEA, Fitch believes the legislation's extended time horizon provides sufficient flexibility to address the carbon reduction requirements. Additionally, all of IMEA's outstanding debt, including the debt issued to finance PSEC, is scheduled to be retired by 2035, limiting the potential costs and obligations of managing future power supply on IMEA and its members, including the fixed-costs associated with future potential stranded assets. A lack of debt beyond 2035 also provides a degree of flexibility to manage potential resource transition and/or adoption and implementation of new technologies.<br/><br/>Sources of Information<br/><br/>In addition to the sources of information identified in Fitch's applicable criteria specified below, this action was informed by information from Lumesis.<br/><br/>REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING<br/><br/>The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.<br/><br/>ESG Considerations<br/><br/>The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

It supplies all-requirements power to its members through long-term take-and-pay power sales contracts (PSC) that will expire in 2035. IMEA's members serve approximately 145,000 residential and 21,000 commercial and industrial accounts.<br/><br/>IMEA's increased proportion of owned generation over the past decade affords it greater control over power supply, while reducing its historical dependence on purchased power and providing cost stability to its members. The share of IMEA's total planned capacity provided from purchased power has declined to about 25% from nearly 80% in 2010. An integral part of this process was the acquisition of an ownership share of PSEC and Trimble County Unit 2.<br/><br/>In late 2021, the state of Illinois passed CEJA, which requires all electric generators to provide 100% clean energy generation statewide by 2050. This is likely to be accomplished by phasing out fossil fuel power plants, like PSEC, over time. According to the legislation, PSEC must reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035,with a three-year grace period, and eliminate emissions totally by YE 2045.<br/><br/>While the law provides the framework for a significant shift in the generation and delivery of energy for utilities like IMEA, Fitch believes the legislation's extended time horizon provides sufficient flexibility to address the carbon reduction requirements. Additionally, all of IMEA's outstanding debt, including the debt issued to finance PSEC, is scheduled to be retired by 2035, limiting the potential costs and obligations of managing future power supply on IMEA and its members, including the fixed-costs associated with future potential stranded assets. A lack of debt beyond 2035 also provides a degree of flexibility to manage potential resource transition and/or adoption and implementation of new technologies.<br/><br/>Sources of Information<br/><br/>In addition to the sources of information identified in Fitch's applicable criteria specified below, this action was informed by information from Lumesis.<br/><br/>REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING<br/><br/>The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.<br/><br/>ESG Considerations<br/><br/>The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

In addition, the rating incorporates IMEA's strong operating risk profile, stable financial performance trends, and very low leverage. The strong operating risk profile is driven by a low-cost burden and diversifying resource base. While IMEA's resources are still predominantly coal-fired, the agency continues to add renewable resources and uses short-term agreements for capacity and energy, as well as market purchases to meet demand. Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources, which coupled with rate-raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-looking stress scenario. The ratings also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net-zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the current U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant standards that require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032. IMEA, a partial owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA carbon reduction milestones. Additionally, the Trimble County coal units in northern Kentucky, in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards, should they be upheld by the current administration. Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation."]}, {"relevance_score": 4, "title": "Deconstructing the (un)affordability of clean cooking fuels through a randomized trial in rural Tanzania", "published": "2025-09-09", "bodyText": "<p>Supplementary informationThe online version contains supplementary material available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-025-01778-w\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41560-025-01778-w</url>.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Publisher\u2019s note</emphasis> Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.</p>", "publisher": "Nature Energy", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 53, "title": "-BadCarbon $ 100 Million GEMS Catalytic Equity Drives Nexus Renewable Expansion", "published": "2025-03-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">DALLAS - Setting a new benchmark for renewable energy expansion in Texas, Nexus Renewable Power, LLC ('Nexus') and Bad Carbon, LLC ('BadCarbon') have announced a $ 100 million equity investment capitalizing Geologic Environmental Mineral Sequestration (GEMS) credits.

Africa stands at the nexus of several global transitions: demographic, energy, and agricultural. With 75% of its population under 35 years old, including 600 million people between ages 15 and 35, the continent is positioned to become the world's workforce. Its vast mineral resources-including critical materials for electric vehicles and renewable energy-make it indispensable to the global energy transition.<br/><br/>'Whether it is lithium-ion batteries, whether it is electric vehicles, whether it's platinum, whether it's copper, whether it's graphite, whether it's any of this lithium-ion, all is in Africa,' Adesina noted. 'So what Africa actually does with its resources will shape the future of the world.'<br/><br/>The narrative of a 'resource curse' that has long haunted Africa's development story also came under scrutiny at the summit.

This success is part of a broader push to industrialize the continent and move beyond raw commodity exports.<br/><br/>'The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,' Adesina emphasized. 'But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.'<br/><br/>Major initiatives are already underway to build this infrastructure. The African Development Bank Group is investing $ 3 billion in special agro-industrial processing zones, while 'Mission 300,' a partnership with the World Bank, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans.

This commitment is strategically divided: $ 50 million supports nonprofit grants that empower organizations driving climate and social impact, while the other $ 50 million is dedicated to equity and debt investments in early-stage climate startups (Seed to Series A) and venture funds.</p><p><br/><br/>As climate challenges accelerate and natural disasters intensify, the $ 50m climate investments program has refined its approach to impact investing by focusing on transformative, venture-backed technologies and solutions. Today, we're proud to announce the evolution and rebranding of our climate investments program as the Regenerative Future Fund.<br/><br/>This new name reflects our deep commitment to leveraging the Foundation's endowment to drive scalable, high-impact solutions. By investing in startups and venture funds that deliver measurable, transformative results, the Regenerative Future Fund focuses on regenerating ecosystems, strengthening community resilience, and advancing sustainable economies.<br/><br/>Beyond providing capital, the Fund embodies the Cisco Foundation's holistic approach: catalyzing market-driven, regenerative solutions that actively protect and renew our planet. With portfolio development support and a vision to accelerate the next wave of climate innovation, the Regenerative Future Fund is dedicated to creating a more sustainable, thriving future through its portfolio of solutions.<br/><br/>Why the Regenerative Future Fund?<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is part of our Cisco Foundation $ 100M Climate Impact and Regeneration commitment. It represents our belief in the power of climate impact investing to drive tangible, meaningful action. Through the Fund we will continue to invest in climate tech companies at the seed and series A stages, while also serving as a limited partner with early-stage venture funds advancing climate solutions. This dual approach enables us to support high-potential startups directly, de-risk key early-stage markets, and foster ecosystems of innovation through venture fund partnerships.<br/><br/>Our vision is to help build systems where humanity and nature thrive together. This rebranding signals a sharpened focus on technologies and solutions that regenerate rather than deplete and that strengthen resilience, particularly for communities most impacted by climate change. Our priorities include:<br/><br/>- Restoring and regenerating: Supporting innovations that replenish biodiversity, restore and build resilient ecosystems, and advance circular, regenerative economies.<br/><br/>- Prioritizing co-benefits, climate equity and inclusion: Championing solutions that promote resilience and equity in communities facing climate risks.<br/><br/>- Catalyzing lasting change: Investing in breakthrough ideas that reshape industries towards sustainability, such as regenerative agriculture and the built environment.<br/><br/>Why Now?<br/><br/>The climate tech investment landscape has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few years. After peaking in 2021 with a record $ 48 billion in global venture and growth equity investment, the sector saw a third successive year of decline in 2024, dropping to $ 30 billion-a 14% decrease from 2023 and a 37% drop from its 2021 peak (Sightline Climate). However, the climate tech sector has demonstrated resilience compared to the venture capital market, where investment volumes have plummeted by 52% since 2021, largely due to rising interest rates (KPMG). Carbon technology investing has bucked the overall trend, experiencing a 24% increase in venture capital investments in 2023, totaling $ 17.7 billion (Pitchbook). This surge has been driven by regulatory demand and corporate decarbonization goals, highlighting the growing importance of scalable carbon solutions.<br/><br/>Why Catalytic Impact Capital Is Still Needed: Catalytic capital like Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund is needed now more than ever to provide the funding required for first-of-a-kind and scaling innovations essential to meeting global climate goals (Foley Hoag). With their resources, networks, and influence, corporate foundations like Cisco Foundation can help elevate pioneering technologies and position them to be adopted and scaled by larger players in the tech ecosystems. By stepping in where the market falls short, catalytic funding can ensure that transformative solutions are scaled to deliver meaningful climate impact.<br/><br/>Early-Stage Climate Investments Hold Strong: Within the climate tech space, early-stage investments have shown remarkable durability. In 2023, 69% of climate tech deals were directed toward early-stage companies-an increase of 14 percentage points from the prior year (CB Insights). In addition, the overall financing picture for climate tech start-ups is evolving. While equity investments have declined, new forms of non-dilutive capital are stepping in. Debt financing for climate tech soared from $ 13.9 billion in 2021 to $ 45.6 billion in 2024, as companies transition from venture capital to bank loans and other funding sources (Net Zero Insights).<br/><br/>Gaps in Funding for Adaptation, Biodiversity, Decarbonization, and Nature: Despite these advances, critical funding gaps remain. Adaptation finance represents just 10% of global climate finance (UNEP), while investments in nature-based solutions and biodiversity remain underfunded despite their crucial role in combating climate change. Additionally, climate mitigation and decarbonization technologies still struggle to attract the necessary capital to scale solutions.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, by refocusing as the Regenerative Future Fund, we reaffirm our dedication to solutions that regenerate ecosystems and drive resilient, sustainable growth. Through catalytic venture capital, we aim to address the critical funding gaps in adaptation, mitigation, and nature-based solutions, supporting innovations that harmonize with natural systems. Together, we're working to create a future where businesses, ecosystems, and communities can thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>Celebrating Our Portfolio's Progress<br/><br/>Since 2021, the Regenerative Future Fund has been a catalyst for transformative change, weaving a tapestry of innovation in more than 25 companies and funds. As we cross the halfway mark in deploying our committed capital, the stories of our portfolio light the path to a more sustainable and equitable future, including:<br/><br/>- Building Resilient Ecosystems. At the heart of disaster preparedness lies the ability to anticipate and adapt. Our portfolio company Hohonu is leading the charge in protecting communities from the rising threats of flooding and sea-level rise. With its groundbreaking real-time water monitoring technology, Hohonu equips municipalities, insurance, researchers, and underserved communities with the tools to stay ahead of climate-driven disasters. By collecting over 2 million hours of precise data, Hohonu has laid a critical foundation for safeguarding livelihoods and resilient ecosystems. The fund also aims to bolster solutions in regenerative agriculture to enforce the climate resilience of our soil, farmlands, and farmer systems to extreme weather events through investments like in Trailhead Capital.<br/><br/>- Leading Decarbonization Across Land, Sea, and Cities. The Cisco Foundation is advancing transformative decarbonization with investments across ecosystems. In the ocean and coastal sector, Ebb Carbon is pioneering Electrochemical Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement to remove up to 350,000 tons of CO2 over the next decade in partnership with Microsoft. This builds on our initial commitment to marine and coastal technologies, starting in 2022 with our investment in Vesta. On land, Terradot is scaling Enhanced Rock Weathering in tropical climates, supported by $ 58.2 million in new funding and partnerships with Google, Frontier, and Microsoft. In industry, CarbonBuilt is transforming the cement sector with its breakthrough low-carbon concrete technology, recently securing a major deployment agreement with Meta. A few months ago, we also backed Carbon Reform's innovative solution for the built environment.<br/><br/>- Reimagining Carbon Markets for a Transparent Future. We also support platforms and solutions that will make decarbonization technologies a success. The frontier of Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) is being reshaped by portfolio visionaries like Chloris Geospatial and Miraterra. Chloris's partnership with Trove Research is bringing clarity to over 550 forest carbon projects, illuminating pathways to accountability. Meanwhile, Miraterra is revolutionizing soil carbon monitoring. By combining AI and sensor technology, Miraterra empowers landowners to accurately measure, track, and increase soil carbon stocks, bridging the gap between more sustainable agriculture and robust carbon markets.<br/><br/>- Expanding Access with Inclusive Clean Energy. From African villages to bustling urban centers, our dynamic clean energy portfolio is powering communities with hope and resilience. Jaza Energy, through its acquisition, has not just marked a successful exit but amplified its mission of solar-powered empowerment. And the merger of SteamaCo and Shyft Power Solutions is rewriting the playbook for decentralized renewable energy for Africa and South Asia. In the spring of 2024, our investment in Aikido Technologies has propelled advancements in floating offshore wind solutions. Their Aikido One platform achieved a groundbreaking milestone with its final structural assembly completed in under 40 working hours-a tenfold increase in speed compared to traditional methods-setting a new standard in the industrialization of floating platforms.<br/><br/>- De-Risking Early-Stage Climate Capital. Our climate venture funds are at the forefront of driving systemic change. The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility (SEACEF) has established the first blended finance fund for the energy transition in Southeast Asia. The fund is electrifying Southeast Asia's energy landscape by supporting transformative early-stage projects aimed at accelerating the region's transition to renewable energy. Third Sphere is empowering startups to push the boundaries of venture investing in climate with groundbreaking hardware solutions. By building the world's leading venture fund for biodiversity, Superorganism is setting a new community for nature technologies globally. Enduring Planet is redefining climate financing by providing rapid and flexible capital to founders, while, Catalyst Fund and Katapult deliver tailored, quality venture support to ventures across Africa and Europe, respectively, to drive impact and address key needs beyond capital.<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is more than an impact investment initiative-it's a community of visionary founders, co-investors, and partners working together to build bridges to a regenerative, resilient future.<br/><br/>Just as Cisco connects the world through transformative technology, we're connecting businesses, ecosystems, and communities to create a regenerative world where innovation and resilience thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>With every venture investment and partner fund, we're weaving a web of opportunity and impact, ensuring a future where people and planet are more resilient together.<br/><br/>To connect with us, learn more, or share a pitch deck, and please follow our online form or reach out on LinkedIn.<br/><br/>About Cisco Foundation<br/><br/>Cisco Foundation envisions a world of equitable, resilient and empowered communities where everyone can reach their full potential and thrive.

However, the climate tech sector has demonstrated resilience compared to the venture capital market, where investment volumes have plummeted by 52% since 2021, largely due to rising interest rates (KPMG)."]}, {"relevance_score": 94, "title": "Re(Introducing) the Cisco Foundation Regenerative Future Fund: Redefining Impact in Climate Investing", "published": "2025-02-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2021, the Cisco Foundation made a bold commitment to address the climate crisis, pledging $ 100 million over 10 years to fund innovative climate solutions. This commitment is strategically divided: $ 50 million supports nonprofit grants that empower organizations driving climate and social impact, while the other $ 50 million is dedicated to equity and debt investments in early-stage climate startups (Seed to Series A) and venture funds.</p><p><br/><br/>As climate challenges accelerate and natural disasters intensify, the $ 50m climate investments program has refined its approach to impact investing by focusing on transformative, venture-backed technologies and solutions. Today, we're proud to announce the evolution and rebranding of our climate investments program as the Regenerative Future Fund.<br/><br/>This new name reflects our deep commitment to leveraging the Foundation's endowment to drive scalable, high-impact solutions. By investing in startups and venture funds that deliver measurable, transformative results, the Regenerative Future Fund focuses on regenerating ecosystems, strengthening community resilience, and advancing sustainable economies.<br/><br/>Beyond providing capital, the Fund embodies the Cisco Foundation's holistic approach: catalyzing market-driven, regenerative solutions that actively protect and renew our planet. With portfolio development support and a vision to accelerate the next wave of climate innovation, the Regenerative Future Fund is dedicated to creating a more sustainable, thriving future through its portfolio of solutions.<br/><br/>Why the Regenerative Future Fund?<br/><br/>The Regenerative Future Fund is part of our Cisco Foundation $ 100M Climate Impact and Regeneration commitment. It represents our belief in the power of climate impact investing to drive tangible, meaningful action. Through the Fund we will continue to invest in climate tech companies at the seed and series A stages, while also serving as a limited partner with early-stage venture funds advancing climate solutions. This dual approach enables us to support high-potential startups directly, de-risk key early-stage markets, and foster ecosystems of innovation through venture fund partnerships.<br/><br/>Our vision is to help build systems where humanity and nature thrive together. This rebranding signals a sharpened focus on technologies and solutions that regenerate rather than deplete and that strengthen resilience, particularly for communities most impacted by climate change. Our priorities include:<br/><br/>- Restoring and regenerating: Supporting innovations that replenish biodiversity, restore and build resilient ecosystems, and advance circular, regenerative economies.<br/><br/>- Prioritizing co-benefits, climate equity and inclusion: Championing solutions that promote resilience and equity in communities facing climate risks.<br/><br/>- Catalyzing lasting change: Investing in breakthrough ideas that reshape industries towards sustainability, such as regenerative agriculture and the built environment.<br/><br/>Why Now?<br/><br/>The climate tech investment landscape has experienced significant fluctuations over the past few years. After peaking in 2021 with a record $ 48 billion in global venture and growth equity investment, the sector saw a third successive year of decline in 2024, dropping to $ 30 billion-a 14% decrease from 2023 and a 37% drop from its 2021 peak (Sightline Climate). However, the climate tech sector has demonstrated resilience compared to the venture capital market, where investment volumes have plummeted by 52% since 2021, largely due to rising interest rates (KPMG). Carbon technology investing has bucked the overall trend, experiencing a 24% increase in venture capital investments in 2023, totaling $ 17.7 billion (Pitchbook). This surge has been driven by regulatory demand and corporate decarbonization goals, highlighting the growing importance of scalable carbon solutions.<br/><br/>Why Catalytic Impact Capital Is Still Needed: Catalytic capital like Cisco Foundation's Regenerative Future Fund is needed now more than ever to provide the funding required for first-of-a-kind and scaling innovations essential to meeting global climate goals (Foley Hoag). With their resources, networks, and influence, corporate foundations like Cisco Foundation can help elevate pioneering technologies and position them to be adopted and scaled by larger players in the tech ecosystems. By stepping in where the market falls short, catalytic funding can ensure that transformative solutions are scaled to deliver meaningful climate impact.<br/><br/>Early-Stage Climate Investments Hold Strong: Within the climate tech space, early-stage investments have shown remarkable durability. In 2023, 69% of climate tech deals were directed toward early-stage companies-an increase of 14 percentage points from the prior year (CB Insights). In addition, the overall financing picture for climate tech start-ups is evolving. While equity investments have declined, new forms of non-dilutive capital are stepping in. Debt financing for climate tech soared from $ 13.9 billion in 2021 to $ 45.6 billion in 2024, as companies transition from venture capital to bank loans and other funding sources (Net Zero Insights).<br/><br/>Gaps in Funding for Adaptation, Biodiversity, Decarbonization, and Nature: Despite these advances, critical funding gaps remain. Adaptation finance represents just 10% of global climate finance (UNEP), while investments in nature-based solutions and biodiversity remain underfunded despite their crucial role in combating climate change. Additionally, climate mitigation and decarbonization technologies still struggle to attract the necessary capital to scale solutions.<br/><br/>For all these reasons, by refocusing as the Regenerative Future Fund, we reaffirm our dedication to solutions that regenerate ecosystems and drive resilient, sustainable growth. Through catalytic venture capital, we aim to address the critical funding gaps in adaptation, mitigation, and nature-based solutions, supporting innovations that harmonize with natural systems. Together, we're working to create a future where businesses, ecosystems, and communities can thrive hand in hand.<br/><br/>Celebrating Our Portfolio's Progress<br/><br/>Since 2021, the Regenerative Future Fund has been a catalyst for transformative change, weaving a tapestry of innovation in more than 25 companies and funds. As we cross the halfway mark in deploying our committed capital, the stories of our portfolio light the path to a more sustainable and equitable future, including:<br/><br/>- Building Resilient Ecosystems. At the heart of disaster preparedness lies the ability to anticipate and adapt. Our portfolio company Hohonu is leading the charge in protecting communities from the rising threats of flooding and sea-level rise. With its groundbreaking real-time water monitoring technology, Hohonu equips municipalities, insurance, researchers, and underserved communities with the tools to stay ahead of climate-driven disasters. By collecting over 2 million hours of precise data, Hohonu has laid a critical foundation for safeguarding livelihoods and resilient ecosystems. The fund also aims to bolster solutions in regenerative agriculture to enforce the climate resilience of our soil, farmlands, and farmer systems to extreme weather events through investments like in Trailhead Capital.<br/><br/>- Leading Decarbonization Across Land, Sea, and Cities. The Cisco Foundation is advancing transformative decarbonization with investments across ecosystems. In the ocean and coastal sector, Ebb Carbon is pioneering Electrochemical Ocean Alkalinity Enhancement to remove up to 350,000 tons of CO2 over the next decade in partnership with Microsoft. This builds on our initial commitment to marine and coastal technologies, starting in 2022 with our investment in Vesta. On land, Terradot is scaling Enhanced Rock Weathering in tropical climates, supported by $ 58.2 million in new funding and partnerships with Google, Frontier, and Microsoft. In industry, CarbonBuilt is transforming the cement sector with its breakthrough low-carbon concrete technology, recently securing a major deployment agreement with Meta. A few months ago, we also backed Carbon Reform's innovative solution for the built environment.<br/><br/>- Reimagining Carbon Markets for a Transparent Future. We also support platforms and solutions that will make decarbonization technologies a success. The frontier of Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) is being reshaped by portfolio visionaries like Chloris Geospatial and Miraterra. Chloris's partnership with Trove Research is bringing clarity to over 550 forest carbon projects, illuminating pathways to accountability. Meanwhile, Miraterra is revolutionizing soil carbon monitoring. By combining AI and sensor technology, Miraterra empowers landowners to accurately measure, track, and increase soil carbon stocks, bridging the gap between more sustainable agriculture and robust carbon markets.<br/><br/>- Expanding Access with Inclusive Clean Energy. From African villages to bustling urban centers, our dynamic clean energy portfolio is powering communities with hope and resilience. Jaza Energy, through its acquisition, has not just marked a successful exit but amplified its mission of solar-powered empowerment. And the merger of SteamaCo and Shyft Power Solutions is rewriting the playbook for decentralized renewable energy for Africa and South Asia. In the spring of 2024, our investment in Aikido Technologies has propelled advancements in floating offshore wind solutions. Their Aikido One platform achieved a groundbreaking milestone with its final structural assembly completed in under 40 working hours-a tenfold increase in speed compared to traditional methods-setting a new standard in the industrialization of floating platforms.<br/><br/>- De-Risking Early-Stage Climate Capital. Our climate venture funds are at the forefront of driving systemic change. The Southeast Asia Clean Energy Facility (SEACEF) has established the first blended finance fund for the energy transition in Southeast Asia. The fund is electrifying Southeast Asia's energy landscape by supporting transformative early-stage projects aimed at accelerating the region's transition to renewable energy.

No ecosystem or human community could exist without access to clean air and water, making the protection of these resources a paramount concern. Unfortunately, decades of industry and development have had negative effects on the quality of the earth's air and water.<br/><br/>Because of the widespread and well-documented impacts of air and water pollution, governments have implemented regulations requiring industries to minimize deleterious effects on air and water. Adherence to these critical regulations is not the final step in corporate efforts to protect air and water quality. The private sector can go above and beyond these regulations to promote air and water quality through voluntary habitat conservation projects, with the added benefits of supporting wildlife species and human well-being.<br/><br/>The case studies featured in this white paper illustrate the role of habitat-specific projects in water and air quality improvement.

It's important to highlight our role as engineers and designers of the built environment and how we can and must influence decisions that promote climate equity.<br/><br/>Wellness and Quality of Life<br/><br/>There is a direct relationship between income and quality of life. There is also a direct proportional relationship between the built environment and the wellbeing/quality of life of its inhabitants. People are only able to inhabit places that they can afford. Underserved communities tend to be more vulnerable to environmental degradation and escalating climate conditions like flooding and extreme heat.<br/><br/>The urban heat island (UHI) effect is the phenomenon where cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. This makes dense, populated neighborhoods more vulnerable to extreme heat. UHI is most prevalent in urban areas where there is a lack of greenspace, adequate ventilation, open spaces, adequate cooling systems or accessible cooling facilities for residents. Due to these conditions, extreme heat has killed more Americans than any other weather-related disaster.<br/><br/>Heat Vulnerability Index in New York City<br/><br/>Heat Vulnerability Index in New York City (light yellow is lowest risk, and dark red is highest risk).<br/><br/>Mary Anne Woody, Anais Teyton, Lucy Piacentini, Matthew Bilik, Dr. Reginald Blake, and Dr. Hamidreza Norouzi<br/><br/>Is infrastructure equitable?<br/><br/>Because of socio-economic challenges rooted in historical discrimination like redlining and poor zoning regulations, vulnerable populations have been forced to live in underinvested, low-lying neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods are now hotter, noisier and more prone to flooding, and they lack adequate grocery stores, healthcare facilities, affordable housing, public transportation, greenspace and, most importantly, resilient infrastructure. These circumstances contribute to an atmosphere that negatively affects the quality of life, wellness and mental health of these communities' constituents by forcing a challenged and strained relationship with the built environment-a built environment in which infrastructure has failed them.<br/><br/>As engineers and designers, it is a necessity that we acknowledge that increasing wellness, livability and viability in vulnerable communities amid climate escalation is imperative to achieve a future with climate equity.<br/><br/>Equity, Risks and Vulnerability<br/><br/>Environmental injustice and climate change--based inequality, like poverty, is a reinforcing feedback loop. Those most vulnerable to environmental burdens will continue to be disproportionately at-risk until intervention is taken.<br/><br/>The social and historical context of a site should not be viewed as a limiting factor but should be used as a parameter to encourage the design of not only resilient infrastructure but reliable infrastructure. By considering site context, assessing risk and vulnerability and identifying the lack of access to resources, we can design sites through the lens of climate justice. Respectively, evaluating the urban fabric and creating resilient landscapes that challenge a site's current conditions makes resilient and reliable infrastructure more accessible.<br/><br/>Awareness, Advocacy and Engagement 'VOICE'<br/><br/>Discrimination within the built environment is not limited to low income and BIPOC communities but also includes the unhoused, individuals with disabilities and the elderly-all of whom lack access to a built environment that serves them with sufficient social services, safe neighborhoods and political power.<br/><br/>Thornton Tomasetti advocates for climate justice by first acknowledging that disabled citizens, people of color and other marginalized groups are disproportionately affected by climate change and have historically been left out of the planning and development processes of the built environment. Defining unserved groups provides a factual foundation that can drive design, policy and infrastructural change. We strive for equality in our designs with a multifaceted approach that incorporates solutions regarding leadership, resilience, sustainability, structural adaptation, mobility, waste reduction, resource allocation and equitable access.<br/><br/>What is the role of designers?<br/><br/>In planning for resilient infrastructure, design professionals become advocates and allies for the underserved and at-risk vulnerable communities. Our role as engineers, designers and innovators is to design resilient infrastructure with equity, diversity and inclusion in mind. This is our commitment and contribution to the built environment through 'positive infrastructure.'<br/><br/>How do we break the cycle?<br/><br/>A holistic framework is required to address climate equity and change the accessibility of sustainable and resilient infrastructure in poor and marginalized communities. This framework gives voice to those that are discriminated against and improves their relationship to the built environment by creating sustainable, resilient infrastructure.<br/><br/>Climate Policy and Resilient Communities 'ACTION'<br/><br/>We help our clients develop diplomacy and actionable policy to bring positive changes to right existing inequalities. We work alongside owners, public agencies and governments to advance climate equity by informing policy, planning and processes that empower communities and promote equitable area-wide resilience.<br/><br/>We acknowledge policies and agencies including the Federal Sustainability Plan, Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Better Climate Challenge and the National Building Performance Standards (BPS) Coalition. We take action in designing and recommending resilient strategies and sustainable infrastructure that incorporate climate policies, exceed local building code minimums, and adopting industry resilience frameworks-including the Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines, Waterfront Alliance's Waterfront Edge Design Guidelines (WEDG), Institute of Sustainable Infrastructure's Envision Sustainable Infrastructure Framework (Envision), American Planning Association's (APA) Guide for Planning for Infrastructure Resilience and RELi Rating System-to make climate policy equitable.<br/><br/>The current WEDG and Envision manuals have guidelines that directly address aspects of climate equity and community resilience. WEDG has recently revised their manual V2.O to V3.0. One of the biggest changes of note is the expansion of climate equity across the guidelines and credit requirements that pushes designers to address issues of urban heat, environmental justice and community engagement for vulnerable communities that have been neglected or put at-risk by poor planning practices in the past. Envision V3 directly addresses issues related to equity and social justice, preservation of history and culture resources, accessibility and the improvement of quality of life. With these standards, Thornton Tomasetti is able to advocate for and support unserved communities through equitable design and master planning.<br/><br/>The first step in correcting urban inequalities is to identify them. By mapping inequalities, we can consider socio-economic factors, zoning, urban heat island effect, land use, regulations and developments within the urban grid and use computational modeling and spatial data analysis (i.e., open-source data, GIS, Grasshopper) to not only identify gaps of inequality and communities more vulnerable to risk but also to design solutions. We analyze, map and interpret spatial data as a response to environmental injustices and systemic inequalities related to infrastructure and the built environment.<br/><br/>The second step is to use the results of our analyses to increase the opportunities for a holistic design and investment in equitable and resilient infrastructure and policy. For example, Thornton Tomasetti's Sustainability and Resilience practices are developing a climate equity framework inspired by a waterfront project in Boston. As part of this framework, we help clients and organizations identify climate equity goals, targets and strategies as they relate to structural and site adaptation, mobility and transportation, waste management and climate advocacy.

Underserved communities tend to be more vulnerable to environmental degradation and escalating climate conditions like flooding and extreme heat. The urban heat island (UHI) effect is the phenomenon where cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat.", "Reginald Blake, and Dr. Hamidreza NorouziIs infrastructure equitable? Because of socio-economic challenges rooted in historical discrimination like redlining and poor zoning regulations, vulnerable populations have been forced to live in underinvested, low-lying neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods are now hotter, noisier and more prone to flooding, and they lack adequate grocery stores, healthcare facilities, affordable housing, public transportation, greenspace and, most importantly, resilient infrastructure. These circumstances contribute to an atmosphere that negatively affects the quality of life, wellness and mental health of these communities' constituents by forcing a challenged and strained relationship with the built environment-a built environment in which infrastructure has failed them. As engineers and designers, it is a necessity that we acknowledge that increasing wellness, livability and viability in vulnerable communities amid climate escalation is imperative to achieve a future with climate equity. Equity, Risks and VulnerabilityEnvironmental injustice and climate change--based inequality, like poverty, is a reinforcing feedback loop. Those most vulnerable to environmental burdens will continue to be disproportionately at-risk until intervention is taken. The social and historical context of a site should not be viewed as a limiting factor but should be used as a parameter to encourage the design of not only resilient infrastructure but reliable infrastructure. By considering site context, assessing risk and vulnerability and identifying the lack of access to resources, we can design sites through the lens of climate justice. Respectively, evaluating the urban fabric and creating resilient landscapes that challenge a site's current conditions makes resilient and reliable infrastructure more accessible.", "What is the role of designers?

With these standards, Thornton Tomasetti is able to advocate for and support unserved communities through equitable design and master planning. The first step in correcting urban inequalities is to identify them. By mapping inequalities, we can consider socio-economic factors, zoning, urban heat island effect, land use, regulations and developments within the urban grid and use computational modeling and spatial data analysis (i. e.", "By mapping inequalities, we can consider socio-economic factors, zoning, urban heat island effect, land use, regulations and developments within the urban grid and use computational modeling and spatial data analysis (i. e. , open-source data, GIS, Grasshopper) to not only identify gaps of inequality and communities more vulnerable to risk but also to design solutions. We analyze, map and interpret spatial data as a response to environmental injustices and systemic inequalities related to infrastructure and the built environment. The second step is to use the results of our analyses to increase the opportunities for a holistic design and investment in equitable and resilient infrastructure and policy. For example, Thornton Tomasetti's Sustainability and Resilience practices are developing a climate equity framework inspired by a waterfront project in Boston. As part of this framework, we help clients and organizations identify climate equity goals, targets and strategies as they relate to structural and site adaptation, mobility and transportation, waste management and climate advocacy.

'ComEd is proud to work hand in hand with partners like Elevate and Bickerdike to deliver innovative, clean energy technologies to communities that need them most. By empowering customers and lowering costs, we can put ourselves on the path to a cleaner and more equitable future.'<br/><br/>The announcement was made at the Nuestro Hogar affordable housing units in Humboldt Park, one of the first multi-family projects electrified through the program. The project is one of several to receive significant upgrades, at no cost to the tenants, with the program exclusively serving low-income communities - those that have historically been impacted by air pollution.<br/><br/>'This initiative is about more than just upgrading homes; it is about investing in the health and well-being of our communities,' said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. 'By electrifying these homes, we are reducing energy costs and environmental impact while ensuring that families in Chicago have access to sustainable, modern living standards. This partnership with ComEd and Elevate is a testament to what is possible when we prioritize equity and innovation in our city's path to a cleaner, greener future.'<br/><br/>ComEd first launched the Whole Home Electric program in 2022, with an initial $ 40 million investment, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower overall energy use and costs for low-income customers - those who can benefit most from energy savings. The program supports the goals of the state's Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) which calls for expanding clean energy technology, like heat pumps, to help achieve a lower carbon future.<br/><br/>In partnership with environmental and community agencies, such as Elevate and Resource Innovations, ComEd has since helped electrify 180 single-family homes and 270 multi-family homes through the program, with upgrades coming at no cost to qualifying low-income customers. In the city of Chicago, a combination of 100 single-family and multi-family homes have been completed with Elevate, a local climate justice nonprofit.<br/><br/>'Families across Chicago deserve not only affordable housing but homes that promote health and sustainability while reducing energy consumption,' said Dr. Anne Evens, Elevate CEO.

We will continue this vital work with partners like ComEd and Bickerdike to achieve climate equity for all.'<br/><br/>With the building sector a significant contributor of overall greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. today, and responsible for about 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Chicago neighborhoods, the program helps to deliver a strong example of early efforts that are making a difference, with a goal of scaling this program for the future. So far, the homes completed through the program are estimated to reduce emissions by 2,500 metric tonnes of CO2 annually, which has an environmental impact equivalent to planting 3,000 acres of trees every year. Participating customers are also estimated to save up to $ 500 annually, on average, on energy bills.<br/><br/>Nuestro Hogar, an affordable housing property owned by Bickerdike, a community development nonprofit, was first built in 1923. The electrification and weatherization of the 100-year-old, 18-unit building was completed last year and has since saved over 300 megawatt-hours or 100 metric tons of CO2 annually, which is the equivalent to removing 22 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road.<br/><br/>'The electrification of Nuestro Hogar Apartments is more than just a modern upgrade; it's a vital step towards creating a sustainable and brighter future for our residents,' said Joy Aruguete, CEO of Bickerdike. 'As an affordable housing developer, we are committed to ensuring that our community thrives in a healthier environment by moving away from non-renewable resources and toward reducing our carbon footprint. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners ComEd and Elevate who have made this vision a reality.'<br/><br/>Through the program, residential customers receive new heat pumps and replace fossil-fueled appliances with all-electric ENERGY STAR appliances like induction cooktops, electric clothes dryers, and other energy-efficient electric technologies, allowing them to reduce their overall energy bills and lower their carbon footprint. Since homes enrolled in Whole Home Electric tend to be older and located in areas historically impacted by pollution, the program also delivers weatherization and home safety upgrades as needed to ensure the maximum efficiency, and helping produce the highest energy savings for customers.<br/><br/>'On behalf of the Department of Environment and Mayor Brandon Johnson, I am thrilled to congratulate all the partners involved on this incredible milestone in advancing environmental equity,' said Angela Tovar, Chief Sustainability Officer for the City of Chicago. 'I look forward to seeing this work continue to grow and bring the benefits of clean energy to even more Chicagoans.'<br/><br/>To be eligible to participate in the Whole Home Electrification program, customers must demonstrate annual income at or below 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Multi-family buildings that provide housing to income-eligible tenants and buildings owned or managed by Public Housing Authorities are also eligible to participate. There is no cost for single-family customers to participate. Income-eligible and public housing multi-family building owners may have a co-pay for certain measures.<br/><br/>Other qualifying criteria are determined through over the phone screening and a home assessment, completed by the program team.

The program supports the goals of the state's Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) which calls for expanding clean energy technology, like heat pumps, to help achieve a lower carbon future.<br/><br/>In partnership with environmental and community agencies, such as Elevate and Resource Innovations, ComEd has since helped electrify 180 single-family homes and 270 multi-family homes through the program, with upgrades coming at no cost to qualifying low-income customers. In the city of Chicago, a combination of 100 single-family and multi-family homes have been completed with Elevate, a local climate justice nonprofit.<br/><br/>'Families across Chicago deserve not only affordable housing but homes that promote health and sustainability while reducing energy consumption,' said Dr. Anne Evens, Elevate CEO. 'I'm proud to have been a partner in the electrification of Nuestro Hogar in Humbolt Park. Retrofits of existing buildings are crucial in preserving affordable and healthy housing. We will continue this vital work with partners like ComEd and Bickerdike to achieve climate equity for all.'<br/><br/>With the building sector a significant contributor of overall greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. today, and responsible for about 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Chicago neighborhoods, the program helps to deliver a strong example of early efforts that are making a difference, with a goal of scaling this program for the future. So far, the homes completed through the program are estimated to reduce emissions by 2,500 metric tonnes of CO2 annually, which has an environmental impact equivalent to planting 3,000 acres of trees every year. Participating customers are also estimated to save up to $ 500 annually, on average, on energy bills.<br/><br/>Nuestro Hogar, an affordable housing property owned by Bickerdike, a community development nonprofit, was first built in 1923. The electrification and weatherization of the 100-year-old, 18-unit building was completed last year and has since saved over 300 megawatt-hours or 100 metric tons of CO2 annually, which is the equivalent to removing 22 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road.<br/><br/>'The electrification of Nuestro Hogar Apartments is more than just a modern upgrade; it's a vital step towards creating a sustainable and brighter future for our residents,' said Joy Aruguete, CEO of Bickerdike. 'As an affordable housing developer, we are committed to ensuring that our community thrives in a healthier environment by moving away from non-renewable resources and toward reducing our carbon footprint. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners ComEd and Elevate who have made this vision a reality.'<br/><br/>Through the program, residential customers receive new heat pumps and replace fossil-fueled appliances with all-electric ENERGY STAR appliances like induction cooktops, electric clothes dryers, and other energy-efficient electric technologies, allowing them to reduce their overall energy bills and lower their carbon footprint. Since homes enrolled in Whole Home Electric tend to be older and located in areas historically impacted by pollution, the program also delivers weatherization and home safety upgrades as needed to ensure the maximum efficiency, and helping produce the highest energy savings for customers.<br/><br/>'On behalf of the Department of Environment and Mayor Brandon Johnson, I am thrilled to congratulate all the partners involved on this incredible milestone in advancing environmental equity,' said Angela Tovar, Chief Sustainability Officer for the City of Chicago. 'I look forward to seeing this work continue to grow and bring the benefits of clean energy to even more Chicagoans.'<br/><br/>To be eligible to participate in the Whole Home Electrification program, customers must demonstrate annual income at or below 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Multi-family buildings that provide housing to income-eligible tenants and buildings owned or managed by Public Housing Authorities are also eligible to participate. There is no cost for single-family customers to participate. Income-eligible and public housing multi-family building owners may have a co-pay for certain measures.<br/><br/>Other qualifying criteria are determined through over the phone screening and a home assessment, completed by the program team. An additional assessment is performed for eligible projects by a qualified ComEd Energy Efficiency Service Provider (EESP), which determines the level of home modifications. The proposed home upgrades must collectively model annual energy bill savings to the customer. Most customers that participate in the Whole Home Electric offering are able to completely eliminate their gas or propane bills.<br/><br/>The Whole Home Electric program is just one example of how ComEd is working across sectors to expand the benefits of electrification, helping customers unlock energy savings and enhanced air quality that comes with it. ComEd offers a variety of heating and cooling efficiency programs, including a heat pump rebate of up to $ 1,400, which can be obtained from their local contractor. ComEd is also leading efforts to boost transportation electrification, with a series of rebates launched earlier this year totaling nearly $ 90 million.<br/><br/>For more information on how to determine if you are a candidate for the Whole Home Electric program, how to apply for electrification rebates, or to explore the array of customer clean energy empowerment programs offered by ComEd, please visit ComEd.com/Clean.<br/><br/>About ComEd<br/><br/>ComEd is a unit of Chicago-based Exelon Corporation (NASDAQ: EXC), a Fortune 200 energy company with approximately 10 million electricity and natural gas customers - the largest number of customers in the U.S. ComEd powers the lives of more than 4 million customers across northern Illinois, or 70 percent of the state's population.

By June 2024, TPE had already met its initial target, and is on track to substantially exceed this goal over the next five years.<br/><br/>In conjunction with its community solar project development goal for the state, TPE also committed to contribute over $ 500,000 in charitable and community investment to local Illinois community organizations. TPE is on track to surpass this goal as well, with over $ 725,500 committed or given to date.<br/><br/>The company's community investment efforts support local community assistance and educational initiatives such as the United Way of Livingston County and student innovation and environmental stewardship programs at the Pontiac Township High School District 90.<br/><br/>TPE's $ 20,000 donation to the United Way of Livingston County will support its mission to improve life for financially struggling essential workforce and community members earning just above the poverty level as part of its local Asset Limited, Income-Constrained, Employed (ALICE) program.<br/><br/>'This funding comes at a time when we have experienced the greatest need to date from hardworking local residents and families who still struggle to survive,' said Deb Howard, Executive Director of the United Way of Livingston County. 'TurningPoint Energy's donation will enable us to support up 40 ALICE program families with housing or other much needed assistance.'<br/><br/>TPE's $ 15,000 donation to Pontiac Township High School District 90 will support two programs: Celebrating High School Innovators (CHSI) and Operation Endangered Species (OES).<br/><br/>CHSI first began in 2012 and endeavors to identify, foster, and engage the best and brightest students across the globe and offer them a platform to showcase their ingenuity.<br/><br/>'Students today can do more than anyone can imagine,' said Paul Ritter, Director and Co-Founder of CHSI.

Ceres' submission is in response to requests for comments on the interagency notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) on updating the CRA.<br/><br/>\"Climate change exacerbates racial and economic inequality and frustrates the purpose of the CRA to end the nation's long and painful history of lending discrimination against and the resulting disinvestment in communities of color and other financially vulnerable communities,\" Ceres wrote in its comments.<br/><br/>Ceres recommends the rule contains the following provisions:<br/><br/>Explicitly including the race of the borrower and community as a metric to ensure historically redlined communities, and those vulnerable to climate change, have improved access to credit and services.<br/><br/>Having banks leverage available data tools to understand where climate vulnerable communities are found within assessment areas and work towards driving investment to those communities.<br/><br/>A revised definition of community development activities to more effectively target activities to communities in need. Ceres supports the NPR's addition of the disaster preparedness and climate resiliency definition under community development (CD) activities and an expanded, though non-exhaustive, list of eligible climate-related activities.<br/><br/>Measuring the impact of community development activities as well as establishing benchmarks and metrics to assess the strength of community development financing.<br/><br/>Encouraging banks to increase community engagement and relationship-building with climate and environmental justice organizations.<br/><br/>Avoiding adverse impacts to LMI communities from community development activities receiving CRA credit. Any activities that contribute to demonstrable adverse impacts or disproportionate consequences, such as displacement, predatory lending, and increased environmental hazards, should not receive credit, and should result in ratings downgrades.<br/><br/>Ensuring changes to assessment areas sufficiently capture online lending and deposit activity, particularly in smaller metropolitan areas and rural counties.<br/><br/>No changes to the asset threshold for small and intermediate small banks.

For example, India is locked into using electricity subsidies as a form of welfare payment, has based the viability of its rail system on over-charging for coal freight, and depends on fossil-fuel taxes to fill fiscal coffers. The pace of transition required to limit warming to 1.5\u200a\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures is unprecedented.</p><p>Perhaps most important is ensuring that emerging economies that already face a high cost of capital can access low-cost finance.

Concrete, nation-specific plans should lead to greater confidence that financial support will be used to build mitigative and adaptive capacity. </p><p>The Paris Summit for a New Global Financing Pact, held last month, signalled renewed political interest in the climate-equity agenda, but it must be followed by actual delivery of finance. Rich countries must restore frayed credibility: they have failed to fulfil their 2009 promise of providing US$100 billion a year, and the actual amount of money needed is several times higher than that. Some pledges and funding offered by the G7group of the world\u2019s biggest economies are limited to reducing use of fossil fuels, rather than having a more expansive vision.</p><p>Three climate policies that the G7 must adopt \u2014 for itself and the wider world</p><p>Third, the world\u2019s poorest people need insurance against having their energy needs squeezed, which could occur under the rapid pace of decarbonization that is required. For example, a G20 declaration could enshrine an equity principle for fossil-fuel funding and regulation: the few fossil fuels that fall in the remaining global carbon budget should be used, where they contribute the most to human welfare: in poorer countries. The need to use this insurance will probably be proportional to the credibility of promises of support from rich countries. Such an agreement would help to correct current injustices, such as European nations using short-term energy-security concerns stemming from the Russia\u2013Ukraine war to justify re-opening their own coal plants while withdrawing support for World Bank funding of fossil-fuel infrastructure in Africa. It could inform decisions, such as whether the World Bank finances fossil-fuel expansion in Nigeria. And it could speed up the phasing out of fossil fuels in the industrialized world.</p><p>The choice between development and a low-carbon future is not viable and is increasingly leading to the wrong questions. But achieving both is not trivial and will require both political will and determined implementation.

Infrastructure improvements and maintenance that look to the future can help us guard against natural, climatic and human threats. This week in our continuing series showcasing how engineers and scientists can play a key role in addressing the short- and long-term challenges of climate change, we look at the iterative process involved in risk and resilience evaluations for infrastructure, with a focus on climate risk assessments, stakeholder engagement, recovery-based design and resilience strategy development.</p><p><br/><br/>Resilient and reliable infrastructure is essential to our communities, providing not only critical services like potable water, sewer, electricity and communications utilities, but also transportation means through our bridges, roadways, airports and railway networks.<br/><br/>In recent years, President Biden signed Executive Order (EO) 14057: Catalyzing Clean Energy Industries and Jobs Through Federal Sustainability, which promotes U.S. federal government net-zero energy targets for 2035 and 2050 and climate resilient infrastructure and operations in direct response against the global effects of climate change. In implementing this EO policy, there are specific goals to reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy and water efficiency and minimize waste, among others.<br/><br/>We can help our clients respond to these requirements through decarbonization and circularity consulting, the promotion of sustainable materials and strategies and implementation of resilience plans for the built environment to enable critical services to bounce back quickly following disruption.<br/><br/>The process for evaluating the risk and resilience of our global infrastructure is the same as described in previous thought leadership posts, namely:<br/><br/>Begin with a climate risk assessment to evaluate site-specific impacts and vulnerabilities to future-projected climate and earth hazards.<br/><br/>Meet with relevant stakeholders through workshops and guided discussions to understand needs, expectations and establish goals to promote climate equity.<br/><br/>Develop a recovery-based design approach that seeks to go beyond code-based minimums to meet the desired performance objectives.<br/><br/>Incorporate the above findings into the development of resilience strategies that seek to future-proof the infrastructure over short, medium and long-term planning horizons.<br/><br/>This process is iterative in nature, just like a conventional design approach, with a comparison of performance metrics with stakeholder's expectations.

The very first meetings of the international community are underway, designing the bones of an agreement to address the emergent issue of what is then called global warming. On 17 December 1991, the tiny Pacific nation of Vanuatu puts forward a well-developed proposal on behalf of a coalition of small island states. The plan is to create an insurance mechanism to pay countries damaged by the various expected impacts of warming, especially flooding from sea level rise. The funding to pay for these damages would be assessed based on the countries\u2019 responsibility for causing the problem and their ability to pay \u2014 50% from each.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vanuatu\u2019s original proposal was sidelined and ignored in the drafting of the 1992 United Nations (UN) Framework Convention on Climate Change and calls for any funding mechanism for climate damages were kept off the agenda for over three decades, until the 2022 talks in Egypt created an unnamed fund \u2014 but without any money in it,.</p><p>Now flash forward to 29 March 2023. Vanuatu is again in the news as its government convinces the UN General Assembly to request the International Court of Justice to issue an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d on who is liable for climate impacts, and for what.</p><p>Writing in Nature Sustainability, Fanning and Hickel offer a useful perspective on what a comprehensive effort to understanding who should be on the hook for climate impacts might look like. This is an important, ambitious and rigorous effort to take on one of the world\u2019s most important and difficult topics: the debt owed to poorer nations by the richer ones for the atmospheric space we have taken by dumping our carbon pollution into the air, where it has been accumulating and will stay for centuries.</p><p>The numbers are staggering. On emissions, Fanning and Hickel find that we are already three times past the \u2018safe\u2019 350 ppm budget and that we need to reduce emissions globally by 10% a year just to hit net zero by 2050 and stay within the 1.5 \u00b0C \u2018global carbon budget\u2019.</p><p>Given that the wealthier nations have long since overspent our share of the global carbon budget, Fanning and Hickel calculate what we should pay the \u201cundershooting\u201d countries for the access to their shares. Using \u201cmarginal abatement costs\u201d from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)\u2019s latest Sixth Assessment Report (AR6; they choose ones that limit warming to 1.5 \u00b0C with no or limited overshoot), they calculate a US$141\u2013298 trillion climate debt. That is trillion with a T, but that is over the 31-year period, so our bill is \u2018only\u2019 $4.5\u20139.6 trillion a year (6\u201311% of global GDP). The USA alone owes somewhere between $1.9 and $4.0 trillion a year (11\u201323% of the GDP).</p><p>Whether a fund for compensating countries for climate impacts will ever move forward is uncertain, but that does not invalidate the need for us to have a clear-eyed perspective of what is owed. Fanning and Hickel offer a bold contribution to that effort, related to earlier efforts like those of the Greenhouse Development Rights framework, the Civil Society Equity Reviews and the Climate Equity Reference Calculator\u2013 (Climate Equity Reference Project).</p><p>Fanning and Hickel build their analysis upon four bedrock assumptions, each strongly informed by ethical principles of climate justice. First, the total global carbon budget of how much can be emitted while staying within safe thresholds must be our guard-rail when discussing how much can be emitted. Second, only conservative estimates from the IPCC AR6 that do not assume that it will be feasible and affordable to remove massive amounts of carbon from the atmosphere later in the century should be used. Third, since carbon stays in the atmosphere causing warming for centuries, historical emissions must be counted, and those who made the mess must clean up or pay for the clean-up of the mess, whether they understood they were causing it or not. Finally, nations should be allocated \u201cemissions rights\u201d based on a per capita approach \u2014 each human merits the same rights to the global atmosphere.</p><p>Fanning and Hickel\u2019s striking findings provide two major novelties beyond the Greenhouse Development Rights approach. First, rather than just looking backwards to calculate current \u201cfair shares\u201d of emissions rights as of now, they model \u201cnet zero\u201d and \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d trajectories into the future and contrast the warming impacts and \u201cobligations\u201d of countries if they take each approach. Second, they rigorously estimate the financial obligations of countries taking either of these pathways.</p><p>The estimates provided by Fanning and Hickel are uncomfortable and may never be acknowledged by anyone in power in the debtor nations, but there is value in knowing their scale. Their findings show that any future compensation effort or fund, whether obligatory or voluntary, whether universal or selective, will be paltry compared with the debt we owe. Finding the will and means to equitably collect and effectively deliver even a fraction of this climate debt would open the potential for developing nations to address deep social needs while rapidly decarbonizing their economies.</p><p>Imagining a crisis and political moment that would drive a global response along the lines implied by Fanning and Hickel\u2019s piece may currently fall into the realm of fiction. Vanuatu\u2019s success in moving the UN General Assembly to request a look at the issue of climate debt to the International Court of Justice makes that future only a tiny bit more imaginable. International cooperation such as is needed to address global climate change requires building trust, and addressing equity is fundamental to such cooperation. Having a solid understanding of the scale of the debt owed by those nations who have appropriated the atmospheric space left on a rapidly heating planet seems a foundational stone on the road ahead.</p>", "publisher": "Nature Sustainability", "instances": ["6 trillion a year (6\u201311% of global GDP).

Some EPR laws have been designed without the necessary partnering with industry and innovators. \u201cThat\u2019s going to cause problems,\u201d she says. </p><p>\u201cIf you create a law that says, \u2018we must do this\u2019, without taking into account the transition need, or actual coordination between the different parties involved \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be effective.\u201d</p><h>Plastic\u2019s subtle advantage</h><p>For plastics use to diminish at the scale necessary to protect the planet and its inhabitants, the economics must make sense.\u00a0</p><p>Speaking to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ESG Investor</emphasis>, Nicholas Vijverman,\u00a0Programme Manager of the New Plastics Economy team at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, said that it was often not financially viable for a business to have single use alternatives at this point in time. </p><p>\u201cThere are environmental benefits that have economic benefits,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at this point it\u2019s just not cost-competitive yet, which keeps companies a bit reluctant to invest alternatives.\u201d </p><p>But Noronha believes that companies must not accept the current situation as an \u201cabsolute truth\u201d, noting that the lack of cost-competitiveness in certain areas, like plastic production, stems from underlying factors, namely subsidies. </p><p>According to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/newsroom/support-for-fossil-fuels-almost-doubled-in-2021-slowing-progress-toward-international-climate-goals-according-to-new-analysis-from-oecd-and-iea.htm\">data</url>, global fossil fuel subsidies close to doubled in 2021, with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies\">International Monetary Fund</url> (IMF) forecasting they will grow to 7.4% of GDP in 2025, up from 6.8% in 2020.</p><p>\u201cPlastic production benefits from a subtle advantage as it\u2019s subsidised by the fossil fuel industry, making virgin plastic appear artificially cheaper than its actual cost,\u201d she says, noting that this is driven primarily by a failure to incorporate the true costs of collection, environmental impact, and community health into the price of plastic.\u00a0</p><p>Consequently, it enjoys an unfair discount in the market, with a pound of virgin high-density polyethylene (HDPE) costing 54 cents versus US$1.33 for recycled material \u2013 a 146% premium, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/cheap-new-plastic-choking-the-world-9b318936\">data</url> from Chemical Market Analytics.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cRectifying this would involve internalising these costs, likely narrowing the cost differential,\u201d explains Noronha, adding that to truly address the issue of plastic\u2019s lack of cost-competitiveness will require policymakers to explore methods to enhance its economic viability. </p><p>\u201cAggregating demand or implementing advanced market commitments could potentially alleviate this issue,\u201d she says, but unfortunately, the utilisation of such methods remains limited in procurement practices.\u00a0</p><h>No excuses\u00a0</h><p>A third meeting of the UN-facilitated <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/inc-plastic-pollution/session-3\">Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-3)</url> took place in Nairobi, Kenya, from 13 to 19 November, where governments convened to negotiate a Global Plastics Treaty.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The session, however, ended in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/63663/un-inc3-ends-in-frustration-as-governments-allow-low-ambition-countries-to-derail-global-plastics-treaty\">disappointment and frustration</url> as policymakers allowed oil-dependent countries to lower ambition on ending plastic pollution and, in the process, potentially derail progress towards the adoption of a global treaty.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cGovernments are allowing fossil fuel interests to drive the negotiations towards a treaty that will absolutely, without question, make the plastic problem worse and accelerate runaway climate change,\u201d said Graham Forbes, Greenpeace Head of Delegation to the Global Plastics Treaty negotiations and Global Plastics Campaign Lead at GreenpeaceUSA. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe need to find a way forward without oil and gas producers dictating the terms of our survival [\u2026] When the negotiations resume in Canada in April 2024, our leaders must be ready to show a level of courage and leadership we have yet to see.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>When asked what needs to occur at the next INC meeting to edge closer to an ambitious plastics treaty, Noronha underscores the need for clarity throughout the negotiations as any \u201croom for misinterpretation\u201d that create potential loopholes will result in further delays.\u00a0</p><p>In her view, a lack of clarity will be used by the oil and gas industry as an excuse to lower ambition. Certainty regarding specific incentives or disincentives, certain banned or penalized chemicals, and approved or disapproved project types for immediate funding would accelerate progress, Noronha insists. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\u201cClearly outlining commitments and signals for the financial system to fund the transition away from plastics is crucial,\u201d she says. When capital begins to flow into a clearly defined fund and its predetermined use cases are transparent, Noronha adds, it will greatly benefit innovators and groups involved in projects, especially those in plastic production who typically struggle to find the investment needed to scale. </p><p>Further, it\u2019s critical for the upcoming treaty discussions to have representation from the informal sector, project developers, innovators, and not just from plastic-producing companies and/or governments, she says.\u00a0</p><p>This inclusivity is necessary, Noronha explains, asserting that a balanced representation across stakeholders is vital to avoid dominance by any particular group. An overrepresentation of lobbyists was apparent in previous INC meetings, she observes. </p><p>If governments do eventually deliver on a truly ambitious treaty, the environment, business and investors will be provided some long-awaited and much-needed certainty. \u00a0</p><p>\u201cBusinesses will always optimise for what\u2019s in the best interest of their shareholders, with a legally binding global plastics treaty setting the bar for what they have to meet,\u201d says Noronha, adding that outlines set by a global agreement on plastics will in turn spur demand for the development of supply-side solutions. \u00a0</p><p>But Noronha is quick to point out that the outcome of the plastics treaty should not delay businesses and investors from taking action.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cBecause unanimity is required, the final version often becomes so watered down that people feel it\u2019s not effective or doesn\u2019t meet their hopes,\u201d she says, adding that organisations, regardless of the treaty\u2019s outcome, must be prepared to transform their operations, understand the different actors in their supply chain and determine how to collaborate with them to drive meaningful change.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cThey must be ready to answer questions about how to make green procurement and solutions more economically viable and be ready to do that irrespective of the treaty\u2019s content,\u201d she says. \u00a0</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.esginvestor.net/viable-alternatives\">Viable Alternatives</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.esginvestor.net\">ESG Investor</url>.</p>", "publisher": "ESG Investor", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 25, "title": "New Sun Road Secures USD4 Million in Series A Venture Funding", "published": "2023-05-23", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Sun Road P.B.C., a leading provider of sustainable energy solutions, announced the successful first close of its $4 million Series A funding round.

UVA RESEARCHERS ARE WILLING TO TRY", "published": "2023-10-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">October 13, 2023<br/><br/>Release date- 12102023 - University of Virginia : UVA's Environmental Institute is providing both funding and expertise to help a Virginia region explore a transition to renewable energy, while also assisting women in India with protecting their communities from increasingly intense flooding.<br/><br/>Women in a flood-prone region of India are the key to protecting drinking-water wells for their families and neighbors, but they need stronger voices - literally, figuratively and politically - to bring solutions to their communities, according to University of Virginia climate researchers.</p><p><br/><br/>With a $ 1.5 million grant, UVA's Environmental Institute is studying how to empower women already elected to local offices in Bihar, India, to tackle a climate-change problem that threatens the lives and health of families, including the novel solution of voice training.<br/><br/>It's part of a pair of grants - $ 3 million in total, supporting UVA's Grand Challenges Research Initiative - that the Environmental Institute is sending to a pair of communities 8,000 miles apart.<br/><br/>The Hardest Working Icon: The Rotunda Enriches Student Life Daily<br/><br/>The goal of this inaugural phase of the 'Climate Collaboratives' program is to gather UVA experts from several disciplines to work directly with community members on strategies to adapt to climate change and to improve their futures. The focus for now will be on research to learn what approaches could lead to long-term resilience as the climate, and their communities, continue to change.<br/><br/>'Grand Challenges are meant to support the full scope of research, from basic research to team science to implementation and adoption by stakeholders,' said Megan Barnett, vice provost for academic initiatives. 'The Climate Collaborative projects are a great illustration of this type of effort. They will generate discoveries, and also put those discoveries, and the tools to use them, in the hands of local communities.'<br/><br/>One of those communities is closer to home. UVA researchers will examine how the Appalachian region - still adjusting to the diminishment of coal mining as an economic driver - might thrive if it embraces renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.<br/><br/>Christine Mahoney<br/><br/>Christine Mahoney, a professor in the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, will organize a team of UVA researchers to work with communities in Southwest Virginia in exploring the economic and health benefits of a transition to renewable energy like solar and wind power. (Photo by Dan Addison, University Communications)<br/><br/>In places like Russell County, tucked into the tip of Virginia's southwest corner, the region is trying to map a future that isn't reliant on fossil fuels. County leaders, with federal help, are reclaiming abandoned coal mines and other areas littered with coal detritus to create an industrial development site. And they are also working with the Environmental Institute to explore how a clean-energy revolution could bolster the region's economy, improve the health of its residents and position Appalachia for a sustainable future.<br/><br/>'I understand the importance of building community resilience,' said Lou Wallace, co-founder of the community nonprofit St. Paul Tomorrow and the chair of the Russell County Board of Supervisors. 'We are excited about this project and look forward to engaging with all of the strategic partners involved in this initiative.'<br/><br/>Shannon R. Blevins, vice chancellor at the University of Virginia's College at Wise, said places like Russell County could be on the cusp of a complete reimagining.<br/><br/>'The communities of Southwest Virginia have tremendous potential and opportunities ahead of them,' she said. 'We look forward to working with community leaders and strategic partners to design strategies to build resiliency and address complex challenges that threaten the vibrancy of our communities.'<br/><br/>In India, the problem isn't a flagging fossil fuel economy, but increasingly damaging flooding made worse by a changing climate. Yearly monsoon-season flooding in the Bihar area has grown increasingly dire. Rivers that overrun their banks routinely inundate hand pumps or contaminate drinking water.<br/><br/>Women there bear the brunt of the problem because they are the ones most often tasked with taking care of families and seeking aid after natural disasters. And because women are the most affected, they have an incentive to spearhead change, UVA researchers say.

UVA RESEARCHERS ARE WILLING TO TRY", "published": "2023-10-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">University of Virginia : UVA's Environmental Institute is providing both funding and expertise to help a Virginia region explore a transition to renewable energy, while also assisting women in India with protecting their communities from increasingly intense flooding.<br/><br/>Women in a flood-prone region of India are the key to protecting drinking-water wells for their families and neighbors, but they need stronger voices - literally, figuratively and politically - to bring solutions to their communities, according to University of Virginia climate researchers.</p><p><br/><br/>With a $ 1.5 million grant, UVA's Environmental Institute is studying how to empower women already elected to local offices in Bihar, India, to tackle a climate-change problem that threatens the lives and health of families, including the novel solution of voice training.<br/><br/>It's part of a pair of grants - $ 3 million in total, supporting UVA's Grand Challenges Research Initiative - that the Environmental Institute is sending to a pair of communities 8,000 miles apart.<br/><br/>The Hardest Working Icon: The Rotunda Enriches Student Life Daily<br/><br/>The goal of this inaugural phase of the 'Climate Collaboratives' program is to gather UVA experts from several disciplines to work directly with community members on strategies to adapt to climate change and to improve their futures. The focus for now will be on research to learn what approaches could lead to long-term resilience as the climate, and their communities, continue to change.<br/><br/>'Grand Challenges are meant to support the full scope of research, from basic research to team science to implementation and adoption by stakeholders,' said Megan Barnett, vice provost for academic initiatives. 'The Climate Collaborative projects are a great illustration of this type of effort. They will generate discoveries, and also put those discoveries, and the tools to use them, in the hands of local communities.'<br/><br/>One of those communities is closer to home. UVA researchers will examine how the Appalachian region - still adjusting to the diminishment of coal mining as an economic driver - might thrive if it embraces renewable energy sources like wind and solar power.<br/><br/>Christine Mahoney<br/><br/>Christine Mahoney, a professor in the Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy, will organize a team of UVA researchers to work with communities in Southwest Virginia in exploring the economic and health benefits of a transition to renewable energy like solar and wind power. (Photo by Dan Addison, University Communications)<br/><br/>In places like Russell County, tucked into the tip of Virginia's southwest corner, the region is trying to map a future that isn't reliant on fossil fuels. County leaders, with federal help, are reclaiming abandoned coal mines and other areas littered with coal detritus to create an industrial development site. And they are also working with the Environmental Institute to explore how a clean-energy revolution could bolster the region's economy, improve the health of its residents and position Appalachia for a sustainable future.<br/><br/>'I understand the importance of building community resilience,' said Lou Wallace, co-founder of the community nonprofit St. Paul Tomorrow and the chair of the Russell County Board of Supervisors. 'We are excited about this project and look forward to engaging with all of the strategic partners involved in this initiative.'<br/><br/>Shannon R. Blevins, vice chancellor at the University of Virginia's College at Wise, said places like Russell County could be on the cusp of a complete reimagining.<br/><br/>'The communities of Southwest Virginia have tremendous potential and opportunities ahead of them,' she said. 'We look forward to working with community leaders and strategic partners to design strategies to build resiliency and address complex challenges that threaten the vibrancy of our communities.'<br/><br/>In India, the problem isn't a flagging fossil fuel economy, but increasingly damaging flooding made worse by a changing climate. Yearly monsoon-season flooding in the Bihar area has grown increasingly dire. Rivers that overrun their banks routinely inundate hand pumps or contaminate drinking water.<br/><br/>Women there bear the brunt of the problem because they are the ones most often tasked with taking care of families and seeking aid after natural disasters. And because women are the most affected, they have an incentive to spearhead change, UVA researchers say. Bolstering the authority of women elected to office in the flood-ravaged region could lead to better outcomes, like moving drinking-water wells out of flood zones.<br/><br/>But many of the region's elected women lack confidence in their voices, and their tone and pitch is not assertive, according to UVA professor Sheetal Sekhri.
