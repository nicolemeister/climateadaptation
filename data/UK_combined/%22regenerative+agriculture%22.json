This could, according to the report, add to the appeal of regenerative agriculture. </p><p>While many consumers know what regenerative agriculture is, they often confuse it with organic agriculture. </p><p>However, many consumers believe that regenerative agriculture is only relevant or applicable to small-scale or local farms.

Recently, regenerative agriculture has seen a surge in interest as a promising approach to enhance sustainability and climate resilience within the agri-food system. Practices like maintaining soil cover, reducing tillage, and optimizing inputs have gained widespread attention for their potential benefits. Yet, as enthusiasm grows, so do questions about whether these practices can deliver on the ambitious environmental outcomes they aim to achieve.</p><p><br/><br/>For decades, scientists have studied the impact of these practices on soil health and their ability to improve the resilience of crops, sequester carbon, conserve water, reduce erosion, and improve biodiversity. Science shows, the answer is positive.<br/><br/>In the right places, with the right incentives, regenerative agriculture can play a critical role in not only sequestering large amounts of carbon, but also in building on-farm resiliency and benefiting the ecosystem at large. Deep agronomic knowledge and quantification technology are key to getting placement and incentives right.<br/><br/>Indigo Ag's sustainability programs - rooted in agronomic knowledge, advanced quantification technology, and meaningful incentives - have shown scaling regenerative agriculture as a solution to achieve positive climate outcomes is possible. With over 7 million acres enrolled, we are pioneering this approach on an unprecedented and growing scale.<br/><br/>Scaling such solutions for widespread adoption, however, involves inherent complexities. Recognizing this, Indigo remains committed to upholding the highest standards of scientific rigor and integrity. To ensure transparency and credibility, we submitted our findings for scientific peer review. This research, which analyzed our first three carbon credit issuances, confirmed that large-scale initiatives can effectively build soil carbon and deliver significant environmental benefits when the right incentives are in place.<br/><br/>Our initial three carbon credit issuances alone totaled nearly 300,000 credits - by far the largest volume of high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits issued repeatedly at scale. This program has created real, measurable climate and environmental impact, resulting in millions of dollars paid directly to farmers for their efforts. And as our methodologies and understanding of soil carbon science evolve, our research shows that the impact per acre is even greater than initially estimated. With Indigo's carbon credits now priced between $ 60 and $ 80 per credit - and approaching the catalytic $ 100 mark - the potential returns for farmers continue to grow, offering a valuable opportunity amid volatile commodity markets and rising input costs.<br/><br/>Key findings from the study include:<br/><br/>* Technology enables scalable monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for regenerative agriculture that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon.<br/><br/>* Reduced nearly 400,000 tons of carbon equivalent emissions, resulting in nearly 300,000 carbon credits issued.<br/><br/>* The impact of farming practices varies by geography, underscoring the need for tailored solutions for different regions, ideally down to the field level.<br/><br/>* High-impact practices: No-till and cover crops contribute the most to soil carbon at the project scale, with cover crops having one of the highest impacts per acre across a range of geographies.<br/><br/>* By incentivizing outcomes and tailoring advice regionally, we can ensure the right solution is applied to the right acre.<br/><br/>Like other emerging climate solutions, regenerative agriculture faces the challenge of balancing lengthy research timelines with the urgency of reducing atmospheric carbon now. Carbon emissions avoided or sequestered today have a greater impact than the same reduction achieved a decade from now, helping us avoid critical climate tipping points. Decades of research demonstrate the benefits of sustainable farming practices, with some areas well-documented and others under-studied. In some cases, science is still building methods to measure the impacts of regenerative practices that people and communities working the land have known and witnessed for generations. Bringing together the experience and wisdom of these practitioners with peer-reviewed science is critical for scaling solutions with genuine environmental and ecosystem impact. A key question remains: Can findings from prior studies be generalized and scaled?<br/><br/>Rather than waiting for others to address this question, we chose to act - experimenting, gathering evidence, and sharing results with the broader scientific community. Our recent publication demonstrates impact at scale is possible with appropriate safeguards and a focus on areas of greatest certainty of impact.<br/><br/>And we are just getting started. We understand that sustainability and decarbonization in agriculture require multiple approaches, with carbon credits being just one tool.<br/><br/>Science and technology are at the heart of our approach to open new markets for farmers to participate in the programs that reward them best for the ecosystem benefits they provide. The same monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) engine that drives our carbon credit programs is helping supply chains incentivize sustainable practices, whether it's cotton for clothing, rice for food, or corn for biofuels. These flexible solutions are and will help companies meet their goals while improving farm profitability and resilience.<br/><br/>Since we launched our Carbon and Sustainable Sourcing programs, we've learned a tremendous amount and worked hard to use learnings to improve them. While we began in areas with greater scientific certainty, we've invested in scientific research, partnered with others to explore under-researched areas, and advocated for universities and government to fill gaps in knowledge. This approach, combined with transparency and a commitment to the highest standards of integrity, is driving progress in regenerative agriculture and carbon markets.<br/><br/>The benefits of programs that reward regenerative agriculture go beyond emissions reductions and carbon removals. Regenerative agriculture positively affects multiple ecosystem services and the environment, such as improved water quality and reduced erosion. When valued with market-based incentives, these systems also positively impact farm resiliency and rural communities by ensuring that farmers themselves receive the majority of the value generated by our programs.<br/><br/>Just as we continuously improve the science and technology behind our programs, we also expand the pool of producers that can benefit from them. Early on, we adjusted our minimum acre requirements to ensure more farmers, including smaller operations, could participate. We've also expanded the geographies and crops we can support. As ecosystem markets grow, this must continue to ensure that structural barriers, which historically underserved some producers, are not perpetuated. It's why engagement with groups like the National Black Growers Council and the National Indian Carbon Coalition are vital to enabling us to build programs that are inclusive of the diversity of farmers across the continental U.S.<br/><br/>The science remains foundational, and we're committed to advancing it. It's why our customers and partners trust us, it's why we continue to share our findings, and it's why we invite the scientific community and the farming community to engage and work with us to answer the open questions and identify areas where our programs can improve. Only by working together will we build trust and confidence in regenerative agriculture's potential to deliver for farmers, our soils and our planet.<br/><br/>Join us in scaling proven regenerative agriculture solutions to deliver sustainable outcomes.

Recently, regenerative agriculture has seen a surge in interest as a promising approach to enhance sustainability and climate resilience within the agri-food system. Practices like maintaining soil cover, reducing tillage, and optimizing inputs have gained widespread attention for their potential benefits. Yet, as enthusiasm grows, so do questions about whether these practices can deliver on the ambitious environmental outcomes they aim to achieve.<br/><br/>For decades, scientists have studied the impact of these practices on soil health and their ability to improve the resilience of crops, sequester carbon, conserve water, reduce erosion, and improve biodiversity. Science shows, the answer is positive.<br/><br/>In the right places, with the right incentives, regenerative agriculture can play a critical role in not only sequestering large amounts of carbon, but also in building on-farm resiliency and benefiting the ecosystem at large. Deep agronomic knowledge and quantification technology are key to getting placement and incentives right.<br/><br/>Indigo Ag's sustainability programs - rooted in agronomic knowledge, advanced quantification technology, and meaningful incentives - have shown scaling regenerative agriculture as a solution to achieve positive climate outcomes is possible. With over 7 million acres enrolled, we are pioneering this approach on an unprecedented and growing scale.<br/><br/>Scaling such solutions for widespread adoption, however, involves inherent complexities. Recognizing this, Indigo remains committed to upholding the highest standards of scientific rigor and integrity. To ensure transparency and credibility, we submitted our findings for scientific peer review. This research, which analyzed our first three carbon credit issuances, confirmed that large-scale initiatives can effectively build soil carbon and deliver significant environmental benefits when the right incentives are in place.<br/><br/>Our initial three carbon credit issuances alone totaled nearly 300,000 credits - by far the largest volume of high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits issued repeatedly at scale. This program has created real, measurable climate and environmental impact, resulting in millions of dollars paid directly to farmers for their efforts. And as our methodologies and understanding of soil carbon science evolve, our research shows that the impact per acre is even greater than initially estimated. With Indigo's carbon credits now priced between $ 60 and $ 80 per credit - and approaching the catalytic $ 100 mark - the potential returns for farmers continue to grow, offering a valuable opportunity amid volatile commodity markets and rising input costs.<br/><br/>Key findings from the study include:<br/><br/>* Technology enables scalable monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for regenerative agriculture that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon.<br/><br/>* Reduced nearly 400,000 tons of carbon equivalent emissions, resulting in nearly 300,000 carbon credits issued.<br/><br/>* The impact of farming practices varies by geography, underscoring the need for tailored solutions for different regions, ideally down to the field level.<br/><br/>* High-impact practices: No-till and cover crops contribute the most to soil carbon at the project scale, with cover crops having one of the highest impacts per acre across a range of geographies.<br/><br/>* By incentivizing outcomes and tailoring advice regionally, we can ensure the right solution is applied to the right acre.<br/><br/>Like other emerging climate solutions, regenerative agriculture faces the challenge of balancing lengthy research timelines with the urgency of reducing atmospheric carbon now. Carbon emissions avoided or sequestered today have a greater impact than the same reduction achieved a decade from now, helping us avoid critical climate tipping points. Decades of research demonstrate the benefits of sustainable farming practices, with some areas well-documented and others under-studied. In some cases, science is still building methods to measure the impacts of regenerative practices that people and communities working the land have known and witnessed for generations. Bringing together the experience and wisdom of these practitioners with peer-reviewed science is critical for scaling solutions with genuine environmental and ecosystem impact. A key question remains: Can findings from prior studies be generalized and scaled?<br/><br/>Rather than waiting for others to address this question, we chose to act - experimenting, gathering evidence, and sharing results with the broader scientific community. Our recent publication demonstrates impact at scale is possible with appropriate safeguards and a focus on areas of greatest certainty of impact.<br/><br/>And we are just getting started. We understand that sustainability and decarbonization in agriculture require multiple approaches, with carbon credits being just one tool.<br/><br/>Science and technology are at the heart of our approach to open new markets for farmers to participate in the programs that reward them best for the ecosystem benefits they provide. The same monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) engine that drives our carbon credit programs is helping supply chains incentivize sustainable practices, whether it's cotton for clothing, rice for food, or corn for biofuels.

This research, which analyzed our first three carbon credit issuances, confirmed that large-scale initiatives can effectively build soil carbon and deliver significant environmental benefits when the right incentives are in place.", "This research, which analyzed our first three carbon credit issuances, confirmed that large-scale initiatives can effectively build soil carbon and deliver significant environmental benefits when the right incentives are in place. Our initial three carbon credit issuances alone totaled nearly 300,000 credits - by far the largest volume of high-quality agricultural soil carbon credits issued repeatedly at scale. This program has created real, measurable climate and environmental impact, resulting in millions of dollars paid directly to farmers for their efforts. And as our methodologies and understanding of soil carbon science evolve, our research shows that the impact per acre is even greater than initially estimated. With Indigo's carbon credits now priced between $ 60 and $ 80 per credit - and approaching the catalytic $ 100 mark - the potential returns for farmers continue to grow, offering a valuable opportunity amid volatile commodity markets and rising input costs. Key findings from the study include:* Technology enables scalable monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for regenerative agriculture that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon. * Reduced nearly 400,000 tons of carbon equivalent emissions, resulting in nearly 300,000 carbon credits issued. * The impact of farming practices varies by geography, underscoring the need for tailored solutions for different regions, ideally down to the field level. * High-impact practices: No-till and cover crops contribute the most to soil carbon at the project scale, with cover crops having one of the highest impacts per acre across a range of geographies. * By incentivizing outcomes and tailoring advice regionally, we can ensure the right solution is applied to the right acre. Like other emerging climate solutions, regenerative agriculture faces the challenge of balancing lengthy research timelines with the urgency of reducing atmospheric carbon now.", "Key findings from the study include:* Technology enables scalable monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) for regenerative agriculture that accounts for greenhouse gas emissions and soil organic carbon. * Reduced nearly 400,000 tons of carbon equivalent emissions, resulting in nearly 300,000 carbon credits issued. * The impact of farming practices varies by geography, underscoring the need for tailored solutions for different regions, ideally down to the field level. * High-impact practices: No-till and cover crops contribute the most to soil carbon at the project scale, with cover crops having one of the highest impacts per acre across a range of geographies. * By incentivizing outcomes and tailoring advice regionally, we can ensure the right solution is applied to the right acre. Like other emerging climate solutions, regenerative agriculture faces the challenge of balancing lengthy research timelines with the urgency of reducing atmospheric carbon now. Carbon emissions avoided or sequestered today have a greater impact than the same reduction achieved a decade from now, helping us avoid critical climate tipping points. Decades of research demonstrate the benefits of sustainable farming practices, with some areas well-documented and others under-studied. In some cases, science is still building methods to measure the impacts of regenerative practices that people and communities working the land have known and witnessed for generations. Bringing together the experience and wisdom of these practitioners with peer-reviewed science is critical for scaling solutions with genuine environmental and ecosystem impact. A key question remains: Can findings from prior studies be generalized and scaled?", "Science and technology are at the heart of our approach to open new markets for farmers to participate in the programs that reward them best for the ecosystem benefits they provide. The same monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) engine that drives our carbon credit programs is helping supply chains incentivize sustainable practices, whether it's cotton for clothing, rice for food, or corn for biofuels. These flexible solutions are and will help companies meet their goals while improving farm profitability and resilience. Since we launched our Carbon and Sustainable Sourcing programs, we've learned a tremendous amount and worked hard to use learnings to improve them. While we began in areas with greater scientific certainty, we've invested in scientific research, partnered with others to explore under-researched areas, and advocated for universities and government to fill gaps in knowledge. This approach, combined with transparency and a commitment to the highest standards of integrity, is driving progress in regenerative agriculture and carbon markets. The benefits of programs that reward regenerative agriculture go beyond emissions reductions and carbon removals. Regenerative agriculture positively affects multiple ecosystem services and the environment, such as improved water quality and reduced erosion. When valued with market-based incentives, these systems also positively impact farm resiliency and rural communities by ensuring that farmers themselves receive the majority of the value generated by our programs. Just as we continuously improve the science and technology behind our programs, we also expand the pool of producers that can benefit from them. Early on, we adjusted our minimum acre requirements to ensure more farmers, including smaller operations, could participate.", "The same monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) engine that drives our carbon credit programs is helping supply chains incentivize sustainable practices, whether it's cotton for clothing, rice for food, or corn for biofuels.

Research suggests that using regen ag principles not only matches the productivity of traditional agriculture, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2025/06/05/regenerative-agriculture-could-make-eu-farms-carbon-negative/\">but can even surpass it</url>.</p><p>\u201cWhen survival depends on every harvest, shifting to unfamiliar methods \u2013 even if they promise long-term gains \u2013 is daunting and not always possible.\"</p><p>Juliana Jaramillo, regenerative agriculture lead, Rainforest Alliance</p><p>Barriers exist in rolling these principles out, however.

Removing some of that burden for farmers, believes the regen ag expert, stressing that transitioning to regenerative agriculture cannot rest on the shoulders of farmers alone. They need to be supported along from farm to shelf. </p><p>Should chocolate brands shout about their regen ag practices?</p><p>Once the cocoa is turned into chocolate, and packaged for the end-consumer, there\u2019s often little evidence it was produced for better soil health or biodiversity.</p><p>That\u2019s because on-pack <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2025/06/10/regenerative-agriculture-on-pack-claims/\">claims for regenerative agriculture are few and far between</url>. Should chocolate brands let consumers know they\u2019ve used regenerative farming practices? </p><p>Ferrero believes consumers do want to understand about the complex transition from traditional to regenerative agricultural practices taking place on farms today. The snacks and confectionery company releases regular reports to keep people informed about what\u2019s changing on the ground.</p><p>Others in the supply chain also suspect there\u2019s growing interest among consumers. According to research from ingredients supplier ADM, more than half of consumers in EMEA say they are more likely to purchase foods and drinks from companies that practice regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Thirty-nine percent said they would pay more for food and beverage products that support local farmers and promote community growth, 33% said they would stomach a higher price tag for sustainably sourced products, and 21% said they\u2019d fork out for products sourced from regenerative agriculture.</p><p>As more companies adopt these methods, should they talk more openly about what they\u2019re doing? The data suggests yes. As regenerative agriculture scales, storytelling will be an important part of the transition.

While arable systems usually focus on things like no-till and crop rotation, cocoa farming leans into mixing cocoa trees with native plants, using cover crops, composting and managing shade to boost soil health and bring the ecosystem back to life. Many big-name confectionery makers are adopting regen ag practices in cocoa. Ferrero \u2013 which owns brands Ferrero Rocher, Kinder and others \u2013 is incorporating agroforestry farming systems into its cocoa cultivation.", "Many big-name confectionery makers are adopting regen ag practices in cocoa.

Removing some of that burden for farmers, believes the regen ag expert, stressing that transitioning to regenerative agriculture cannot rest on the shoulders of farmers alone.

But we knew progress would require innovation, long-term commitment and supportive policy environments.</p><p><br/><br/>Five years on, we have better data, deeper insights and a clearer view of the practical realities to deliver net zero. Climate resilience is complex and key systems like regulation, policy frameworks and infrastructure have not advanced at the scale required.<br/><br/>Today, alongside our Annual Report publication, we're updating a few of our sustainability goals, with some important adjustments to our carbon and packaging goals to give us a stronger, more credible path forward.

Different stakeholders can partake in risk sharing, from governments to suppliers and manufacturers. Unilever agrees to share that risk if a crop fails, or if yield decreases.</p><p>Another way to help get farmers over the line is to show that regen ag is working. None of the 23 projects Unilever has instigated has resulted in a loss in yield.</p><p>In southern Spain, Unilever has seen an influx in neighbouring farms adopting regenerative agricultural practices after setting up its own project for tomatoes. The water-scarce areas had suffered from failed harvests in recent years, and Unilever has helped install drip irrigation to use less water more efficiently.

Those yields, however, have occurred in a climate-stable regime,\u201d Rudzinski explained.\u00a0</p><p>Historic data is becoming a less valuable tool for institutional investors to predict future cash flows and farm performance as the climate crisis worsens.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Instead, institutional investors should be procuring and analysing data demonstrating the impact of regenerative agriculture, such as tracking soil health, he suggested. \u201cThe healthier the soil, the more resilient and stable the yield and the more predictable cash flows become,\u201d Rudzinski added. \u201cInvestors can either continue to operate on using outdated data or they can push for more stable farms that focus on regenerative agriculture.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Rudzinski also said investors needed to take a more proactive approach to monitoring how their land is farmed to protect against falling yields and valuations. In the US, around 40% of farmland is rented or leased, with owners of that land \u2013 typically institutional investors \u2013 expecting returns that match historic trends. As the negative impacts of climate change worsen, he said, the land is becoming less valuable, and output is decreasing.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cOver time, rents will decrease and, when it comes time to sell the land, returns will suffer further,\u201d said Rudzinski. \u201cAny farmland asset owner should be very concerned about what their tenants are doing to that land and how they are farming it. The asset is not just the physical land, it\u2019s what the land can produce that matters and investors need to pay more attention to that.\u201d\u00a0</p><p>Increasing engagement and disclosure is helping to increase oversight, with asset owners able to draw on stewardship-focused initiatives like the Principles for Responsible Investment\u2019s Spring or reporting frameworks like the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures to improve insight of transition progress across their agricultural assets.

After establishing a framework, the EARA put it to the test, exploring productivity in 14 European countries: Italy, Germany, Greece, Finland, Estonia, Sweden, Belgium, Spain, France, Hungary, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia and the Netherlands. All countries assessed received a higher RFP score than the average farm. This score averaged out at 32%; the greatest was in Hungary, with 52. 1%, the lowest being Estonia with 13. 7%.", "7%. The scores were the result of averaging out the responses for each involved farmer for the country in question, on variables such as fuel use, soil cover, and photosynthetic activity. For example, farms involved in the programme achieved 24% higher photosynthesis than neighbouring farms, 23% higher soil cover and 17% higher plant diversity. While yields were 2% lower, the farms used on average 61% less synthetic nitrogen fertiliser and 76% fewer pesticides per hectare. Farmers also used feed from exclusively within their bioregions, rather than importing extensively. What could regenerative agriculture\u2019s impact be on the climate? While in many cases, regenerative agriculture has had a holistic approach to the environment, its impact on greenhouse gas emissions is still an integral part of its appeal. In this case, it\u2019s no different. According to the study, if even 50% of the farms in Europe adopted regenerative agriculture, it could offset European agricultural emissions. If all did so, it could make agriculture carbon negative by three times.", "The scores were the result of averaging out the responses for each involved farmer for the country in question, on variables such as fuel use, soil cover, and photosynthetic activity.

We must collaborate across the value chain to accelerate the transition regenerative systems at pace and scale. Collaborating to accelerate and scale regenerative agricultureFarmers are the stewards of the land, and their firsthand knowledge of local ecosystems, soil conditions, and climate challenges is critical to enable innovation and effective solutions with real-world application. Businesses must engage with farmers not just as suppliers but as partners, ensuring fair compensation and sharing risks and rewards. At Mars, we are fostering partnerships across multiple geographies and platforms that bring diverse stakeholders together to share knowledge, invest in innovation and support farmers in the challenge of transitioning to more regenerative practices. For example, in Europe, to help tackle issues around the upfront costs of transitioning to a regenerative system, Royal Canin is working together with Soil Capital - a Belgium-based agronomy firm - to help engage, train, and support farmers in their transition to using regenerative agriculture practices\u200b.

This represents the total wheat and barley for the brand sourced from France, and 30% of the corn. In addition, together with ADM's established re: generation program, Mars is helping to pair direct incentives for farmers with technical assistance support, demonstrating our recognition that farmers must be at the centre of all climate-smart agricultural practices. In Australia, Mars is working with industry peers and Charles Sturt University on the Cool Soil initiative - a farmer-focused, scalable framework for emissions reporting through the supply chain. This initiative works to enable a scientifically credible framework for the Australian food industry to support farmers to deliver healthy, sustainable products into the future."]}, {"relevance_score": 22, "title": "Regen-farmed craft beer: Wildfarmed moves from bread to beverage", "published": "2025-05-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">A partnership between Wildfarmed and Jubel sees regenerative agriculture brought to beverage </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wildfarmed, best known for its regeneratively farmed bread, recently announced a partnership with flavoured beer brand Jubel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under the partnership, Jubel will source its barley from Wildfarmed, aiming to make all its beers from 100% regenerative farmed grain.</p><p>This could create up to 50% savings in carbon emissions, and all barley will be traceable back to the fields in which it was grown, the brand claims.</p><p>The partnership not only marks a significant supply chain transformation, but will also aim to boost consumer perception of Jubel\u2019s sustainability.</p><p>However, further growth is hindered by the lack of a linear approach from the wider food and farming sectors.</p><p>What is regenerative agriculture?</p><p>Regenerative agriculture currently has no legal definition.

Investor members collectively oversee $80trn of assets under management.<br/>Read on for Ridwaan's answers to our questions.<br/>How I got to where I am now:<br/>\"I spent part of my childhood visiting family in the Horn of Africa, where conversations often centred on the harvest: whether rain would come, if the drought would last, or how crops were holding up. From a young age, I saw how climate shocks like droughts and floods were part of daily life, not distant risks, and how much they disrupted communities who relied on agriculture for both income and food security. It made me ask why this was happening. The more I learned about climate change, the clearer it became that those who contributed least were paying the highest price. That early understanding shaped how I see sustainability and why I chose to work in it.<br/>\"I joined FAIRR in 2024. At FAIRR, I work across climate, equity, and investment strategy to ensure sustainability transitions deliver for the people most affected by them. I help shape FAIRR's approach to a Just Transition, defining what it means for the global food system and demonstrating how it can add value across climate, nature, and social workstreams. The goal is to build a shared understanding internally and provide investors with practical ways to engage on transition risks and equity.<br/>\"Right now, I am helping update FAIRR's regenerative agriculture framework to reflect real-world complexity. That includes the financial realities farmers face, whether related to income stability, access to fair labour conditions, or resilience against economic shocks.<br/>\"The transition to a low-carbon food system is already underway. The question is whether it will be designed to include everyone.\"<br/>My biggest career achievement to date has been:<br/>\"Helping to drive a multi-stage project at FAIRR that culminated in a high-level roundtable at biodiversity COP16 in Cali, Colombia, last year. The aim was to explore how investors can finance a Just Transition to regenerative agriculture.<br/>\"We brought together global food companies, financial institutions, and civil society to discuss how capital can support farmer livelihoods while reducing environmental impact. I helped shape the research, stakeholder engagement, and design of the roundtable itself, which turned months of background work into meaningful action with global stakeholders.\"<br/>The biggest challenge I have encountered has been:<br/>\"Showing that a Just Transition isn't a 'nice-to-have' - it is essential for resilience and long-term value. Many companies prioritise decarbonisation but overlook how these shifts affect livelihoods, incomes, and communities. When transition plans exclude people, the result can be disruption, unrest and rising future costs.<br/>\"That's why my work focuses on grounding Just Transition in data, risk and materiality, not sentiment. It's not just about doing the right thing. It's about ensuring supply chains remain stable, business models remain viable, and transitions are delivered effectively.<br/>\"For this to happen, we need more than climate ambition.

Unfortunately, they're a week apart! But running with friends makes training enjoyable.<br/>\"I've also fallen into the padel craze and am enjoying the challenge of learning something new. These outlets help me stay balanced and recharged.\"<br/>My 'Mission Possible' message to business leaders is:<br/>\"We must move beyond seeing sustainability as simply reducing harm. The opportunity is to build systems that restore ecosystems, improve lives, and create shared value for people, nature, and business.<br/>\"So, sustainability must be holistic. It is not just about carbon or nature. Social impact, including livelihoods, fair work, and community resilience, is inseparable from environmental goals. One without the other is not sustainability. Climate justice must be central, especially as the Global South has long shouldered the consequences of a crisis it contributed least to.<br/>\"The first movers will be the businesses that act now. Do not wait for perfect data or outside pressure. Choose to lead. The cost of inaction will outweigh the investment in a planned, inclusive, and just transition. This is the chance to shape a future that is regenerative, resilient, and rooted in shared prosperity for people, communities, and planet.\"<br/>My advice for young people entering the sustainability profession is:<br/>\"Start by finding your people. The sustainability world is complex, spanning climate, food systems, equity, and nature. It's all connected, and no one makes sense of it alone. It took me a while to realise how important community is, but having people who challenge and support you makes all the difference.<br/>\"Learn from your peers. Find a mentor. Reach out to someone whose work you admire and ask for advice. The best guidance often comes from a single honest conversation.<br/>\"And hold onto your 'why'. It's easy to get swept up in frameworks, company assessments, and constant updates. When things feel overwhelming, return to that purpose. That's your anchor.\"<br/>To stay in the loop for the next round of annual nominations for the 30 Under 30,\u00a0.

But where will this money come from?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As food industry stakeholders look for ways to improve their sustainability credentials, a number of new production methods and types have been developed, from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/11/02/The-past-and-future-of-the-cultivated-meat-market-For-the-industry-to-succeed-there-will-need-to-be-a-ramping-up-of-investment\">cultivated meat</url>\u200b to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2023/12/21/edible-packaging-which-innovations-are-whetting-consumers-appetites\">edible packaging</url>\u200b. One of the keys to making the food industry more sustainable is addressing agriculture, which, with its links to deforestation and the environmental affects of cattle rearing, is a prominent part of the food industry\u2019s links to climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regenerative agriculture is a key part of this. Aiming to regenerate soil and landscape rather than simply protecting it, regenerative agriculture is growing in popularity among industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, as with all things new, it must make a business case for itself. Without a strong infrastructure already in place, it must build itself up to a point where it can move into the space currently taken up by traditional agriculture.</p><p>This is easier said than done. Whilst funding initiatives are in place, regenerative agriculture poses a risky proposition for many businesses.</p><p> How regenerative agriculture is being funded \u200b</p><p>On an EU level, funding is possible, especially when working in collaboration with the private sector.</p><p>For example, EIT Food, the food part of Europe\u2019s Institute of Innovation and Technology, recently launched its regenerative innovation portfolio, aiming to help companies scale up regenerative agriculture practices through funding.</p><p>\u20ac15m will be invested into the portfolio by EIT, matched by its corporate partners, and it will focus on five European landscapes. EIT will then match corporate contributions of \u20ac5m a year for three years, bringing up the total investment into the programme to \u20ac30m.</p><p>Activities that generate a return will be invested back into the portfolio. The money will not only be used to regenerate the landscape, but also to help participants with applications for external funding, including from government grants, public and private investment, and VC and angel investment.</p><p>Such a large initiative, which will involve many companies, could have a significant impact on regenerative agriculture. The funding will be used to upscale a range of regenerative agriculture initiatives.</p><p>\u201cWe want to move the responsibility and risk of transitioning to regenerative agricultural practices from individual farmers towards a landscape transition in which actors along the value chain collaborate and facilitate the farmer to transition to regenerative agriculture,\u201d EIT told us.</p><p>\u201cTo do this we need the key stakeholders in that landscape working together, including farmers, the companies that source products from that landscape, the banks that support the farmers and other actors in the supply chain.</p><p>\"We need the key stakeholders in that landscape working together, including farmers, the companies that source products from that landscape, the banks that support the farmers and other actors in the supply chain.\"</p><p>\u201cTo facilitate this, for every landscape a local landscape coordinator, that understands the local (business) ecosystem, dynamics and socio-cultural aspects within the region, will be appointed to engage with and orchestrate collaboration between a diverse group of stakeholders.\u201d</p><p>The scale is a vital part of the initiative, EIT told us. Without the scale, there is no showing stakeholders that there can be a business case for regenerative agriculture; there is no showing them that it can fight food insecurity; there is no showing them that it can mitigate the effects of climate change and pollution, and improve biodiversity and soil health. Scale, in a word, matters.</p><p>Farmers are central to this process. Upskilling farmers will enable more regenerative agriculture projects to thrive, and cement regenerative methods as a part of agricultural practices.</p><p>\u201cThe Portfolio is focussed around demonstrating how actors within a region can work together to develop a viable transition towards regenerative agriculture. The Portfolio will upskill, train and support a core group of farmers within the region. This will involve a range of organisations working . . . to test solutions, from insurance companies and banks to startups and innovators working with farmers, cooperatives and offtakers.\u201d An offtaker is someone who has signed a contract agreeing to buy a portion of a producer\u2019s upcoming goods.</p><p>EIT is leading the programme in collaboration with the non-profit FoodValley, which aims to keep track of developments. \u201cWe will use an approach for baseline measurements and monitoring measurements, so we can monitor the developments,\u201d the organisation told FoodNavigator. \u201cWe aim to contribute in practice and accelerate the sustainable ambitions that various Portfolio partners have set.\u201d</p><p>The initiative, it stressed, \u201caims to demonstrate pathways in various regions to show how cross sectoral and cross value chain collaboration can facilitate farm to fork transition.\u201d</p><p> Derisking regenerative agriculture \u200b</p><p>Despite significant investment from organisations such as EIT, many corporates are reluctant to stick their toe into the world of regenerative agriculture, as the business case remains uncertain. The problem of upscaling regenerative systems is a complex one, Steven Lang, managing director from the climate change investment firm Pollination, told FoodNavigator.</p><p>To persuade investors to put money into regenerative agriculture, Lang told us, he would say to them: \u201cYou\u2019re investing in a system which is founded on robust and strengthening natural capital, which underpins all agricultural productivity; and you're investing in the social and human capital that is the unit of production.</p><p>\u201cSo in terms of risk mitigation for investors: strong natural capital, strong social capital and relationships.\u201d Furthermore, the fear of a yield drop in regenerative agriculture, he suggested, is overstated, and in some programmes, such as in India, yields even went up from using a regenerative system.</p><p>However, investors are cautious, and must be persuaded before they put their money into risky propositions like new farming methods. This is where blended finance comes in.

It is much the same for development banks.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is risky because, she told us, \u201cit\u2019s asking a farmer to move away from an existing track record and a given productivity of the soil to switch practices.\u201d This, firstly, requires a significant trust in the farmers \u2013 that they will be both able and willing to shift their practices \u2013 as well as a period of five or six years where no revenue will come in at all.</p><p>On top of this, the agricultural sector itself is risky as it is, added Peter Mbanda Umunay, senior environment specialist at the GEF. Climatic conditions such as drought and flood make the sector inherently unstable. \u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Nevertheless, he went on, the private sector is interested in using the GEF money to scale up regenerative agriculture practices. \u201cIt\u2019s getting more traction, many many companies and private entities are coming to us with different projects, and it happens to be quite often linked to agriculture and regenerative agriculture,\u201d he told us.</p><p>While many multinationals are still focused on sustainable agriculture, interest in regenerative is growing, albeit mainly in developed countries. The focus is on developed economies, Benchimol-Dominguez told us, is that it there is less risk.</p><p>\u201cYou hear now that . . . the value of the land is bigger if you do regenerative agriculture than if you didn\u2019t,\u201d she told us. While up until now, the focus was on yield, now key private sector players are beginning to realise that investing in regenerative agriculture could make land more valuable. \u201cThen if you want to sell it, it will be sold by a higher amount.\u201d</p>", "publisher": "FoodNavigator.com", "instances": ["Regenerative agriculture, without clearly defined practices or financial incentives, and with uncertain results, needs money to thrive.

This means that regenerative agriculture practices now have a real price tag attached to them for farmers. First Milk is undoubtably the most invested in this with its members having to undertake a -regen plan- annually where points are awarded based on the number of regenerative or biodiversity enhancing interventions taking place on the farm. However, other milk companies also have points-based systems or advantage schemes such as Arla and M\\xC3ller, where premiums are awarded based at least in part, according to similar criteria. There is no actual universally agreed upon set of standards or practices that constitutes regenerative agriculture but there is consensus on the fundamental principles. These are:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Minimise soil disturbance. Keep the soil covered. Maintain living roots in the soil. Maximise plant diversity. Integrate livestock.</p><p>Furthermore, whilst not mentioned in the above list of principles, milk companies are also assessing farm practices in terms of biodiversity gain and carbon efficiency. With milk companies and the Scottish Government both offering financial incentives for hitting the same criteria, there has never been a more important time to invest in your farm-s natural capital, not just to tick a box, but for the bottom line. So, what are some of the things you can do to stay ahead of the curve and make sure you are securing the regen-ag, carbon and biodiversity premiums?</p><p>Grazing and cropping strategies</p><p>You may think that livestock integration on a dairy farm is easily achieved. However, even dairy farms can have large areas that are just cut for silage or used for arable cropping that are rarely grazed by livestock. With housed herds this is especially significant. Where grazing can be maximised, this can help to increase the regen score. Beyond the amount of land grazed, the method of grazing is also important, with rotational grazing or mob grazing being preferable to set stocking. Sward plant diversity is also a criterion. This could include multispecies leys that are intentionally seeded or semi-natural, and species-rich grasses. Where land is used for arable cropping, cover and catch cropping and incorporating livestock grazed grass leys into the rotation can help to meet the standards.</p><p>Biodiversity features</p><p>Milk companies are also allocating points for the establishment of new, or management of existing biodiversity promoting features. Hedges can help to meet both biodiversity and carbon targets. This is because they provide habitat and a food source for a number of species, and also sequester carbon whilst gaining biomass. Hedgerow sequestration is quantifiable in the Agrecalc carbon calculator for hedges younger than 30 years. To manage existing hedgerows for biodiversity gain, consider trimming hedges once every two or three years to allow them to flower. Hedges can also be enhanced by laying or coppicing. Other biodiversity options include wildlife corridors, wildflower strips, ponds, riparian buffers, conservation areas, wetlands, and silvopastures. It is worth noting that many of these options also fall under the Agri-Environment Climate Scheme (AECS). As such, there is funding towards the establishment capital and the management of a number of different biodiversity features and habitats that also satisfy milk company objectives.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Whilst milk companies are not all paying for the same regen and biodiversity practices, or may be incentivising some more than others, between the milk buyer premiums and the Scottish Government-s environmental schemes, the financial significance of environmental farming has never been higher. You may have land that you-ve previously considered unproductive and less valuable, but in the coming years that land may turn out to be one of your most valuable natural capital assets to help you access both government funding and milk buyer premiums. To find out more about what you-ve got and what you could create in terms of biodiversity and habitat, there is currently funding available towards biodiversity audits.

This includes cultivating perennial crops, which stay in the ground over years improving soil health by reducing or eliminating the need for tillage.<br/><br/>'Teaming up with Mad Agriculture represents a meaningful step forward in our commitment to improving ecosystem health and fostering climate resilience,' said Jason Buechel, chief executive officer at Whole Foods Market. 'This initiative is about rethinking how we care for the land and support the people who grow our food. As the program expands, it will forge a more connected, resilient landscape - supporting biodiversity and more sustainable farming for generations to come. It's one of the most exciting efforts we've launched this year, and it builds on the momentum and progress outlined in our 2024 Impact Report.'<br/><br/>As part of the initiative, Whole Foods Market has pledged up to $ 500,000 in matching funds to catalyze $ 1 million in collective investment from food system stakeholders in 2025. The program aims to cultivate a 1,000 acre biodiversity highway across American farmland and invites Founding Member organizations to co-invest in ecosystem reconstruction efforts that will serve as an example for regenerative agriculture and collaborative supply chain transformation. Companies committed include Applegate, Bob's Red Mill, The Campbell's Company, New Belgium Brewing, OLIPOP, UNFI, UNFI Foundation, west~bourne, and Yogi Tea.<br/><br/>'This initiative is laying the groundwork for a new kind of agriculture,' said Omar de Kok-Mercado, Director of Wilding at Mad Agriculture. 'The biodiversity highway is a blueprint for the next era of American infrastructure. Not just pipes and roads but living systems that restore function to land. It operationalizes perennial agriculture at scale, connecting ecological health to economic resilience. We're not restoring the past - we're engineering the future, one corridor at a time.'<br/><br/>The initiative is a cornerstone of Whole Foods Market's broader commitment to sustainability, as detailed in its newly released 2024 Impact Report. The report highlights progress across our key focus areas, including:<br/><br/>Advancing Regenerative Agriculture: Doubled the number of certified regenerative products to 301, all verified by trusted third-party standards such as Regenerative Organic Certified, Regenified, and Ecological Outcome Verified.<br/><br/>Biodiversity Leadership: Ranked the top U.S. retailer for pollinator protection by Friends of the Earth and expanded biodiversity efforts through native prairie restoration and pollinator-friendly sourcing policies.<br/><br/>Food Access and Community Giving: Donated over 34.6 million pounds of food - nearly 29 million meals - to more than 1,000 food rescue and redistribution programs across North America.<br/><br/>Reducing Emissions in Our Supply Chain: Collaborated with key suppliers, including shrimp and dairy suppliers, to help accelerate their carbon-reduction efforts and mitigate the carbon impact of our supply chain.<br/><br/>Reducing Emissions at our Stores:64 stores with solar installations, 235 stores relying on lower-global warming potential refrigerants, and 389 electric vehicle charging stations across our store to improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions.<br/><br/>Impact Through Giving: Invested $ 14.2 million through the Whole Foods Market Foundation, supporting 1,239 organizations and schools in 39 countries to advance food access, education, and economic opportunity.<br/><br/>Responsible Sourcing: Supplied more than $ 8.8 million in premiums benefitting workers, their communities, and/or the environment through our Sourced for Good program.<br/><br/>'The 2024 Impact Report is a reminder that the products on our shelves represents a story-of people, places, and choices that shape our food system,' said Caitlin Leibert, Vice President of Sustainability at Whole Foods Market. 'It reflects the collective effort of farmers, producers, Team Members, and partners who are helping us build something better. Our work with Mad Agriculture is one of the most inspiring examples of that effort - showing what's possible when we stay rooted in our purpose to nourish people and the planet. We're proud to be part of something that honors those connections and helps shape a more hopeful future for food.'<br/><br/>Check out the 2024 Impact Report on its new microsite here: wholefoods.com/impact.<br/><br/>This shared vision - spotlighted in the 2024 Impact Report and embodied by the biodiversity corridor initiative with Mad Agriculture - offers a forward-looking blueprint for how the food industry can address ecological challenges through ecosystem restoration and land stewardship.

The garden blends science, art and climate storytelling to bring the carbon cycle to life while showing how gardens can be powerful tools in the fight against climate change.</p><p><br/>In this episode of the edie Extra Podcast, edie's senior reporter Sidhi Mittal records live on-site at the UK's largest botanical garden, meeting two of the project's key figures: senior project manager Lara Michael and garden supervisor Joe Richomme. Together, they explain the inspiration, design and impact of this world-first concept.<br/>A net-zero garden from the ground up<br/>The Carbon Garden, explains Lara, was conceived in 2021 by Kew's head of garden design Richard Wilford and began construction in February 2025. The project has been designed as a \"whole-life net-zero\" space, meaning every stage from design to construction aimed to minimise carbon emissions.<br/>The garden's centrepiece is a mushroom-inspired pavilion that draws from underground fungal networks, which help plants capture and store carbon. Its structure uses low-embodied-carbon materials, from recycled gravel foundations to European larch timber and a pioneering flax-and-resin canopy. Even the site's removed concrete was crushed and reused as a planting substrate in the garden's dry zone.<br/>Plants for a hotter, drier future<br/>Richomme explains that the garden's planting choices are rooted in climate resilience research. With London projected to experience hotter, drier summers, Kew's scientists have selected species, many from Mediterranean regions, that can thrive under future climate conditions.<br/>The garden contrasts lush, herbaceous areas with drought-tolerant \"future climate\" plantings. Striking bands of red, blue and orange flowers mirror Reading University's iconic climate stripes, highlighting traits such as silvery leaves or drought-resistant hairs that help species survive in harsher conditions.<br/>Nature's role in climate action<br/>Beyond aesthetics, the Carbon Garden aims to change how people think about climate action in cities. Lara points to research showing urban gardens can reduce local temperatures by up to 5C, making them a powerful cooling tool as cities heat up.<br/>The installation also plays a role in Kew's wider ambition to be climate positive by 2030. It forms part of the organisation's sustainability and landscape succession plans and doubles as a living laboratory, piloting an irrigation system that uses soil moisture probes and weather data to minimise water use.<br/>Education, biodiversity and community<br/>Educational features, such as interactive binocular animations of the carbon cycle, aim to engage younger visitors. The garden also promotes biodiversity with habitats including wildflower meadows, long-grass areas and log piles to support fungi, which are vital for locking carbon in soils.<br/>Visitors are encouraged to \"play their part\" through QR codes linking to plant lists and at-home sustainability ideas, from creating rain gardens to choosing climate-resilient species for their own plots.<br/>As Richomme puts it, the garden aims to offer \"hope\", reminding visitors that carbon, while often portrayed as the villain of climate change, is also the foundation of life on Earth.<br/>Never miss an edie Extra episode<br/>You can follow edie Extra on\u00a0,\u00a0,\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0You'll be the first to access new episodes when they are published.<br/>As well as podcasts live from key events, this channel is our home for 1:1 interviews with sustainability leaders in our Green Room and SustyTalks series.

This is along with recognising the need to move beyond current LCA metrics to capture a more holistic view of environmental, social, and animal welfare impacts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It adds that an aspirational goal for impact measurement is to track outcomes on a continuous basis, either through annual LCA studies (or a cadence that makes sense for a particular system) or frameworks such as the Regenerative Agriculture Outcome Framework. It should be noted that for some indicators, tracking year-on-year changes may not be appropriate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recommendations for apparel sector when using life cycle assessment data </p><p>It shares nine recommended ways of using LCA data, including:</p><p>1 Textile Exchange recommends that LCA data is only applied when there is a full understanding of the key assumptions, methods, and use cases. End users of LCA data, such as brands, may need to work with consultants or other third parties to support with the application of LCA data.</p><p>2 Comparisons between separate LCA studies should not be made and neither should comparisons within a study, unless the study is a comparative LCA.</p><p>3 Textile Exchange discourages the comparison of LCA data between fibre or material categories or geographies. For example, comparisons between natural and synthetic fibres should not be made as the systems are fundamentally different and therefore not comparable. Textile Exchange also discourages shifting sourcing geographies as a method to reduce or avoid impact. Instead, we encourage implementing reduction measures within existing sourcing regions.</p><p>4 The usefulness of LCA data depends heavily on its quality. Robust, high-quality data supports a much broader range of applications. Generally, LCA data quality for the industry must be improved to enable the desired use cases.</p><p>5 Textile Exchange encourages LCA studies to fully document the assumptions, methodological decisions, limitations, and underlying datasets (primary and secondary) applied within an LCA. LCA data can only be improved if there is a good understanding of existing studies and how they have been developed.</p><p>6 Brands may choose to subscribe to an industry database such as the Higg Material Sustainability Index (MSI) or Quantis World Apparel and Footwear Life Cycle Assessment Database (WALDB) which house supporting information from Textile Exchange s Life Cycle Inventory (LCI) Library. LCA data from industry databases should not be compared. These are not like-for-like comparisons, as each database will apply differing methodologies and assumptions.</p><p>7 There is a critical need to move beyond current LCA methodology and adopt an  LCA+  approach. This considers context-specific impact areas and includes beneficial outcomes not captured within current LCA methodology, such as biodiversity, soil health, water, animal welfare, and livelihoods.</p><p>8 For Scope 3 footprinting, Textile Exchange encourages the use of supplier-specific data and LCA data from well-documented LCA studies, with careful consideration of data quality in relation to the materiality of a fibre or material within the overall footprint.</p><p>9 To help close remaining impact data gaps, frameworks such as Textile Exchange s Regenerative Agriculture Outcome Framework can be used.

This means they only measure impacts at a single point in time. This can make it challenging to use them for tracking progress, however this can be done if LCAs are performed at regular intervals.</p><p>LCAs often average impacts across a variety of locations and geographies. These can be at a regional, country, or global level, so they may not represent location-specific differences. In some cases, average country-level impacts are assumed to be representative of global impacts, especially in the absence of more representative LCA data.</p><p>Secondary data may need to be used to proxy some data points when there there are data gaps in the underlying LCA data. But, it is sometimes not clear where secondary data has been applied in LCA studies.</p><p>LCA studies typically only measure a specific set of impact areas, such as greenhouse gas emissions, water consumption, water pollution, or waste.</p><p>LCA practitioners need to make several assumptions. These assumptions can range from where and how to fill data gaps, which LCA methodologies to apply, and how to allocate impacts where a system has a number of products</p><p>For natural fibres and synthetic fibres, the system boundaries are different because the types of inputs vary between these production systems. This is one of the key reasons why Textile Exchange discourages the comparison between fibre and material categories.</p><p>There is contention around how products from the same system are &amp;#8216;assigned&amp;#8217; a portion of the impact.

This is along with recognising the need to move beyond current LCA metrics to capture a more holistic view of environmental, social, and animal welfare impacts. It adds that an aspirational goal for impact measurement is to track outcomes on a continuous basis, either through annual LCA studies (or a cadence that makes sense for a particular system) or frameworks such as the Regenerative Agriculture Outcome Framework. It should be noted that for some indicators, tracking year-on-year changes may not be appropriate. Recommendations for apparel sector when using life cycle assessment data It shares nine recommended ways of using LCA data, including:1 Textile Exchange recommends that LCA data is only applied when there is a full understanding of the key assumptions, methods, and use cases. End users of LCA data, such as brands, may need to work with consultants or other third parties to support with the application of LCA data. 2 Comparisons between separate LCA studies should not be made and neither should comparisons within a study, unless the study is a comparative LCA. 3 Textile Exchange discourages the comparison of LCA data between fibre or material categories or geographies.", "LCA data from industry databases should not be compared. These are not like-for-like comparisons, as each database will apply differing methodologies and assumptions. 7 There is a critical need to move beyond current LCA methodology and adopt an  LCA+  approach. This considers context-specific impact areas and includes beneficial outcomes not captured within current LCA methodology, such as biodiversity, soil health, water, animal welfare, and livelihoods. 8 For Scope 3 footprinting, Textile Exchange encourages the use of supplier-specific data and LCA data from well-documented LCA studies, with careful consideration of data quality in relation to the materiality of a fibre or material within the overall footprint. 9 To help close remaining impact data gaps, frameworks such as Textile Exchange s Regenerative Agriculture Outcome Framework can be used. This tool can help track progress across a holistic set of impact areas tailored to specific systems and contexts over time.

These challenges pose barriers to widespread adoption.<br/><br/>In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed US$ 100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Through the Regenerative Catalyst Fund, Mad Agriculture helps farmers move from planning to action, offering small grants, 0% loans, cost-sharing opportunities, and other innovative financing models. In 2024, $ 500,000 was provided to over 30 farmers for regenerative practices such as prairie strips, perennial plantings (including trees, hedgerows, pollinator habitats, and silvopasture), and fencing for holistic grazing.

Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast.

Healthy soil is not only more productive but also resilient to droughts and floods, reducing the risks for farmers and stabilizing crop yields. These practices can also enhance the soil's ability to sequester carbon, turning farms into carbon sinks rather than sources of emissions. Regenerative agricultural practices not only mitigate the climate crisis in the first place, but can also help improve farmer crop yield, increase income, and provide a buffer to climate shocks.<br/><br/>However, the transition to regenerative agriculture is not without challenges. The shift often comes with financial and administrative burdens, especially for smallholder farmers who are pioneering these new practices. Farmers may need to invest in new machinery, seeds for cover crops, and time to learn new techniques as well as provide evidence of their climate impact - all of which come with financial inputs. Applying for grants, loans, or subsidies to support the transition can also be time-consuming and complex, placing an additional burden on farmers already juggling the day-to-day demands of running their farms. These challenges pose barriers to widespread adoption.<br/><br/>In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed US$ 100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast. Through the Regenerative Catalyst Fund, Mad Agriculture helps farmers move from planning to action, offering small grants, 0% loans, cost-sharing opportunities, and other innovative financing models. In 2024, $ 500,000 was provided to over 30 farmers for regenerative practices such as prairie strips, perennial plantings (including trees, hedgerows, pollinator habitats, and silvopasture), and fencing for holistic grazing. In addition to ecological expertise, Mad Agriculture brings business acumen to support farmers in their full complexity, including enabling irrigation systems, agrotourism, and winning larger grants.<br/><br/>myAgro - Designing mobile tools that connect farmers in West Africa with climate-smart solutions<br/><br/>myAgro is a nonprofit social enterprise that helps smallholder farmers in West Africa move out of poverty. With myAgro's mobile layaway platform, farmers make small payments towards climate-smart packages of seeds, fertilizer, and regenerative agriculture training that increase soil health, yields, and income - boosting climate resilience. In 2023, myAgro reported their farmers grew 179% more food and earned US$ 164 more than control farmers.<br/><br/>Central to myAgro's model are Village Entrepreneurs (VEs) - local sales ambassadors (primarily women) who help farmers enroll for packages and make payments. Initially VEs used paper ledgers to manage sales, but they eventually needed digital tools to serve a growing number of farmers in their communities. With support from the Cisco Foundation, myAgro developed the Connect mobile app, enabling VEs to manage sales, enroll farmers, and collect payments digitally. Since then, myAgro has upgraded the app with support from Cisco to generate customer target lists, facilitate mobile money payments, and make year-round package sales among other key features.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Connect has enabled VEs to link exponentially more farmers with the tools they need to increase their income through regenerative agriculture. In 2024, myAgro is on track to serve more than 280,000 farmers in Mali, Senegal, and C\u00f3te d'Ivoire.<br/><br/>\"I was drawn to myAgro's holistic approach towards farming, which emphasized the importance of sustainable techniques and access to quality inputs.

With 95% of food grown in soil, improving soil health and halting degradation is crucial for our food system. Regenerative agriculture practices build healthier, more resilient soil, yielding nutrient-rich plants and food. However, a comprehensive measurement system has been lacking.

These challenges pose barriers to widespread adoption.<br/><br/>In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed US$ 100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers<br/><br/>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.<br/><br/>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).<br/><br/>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.<br/><br/>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States<br/><br/>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.<br/><br/>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place? And how can those caring for the land be ensured access to the resources they need?<br/><br/>With these questions in mind, the Cisco Foundation has funded Mad Agriculture's work with farmers across the U.S., beginning the focus predominately in the Intermountain West, Great Plains, Midwest, and Southeast.
