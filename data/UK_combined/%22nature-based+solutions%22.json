This will help improve collective understanding of SuDS performance, support stakeholders who don't have access to modelling software to compare options and improve communications during the scoping phases of a project.", "Given the 165,000 major street works in London every year, if even a small percentage of these holes could be refilled with SuDS rather than road or pavement, this could meaningfully contribute to the reduction of surface water flood risk whilst also reducing disruption to road users and communities. Fund partner Isle Utilities looking forward to wider adoption of innovationsIsle Utilities associate director Oliver Raud said: \"This learning report brings together valuable insights from a range of pioneering projects within the Ofwat Innovation Fund portfolio. It highlights how collaboration, shared learning, and, crucially, systems thinking can accelerate transformation and drive improved environmental, societal and customer outcomes, from our upstream catchments, through to the sea. We, at Isle, are proud to have supported this important work and look forward to seeing how these lessons and learnings can help deliver even greater impact across the sector. Climate and biodiversity crises driving need for innovationOfwat director, environment and innovation Jo Jolly said: \"Our water sector needs innovative solutions, and the culture to enable it, to navigate the crises we face - from climate change and biodiversity loss to rapid population growth. Right across the sector, we need to collaborate at pace and drive a major shift towards nature-based solutions The Ofwat Innovation Fund has been a vital part of initiating this transition, and our ambition for ever more urgent progress is a central part of our new action plan for 2025-30. Listen to a recent episode of The Engineers Collective podcast featuring Jolly speaking about how the Ofwat Innovation Fund is breaking down barriers between silos in the sector and promoting solutions to solve water stress.

'Planning for this urban expansion must start now.", "As cities across the continent grow at unprecedented rates, they face mounting climate risks-from flooding to heatwaves-while grappling with aging infrastructure and significantly contributing to Greenhouse gas emissions. Co-hosted by the African Development Bank, World Resources Institute (WRI) Africa, and the World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the event held on 30 May, made a compelling case for scaling up nature-based solutions and Green-Grey Infrastructure in African cities. Currently, the nature-based solutions model is gaining significant momentum in Africa as an important approach to address pressing urban challenges posed by climate change, biodiversity loss, infrastructure gap, and rapid population growth. In this regard, the notion of Nature-based solutions implies that Africa should work with nature instead of destroying it as is currently the case in most African cities. GGI blends traditional built infrastructure with natural systems such as wetlands, forests, and rivers-offering more cost-effective, resilient, sustainable and inclusive solutions.

(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/understanding-biodiversity-net-gain\">Biodiversity Net Gain</url>, or BNG, requires developers in England to counteract and ameliorate the impacts that projects such as housing developments have on biodiversity, either by improving the habitat on-site or funding habitat creation off-site. Habitat banks are areas of land where habitat restoration is carried out to meet developers' off-site BNG requirements. To help deliver the requisite minimum 10% uplift in biodiversity, developers can choose to buy BNG 'units' from a habitat bank.)</p><p>Other asset managers like Abrdn are incorporating nature-positive investments into their portfolios, reflecting the growing demand for sustainable finance. Oxygen Conservation, Nattergal, and Highlands Rewilding are notable examples of private companies investing in large-scale land restoration and conservation projects in the UK. Additionally, private estates such as Knepp, in southern England, are leading rewilding efforts that not only restore ecosystems, but also generate revenue through eco-tourism and sustainable land management.</p><p>In addition, large multinationals like Mars, Cargill and Walmart are funding nature-based solutions through philanthropic partnerships, such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.earth/fif/\">Fisheries Improvement Fund</url> (developed by WWF and Finance Earth).</p><p>Local authorities, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oceancitynature.co.uk/\">Plymouth City Council</url>, and water companies are also increasingly investing in nature-based solutions to manage flood risks, improve water quality, enhance biodiversity and deliver community benefits.</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"1\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colnum=\"1\" colwidth=\"640\"/><tbody><row><entry>Glossary: related termsNatural capital: the stock of natural assets, like forests, wetlands, soil and animalsEcosystem services: the benefits that natural capital and natural systems provide, such as clean air and water, medicine, food, flood management and coastal protectionNatural climate solutions: nature-based solutions which specifically focus on reducing or removing greenhouse gas emissionsGreen infrastructure: a broad term which applies to natural and semi-natural areas and interventions designed to deliver ecosystem services, often connected to urban and rural development, for instance sustainable drainage systems, green roofs, parks and street treesNature markets: the preferred term of the UK government for the financing of NbS projects and the purchase and sale of the benefits they generate</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>How is such financing typically structured?</p><p>AM &amp; WP: Financing for NbS varies depending on the type of project and organisation providing the finance. Ultimately there is no \"one size fits all\" and the type of finance will need to be structured based on how suitable it is for the specific project. Since many nature markets are nascent, financing for NbS is often \"blended\", combining philanthropic or public funding with private investment.</p><p>For instance, Highlands Rewilding has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.highlandsrewilding.co.uk/crowdfund-launch-2022\">used a crowdfunding campaign</url> to engage local Scottish communities and investors in their rewilding efforts. Organisations like Nattergal attract investments from high-net-worth individuals who are interested in supporting sustainable land management and biodiversity projects. Aviva's investments have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://connect.avivab2b.co.uk/broker/articles/news/Taking-a-stand-on-sustainability-at-BIBA-2024/\">made from the balance sheet</url>, on the basis that they will develop nature markets and help Aviva achieve its net zero target.</p><p>Projects may also be financed by the sale of credits or 'units'. In 2023, Finance Earth worked with Surrey Wildlife Trust to secure a \u00a31m commitment from Shepperton Studios, a Surrey-based film studio, to purchase biodiversity units in order to meet its Biodiversity Net Gain obligations. This enabled Surrey Wildlife Trust to carry out extensive grassland restoration.</p><p>There are also examples of debt finance enabling NbS. For example, we worked with the RSPB (the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds) to secure a loan for the creation of habitat in south Devon to support the cirl bunting, a farmland bird threatened by agricultural intensification. This loan is being repaid through contributions from the local council to deliver compensatory habitat for housing development.</p><p>What are the particular challenges of financing nature-based solutions?</p><p>AM &amp; WP: Financing nature-based solutions faces several challenges, primarily due to uncertain revenue streams and evolving business models. While there are a few established codes such as the Woodland Carbon Code or Peatland Code in the UK, there remains a general lack of agreed standards and methodologies for other potential markets and ecosystem services. This creates uncertainty for potential buyers around what benefits they are purchasing and what they can claim. Several codes are under development, like the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ceh.ac.uk/our-science/projects/uk-saltmarsh-code\">Saltmarsh Code</url> \u2013 some of the funding commitments from Aviva will support the piloting of this code.</p><p>There is also a limited pipeline of investment-ready projects. Despite growing interest from the private sector, there's often a mismatch between available capital and projects that can deliver measurable outcomes and returns. Many NbS initiatives are not yet at a stage where they can adequately quantify their impacts or potential revenues, which is essential for attracting investment. This gap is exacerbated by the immaturity of the market and a shortage of skills, knowledge and expertise necessary for project development. (Finance Earth's <url normalizedValue=\"https://finance.earth/uknaccelerator/\">UK Nature Accelerator</url> aims to address these issues by providing technical assistance and guidance for project developers.) Another positive step has been the UK government's Natural Environment Investment Readiness Fund (NEIRF) grant programme, which has been critical in supporting UK nature projects towards securing investment.</p><p>There is a limited pipeline of investment-ready projects. Many NbS initiatives can not yet adequately quantify their impacts or potential revenues</p><p>Policy uncertainty also poses a challenge. Stable regulatory frameworks and supportive environmental policies are essential for creating robust nature markets at scale. Some helpful initiatives have included the UK government's <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/642542ae60a35e000c0cb148/nature-markets.pdf\">Nature Markets Framework</url> and BSI's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/capabilities/standards-services/the-nature-investment-standards-programme/\">Nature Investment Standards Programme</url>. Nonetheless, inconsistency in policy has stalled progress in some areas. This has included mixed messages about nutrient neutrality rules in the UK, providing uncertainty around emerging markets and initiatives for trading nutrient credits.</p><p>Concerns about greenwashing and the integrity of nature projects further complicate the landscape. Government initiatives like the UK's <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/642542ae60a35e000c0cb148/nature-markets.pdf\">Nature Markets Framework</url> can help address these concerns. Recognising a gap in current policy and guidance, Finance Earth worked with leading environmental NGOs to publish the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.finance.earth/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Nature-Market-Principles-Full-Document-September-2023.pdf\">Nature Markets Principles</url>, aimed at ensuring accountability and mitigating risks associated with over-claiming by businesses.</p><p>Where are the biggest opportunities in this field right now?</p><p>AM &amp; WP: The biggest opportunities currently stem from the surge in corporate interest to address operational impacts and dependencies on natural resources. Companies across various sectors \u2013 particularly in food, agriculture, forestry and fisheries \u2013 are increasingly recognising the urgency of implementing sustainable practices within their supply chains. This shift is driven by a growing awareness of the massive economic and reputational risks posed by environmental degradation, which can directly affect their operations. As a result, businesses are seeking to support initiatives that enhance the sustainability of their supply chains, leading to increased investment in nature-based solutions projects that enhance biodiversity, improve soil health and protect terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Water companies and other industries heavily reliant on natural resources are also exploring partnerships and funding opportunities to mitigate their environmental impacts, creating fertile ground for developing new financing mechanisms that align corporate goals with environmental outcomes.</p><p>Established nature markets in the UK also present significant opportunities for nature-based solutions finance. The two government-backed carbon codes (the Woodland Carbon Code and the Peatland Code) are catalysing demand for investment in nature restoration projects. These frameworks offer robust, science-based market infrastructure for monitoring, reporting and verifying CO\u2082 emissions, ensuring that investments are both effective and accountable. The track record of transactions within these markets further enhances investor confidence, making it easier for businesses to engage in nature-based solutions.</p><p>While there is growing interest in investing in nature-based solutions, strong regulatory frameworks will be required to drive and sustain long-term, meaningful action at scale.</p>", "publisher": "Pioneers Post", "instances": ["IMPACT 101: What are nature-based solutions and why do we need them?

Companies across various sectors \u2013 particularly in food, agriculture, forestry and fisheries \u2013 are increasingly recognising the urgency of implementing sustainable practices within their supply chains. This shift is driven by a growing awareness of the massive economic and reputational risks posed by environmental degradation, which can directly affect their operations.

Cecilia Young, catchment officer with the Severn Rivers Trust, said: \"The design was carefully adapted following ecological surveys to protect species-rich habitats, demonstrating a commitment to biodiversity alongside flood resilience. We are looking forward to collating the data and seeing how this wetland will prove the benefits of nature-based solutions to water management.

The CDL MicroForest is a 2,800 square feet (sq ft) regenerative tropical microforest, developed in collaboration with experts in ecology and biological sciences from the National University of Singapore (NUS), and with inputs from the National Parks Board (NParks). This pioneering nature-based solution for cooling through greening aims to combat urban heat and biodiversity loss in high-density urban landscapes, serving as a living laboratory to study how microforests can lower temperatures, boost biodiversity and enhance ecological resilience.<br/><br/>The creation of the MicroForest is an extension of CDL's long-standing commitment to sustainability and integrating nature in the built environment. Since 2010, CDL has also been voluntarily conducting biodiversity impact assessments (BIAs) on greenfield sites located within or adjacent to natural habitats before construction. Environmental mitigation measures are also undertaken where necessary.<br/><br/>The launch was graced by Singapore's President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who participated in a tree-planting ceremony alongside representatives from CDL, NParks, NUS, as well as young eco-champions. This symbolic event underscores the strength of the 3P (Public, Private and People) partnership model in advancing urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation.<br/><br/>Mr Sherman Kwek, CDL's Group Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Climate action thrives on the power of 3P collaboration and innovation. We created the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest as sustainable showcases to complement our ongoing revamp of City Square Mall. Since its opening in 2009, City Square Mall has established itself as Singapore's first eco-mall, home to innovative community spaces for sustainability events and education, such as the Singapore Sustainability Academy. The timely launch of the EcoTrain and MicroForest enhances the Mall's unique position as a family-friendly eco-hub with exciting programmes to nurture future eco-champions and promote sustainable living.\"<br/><br/>Scaling Impact: A Blueprint for Sustainable Cities<br/><br/>As cities worldwide grapple with the effects of climate change, CDL's EcoTrain and MicroForest present scalable, high-impact solutions that can be adapted across urban landscapes. By demonstrating how decommissioned infrastructure can be repurposed for sustainability education and how regenerative tropical microforests can contribute to climate resilience, these projects set a new benchmark for integrating ESG principles into real estate development.<br/><br/>With urban populations expected to continue rising, the need for innovative, nature-based interventions has never been greater. Through these initiatives, CDL showcases how the built environment can harmonise with nature, creating sustainable, livable cities that benefit both people and the planet.<br/><br/>Projects like the CDL EcoTrain and MicroForest highlight the power of cross-sector collaboration in driving urban transformation.

They enhance biodiversity, improve water quality and create healthier, more attractive, resilient places to live. Crucially for water companies, they can help reduce storm overflow spills by diverting stormwater away from sewer networks. Many types - such as engineered rain gardens or planters - also offer resilience to drought by storing rainwater for use in dry periods.</p><p>New legislation and national standards signal a positive trend toward broader adoption of SuDS.\u00a0 As a supplier of the SuDSPlanter systems, we work closely with the water sector - as well as local authorities, businesses and developers - to incorporate sustainable drainage into their operations and community settings.</p><p>Many water companies are already realising the benefits, having begun to invest in SuDS during AMP7 and earlier. Our planter systems are operating in all-but-one water company catchment in the UK - including in more than 300 schools.</p><p>Most recently, we partnered with Yorkshire Water to install 49 planter systems across 15 primary schools and one farm in areas vulnerable to surface water flooding, capturing up to 18,700l of rainwater, helping to reduce pressure on the sewer system during storms.</p><p>Under the new legislation, performance data like this, established through instant drainage modelling, will be essential for water companies writing their drainage plans - which must now consider sustainable drainage.\u00a0\u00a0The modelling, carried out by an independent civil engineer and hydraulics specialist, simulates how our planter systems of varying sizes, against varying roof areas, behave under a range of wet and dry weather conditions.</p><p>The analysis tells us how quickly the storage will fill, how long it would take to drain down and what impact each scenario would have on downstream drainage. This data can be used alongside results from the real-time monitoring we undertake of our planters in situ, to assess their hydraulic efficiency in attenuating and controlling roof runoff.</p><p>For developers specifiers and designers, such calculations can support planning applications by demonstrating how any SuDS within their designs can reduce the risk of flooding downstream.</p><p>Crucially, there is also the biodiversity net gain by creating and enhancing habitats within developments. Our planter systems, designed to ensure maximum plant health, can demonstrate a measurable increase in biodiversity.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maintenance </emphasis></p><p>It is good to see a section on maintenance in the new national standards - poorly maintained SuDS can fail to deliver their intended benefits. We would certainly advise, those managing SuDS installation projects - particularly on third party land - consider maintenance agreements. These should include confirmation of who will be responsible for maintaining the asset in the future.</p><p>Of course, SuDS are only part of wider strategy for sustainable management of wastewater - they do not address domestic waste or grey water, which require separate solutions - but the increasing prominence of SuDS, through these policies, is a positive step forward in creating climate resilience communities.

But how can governments and communities determine which nature-based solutions best meet their needs? In Kinshasa, indigenous knowledge, innovative tools, and proactive local government are helping to answer the question.</p><p><br/><br/>The capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kinshasa, is one of Africa's largest cities. Already home to over 15 million people, Kinshasa is growing rapidly, expanding by about 2,000 people and five hectares every day, according to World Bank estimates.<br/><br/>Much of the city's growth is informal, sprawling out to the savannah south and east of the capital. Green spaces are being replaced by concrete, metal, and bare earth, ushering in climate challenges like flooding, soil erosion and higher temperatures.<br/><br/>These problems stem from rapid unplanned urbanization. Without sufficient planning, the capital is expanding into areas that lack basic infrastructure and services like drainage systems and solid waste management. Construction on unstable, sandy soil is putting infrastructure, homes and people at risk of erosion. Urban heat is also a challenge, with temperatures in the city recorded up to 8\u00b0 C higher than outside the capital.<br/><br/>The untapped potential of nature-based solutions<br/><br/>To help tackle these challenges, the City of Kinshasa requested the City Climate Finance Gap Fund (the Gap Fund), a partnership implemented by the World Bank and European Investment Bank, to explore the potential of using nature-based solutions to build urban climate resilience, sequester carbon emissions and provide socio-economic benefits.<br/><br/>The Gap Fund provided US$ 260,000 in technical assistance to help identify, evaluate, and integrate specific nature-based solutions in Kinshasa. Government actors from the City of Kinshasa, the Department of Urban Development and the Ministry of Public Works partnered with World Bank specialists and consultants from Groupe Huit, ARTER and VSI Afrique to implement the Gap Fund technical assistance proposal.<br/><br/>The work builds on the World Bank-financed Kinshasa Multisector Development and Urban Resilience project as well as support previously provided by the World Bank's Global Program on Nature-based Solutions for Climate Resilience at the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR).<br/><br/>Pinpointing solutions to design an atlas of plant species<br/><br/>The team used the World Bank's Nature-based Solutions Opportunity Scan (NBSOS), a digital algorithm that uses high-resolution geospatial data and analysis to help pinpoint nature-based solutions that would support Kinshasa's three goals: to sequester carbon, reduce natural disaster risk, and provide socio-economic benefits.<br/><br/>The tool helped analyze physical conditions such as topography and soil composition, determine suitable locations, and compile a list of nature-based solutions, drawn from the 14 types outlined in the World Bank Catalogue of Nature-based Solutions for Urban Resilience. Examples include urban farming, terraces and slopes and green corridors.<br/><br/>For the first time, the NBSOS tool was adapted to the local and hyper-local scale to provide recommendations that were site specific and customized to local needs. Local, indigenous knowledge from people living in Ibi, a village near Kinshasa known for its sustainable agroforestry practices and biodiversity expertise, was integrated in analysing suitable vegetation types. Their input was crucial in choosing native, local and exotic plant species.<br/><br/>The team also integrated knowledge from the NBSOS tool with data on local vegetation types to create a 'Vegetation Atlas' which scored each plant's ability to reduce vulnerability to floods, heatwaves and soil erosion, sequester carbon and enhance socio-economic development. By linking the Vegetation Atlas to the NBSOS, the team could identify the most effective nature-based solutions and plant species for specific areas.<br/><br/>\"The Vegetation Atlas enabled us to know which types and varieties of grass, plants and trees could best meet Kinshasa's challenges and priorities,\" said Laurent Corroyer, Disaster Risk Management Specialist at the World Bank. \"Vegetation choices can now be optimized by benefit, such as reduced soil erosion, heat stress, air pollution or flooding. The new tool offers practical insights, locally adapted solutions and clearer guidance for investment opportunities.\"<br/><br/>Tackling soil erosion and flood risk, and supporting livelihoods<br/><br/>Results from the assessment allowed the city and experts to develop a city-wide nature-based solutions strategy and pilot solutions in Kimwenza, a hilly commune on a slope to the south of Kinshasa owned by the Loyola University of Congo. The area is a large hotspot for soil erosion and home to more than 300 families, many of whom live in basic housing, facing challenges of unemployment, poverty and soil erosion.<br/><br/>The pilot site was divided into three zones -- uphill, intermediate and lower -- with targeted nature-based solutions for each zone designed to prevent soil erosion, restore soil fertility, create jobs and provide food for local people. These solutions included the layered planting of local species of herbs, plants and trees on terraces, the creation of urban farms and pedestrian pathways, as well as the medium- to long-term maintenance of the site.<br/><br/>The team also trained staff from the university on implementation, including planting techniques and plant spacing. The university is now sharing this knowledge by training and working with people in local communities to implement the solutions.<br/><br/>Lucie Bakajika, Urban Development and Governance Specialist at the Ministry of Public works, said: \"[The experts] helped us to define investments in nature-based solutions more specifically on this erosion site [in Kimwenza], which has solutions that will be implemented with the University of Loyola Congo. [They] also helped us to put in place better communication with the beneficiaries and technical assistance in the review. Thanks to this study, we were able to obtain an atlas of plant species, which allowed us to discover local plant species, and will be used on the site and which are not always the same [as those] used previously.\"<br/><br/>The Office for Roads and Drainage, the national office in charge of drainage work, also worked with the university to identify complementary drainage solutions for Kimwenza, including building a structure that can hold and channel runoff during heavy rains. This work is due to be completed in 2024.<br/><br/>Impact: an integrative tool that can support nature-based solutions at the local level and in cities globally<br/><br/>The technical assistance provided by the Gap Fund is leading to concrete results and investments: The City of Kinshasa developed a nature-based solutions strategy informing the city's investment program and identifying a long list of local and city-wide investments with an estimated value of US$ 153M. Of that, a selected short list of nature-based solutions investments, estimated at US$ 4M, will be taken up for further preparation and financing by the World Bank. The city's nature-based solutions strategy is expected to inform dialogue on and help mobilize additional financing for future urban investments financed by the World Bank and other development partners in Kinshasa.<br/><br/>The local and national government have also increased their understanding of the opportunities for nature-based solutions, including potential costs and strategic investments sequencing.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, the team is working with the government to explore scaling up their support to other sites in Kimwenza and Kinshasa that face similar challenges. This work could inspire and inform governments around the world that want to adopt nature-based solutions to help address urban challenges while mitigating and adapting to climate change.<br/><br/>Distributed by APO Group on behalf of The World Bank Group.       </p>", "publisher": "ENP Newswire", "instances": ["Nature-based solutions like urban farming, terraces, and green corridors can help cities with climate challenges including urban heat, flooding, and air pollution.

Green spaces are being replaced by concrete, metal, and bare earth, ushering in climate challenges like flooding, soil erosion and higher temperatures.", "Green spaces are being replaced by concrete, metal, and bare earth, ushering in climate challenges like flooding, soil erosion and higher temperatures. These problems stem from rapid unplanned urbanization. Without sufficient planning, the capital is expanding into areas that lack basic infrastructure and services like drainage systems and solid waste management. Construction on unstable, sandy soil is putting infrastructure, homes and people at risk of erosion. Urban heat is also a challenge, with temperatures in the city recorded up to 8\u00b0 C higher than outside the capital. The untapped potential of nature-based solutionsTo help tackle these challenges, the City of Kinshasa requested the City Climate Finance Gap Fund (the Gap Fund), a partnership implemented by the World Bank and European Investment Bank, to explore the potential of using nature-based solutions to build urban climate resilience, sequester carbon emissions and provide socio-economic benefits.

To further elevate the Kingdom's standing, HH the Governor of AlQassim launched the 'International Date Road' initiative to link Saudi date production to the historic Silk Road. The project will facilitate the export of more than 578,000 tons of dates annually, strengthening the Kingdom's position as a global hub for date trade, in line with the Saudi Vision 2030 objectives.<br/><br/>The Saudi Green Building Forum, recognized in Consultative Status with the United Nations, hosts its 15th edition, with 3,000+ participants, from companies such as Saudi Aramco, Nesma  Partners, Climatech, Roshan, and Shaker Group. Titled: 'Energizing Green Action: Driving Nature-Based Solutions for Sustainable Development Goals', the SGBF will feature 50 speakers and more than 20 sessions to address green city challenges, promote multilateral agreements, and further accelerate localization of Sustainable Development Goals in light of Saudi Vision 2030.

These markets aim to\u00a0channel private investment into nature recovery\u00a0by assigning economic value to natural assets and services. By establishing them locally to a new infrastructure development, nature markets can be far more than a sales transaction. They can boost asset resilience to climate change, increase access to green space and create long-term jobs in the management and maintenance of nature.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But to reach this stage, where local nature markets go beyond sales transactions, the infrastructure industry needs to play its part. The starting point is to understand the challenges of establishing nature markets in a fair and inclusive way and helping to overcome these.</p><p>The need for nature's recovery to go hand in hand with development was reinforced last year when biodiversity net gain (BNG) became mandatory for most developments seeking planning permission. That requirement will be extended to Nationally Significant Infrastructure Projects from May next year, but many infrastructure providers already have ambitious commitments for nature that go beyond the fast-approaching legislation.</p><p>BNG can be achieved using \"biodiversity units\" on nature markets offered by third parties, especially where there isn't the available or suitable land on site. However, while this meets legislative requirements, buying biodiversity units from local nature markets rather than further away is an opportunity to drive real improvements for communities close to these new infrastructure schemes.</p><p>The lack of standard pricing means that buying biodiversity units from third parties is not always straightforward. Doing so locally is even less so with potential providers being new to the process. As a result, a \"matching\" process is needed to achieve localised investment in nature - but currently there is no national system to do this. On one hand, you have large infrastructure providers with stringent procurement requirements. On the nature delivery side, there are a range of parties from individual landowners to nature conservation bodies with a national presence who are registered charities. This creates issues, none of them insurmountable but they need to be acknowledged and addressed.</p><p>For nature conservation organisations, the formalities and costs involved can appear daunting, particularly that legal obligations under BNG can extend to 30 years. For the infrastructure asset owners, there is often a challenge of finding the organisations and then the right people within them to get the necessary agreements in place, especially when that work needs to happen at pace.</p><p>These issues can be addressed with the right support but that will take time and money. When added to the tight project timelines and need for certainty required by infrastructure investors, developing a local nature market can certainly present risk. Minimising this could lead to using established third-party suppliers which are based further away, resulting in lost local opportunities.</p><p>In order for local conservation groups close to where these infrastructure projects are being built to enter the nature market, they will need support and guidance. As a sector, we have a responsibility to provide advice to our infrastructure client base and to work with grass roots conservation organisations to bring them together and understand the challenges each face.</p><p>Looking at how a similar challenge was addressed by the long-term management of nature-based solutions for flood management could be key. The use of a not-for-profit Community Interest Company (CIC), which blends public and private finance, was critical to create the Aire Resilience Company that cares for the nature-based flood management elements of the Leeds Flood Alleviation Scheme. It brings together local organisations to achieve the goal without having a workforce of its own.</p><p>It took time for the nature-based solutions sector to develop concepts that are now becoming accepted for long term management and development, local nature markets are no different. However, given the scale of infrastructure investment that is starting, action is needed now to build these nature markets so local communities and nature see a positive effect. The government should develop a central marketplace for biodiversity units that standardises key data and facilitates matchmaking to deliver on the legal obligations it is putting in place around BNG. This tool would help developers plan earlier and give suppliers confidence that they can find a buyer so they could plan and invest ahead of reaching an agreement.</p><p>As an industry, we have responsibilities to help make this change happen too. We can do that by continuing to foster collaboration, sharing best practice through case studies and developing tools that reduce duplication.</p><p>Nature markets are no longer just a concept, they have real potential which, if fully realised, will see private investment being channelled into nature recovery. But there is a risk that, if the local markets are not developed in a local, fair and inclusive manner, nature recovery will not happen at a local level. This may mean that at the end of the 10-Year Infrastructure Strategy we will have an improvement in the roads, schools and hospitals we use every day, but we will not see the same level of benefits to nature, climate resilience and job opportunities around these assets.</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Julia Baker is technical director for nature services at Mott MacDonald</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "New Civil Engineer", "instances": ["These issues can be addressed with the right support but that will take time and money.

The Government will respond to the recommendations in Parliament on Monday. FURTHER INFORMATION PLEDGE:<br/><br/>Environment Secretary Steve Reed's pledge is based on:<br/><br/>*A 50% reduction in spills from storm overflows - an outlet from the public sewer that spills both sewage and rainwater into the environment - by 2030.<br/><br/>*A 50% reduction in the amount of phosphorus from water company treated wastewater entering our waterways by the end of January 2028.<br/><br/>*Work with devolved governments to ban wet wipes containing plastic across the UK.

It is embedded in corporate sustainability, supply chains, and ESG mandates.</p><p><br/><br/>* Finance is a critical enabler, with calls for creative, localized funding models and stronger integration into ESG and investment frameworks.<br/><br/>* Collective action is essential but complex, requiring trust, transparency, and local ownership to succeed.<br/><br/>* Communication matters-simplifying language and storytelling are vital to engaging stakeholders, driving action and breaking out of echo chambers.<br/><br/>* Policy frameworks must catch up, with stronger integration of water into climate adaptation plans and global governance. Scalable impact will come from localized solutions, backed by strong partnerships between government, business, and finance<br/><br/>* AWS Standard Version 3.0 introduces streamlined requirements, deeper integration of climate and biodiversity, and new expectations for collective action and water reuse.<br/><br/>As the climate crisis intensifies and biodiversity loss accelerates, water stewardship is emerging not just as a sustainability imperative-but as a strategic, economic, and social necessity. At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking<br/><br/>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.<br/><br/>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"<br/><br/>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:<br/><br/>* Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/><br/>* Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/><br/>* Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/><br/>* Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/><br/>* Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.<br/><br/>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.<br/><br/>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change<br/><br/>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship.

Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2.

Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0.

SoPHE commends the Commission's transparent, evidence-led approach and particularly endorses the following themes:<br/><br/>SoPHE's position - Key support points:<br/><br/>Integrated water systems thinking:<br/><br/>SoPHE has long advocated joined-up strategies that embed surface water, foul drainage, SuDS, greywater reuse, and water demand reduction within the built environment and support the Commission's call for an industry-wide shift toward system-level resilience<br/><br/>Regulatory reform  accountability:<br/><br/>SoPHE echoes the Commission's recommendation for a clearer governance model with simplified regulatory architecture ensuring accountability for performance outcomes, aligned with incentives for innovation and sustainability.<br/><br/>Infrastructure investment  climate resilience:<br/><br/>The report rightly identifies the urgent need to upgrade the UK's outdated water infrastructure. SoPHE members see firsthand the consequences of underfunded assets - from combined sewer overflows (CSOs) to constrained network capacities. It is SoPHE's belief that new developments must be future-proofed for both flood and drought resilience.<br/><br/>Water efficiency  demand management:<br/><br/>SoPHE champions the Commission's stance on accelerated water efficiency standards across all building types, with minimum performance requirements on fittings and plumbing systems.

The future king told the audience of around 100 people that climate and nature-based solutions were the ``foundation of long-term security, stability and prosperity'', reminding them that more than half of global GDP depends on nature. William said: ``Collectively, we have signed up to a global commitment to protect 30% of land and sea by 2030. ``This commitment is our best chance of reversing the damage done to our planet and restoring its wellbeing. ``But 2030 is just five years away, and only 17% of land and just 3% of the ocean has been fully protected. ``Climate and nature-based solutions are the foundation of long-term security, stability and prosperity. ``More than half of global GDP depends on nature.", "Investors and business owners from around the world attended the event, which spotlighted success stories from the prize, and gave an opportunity for potential investors in environmental solutions to network.

Innovative, Nature-Based SolutionsThe team developed an innovative biological algae control system through the integration of native fish into the water reservoir system that aligned perfectly with the Sustainably Grown standard framework. Introducing algae-eating fish as a replacement for standard chemical controls proved to be a breakthrough, greatly accelerating the reduction of algae. Beyond controlling algae, the fish produced waste that became organic fertilizer, enriching the soil naturally. As ecosystem health improved, more bird species flocked to the ranch, further boosting biodiversity.

With this new funding, Chloris will accelerate product development, grow its commercial and technical teams, and deepen partnerships across corporate carbon accounting for forest risk commodities and the carbon value chain, meeting the market's rising demand for verifiable, high-quality nature-based solutions. The company will also expand its operations with a new European hub to support regional growth and customer engagement. </p><p>The investment comes at a pivotal time for the climate and nature agenda, when trust, transparency, and scalable solutions are more urgent than ever. While the climate and nature crises are global issues, action is taken locally, by governments, project developers, investors, and supply chain actors working across diverse landscapes and regions. Aligning local actions with global ambition demands fit-for-purpose solutions that are both scientifically rigorous and operationally scalable at every level. Chloris' technology responds directly to this need, enabling better decisions through transparent, science-based insights. Developed under the guidance of Co-Founder and Chief Science Officer Dr. Alessandro Baccini, the Chloris technology uses satellite data, proprietary sensor fusion and machine learning to measure vegetation, going far beyond traditional land cover mapping. Chloris is uniquely positioned to provide high-quality, affordable, and timely data on what has happened in every acre of forest around the world since the year 2000. \"This is a decisive moment,\" said Marco Albani, CEO and Co-Founder of Chloris. \"To protect and restore nature at the pace and scale the climate demands, we need tools that make it easy to act-with confidence. That's what Chloris enables, and this investment allows us to take it to the next level. We're thrilled by the support of Future Energy Ventures and honored by the continued belief in our mission from all of our investors.\" As science has been telling us, forests are essential carbon sinks, biodiversity havens, and socio-economic assets-and the urgency to protect and restore them has never been greater. In the past year alone, record-breaking wildfires and declining biomass trends, visible in Chloris data, have highlighted the accelerating loss of forest carbon. Reversing this trend requires scaling investment in nature, but doing so depends on our ability to accurately quantify biomass dynamics with confidence and consistency. \"We invested in Chloris Geospatial because we believe their technology is the missing link to restoring trust and unlocking growth in carbon markets, as well as improving accounting standards. The ability to independently, transparently, and affordably measure carbon dynamics across all woody vegetation globally represents a step change in how we monitor and account for nature-based climate solutions,\" said Patrick Elftmann, Managing Partner at Future Energy Ventures. Across both voluntary carbon markets and corporate supply chains, organizations are increasingly relying on satellite-based insights to assess, invest in, and monitor forest carbon projects and to report emissions and removals in alignment with protocols like the GHG Protocol. \"At AXA IM Alts, investing in solutions that protect, restore, and sustainably manage natural capital is core to our mission. Our continuous support for Chloris reflects our belief that scalable, science-based measurement is critical to driving integrity and impact in both carbon markets and corporate climate strategies,\" said Adam Gibbon, Natural Capital Lead at AXA IM Alts. Chloris' clients include leading corporations working to monitor forest-risk supply chains and make data-driven decisions aligned with climate goals and carbon accounting standards, forward-looking developers of nature-based solutions, and innovative carbon markets standards. Organizations rely on Chloris' analysis to quantify forest carbon dynamics with confidence and integrate transparent, science-based data into their climate reporting.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"328\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Value (US$ Million)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Venture Finance</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-Category</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Start-up</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Status</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Completed: 2025-07-07</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><h>Deal Participants</h><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"360\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Target (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Chloris Geospatial Inc.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer 1 (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">The Cisco Foundation</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer 2 (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Future Energy Ventures GmbH</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer 3 (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">AXA IM Alts</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer 4 (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Counteract Partners Ltd</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer 5 (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Orbia Ventures</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><h>Deal Rationale</h><p>The funding will be used to accelerate product development, grow its commercial and technical teams, and deepen partnerships across corporate carbon accounting for forest risk commodities and the carbon value chain.

At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.<br/><br/>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay  Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.<br/><br/>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:<br/><br/>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point<br/><br/>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.<br/><br/>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.<br/><br/>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"<br/><br/>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking<br/><br/>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.<br/><br/>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"<br/><br/>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence<br/><br/>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.<br/><br/>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"<br/><br/>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact<br/><br/>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.<br/><br/>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"<br/><br/>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice<br/><br/>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.<br/><br/>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"<br/><br/>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice<br/><br/>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.<br/><br/>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"<br/><br/>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps<br/><br/>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.<br/><br/>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"<br/><br/>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship<br/><br/>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:<br/><br/>* Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/><br/>* Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/><br/>* Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/><br/>* Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/><br/>* Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.<br/><br/>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.<br/><br/>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change<br/><br/>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts<br/><br/>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.
