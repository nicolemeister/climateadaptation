I felt this need to do something. Everyone else was doing things in their own way and I had to do something in my way,' Warne told media in January 2020 about his decision to sell the cap.<br/><br/>Shane Warne was amazed when his Baggy Green eventually sold at auction for just over $ 1 million - all of which was donated to the Australian Red Cross Disaster Relief and Recovery Fund.<br/>The cap was bought by Commonwealth Bank's chief executive, Matt Comyn, on behalf of the bank.<br/><br/>Mr Comyn said he was delighted the bank had secured the cherished Baggy Green and commended Shane Warne for putting his cap up for auction.<br/><br/>'He has demonstrated the same Aussie spirit we are seeing across the country with acts of generosity and dedication throughout this disaster as communities rally to support each other,' Mr Comyn said in January 2020.<br/><br/>After acquiring the Baggy Green, the bank took the cap on a fundraising tour across the country before retiring it as a permanent exhibit at the Bowral-based Bradman Museum in August 2020.<br/><br/>Over a period of six months, the baggy green visited schools, cricket clubs, and community centres.

The smoke plume was 14km high into the sky. All the locals could hope for was to take the appropriate shelter and let it \"pass\". And pass it did, taking with it the wildlife, bushland, and property.</p><p>Emotions about what has happened become clearer. We feel the loss of this special area we knew, like the death of a friend. Knowing that you were the last person to watch the wildlife is an upsetting thought, and then you extend it across the huge area that the fire damaged, it feels even worse. Bushfires have always been a normal part of summer in Victoria, but none of this feels normal. It's the start of the fire season. Most of the fires are so big, and so fierce there is little hope of controlling them.</p><p>The science on climate change is well documented and understood. The recent events look a lot like the predictions made by scientists years earlier, subsequently ignored by many politicians, who continue to play down the link and support the coal industry.

Thursday brought a brief reprieve from the devastation of New Year's Eve, allowing fire crews to attempt to gain a degree of control over some fires, authorities to take stock of the damage and rescue and supply operations to get underway. See related Why Australia's government is unmoved on climate change[3] Still, the wildfires have laid waste to vast areas of southern New South Wales (NSW) and eastern Victoria - roughly 12 million acres have been burned during this summer's fires so far - and have generated a cloud of smoke that has blanketed Sydney and Canberra, and travelled as far as New Zealand. The death toll, say authorities, is likely to rise. </p><p>Of particular concern are high temperatures and strong winds forecast for Saturday, which will probably bring further serious blazes. 'It is likely we will see them flare up,' Ben Shepherd, a spokesman for the NSW Rural Fire Service, told The Sydney Morning Herald[4]. 'We don't want a large population in the region.' The Rural Fire Service posted to Twitter to say Saturday's fires were expected to be 'the same or worse than New Year's Eve'. 'If you are planning to visit the South Coast this weekend, it is not safe. Do not be in this area on Saturday,' it warned.

A massive fire destroyed much of the town on Tuesday, forcing some residents and visitors to jump into the water, and rendering inland roads impassable. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said these kind of rescue and supply operations would continue throughout the day. 'There will be an effort today to drop satellite phones, food and water into isolated communities,' he said. 'I wouldn't want any community to think they're not a priority. Each community has a different set of circumstances with how the fire has affected them.' He cautioned, however, that the blazes were 'not like other bushfires' where communities could begin to rebuild once the fire had passed through. 'This is very different to that,' he said. 'This will be an active fire and a very challenging and complex environment for weeks and therefore we have to do things differently.' More than 1,000 people spent Tuesday night on the beach at Malua Bay on New South Wales's South coast, desperate to escape the smoke and flames. 'Everyone was on the beach, just covered in ash and smoke,' said Al Baxter, a former Australian Rugby Union player, who was there. 'There was a strange calmness. People were as close to the water's edge as they could [be]. People were literally just lying on the beach trying to keep out of the smoke and ash.' The fires have raged with such severity that they have created their own weather systems, forming 'pyrocumulonimbus' clouds - which Nasa[8]calls 'the fire-breathing dragon of clouds.'These storms are relatively dry, and the violent lightning they emit can start new fires. The severity of the bushfires has caused many to see them in the context of global climate change. 'Australia is normally hot and dry in the summer, but climate change, which brings longer and more frequent periods of extreme heat, worsens these conditions and makes vegetation drier and more likely to burn,' reports The New York Times[9]. -------------------------------For a round-up of the most important stories [10]from around the world - and a concise, refreshing and balanced take on the week's news agenda - try The Week magazine[11].

'We have faced these disasters before and we have prevailed,' he said, 'that is the spirit of Australians, that is the spirit that is on display, that is a spirit that we can celebrate as Australians.' However, Morrison and his government have also faced criticism for what many believe is there apathy on the issue of climate change, their failure to meets emissions targets, and the degree of influence held over them by Australia's powerful coal lobby. Reflecting in The Guardian Australia[12] on the scale of the disaster, David Marr, considers Morrision's words empty. 'One of the duties of a leader is to find the words in times like these.

The claim that arson is a primary cause of this season's bushfires has been comprehensively debunked: fire officers report that the majority of blazes were started by dry lightning storms. Nevertheless, social media is awash with false claims about the role of arson, obscuring the link between climate change and bushfires (       \u00a0    Disinformation and lies are spreading faster than Australia's bushfires, 11 January). However fires start, they burn more severely because Australia is suffering extreme conditions which are directly linked to anthropogenic climate change: 2019 was the country's hottest and driest year ever, with the temperature 1. 5C above the long-term average.

The prominent Hunter Valley winery <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tyrrells.com.au/\">Tyrrell's</url> announced a few days ago that it had taken the decision to have a drastically reduced 2020 harvest. Tyrrell's vines have not been directly affected by the blazes but the drift of smoke through the vineyards has left its mark on many of the grapes.</p><p>After conducting micro-ferments in the lab to test the grapes for smoke taint - which changes the taste of the wine - Tyrrell's announced that an estimated 80 per cent of its crop had been affected and would not be harvested for wine this year.</p><p>The wine from the grapes that are picked and vinified will be continually tested and retested before it is released, to ensure the quality is as it should be, because smoke taint can sometimes show up later in a wine.</p><p>Tyrrell's will not be the only one affected by smoke taint after a season of terrible fires. Its openness about its assessment of the damage might at least make it easier for other producers to reach a decision about their own harvest. Wine producers live with risk; being at the mercy of hail, fire, rain, frost, pests and predators is an implicit part of being dependent on a single crop often grown in a marginal climate.</p><p>But a wipe-out like this still hits hard. Family-owned Tyrrell's lies about 150 kilometres north of Sydney and has been around since the middle of the 19th century - the land was bought and planted in 1858 and the first vintage was made in 1864.</p><p>Its most famous wine is a contemporary Australian icon: Tyrrell's Vat 1 Semillon, an unoaked white wine that, as it ages, acquires a gently toasty flavour that mingles with the lemongrass, yellow citrus peel and beeswax scents of the wine.</p><p>It's not a common style, but if you drink it in the right setting or with the right food, it's delicious. I had my first taste of Tyrrell's Vat 1 with a plateful of fried soft shell crab in a restaurant close to Sydney Harbour, an experience I recommend. The best way to support Australian winemakers who have suffered vineyard, crop and in some cases building losses from the fires is to drink their wines.</p><p>Flying to Sydney for the soft shell crab and Vat 1 experience may prove a step too far, but there are plenty of wines available here.

At least half a billion animals are estimated to have died since Australia's bushfire season began in September  Credits SAEED KHAN/AFP via Getty Images  Scott Morrison finally acknowledges link with global warming Reaction[1] James Ashford[2] Monday, January 6, 2020 - 2:38pm Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has admitted that climate change 'impacts' Australia, in a major reversal of his previous stance on the role of global warming in hiscountry's ongoing bushfire crisis. See related Instant Opinion: Australia is 'committing climate suicide'[3] Why Australia's government is unmoved on climate change[4] Australia endures hottest day on record with more to come[5] More than 12 million acres have been destroyed and half a billion animals killed in bushfires that have raged across New South Wales,Victoriaand South Australiasince September.Around 150 fires remain active in New South Wales alone, of which 64 are uncontrolled, reports Metro[6]. Morrison had previously been reluctant to link [7]climate change[8]to the blazes, insisting only last monththat 'many other factors' were responsible. </p><p>'There is no argument... about the links between broader issues of global climate change and weather events around the world,' he said. 'But I'm sure people equally would acknowledge that the direct connection to any single fire event - it's not a credible suggestion to make that link.' However, following widespread criticism and calls for his resignation, Morrison has told reporters that he needs 'to correct the record'. 'There is no dispute in this country about the issue of climate change globally and its effect on global weather patterns and that includes how it impacts in Australia,'he said at a news conference on Sunday. 'I have to correct the record here. I have seen a number of people suggest that somehow the government does not make this connection. The government has always made this connection and that has never been in dispute.' The Australian leader subsequently announced that an initial $2bn (1.5bn) in funding had been set asideto support the rebuilding of community infrastructure and to help affected farmers and businesses, with more cash injections to follow, The Guardian[9]reports. The spending, to be overseenby the newly established National Bushfire Recovery Agency, is expected to reach levels similar to the $5.6bn (2.9bn) paid out in disaster recovery assistance in the aftermath of Cyclone Yasi and the Brisbane floods back in 2011.
