That's three former club skippers right there taking their leave parading the Premiership trophy in front of 82,000 fans. </p><p>Such celestial synchronicity is rare. The great Sergio Parisse's final Italy game was meant to be the pool match with New Zealand in 2019 before Typhoon Hagibis intervened while George North dreamt of concluding his 121-match Test career for Wales with a win over Italy at the Principality in March. Instead, Wales slipped to defeat and he ruptured his Achilles in the final moments.</p><p>Owen Farrell and the Vunipola brothers fully intended to bring down the curtain on their remarkable Saracens careersers with a final Twickenham appearance of their own yesterday, but Northampton had different ideas and whipped the rug from under their feetet in that epic semi-final the other week. </p><p>That's the cruel beauty of sport and for long periods yesterday it seemedemed Lady Luck might be at her most capricious. Northampton dodged a bullet against a pumped-up Bath who did superbly well to adapt and adjust after the early sending off of Beno Obano.</p><p>We have seen enough fine performances and wins by teams reduced to 14 by an early dismissal to know that there is always hope in such situations, but in a huge showpiece final against such a free-running team as Saints who can cut you in pieces on their day, it was a mighty effort, and our illustrious trio will acknowledge that. </p><p>They will also highlight, though, the growing maturity of their younger colleagues which did eventually see Saints pull through and suggest that their departures are in fact very well timed. Northampton are in very good hands, the future as well the present is bright. </p><p>All three rolled their sleeves up as usual but it was a tricky afternoon. Although good at the lineout and busy at the breakdown, Lawes did not produce one of his stellar bone-crushing, try-saving performances. Waller endured a tough afternoon at scrum time but typically kept going manfully and Ludlam offered timely heft and experience off the bench but on a testing afternoon it was others who stepped up</p><p>George Furbank has been nigh on immaculate all season and continued in that vein against Bath. To these eyes he is the key figure going forward for Saints, the rallying point and fulcrum. Yesterday, he made a brilliant try for Tommy Freeman and slipped effortlessly into the fly-half slot when Fin Smith was forced off at a moment when Saints were struggling. He keeps smiling and always looks calm and these things count in a team like Northampton who are prepared to live on the edge. </p><p>Freeman is another. Unbelievably good in the air, big tackles when required and classy tries. Both are proper England players now and will have to juggle those dual responsibilities, but both are well up to the task. </p><p>Alex Mitchell also comes into that category as well. Mitchell experienced a testing, occasionally torrid, afternoon. Ben Spencer in particular and Bath in general had clearly targeted him and were determined to make life a living hell for the attack-minded scrum-half. </p><p>They definitely rattled Mitchell, who made a few poor choices and headlessly ran a tapped penalty that needed slotting over. But who was it running that clever cheat line to connect with George Hendy and who was it displaying dazzling footwork to finish off that vital try in the 74th minute? Cometh the hour, cometh the man and Mitchell rarely fails to step up when his team needs him. </p><p>And Hendy? We have seen glimpses of his exciting, unusual, awkward but devastating running style before this season. He is only 21 but Saints haven't hesitated to use him when required, he is an X factor player and there is no point holding him back. Already he has 14 tries in 22 Saints games and yesterday's glorious assist felt as good as a try. It certainly moved Austin Healey to nominate him as MOM and the recipient of the Peter Deakin medal which is the reward for that accolade in the final.</p><p>How do Saints replace this trio and indeed young lock Alex Moon who is also moving after signing for Bayonne? Is there any point trying for a like for like replacement or do you just trust the different talents you are already nurturing? I would suggest Saints are in pretty good shape. In the backrow you probably needn't look beyond No 8 Juarno Augustus, Tom Pearson at blindside and openside flanker Henry Pollock, the U20 Six Nations player of the tournament this year. The speedy Pollock could be sensational in such a free running team but if they want to gradually blood the young man the excellent and ever versatile Sam Graham can slot in wherever required</p><p>None of those permutations will give you the lineout presence of Lawes in the backrow although for the record I think Alex Coles - not dissimilar to Lawes physically - has more potential at blindside flanker than lock. With the departure of Moon, though, he will be required to soldier on in the boiler house for the foreseeable future. As for Waller's replacement, Emmanuel Iyogun is an immensely strong and focussed young prop who is learning very quickly. When he came on in the second half, briefly, he found himself at odds with referee Christophe Ridley as well as the Bath front row. Instead of losing the plot and possibly the game, he listened to Ridley's requirements, made a few changes and steadied the ship. The old heads in the Saints pack nodded their appreciation.

That's three former club skippers right there taking their leave parading the Premiership trophy in front of 82,000 fans. Such celestial synchronicity is rare. The great Sergio Parisse's final Italy game was meant to be the pool match with New Zealand in 2019 before Typhoon Hagibis intervened while George North dreamt of concluding his 121-match Test career for Wales with a win over Italy at the Principality in March. Instead, Wales slipped to defeat and he ruptured his Achilles in the final moments. Owen Farrell and the Vunipola brothers fully intended to bring down the curtain on their remarkable Saracens careersers with a final Twickenham appearance of their own yesterday, but Northampton had different ideas and whipped the rug from under their feetet in that epic semi-final the other week. That's the cruel beauty of sport and for long periods yesterday it seemedemed Lady Luck might be at her most capricious. Northampton dodged a bullet against a pumped-up Bath who did superbly well to adapt and adjust after the early sending off of Beno Obano.

The 44-times-capped Milne, in a light-hearted dig at the criticism of Dodson, said: 'I'll be so glad to go back to the good old days prior to when Mark Dodson took over. I remember fondly the joys of watching our national team perform with such panache in a full, vibrant Murrayfield.

The rot was setting in long before he arrived on the scene. His successor as chief executive will be appointed by the summer, as will a new performance director to replace Jim Mallinder.

I was present at his first press conference as chief executive in Auckland, New Zealand, after Scotland were dumped out of the 2011 World Cup. Even then, you could see he would take no prisoners.

The Japanese hosts were dumbfounded as the deadly storm wreaked havoc, killing more than 100 people. As it happened, the game did take place with Scotland losing to Japan and being dumped out of the World Cup at the group stages. Dodson's ill-advised comments left him embarrassed on the world stage, with Scottish Rugby being fined \u00a370,000 for his outburst.</p><p>Closer to home, the management culture under him was called into question after Keith Russell, father of Scotland international Finn, was dismissed as director of domestic rugby seven years ago. Keith Russell took Scottish Rugby to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal and won.</p><p>When it came to making coaching appointments, Dodson was pretty much spot-on every time.</p><p>This correspondent was sceptical when he appointed Franco Smith as Glasgow Warriors head coach, yet he has been a revelation.</p><p>Dodson also brought Vern Cotter, David</p><p>Rennie and Richard Cockerill ? who was the right man at the time for Edinburgh ? into Scottish rugby. He championed Gregor Townsend, fast-tracking him into Glasgow Warriors and then Scotland. Townsend's star may be on the wane after the international side failed to make the knock-out stages at the last two World Cups but he is likely to see out the remainder of his contract that ends in April 2026.</p><p>The only blot on the Dodson appointment copybook appears to be Mallinder, who was expected to revolutionise the age-grade system as performance director. I sat through a long presentation from Mallinder and Scotland Under-20 coach Kenny Murray at Murrayfield two years ago on their plans for the future, which has clearly been a failure. Not a single Scotland player has made the step up from the Scotland Under-20 team to the national side for four years. Also, on Murray's watch, the Scotland Under-20s failed to make it out of the second tier Junior World Trophy after they lost to lowly Uruguay.</p><p>Dodson did a lot of good work for the women's game after a very slow start and the fact they now have professional contracts is a big step in the right direction, although Scotland still have a long way to go to catch up with the elite nations such as England.</p><p>The outgoing Scottish Rugby chief executive said he doesn't care what people think of him and made clear his mantra was 'never complain and never explain'.

They created the gravy train. Dodson just bought a ticket and jumped on.</p><p>For context, Dodson couldn't have taken over as chief executive at a better time from his own point of view back in 2011 as Scottish Rugby was at their lowest ebb after the national side had failed to qualify out of their World Cup group for the first time.

Now, now, stop laughing at the back.</p><p>Of course that hasn't happened.

Well they did try and bring everybody together under the hashtag \"AsOne\" but their actions undermined their words.</p><p>In 2018, the SRU were deemed to have unfairly dismissed their director of domestic rugby, Keith Russell, father of Finn, who won a big payout after winning his unfair dismissal claim against the governing body. Russell described Scottish Rugby as \"toxic\" under Dodson.</p><p>There is no doubt that Dodson and Scottish Rugby could have dealt better with the tragic death of former Scotland women's international  Siobhan Cattigan.</p><p>When an apology to the family from the governing body was first made it came from Scottish Rugby Limited Chairman John McGuigan, not Dodson. It was too little, much too late.</p><p>Dodson said on that first day in Auckland he shot from the hip but he was guilty of putting his foot in his mouth on too many occasions.</p><p>I was in the room in Yokohama cringing when he demanded that the 2019 World Cup game against Japan go ahead at some stage despite organisers being unable to give guarantees that it would due to Typhoon Hagibis which had killed more than 100 people and caused havoc in the country. </p><p>He was worried that if the game didn't go ahead and recorded as a 0-0 draw, Scotland would be dumped out of the tournament at the group stages. He needn't have worried. World Cup organisers did a great job making the stadium in Yokohama safe so the game did go ahead.

Pieter-Jan van Lill, the greying flecks in his long beard only partially obscured by the strapping of his scrum cap, renewed his quadrennial struggle to end the longest losing sequence in the tournament. Before he could make his presence felt, another Namibian cause had been hopelessly lost. </p><p>The substitute lock had endured so many from three previous World Cups that when he arrived at the front, bitter experience would have convinced him that there wasn't anything to be gained from looking at a scoreboard which told a familiar story: New Zealand 43, Namibia 3. Van Lill set forth in the 50th minute and in next to no time the All Blacks had greeted him by completing their half century with an eighth try. Three more followed which meant the outsiders had now shipped nine or more tries on a dozen occasions at the last seven World Cups. </p><p>The Welwitschias, so-called after a plant known as 'the onion of the desert,' are nothing if not consistent: Played 24, lost 24. The official World Cup record credits them a 0-0 draw, ironically for a match they never played, a fixture against Canada in Japan blown away by Typhoon Hagibis four years ago. </p><p>And yet there was still something heroic to admire on van Lill's splendid defiance of old age and impossible odds. It wasn't just that he will be 40 before the end of the year but that he plays for a club so far off the beaten track as to be largely unheard of. </p><p>Capbreton Hossegor on the Atlantic Coast is immersed so far beneath the French Top 14 that van Lill could almost have been cast as the harpooner straight out of Jules Verne's classic novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea. </p><p>He had earned the right to be there on merit, reward for ensuring Namibia's qualification with decisive wins over Kenya, Zimbabe and Burkina Faso. When they finished their warm-ups against the Bulls in Pretoria late last month, they did so under van Lill's captaincy. </p><p>For a few rousing minutes on Friday, Namibia and their ancient warrior raised the fleeting possibility of leaving All Black whale beached in their in-goal area. The spectre of a try that would have brought the house down may have vanished like a mirage but Namibia had won new admirers for their gallantry in the face of brutal odds.</p><p>As if conceding two tries in six minutes to the livewire novice scrum-half Cam Roigard wasn't punishing enough, they suffered the cruel loss of centre Le Roux Malan with an injury nasty enough to prolong the first half by the best part of ten minutes. </p><p>They could have done without being asked for the umpteenth time to display their capacity for absorbing beatings as well as their unfailing readiness to keep coming back for more. </p><p>No historical burden has ever seemed too great to bear for van Lill, the veterans' veteran giving the World Cup a final fling despite his club's status some eight divisions down from where he used to be in the Top 14 with Bayonne. </p><p>Now under the direction of former Springbok coach Alister Coetzee, aided by ex-England and Scotland forwards' coach Matthew Proudfoot, they will lick their wounds and believe that the elusive victory may be lurking round the next corner, in their last pool match against Uruguay in Lyon on September 27. </p><p>They were never closer to it than on an autumn night in Exeter eight years ago. There at Sandy Park, under the coaching of former Wales lock Phil Davies, they lost to Georgia by the narrowest possible margin, 16-17. </p><p>\"Some of the boys were in tears,\" says Davies. \"We ordered beers for the entire squad and kept telling them they had made history because they'd won their country their first bonus point. We tried as hard as we could to make a positive out of that.''</p><p>Under Davies, Namibia made significant strides towards becoming competitive. Where they had all too often been torpedoed by defeats which plumbed the depths at 0-142 against the Wallabies in Adelaide 20 years ago, van Lill &amp; co. succeeded in slashing the deficit. </p><p>\"He's a wonderful guy, PJ,\" says Davies. \"Always reliable, especially when the chips are down. Always ready to give a seven-or-eight out of ten performance. He never changes.\" </p><p>Neither will the results in the immediate future, not with France next up in Marseille on Thursday evening.

It was on the first Monday in October in a conference suite in a Hilton Hotel in Auckland, New Zealand during the 2011 Rugby World Cup.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He talked a good game. He seemed like a breath of fresh air. \"I call it as I see it,\" he said. \"I'm not an Edinburgh man, I'm not a Glasgow man. I walked through the door and I am here to do the very best for Scottish rugby and I have a plan to deliver it in short order.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He may have had a short-term plan but he stayed in the top job for almost 13 years and I have covered all the highs and lows of his time in charge.</p><p>Over the years I have had my fair share of run-ins with him - a heated face-to-face argument outside a village church on the outskirts of Nelspruit when I questioned the morale of the 2013 Scotland squad who toured South Africa was a particular highlight.</p><p>As he comes off the SRU payroll - in the 2018/2019 financial year he earned a massive \u00a3933,000 through a mix of his basic wage and bonuses - it is the perfect moment to compare his dreams for Scottish Rugby to the reality he leaves behind.</p><p>But before we do, let's look at that ridiculous salary of \u00a3933,000 that got so many of us hot under the collar. It was far too much to pay him but Dodson didn't set that figure himself. There are checks and balances within Scottish Rugby to monitor executive pay.</p><p>Shame on those within the Murrayfield corridors of power who agreed such an incentive scheme. They created the gravy train. Dodson just bought a ticket and jumped on.</p><p>For context, Dodson couldn't have taken over as chief executive at a better time from his own point of view back in 2011 as Scottish Rugby was at their lowest ebb after the national side had failed to qualify out of their World Cup group for the first time. The only way was up from that.</p><p>As I walked down the corridor in the Hilton Hotel around 10am that Monday to meet Dodson for the first time, going the other way and heading for the team bus to take them to the airport for the flight home was the disconsolate Scotland head coach Andy Robinson and senior players such as Chris Paterson, Sean Lamont, Mike Blair and Al Kellock.</p><p>It was a sad sight but such was the shortage of top hotels in Auckland that Scotland had to be out of theirs by noon to make way for a different side who made the knock-out stages to check-in.</p><p>Before he was also hurried out Dodson talked in general terms about the finances of Scottish Rugby - the governing body had bank borrowings of \u00a314.4 million when he took over and the debt stands at \u00a310.01m now - and how his aim was to make the two professional teams, Edinburgh and Glasgow Warriors, more competitive.</p><p>In truth that wouldn't be that hard because they had been dreadful for years.</p><p>He set out five priorities that day in Auckland, so let's see if he has delivered on those promises all these years later.</p><p>A \"user-friendly\" SRU</p><p>First up he wanted to improve the relationship with supporters and make the governing body more \"user friendly\". Now, now, stop laughing at the back.</p><p>Of course that hasn't happened. There is more of a disconnect now between grassroots rugby and the pro ranks than ever before.</p><p>There is resentment at foreign players with not much of a track record - Mosese Tuipulotu who has signed for Edinburgh from the Waratahs in Australia a case in point - being fast-tracked into the pro ranks ahead of Scottish players coming through the ranks.</p><p>As for making the governing body more \"user friendly\"? Well they did try and bring everybody together under the hashtag \"AsOne\" but their actions undermined their words.</p><p>In 2018, the SRU were deemed to have unfairly dismissed their director of domestic rugby, Keith Russell, father of Finn, who won a big payout after winning his unfair dismissal claim against the governing body. Russell described Scottish Rugby as \"toxic\" under Dodson.</p><p>There is no doubt that Dodson and Scottish Rugby could have dealt better with the tragic death of former Scotland women's international  Siobhan Cattigan.</p><p>When an apology to the family from the governing body was first made it came from Scottish Rugby Limited Chairman John McGuigan, not Dodson.

Not even a smaller earthquake in 2016 - the Kumamoto - could dissuade them and the tournament took place as planned in the autumn of 2019. </p><p>Well nearly. Autumn is the typhoon season in Japan, an event so commonplace that the Japanese themselves scarcely notice them. There were nine in total in the South China seas during the 2019 typhoon season and it was the third biggest typhoon -Hagibis - that caused the most destruction and disruption because of where it made landfall on mainland Japan. There were 121 fatalities and, after the typhoon blew through, widespread flooding was the biggest problem and the factor which affected the World Cup. </p><p>Three games had to be cancelled, the final two games in Pool B where Italy had been due to play New Zealand and Canada meet Namibia. Both matches were declared draws which happily did not affect the pool standings in any substantial way. Then in Pool C the much-anticipated clash between England and France had to be called off, which did have a knock on effect. England were leading the pool but a France win would have seen Les Bleus climb above them and alter the quarter-finals match ups. </p><p>It was all a massive shame for the Japanese organisers but as a nation they are used to natural disasters and they coped incredibly well to ensure the tournament, which had already won the hearts of many, scarcely missed a beat. </p><h>2019 That was the year that was...</h><p>\u00b7 l England won their first Cricket World Cup title, beating New Zealand at Lord's </p><p>\u00b7 Ben Stokes masterminded a remarkable one-wicket victory for England over Australia at Headingley </p><p>\u00b7 Dina Asher-Smith won the women's 200m title at the World Athletics Championships </p><p>\u00b7 Egan Bernal won the Tour de France and Richard Carapaz the Giro D'Italia </p><p>\u00b7 Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer in five sets in just under five hours to win the Men's Singles title at Wimbledon </p><p>\u00b7 Shane Lowry won The Open at Portrush </p><p>\u00b7  Notre Dame Cathedral was badly damaged by fire </p><p>\u00b7  Greggs launched a meat free sausage roll </p><p>\u00b7 5G coverage rolled out in six cities - London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Belfast, Manchester and Birmingham </p><p>\u00b7\u00a0The Duke of Edinburgh, driving his Range Rover at the age of 97, was badly shaken up after an accident when driving close to the Sandringham Estate</p><p>And, until the quarter-finals, it was Japan themselves with\u00a0their exhilarating high tempo, quick passing, offloading game that had been the main story with their brilliant pool wins over Ireland and Scotland. Indeed, the Japanese topped their pool with four straight wins and if you factor in their three wins in four games at RWC2015 and draw against Canada in their final game of RWC2011 concluded a run of seven wins and a draw in their last nine World Cup games, one of the more impressive streaks among teams that have never won the tournament.</p><p>The fairytale ended with a 26-3 quarter-final defeat against eventual winners South Africa but there was no disgrace there either as they held on bravely for long periods before succumbing to the vastly superior power and heft up front of the Boks pack. </p><p>Elsewhere it was England, Wales and Boks who provided the main storylines. England had \"only\" managed three wins in the 2019 Six Nations when they finished second behind Grand Slam champions Wales but, under Eddie Jones, they got a second wind that year and started to kick on impressively with much of the energy and dynamic being provided by the partnering of two natural opensides in Tom Curry and Sam Underhill in the back row as flankers, the so-called 'Kamikaze kids'. </p><p>England breezed through the pool stages with trouble free wins over Tonga and USA and an impressive 39-10 trouncing of the Pumas. The only disappointment was their cancelled game against France which among other things denied the pack and in particular the front row a serious work out ahead of the knockout stages, something which some critics fretted about, rightly as it proved. </p><p>Although not massively tested up front against the Wallabies, England romped to a 40-16 quarter-final win over the Australians and produced a supercharged performance for the ages against the All Blacks in the semi-final, wining much more comfortably than the 19-7 scoreline suggests. </p><p>Impressive stuff but England couldn't go to the well again seven days later when South Africa, flexing their muscles and employing their bomb squad off the bench to great effect, did a number on England up front and ran out commanding 32-12 winners. It was an ill-starred day for England who, stuck in traffic, arrived late at the ground and had to rush their warm up. The all-round excellence and precision in all things of seven days earlier had completely vanished. </p><p>The Boks under Siya Kolisi had been a slow burn as they lost to New Zealand in their opening game before \"dealing\" with Italy, Namibia and Canada in comprehensive if unspectacular style. Then came a thoroughly competent but hardly startling quarter-final win over Japan before they scraped home in a scrappy semi-final against Wales 19-16. </p><p>Wales, as was always the case under Warren Gatland, turned up at the World Cup in great shape physically and had emerged from their pool with a 100 per cent record before they hung tough against France in a quarter-final that, at times, they seemed likely to lose before Les Bleus imploded with the sending off of Sebastien Vahaamahina. Wales seized the initiative and can be proud of their 20-19 win. </p><p>The form book seemed to point to England but the Boks had timed their effort brilliantly and are in any case always different in a World Cup final when their competitive might takes over. In their previous two finals the Boks, as well as winning, didn't cough up a single try and that trend continued against England. With their defence rock solid and England off the boil, South Africa established the platform to open up in the final quarter to record a glorious win. </p>", "publisher": "The Rugby Paper", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 20, "title": "Japan expect World Cup exit to spur Scots", "published": "2021-11-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">JAMIE JOSEPH admits that Japan's World Cup victory over Scotland in 2019 remains a special memory.

The damaging effects manifest most notably in secondary perils, as evident in each of the last three years. In 2019 specifically, the rainfall-induced floods that came with Typhoon Hagibis, the storm surge driven flooding from Cyclone Idai in Mozambique, and monsoon rains in southeast Asia and from other weather systems wreaked economic and humanitarian havoc. Record-high temperatures in eastern Australia kept wildfires burning across millions of hectares of bushland in the longest-running wildfires the country has ever seen. Weather risks remain insurableAll told, Swiss Re Institute believes that weather risks, with adaptation actions, remain insurable. Insurers need to adapt to a dynamic risk landscape by closely monitoring and incorporating socio-economic developments, the latest scientific research on climate change effects, and the status of local risk mitigation measures in their modelling. Many of today's catastrophe models are benchmarked against historical loss data, which does not reflect the current level of urbanisation, and hence do not fully account for today's quickly rising exposures, changing socio-economic environment and climate. To uphold the insurance risk transfer model as a powerful tool to foster resilience, insurers need to adapt before, not post events,' Martin Bertogg, Head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re said.", "Insurers need to adapt to a dynamic risk landscape by closely monitoring and incorporating socio-economic developments, the latest scientific research on climate change effects, and the status of local risk mitigation measures in their modelling.

This culminated on June\u00a030 when the river rose dramatically, sweeping away one of the Asa\u00a0bridges between Shirogahama and Minami-Omine.</p><p>JR West was forced to close the line, having discovered 18 embankment washouts, 43 landslides and nine bridges where the track had been deformed. Electrical equipment had also been damaged at numerous locations.</p><p>The damage brought back memories of similar events in July 2010 when the Asa River had also broken its banks. On that occasion\u00a0JR West had asked the government to develop a plan to mitigate the effects of flooding.</p><p>JR West has yet to reveal a timescale or cost for rebuilding the railway, but it is expected to run into billions of yen with repairs likely to take years, not months.</p><p>The route is losing traffic and money. Over the three years to fiscal year 2021 it incurred an average annual deficit of \u00a5460m, with average daily ridership falling to just 366.\u00a0 JR West has therefore asked local municipalities to consider how to support the line should it be restored.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yonesaka Line rebuild</emphasis></p><p>On September\u00a08 the first meeting of the Yonesaka Line Restoration Review Conference took place to consider options for the future of JR East's single-track Yonesaka Line. Badly damaged by floods at 112 locations in August 2022, the line runs east for 90\u22197\u00a0km from Yonezawa on the Ou Main Line and Yamagata Shinkansen through a mountainous area to Sakamachi on the Uetsu Main Line, close to the Sea of Japan coast. The damage had forced suspension of services over the 67\u22197\u00a0km between Imasizumi and Sakamachi.</p><p>JR East estimated that repairs would cost around \u00a58\u22196bn and take five years to complete. About \u00a55\u22195bn would be needed for work within Yamagata Prefecture, with no less than \u00a51\u22196bn of this required to rebuild a bridge over the Koshira River. A further \u00a53\u22191bn would need to be spent in Niigata Prefecture.</p><p>JR East was concerned about the high cost and had been contemplating bus replacement. Local authorities, however, were keen to see the railway revived, prompting JR East to set up the Restoration Review Conference.</p><p>The event was attended by representatives from Yamagata and Niigata Prefectures, and seven local authorities served by the railway, together with a representative from\u00a0the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport &amp; Tourism and JR East officials.</p><p>Agreement was reached to try and rebuild the line by taking advantage of the Disaster Restoration Subsidy scheme, with costs shared by the parties involved. Under this proposal local and prefectural authorities would split the cost with JR.</p><p>The scheme requires a business plan to be drawn up for at least the next 10 years, so guaranteeing the railway's survival over this period. A template existed in the recent restoration of the Tadami Line, where JR East rebuilt both infrastructure and stations and then handed them to Fukushima Prefecture without charge. The prefecture then outsourced maintenance to JR East at an annual cost of \u00a5200m, of which the prefecture pays 70% and local authorities the rest.</p><p>As with other rural routes in Japan, the Yonesaka Line is a victim of depopulation, new road construction and rising car ownership. Whereas in 1987 the section between Imaizumi and Oguni was used by 833 passengers a day, by 2018 the figure had fallen to just 274. Similarly, daily traffic between Oguni and Sakamachi over the same period tumbled from 846 to 180 passengers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Uncertain future</emphasis></p><p>Back in August 2022 JR East's Tsugaru Line from Aomori to Minmaya at the northern tip of Honshu was severely damaged by floods in the remote forested area north of Kanita, forcing suspension of train services between there and Minmaya. Low ridership on this stretch prompted JR East to decide not to repair it until local authority views about its survival had been assessed.</p><p>This section of the line runs through an area that includes the municipalities of Sotogahama and Imabetsu. Most of the district is sparsely populated, except along the coast, the interior consisting of densely forested uplands.</p><p>Imabetsu municipality originally wanted to reopen the entire line, but during summer 2023 it suggested that repairs might be undertaken only along the remote stretch between Kanita, the freight-only junction with the Hokkaido Shinkansen at Odai, and Okutsugaru-Imabetsu, a halt adjacent to the Shinkansen station. Note that the Shinkansen here is dual-gauge to allow JR freight and local passenger trains to pass through the Seikan tunnel. From Okutsugaru-Imabetsu to Minmaya, the railway follows a road along the coast, meaning that bus services could be provided as an alternative.</p><p>The municipality's main argument is that the road between Kanita and Imabetsu crosses the Imabetsu pass, while the railway runs in tunnel below. Snowfall is particularly heavy here, and the road is often blocked in winter.</p><p>'Devastation was\u00a0reported at 317 locations\u00a0on the Sanriku Tetsudo\u00a0(Santetsu) following the\u00a0Great East Japan Earthquake\u00a0and tsunami in March 2011'</p><p>Although the proposal is logical, it seems unlikely to succeed. Sotogahama municipality has offered no support for reopening, and 12 of the 13 damaged locations lie in the 22\u00a0km section between Odai and Okutsugaru-Imabetsu, partly within Imabetsu municipality.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: Alexander Tidd / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>Shimanokoshi station was located on a low viaduct; it was swept away by the waves.</p><p>JR East estimated the cost of repairing the whole line at \u00a5600m, so reopening only to Okutsugaru-Imabetsu would\u00a0not save a great deal. Not only that, but potential traffic from the four stations over the 9\u22194\u00a0km between there and Minmaya would be lost to bus operators.</p><p>Alternatives to complete closure are being explored, but the low population means that it would be hard to fund any work from local taxes. One option would be to establish a freight-only connection with the Hokkaido Shinkansen at Okutsugaru-Imabetsu, instead of at Odai. Locating the connection here would mean electrifying this steeply graded stretch, which includes several tunnels where expensive clearance enhancement may be needed.</p><p>Another suggestion is to extend Tsugaru Line passenger services over the existing dual-gauge track from\u00a0Odai to the Shinkansen station at Okutsugaru-Imabetsu. This would involve constructing a new track and platform at Okutsugaru-Imabetsu but would cost less than electrifying the local line. It would also require 1\u00a0067\u00a0mm gauge stock able to accept the Shinkansen's 25\u00a0kV 50\u00a0Hz power supply as well as an arrangement under which JR\u00a0East's costs for running the local trains would not be borne by JR Hokkaido, owner of the Hokkaido Shinkansen.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: ChiefHira / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>The region served by the Sanriku Tetsudo was severely damaged by the 2011 tsunami and earthquake.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Support in Kanazawa</emphasis></p><p>Local mayors in the municipalities served by the Ishikawa Line of the privately run Ishikawa Hokuriku Railway in Kanazawa Prefecture met on August\u00a030 to debate the railway's future after a long period of declining traffic. Along with Prefectural Governor Hiroshi Hase, who was attending as an observer, the mayors represented Kanazawa, Nonoichi, Hakusan and Uchinada.</p><p>Daily traffic had declined from a peak of 2\u00a0569 passengers in 1991 to 1\u00a0877 in 2019 with a further drop to 1\u00a0314 in 2020 because of the Covid\u00a019 pandemic.</p><p>Options for the route, which is electrified at 600\u00a0V DC, had been put forward in March 2023 in a regional public transport plan drawn up by the Ishikawa Central Metropolitan Area Regional Public Transport Council, formed of local municipalities.</p><p>After rejecting a proposal to convert the line into a busway as there were too few bus drivers, the mayors confirmed their support for the railway and suggested ideas for its development. One proposal, which would require dual-voltage trains, was construction of a chord to provide a connection to the Hokuriku Main Line, enabling operation of through services to Kanazawa. Construction of a 1\u22195\u00a0km extension northwards from Nomachi to Korinbo was also considered as a long-term objective.</p><p>The Ishikawa Line runs for 13\u22198\u00a0km from Nomachi to Shin-Nishi-Kanazawa and Tsurugi, serving the southern suburbs of Kanazawa and traversing semi-rural or low-density residential areas. There is interchange at Shin-Nishi-Kanazawa with the Hokuriku Main Line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Santetsu survives</emphasis></p><p>The Sanriku Tetsudo (Santetsu) represents a remarkable survival story. Located in Iwate Prefecture, the route, which was only completed in 1984, runs along the coast from Sendai to Hachinohe in northern Honshu, serving the towns of Kesennuma, Sakari, Kamaishi, Miyako and Kuji. Santetsu was founded as a third sector company in 1981 with Iwate Prefecture as its majority shareholder to operate the Sakari to Kamaishi and Miyako to Kuji sections of the route.</p><p>On March\u00a011 2011 coastal settlements in northern Miyagi and Iwate Prefectures were devastated by the Great Tohoku Earthquake and tsunami. With a moment magnitude of 9\u22191\u00a0Mw, it was the most powerful ever recorded in Japan, causing 19\u00a0759 deaths and 6\u00a0242 injuries, with 2\u00a0553 people declared missing.</p><p>On the two sections of the Santetsu, devastation was reported at 317 locations. On the JR\u00a0East section between Kamaishi and Miyako there was also severe damage - seven of\u00a0the 13 stations, six bridges and 10 embankments were destroyed and about 8\u22195\u00a0km of route had been obliterated.</p><p>&lt;!-- An error occurred in parsing html (ParseInlineImages) --&gt;</p><p/><p>Photo: Kenkenken667 / Wikimedia Commons</p><p>A Sanriku Tetsudo Series 36-700 DMU at Sakari in July 2014. Sakari station isserved by JR East's BRT service to and from Kesennuma, which uses part of the trackbed of the Ofunato Line, which was heavily damaged by the tsunami in March 2011.</p><p>Santetsu set about repairing the damage, reopening the line in stages. Infrastructure repairs were completed in 2014, and three new diesel railcars were acquired in January that year using finance from Kuwait.</p><p>In 2012 only 400\u00a0000 passengers travelled on the usable sections of line, but in the financial year to March\u00a031 2015 there was a 38% increase over the previous year with 690\u00a0000 passengers carried. Fare receipts were higher than in the financial year ending March\u00a031 2011.</p><p>Perhaps the increase was partly explained by publicity that accrued from a soap opera aired by Japan Broadcasting Corp every morning between April and September 2013. The story covered the period from 2008 to 2012, which included the earthquake, which the producers duly incorporated into the storyline. Much of the filming was carried out in the scenic area served by the railway, which featured prominently throughout. The broadcast gave impetus to local residents to encourage tourism - and use of their railway.</p><p>On the 55\u00a0km central section of the route, which forms part of JR East's Yamada Line from Morioka to Kamaishi, four of the 13 stations had been destroyed, together with 5\u22195\u00a0km of the track, six bridges and 10 embankments. On June\u00a025 2012 JR East arranged a meeting with local authorities to discuss the line's future.</p><p>On January\u00a031 2014 JR\u00a0East decided to spend \u00a514bn on rebuilding the closed stretch of coastal line, with the municipalities covering the remaining \u00a57bn. Operations would then be transferred, free of charge, to Santetsu, which would be able to run through services between Sakari and Kuji.</p><p>Work started on March\u00a07 2015 and was completed on July\u00a018 2018. The\u00a0first test run was made on August\u00a021 between Kamaishi and Otsuchi using\u00a0a 65\u00a0tonne diesel shunter, and test running over the whole line began in the early autumn ahead of a festive reopening on March 19-23 2019. On August 26 2019 Santetsu carried its 50millionth passenger since April 1984.</p><p>Then disaster struck again. In mid-October 2019 Typhoon Hagibis brought torrential rain to the Sanriku coast and mountains. Rivers flooded and embankments were swept away.

Around 4\u00a0700 buildings were destroyed and at least 66 people died. Storms struck again in late June and early July 2023, though with fewer fatalities.</p><p>Kyushu has many loss-making\u00a0rural lines, some of which have been damaged by extreme weather. In some cases traffic has been suspended indefinitely while the operators seek means of financing repairs or other options.</p><p>In the Kuma valley, JR Kyushu's Hisatsu Line, between Yatsushiro and Hitoyoshi, remains closed following the 2020 floods, which swept away two river bridges. Discussions with local authorities continue over rebuilding, with substitute bus and taxi services provided on parallel roads up the valley. A similar situation prevails on the 24\u22198km third sector Kumagawa Tetsudo, from Hitoyoshi-Onsen to Yunomae, where a river bridge was destroyed.</p><p>Although the situation in Kyushu is bleak, there is one example in the west of the island where a badly damaged line has reopened. The Minami Aso Takamori Line (Mantetsu) was built to connect Tateno on the Hohi Main Line with Takamori, a distance of 17\u22197\u00a0km. On April 1 1986 JNR transferred its operation to the third sector Minami Aso Tetsudo.</p><p>During the April 2016 Kumamoto earthquake the line was severely damaged, particularly on the\u00a010\u22196\u00a0km section between Tateno and Nakamatsu where two bridges and\u00a0two tunnels were affected. While services over the remainder of the line were restored in late July 2016, repairs here only began in 2022. They were completed in time for full reopening on July\u00a015 2023.</p><p>Repair and upgrading work cost around \u00a56\u22197bn, with 97\u22195% of the cost met by the central government under a programme for railway restoration following natural disasters. The remainder came from Kumamoto prefectural government and Minami-Aso municipal council.</p><p>In November 2022 two new Series MT4000 diesel railcars were acquired from Niigata Transys. They are equipped with ATS-DK automatic ATP, enabling services to be extended from Tateno to Higo-Otsu on the Hohi Main Line. This is expected to drive up traffic, in particular leisure travel.</p><p>The railcars have step-free access and are fitted with multiple language passenger information systems with a view to encouraging foreign visitors to travel over the railway, which passes through spectacular scenery.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.railwaygazette.com/digital-magazines/railway-gazette-international-2023-digital-archive/63453.article\"/> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "publisher": "Railway Gazette International", "instances": ["Operations would then be transferred, free of charge, to Santetsu, which would be able to run through services between Sakari and Kuji.

The costliest individual peril was inland flooding, which caused economic losses globally of USD82 billion; preceded by tropical cyclone, at USD68 billion.<br/><br/>From a climate perspective, 2019 was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures since 1851. Notably, record temperatures of 46.0-degreeC were seen in France and 42.6-degreeC in Germany, while the January to May period was the wettest on record in the United States, with 15.71 inches (399 millimeters) of rainfall.<br/><br/>Andy Marcell, CEO of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, commented: 'Following two costly back-to-back years for natural disasters in 2017 and 2018, there were several moderately large catastrophes but strong capitalization has allowed the re/insurance industry to comfortably manage recent losses. However, as socioeconomic patterns further combine with scientific factors such as climate change or extreme weather variability, the potential financial costs at play are only going to increase so building resilience is key.'<br/><br/>2010-2019 marked the costliest decade on record with economic damage reaching USD2.98 trillion - some USD1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 and with Asia-Pacific accounting for 44 percent. Private and public insurance entities paid out USD845 billion during the decade with the U.S. accounting for 55 percent alone.<br/><br/>Steve Bowen, Director and Meteorologist at Aon's Impact Forecasting team, commented: 'Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils - such as wildfire, flood, and drought - becoming much more costly and impactful. Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas. As the public and private sectors balance an understanding of the science with smart business solutions, this will lead to new advances that lower the physical risk and improve overall awareness.'<br/><br/>Other significant regional events during the year included:<br/><br/>Wettest 12-month stretch in the contiguous U.S. on record dating to 1895 with river flooding across the Mississippi River watershed causing more than USD20 billion in economic losses<br/><br/>Category 5 Hurricane Dorian made multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a 185 mph (295 kph) storm; tying with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane as the strongest landfalling storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean<br/><br/>Cyclone Idai in Mozambique caused the most substantial humanitarian crisis killing 1,303 people and destroying more than 300,000 homes with USD2 billion economic losses.<br/><br/>Windstorm Eberhard was the lone event in Europe to surpass USD1 billion in insured losses after tracking across Western and Central Europe in March.<br/><br/>Globe's deadliest earthquake occurred in Albania on November 26, killing 52 people<br/><br/>Monsoon rains led to a combined USD25 billion in flood-related damage in China (USD15 billion) and India (USD10 billion) alone<br/><br/>Intense multi-year drought and record-setting spring and summer heat led to conditions able to ignite destructive bushfires in Australia. Some 18.2 million hectares (46 million acres) burned and more than 2,500 homes were destroyed, likely to result in insured losses topping USD1 billion.<br/><br/>Top 10 Global Economic Loss Events<br/><br/>View News Release Full Screen<br/><br/>Date(s)<br/><br/>Event<br/><br/>Location<br/><br/>Deaths<br/><br/>Economic Loss<br/><br/>(USD billions)<br/><br/>Insured Loss<br/><br/>(USD billions)<br/><br/>October 6-12<br/><br/>Typhoon Hagibis<br/><br/>Japan<br/><br/>99<br/><br/>15.0<br/><br/>9.0<br/><br/>June - August<br/><br/>Monsoon Floods<br/><br/>China<br/><br/>300<br/><br/>15.0<br/><br/>0.7<br/><br/>September 7-9<br/><br/>Typhoon Faxai<br/><br/>Japan<br/><br/>3<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>6.0<br/><br/>May - July<br/><br/>Mississippi River Basin Floods<br/><br/>United States<br/><br/>0<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>4.0<br/><br/>Aug 25 - Sep 7<br/><br/>Hurricane Dorian<br/><br/>Bahamas, Caribbean, US, Canada<br/><br/>83<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>3.5<br/><br/>March 12-31<br/><br/>Missouri River Basin Floods<br/><br/>United States<br/><br/>10<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>2.5<br/><br/>June - October<br/><br/>Monsoon Floods<br/><br/>India<br/><br/>1,750<br/><br/>10.0<br/><br/>0.2<br/><br/>August 6-13<br/><br/>Typhoon Lekima<br/><br/>China, Philippines, Japan<br/><br/>101<br/><br/>9.5<br/><br/>0.8<br/><br/>March - April<br/><br/>Flooding<br/><br/>Iran<br/><br/>77<br/><br/>8.3<br/><br/>0.2<br/><br/>May 2-5<br/><br/>Cyclone Fani<br/><br/>India, Bangladesh<br/><br/>81<br/><br/>8.1<br/><br/>0.5<br/><br/>ALL OTHER EVENTS<br/><br/>126 billion<br/><br/>44 billion<br/><br/>TOTALS<br/><br/>232 billion1<br/><br/>71 billion1,2<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>Subject to change as loss estimates are further developed<br/><br/>2<br/><br/>Includes losses sustained by private insurers and government-sponsored programs<br/><br/>Access the full report plus watch meteorologist and report author Steve Bowen's short film about the key findings on the interactive microsite: <url normalizedValue=\"https://aon.io/2FOWzrp\">https://aon.io/2FOWzrp</url><br/><br/>Access current and historical natural catastrophe data, plus event analysis, on Impact Forecasting's Catastrophe Insight website<br/><br/>About Aon<br/><br/>Aon plc (NYSE:AON) is a leading global professional services firm providing a broad range of risk, retirement and health solutions.

This evaluates the impact of global natural disaster events to identify trends, manage volatility and enhance resilience. The report reveals that the 409 natural catastrophe events of 2019 resulted in economic losses of USD232 billion - 3 percent below average annual losses for this century, but 20 percent lower than the previous decade. Of that total, private sector and government-sponsored insurance programs covered USD71 billion of the total - six percent above the century average but significantly lower than the record USD157 billion in 2017 and USD100 billion in 2018. This means the protection gap, which is the portion of economic losses not covered by insurance, was 69 percent in 2019 - the fifth-lowest since 2000.

The combined ratio (discounted and undiscounted) is the ratio, in per cent, of the sum of net insurance expense plus all other operating expenses to net insurance revenue.Alex Maloney, Group Chief Executive Officer, commented:\u201cLancashire delivered an outstanding performance in 2023. We continued to focus on writing profitable business in the best market conditions we have seen for a decade.Aligned to our belief in managing the market cycle, we have built a better balanced and more diverse underwriting portfolio over the past five years, which is generating more profit against our capital base. This has been one of our core strategic goals and will continue to be a focus going forwards.Gross premiums written increased by 16.9%, and insurance revenue increased by 23.9%, during the year, due to a combination of new business and rate rises across our portfolio.This focus on profitable growth has resulted in an excellent underwriting performance with a combined ratio (undiscounted) of 82.6%, or 74.9% on a discounted basis, with a net insurance services result of $382.1 million. Our overall profit after tax for the year was $321.5 million resulting in a change in diluted book value per share of 24.7%.Our investment portfolio also had a strong year and benefited from higher interest rates. </p><p>The portfolio returned 5.7%, resulting in a net investment return of $160.5 million.Lancashire is always led by the underwriting opportunity. We believe there are significant opportunities going into 2024 and we are well capitalised to be able to fund these through existing resources and internal earnings growth.In light of the excellent financial performance in 2023, we are returning the majority of our earnings to shareholders.While we did not complete the share buyback of up to $50 million announced in the third quarter of 2023, we are today announcing a special dividend of $0.50 per common share in part to reflect this as well as the strong operating performance and supportive outlook. This dividend follows the special dividend of $0.50 per common share paid in December 2023.Additionally, given the increased resilience of our business model, we are announcing a change to our regular final and interim dividend policy. Our Board has declared a final dividend of $0.15 per common share, an increase of 50% from last year (and which is subject to shareholder approval at our AGM in May). It is also our current intention to increase the Group\u2019s ordinary interim dividend to $0.075 per common share. Our interim dividends are usually paid after the announcement of our results for the first six months of the year.Lancashire remains focused on delivering its strategic objectives and continuing the growth and momentum we have built during 2023. Our franchise remains strong and we have fantastic teams across the Group who are dedicated to achieving our goals.I would like to thank everyone at Lancashire for their hard work and commitment during 2023, and our shareholders, brokers, clients and other stakeholders for their continued support for our business.\u201dBusiness update<br/>\u00a0Momentum continues for 2024The market showed continued discipline at the 1 January renewals and we are happy with the outcome. From the supply side, we have seen no significant new entrants coming into the market and existing participants have shown willingness to support good quality business at the right level after a strong year in 2023. We are continuing to see growth in demand from clients due to inflationary pressures, helping mitigate some of the increased supply. Importantly, for catastrophe exposed reinsurance, attachment levels have remained a focus for the market, with sustained reluctance for low attaching layers. Within our non-catastrophe exposed products, almost all product lines remain in a very strong position from a rating adequacy perspective. Overall, for 2024 the market appears to be more stable, at healthier levels of profitability. We continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting, while taking advantage of the stronger market conditions.<br/>Lancashire U.S.During 2023, we announced the launch of Lancashire InsuranceU.S., which will operate under a delegated underwriting arrangement with Lancashire\u2019s UK company platform. This development has been driven by the compelling underwriting opportunity that we see in the U.S. Excess and Surplus market. Lancashire InsuranceU.S. will allow us to write business that we could not access before through new distribution channels and with new clients.Delivering for our peopleWe are fundamentally a people business, and we believe that focusing on our people as part of our strategy is crucial to our ongoing success. We instil high expectations in our people and aim to offer a culture that is diverse, unique and special. The growth we have seen over the past few years has increased the scope of the opportunities available. We also want to reward people for their hard work and during 2023 we made 46 internal promotions across the Group.Our 2023 employee survey showed strong support for our culture and the experience we offer our people. Our highest scores were for being proud to work at Lancashire at 94%, while 92% of people said they are motivated to do their best work and would recommend Lancashire as a great place to work.<br/>Delivering for our communitiesSince it was founded in 2007, the Lancashire Foundation has donated over $23 million to charities and in 2023 it distributed $700,000 across a range of causes. This included smaller donations totalling $56,000 to charitable organisations personally nominated by our employees. In November 2023, 12 employees also volunteered their time for Project Transform, travelling to Tanzania to assist with a construction project. We look forward to continuing these activities in 2024 and beyond.Bermuda corporate income taxDuring 2024, the Group will continue to assess the potential impact of the Economic Transition Adjustment introduced by the recent Bermuda Corporate Income Tax legislation. Based on its current plans, the Group does not anticipate that it will become subject to Bermuda corporate income tax until 1 January 2030, as it expects to fall within the exclusion within the Bermuda corporate income tax rules that means groups with a limited international presence are excluded from scope for a period of up to five years.Underwriting resultsGross premiums written<br/>Gross premiums written increased by $279.4 million or 16.9% during 2023 compared to 2022. Excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums and multi-year contracts, underlying growth in gross premiums written was 17.8%. The Group\u2019s two principal segments, and the key market factors impacting them, are discussed below.Reinsurance segment<br/>The increase in the reinsurance segment was primarily driven by new business in the casualty reinsurance classes as well as the continued successful build out of our specialty reinsurance classes in a strong rating environment. The property reinsurance classes also benefited from strong RPIs and new business, albeit these were somewhat offset by a lower level of reinstatement premiums than in 2022 due to higher catastrophe losses in that year. Overall, the RPI was 122% for the reinsurance segment up from 108% in the prior year.Insurance segment<br/>The increase in the insurance segment was primarily due to strong growth in our property insurance lines of business, which include property direct and facultative and also property construction. In these classes we are seeing the benefit of a strong rating environment and also a more mature book of business following the decision to add new teams in recent years. Gross premiums written in the energy and marine lines also increased meaningfully with new business across all lines of business and rate and exposure increases in power and energy liabilities classes. To a lesser extent, new business contributed to growth across all of our casualty insurance lines of business. Rate and exposure increases were the driver of growth in aviation insurance. Overall, the RPI was 110% for the insurance segment.\u00a0\u00a0Insurance revenueInsurance revenue comprises gross premiums earned less inwards reinstatement premium, and is net of commission costs. Insurance revenue increased by $293.4 million or 23.9% in 2023 compared to the same period in 2022. The market factors driving the increase in casualty reinsurance, property insurance and energy &amp; marine insurance gross premiums written also drove the increase in insurance revenue recognised in the period.Allocation of reinsurance premiums<br/>Allocation of reinsurance premiums comprises ceded earned premium less outward reinstatement premiums, and is net of outward commission costs. Allocation of reinsurance premiums increased $53.0 million or 14.3% in 2023 compared to the prior year. This increase was largely the result of the rate increases experienced upon renewal of the Group's outwards reinsurance programme, additional cover purchased for some of the newer lines of business and a higher level of quota share reinsurance spend driven by the growth in insurance revenue. Overall, the allocation of reinsurance premiums as a percentage of insurance revenue was 27.9% down from 30.3% in the prior year.Net claimsDuring 2023, the Group experienced net losses (undiscounted, including reinstatement premiums) from catastrophe, weather and large loss events totalling $106.1 million. None of these events were individually material for the Group.In comparison, during 2022, the Group experienced net losses (undiscounted, including reinstatement premiums) from catastrophe, weather and large loss events of $329.4 million. Within this, catastrophe and weather-related losses for the year ended 31 December 2022, were $232.4 million. This included $181.0 million from hurricane Ian. Large losses for the year amounted to $97.0 million.Prior year development comprises the undiscounted movement in loss reserves, expense provisions and reinstatement premiums. Favourable development was $78.8 million in 2023 compared to favourable development of $134.3 million in 2022. In 2023, there were reductions in reserves for some of the 2022 natural catastrophe events. The 2022 year included reserve reductions from natural catastrophe loss events in the 2019 and 2018 accident years as well as relatively large beneficial claims settlements on risk losses in the 2017 accident year.\u00a0Netdiscounting benefit<br/>The table below shows the total net impact of discounting under IFRS 17, by financial statement line item.In 2023 discount rates across all our major currencies were at a relatively high level throughout the year with a small decrease in the fourth quarter. This drove the high initial discount impact and relatively low change in assumption impact.In comparison, 2022 began in a relatively low discount rate environment, which then experienced significant increases across all currencies throughout the year. This increase in rates resulted in a favourable $39.4 million impact from the change in discount rate assumptions. This was only partly offset by $26.0 million unwind of the initial discount previously recognised in relation to prior accident years that had been set in a lower rate environment.Investments<br/>\u00a0<br/>Net investment income, excluding realised and unrealised gains and losses, was $108.5 million in 2023, an increase of 94.8% compared to 2022. Total investment return, including net investment income, net realised gains and losses and net change in unrealised gains and losses, was $160.5 million in 2023 compared to a loss of $76.7 million in 2022.In a year of continued volatility, the investment portfolio generated an investment return of 5.7%. The returns were driven primarily from investment income given the higher yields during the year. While the Federal Reserve raised rates by 1.0% this year, the higher yields and tighter spreads mitigated any losses on the portfolio. In addition, the risk assets, notably the bank loans, hedge funds and private credit, all contributed positively to the overall investment return.\u00a0In 2022, the investment portfolio generated a negative return of 3.5%. The returns were driven primarily from interest rate increases and the widening of credit spreads, resulting in losses in all asset classes, most of which were unrealised.The managed portfolio was invested as follows:Key investment portfolio statistics for our fixed maturity securities and managed cash and cash equivalents were:Other operating expenses<br/>\u00a0A significant driver of the increase in operating expenses is the increase in variable costs related to remuneration of $31.9 million given the strong financial performance of the Group. Fixed expenses have increased by 24.4% or $29.0 million largely due to the Group\u2019s growth and subsequent impact on headcount. IT and consulting expenses also increased during the year as we focused on upgrading our systems and data capabilities.\u00a0For the year ended 31 December 2023, $82.2 million of operating expenses were considered directly attributable to the fulfillment of (re)insurance contracts issued, and have therefore been re-allocated to insurance service expenses and form part of the insurance service result. This compares to $70.4 million in 2022.Capital<br/>As at 31 December 2023, total capital available to Lancashire was approximately $2.0 billion, comprising shareholders\u2019 equity of $1.5 billion and $0.5 billion of long-term debt. Tangible capital was approximately $1.8 billion. Leverage was 22.8% on total capital and 25.2% on tangible capital. Total capital and total tangible capital as at 31 December 2022 were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion respectively.Share repurchasesDuring the period commencing 22 November 2023 and ending on 29 February 2024, the Company had authorised a share repurchase programme of its common shares of US$0.50 each up to a maximum consideration of $50.0 million. No shares were repurchased under the programme.No other share repurchase programmes were conducted during the year ended 31 December 2023.Dividends<br/>The Lancashire Board declared the following dividends during 2023:<emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">A final dividend relating to 2022 of $0.10 per common share;</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">An interim dividend of $0.05 per common share; and</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">A special dividend of $0.50 per common share.</emphasis>Lancashire\u2019s Board of Directors has declared a special dividend of $0.50 per common share (approximately \u00a30.39 per common share at the current exchange rate), which will result in an aggregate payment of approximately $119.0 million.

These new accounting standards resulted in a change to some of the Group's longstanding APMs. Comparatives have been restated to reflect the consistent application of IFRS 9 and IFRS 17, and to align with the current definition of the APMs.All amounts, excluding share data, ratios, percentages, or where otherwise stated, are in millions of U.S. dollars.Net insurance ratio:Ratio, in per cent, of net insurance expenses to net insurance revenue. Net insurance expenses represent the insurance service expenses less amounts recoverable from reinsurers. Net insurance revenue represents insurance revenue less allocation of reinsurance premium. This ratio gives an indication of the underlying profitability per $1.00 of net insurance revenue in the financial year.Operating expense ratio:Ratio, in per cent, of other operating expenses, excluding restricted stock expenses, to net insurance revenue. This ratio gives an indication of the amount of operating expenses expected to be paid out per $1.00 of net insurance revenue in the financial year.Combined ratio (discounted):Ratio, in per cent, of the sum of net insurance expenses plus other operating expenses to net insurance revenue.Combined ratio (undiscounted) (KPI):Ratio, in per cent, of the sum of net insurance expense plus other operating expenses to net insurance revenue. This ratio excludes the impact of the discounting recognised within net insurance expenses. The Group aims to price its business, to ensure that the combined ratio (undiscounted) across the cycle is less than 100%.Diluted book value per share ('DBVS') attributable to the Group:Calculated based on the value of the total shareholders\u2019 equity attributable to the Group and dilutive restricted stock units as calculated under the treasury method, divided by the sum of all shares and dilutive restricted stock units, assuming all are exercised. This shows the Group net asset value on a diluted per share basis for comparison to the market value per share.*Common voting shares outstanding comprise issued share capital less amounts held in trust.Change in DBVS (KPI):The internal rate of return of the change in DBVS in the period plus accrued dividends. Sometimes referred to as RoE. The Group\u2019s aim is to maximise risk-adjusted returns for shareholders across the cycle through a purposeful and sustainable business culture.*Calculated using the internal rate of returnTotal investment return (KPI):Total investment return in percentage terms is calculated by dividing the total investment return by the investment portfolio net asset value, including managed cash on a daily basis. These daily returns are then annualised through geometric linking of daily returns. The return can be approximated by dividing the total investment return excluding foreign exchange by the average portfolio net asset value, including managed cash. The Group\u2019s primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to support the Group\u2019s payment of claims and other obligations. Within this framework, the Group aims for a degree of investment portfolio return.*Calculated as the average between the opening and closing investments and our externally managed cash.Total shareholder return (KPI):The increase/(decrease) in share price in the period, measured on a total return basis, which assumes the reinvestment of dividends. The Group\u2019s aim is to maximise the Change in DBVS over the longer term, and we would expect that to be reflected in our share price and multiple. This is a long-term goal, recognising that the cyclicality and volatility of both the insurance market and the financial markets in general will impact management\u2019s ability to maximise the Change in DBVS in the immediate term. The total return measurement basis used will generally approximate the simple method of calculating the increase/(decrease) in share price adjusted for dividends as recalculated below.Gross premiums written:The Group adopted IFRS 17 on 1 January 2023. Under IFRS 4, the previous insurance accounting standard, the Group reported gross premiums written on the consolidated income statement as amounts payable by the insured, excluding any taxes or duties levied on the premium, including brokerage and commission deducted by intermediaries and any inwards reinstatement premiums. The Group continues to report gross premiums written as a growth metric and non-GAAP APM.The table below reconciles gross premiums written on an IFRS 4 basis to insurance revenue on an IFRS 17 basis.* Numbers presented in the table above for the comparative period are as previously reported for the year ending 31 December 2022.Gross premiums written under management (KPI):The gross premiums written under management equals the total of the Group\u2019s consolidated gross premiums written, plus the external names portion of the gross premiums written in Syndicate 2010, plus the gross premiums written in Lancashire Capital Management Limited on behalf of Kinesis Reinsurance Limited. The Group aims to operate nimbly through the insurance cycle. We will grow in existing and new classes where favourable and improving market conditions exist, whilst monitoring and managing our risk exposures and not seek top-line growth for the sake of it in markets where we do not believe the right opportunities exist.NOTE REGARDING RPI METHODOLOGYTHE RENEWAL PRICE INDEX (\u201cRPI\u201d) IS AN INTERNAL METHODOLOGY THAT MANAGEMENT USES TO TRACK TRENDS IN PREMIUM RATES OF A PORTFOLIO OF INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE CONTRACTS. THE RPI WRITTEN IN THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS IS CALCULATED ON A PER CONTRACT BASIS AND REFLECTS MANAGEMENT\u2019S ASSESSMENT OF RELATIVE CHANGES IN PRICE, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITS AND IS WEIGHTED BY PREMIUM VOLUME. THE RPI DOES NOT INCLUDE NEW BUSINESS, TO OFFER A CONSISTENT BASIS FOR ANALYSIS. THE CALCULATION INVOLVES A DEGREE OF JUDGEMENT IN RELATION TO COMPARABILITY OF CONTRACTS AND THE ASSESSMENT NOTED ABOVE. TO ENHANCE THE RPI METHODOLOGY, MANAGEMENT MAY REVISE THE METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE RPI, SO THE TRENDS IN PREMIUM RATES REFLECTED IN THE RPI MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE OVER TIME. CONSIDERATION IS ONLY GIVEN TO RENEWALS OF A COMPARABLE NATURE SO IT DOES NOT REFLECT EVERY CONTRACT IN THE PORTFOLIO OF CONTRACTS. THE FUTURE PROFITABILITY OF THE PORTFOLIO OF CONTRACTS WITHIN THE RPI IS DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS BESIDES THE TRENDS IN PREMIUM RATES.NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS:CERTAIN STATEMENTS AND INDICATIVE PROJECTIONS (WHICH MAY INCLUDE MODELLED LOSS SCENARIOS) MADE IN THIS RELEASE OR OTHERWISE THAT ARE NOT BASED ON CURRENT OR HISTORICAL FACTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING IN NATURE INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, STATEMENTS CONTAINING THE WORDS \u201cBELIEVES\u201d, \u201cAIMS\u201d, \u201cANTICIPATES\u201d, \u201cPLANS\u201d, \u201cPROJECTS\u201d, \u201cFORECASTS\u201d, \u201cGUIDANCE\u201d, \u201cPOLICY\u201d, \u201cINTENDS\u201d, \u201cEXPECTS\u201d, \u201cESTIMATES\u201d, \u201cPREDICTS\u201d, \u201cMAY\u201d, \u201cCAN\u201d, \u201cLIKELY\u201d, \u201cWILL\u201d, \u201cSEEKS\u201d, \u201cSHOULD\u201d, OR, IN EACH CASE, THEIR NEGATIVE OR COMPARABLE TERMINOLOGY.

With regard to the impact of Typhoon Hagibis on INPEX's natural gas trunk pipeline network in Japan, INPEX identified the possibility that a portion of the Tokyo Line located in Nagano Prefecture had sustained damaged on October 13, 2019, as announced on the same day(1). A portion of the Tokyo Line located in Tomi City, Nagano Prefecture, has sustained a fracture due to the collapse of an abutment caused by the flooding of the Chikuma River. As announced, INPEX has already closed the affected segment of the pipeline and secured safety, and the residual gas in the pipeline was disposed in a safe manner. The Matsumoto Line, which runs in the same area as the affected segment of the Tokyo Line, was also shut down as a precaution due to the risk of damage resulting from its exposure brought on by the flooding of the Chikuma River, and the residual gas in the pipeline was disposed in a safe manner. INPEX has completed the cutting of both ends of the affected segments of both pipelines, and will now work alongside concerned parties including the local government to determine the best course of action regarding the removal of the affected segments of both pipelines and the restoration of operations. The supply of natural gas to customers located along the Tokyo and Matsumoto lines is continuing without disruption by being rerouted to alternative pipelines."]}, {"relevance_score": 21, "title": "Typhoon Hagibis satellite images: Japan braces for 'monstrous storm' - latest path update", "published": "2019-10-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">With powerful winds, Typhoon Hagibis is also expected to bring risk of landslides, floods and storm surge to Japan with it.

That tournament is also remembered for players revolting against Lievremont, but the idea of overhauling the squad with an eye for the future is one that Galthie appears to have adopted.</p><p>However, the French rugby fraternity is not renowned for patience and, in fairness, it is impossible not to be excited by the talent coming through across the Channel. It is symptomatic of French rugby's change in approach as Top14 sides increasingly recognise the importance of producing and nurturing talent rather than throwing money at global stars.</p><p>NEW ERA This season they have three sides in the quarter-finals of both the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup. And there were promising signs in Japan as Les Bleus came within touching distance of the semi-finals, only for a Sebastien Vahaamahina red card to sabotage their efforts against Wales.</p><p>At half-back, the flourishing partnership between Antoine Dupont, 23, and Romain Ntamack, 21, is so exciting that Galthie has left out Maxime Machenaud and Camille Lopez. They also have excellent runners outside of them in Virimi Vakatawa and Teddy Thomas, who have produced outstanding rugby for Racing 92 in Europe this term, as well as the versatile Damian Penaud, 23, who was one of France's stand-out backs last year.</p><p>Up front they are also well stocked and flankers Charles Ollivon, 26, and Gregory Alldritt, 22, will be a great match for England's Sam Underhill and Tom Curry. However, France will sorely miss Camille Chat, 24, who is perhaps the pick of their pack. He was set to replace Guilhem Guirado in the No2 jersey but has been ruled out by injury. It means more responsibility will fall on the shoulders of 19-stone prop Jefferson Poirot, who at 27 is one of the senior squad members.</p><p>Then there are the backroom changes, with former Wales coach Shaun Edwards and ex-France captain Rafa Ibanez coming in to support Galthie. Edwards in particular will give England reason for concern, with the 53-year-old looking to impart the knowledge that yielded Wales so much success over the last 12 years. His first outing with Wales in 2008 was a 26-19 win at Twickenham.

A There are no available dates inside current international windows this year.

Met Office forecasters predict the storm, with sustained winds of more than 100mph, will then head eastwards along the coast towards Tokyo. NHK News said the storm is likely to pass over central Tokyo at about 9pm, local time, (1pm UK time) before reaching the Sea of Japan on Sunday. Conditions are expected to deteriorate over the intervening hours as high winds and storm surges create a high risk of coastal flooding. What affect has it had? A heavy rain emergency warning has been issued by Japan's Meteorological Agency.", "Damage has been felt across central and eastern parts of Japan already, with many rivers bursting their banks. About 30,000 homes are reportedly without power in the greater Tokyo area, and 14,000 homes were without power in the Chiba prefecture. Pictures emerging from news organisations show residents desperately trying to protect homes and businesses from the worst of the damage. How many people are being evacuated? Is Japan vs Scotland going ahead? Latest news as Typhoon Hagibis threatens Rugby World Cup fixture\u00a0Authorities have ordered the evacuation of more than 600,000 people in 10 prefectures in eastern and central areas of Japan, according to NHK. As of 5pm local time on Saturday, 619,000 residents in Fukushima, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Yamanashi, Nagano, Shizuoka, and Mie prefectures were under orders to evacuate their homes immediately. The order means authorities consider the likelihood of a disaster to be imminent. Slightly less severe \"evacuation advisories\" are in place for about eight million people.

It was one of many \"light bulb\" moments that pushed the England scrum-half to embark on her own mission: to live a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To hold herself accountable, MacDonald started a blog - \"Let's Talk 1%\" - where she documented one small change she was determined to make each month for the greater good of the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From switching to shampoo and hair-conditioning soap bars as a way of cutting down on single-use plastics, to ordering locally-produced vegetables and using bamboo toothbrushes, MacDonald has now conquered most sustainable swaps. There is one, however, that continues to evade her.</p><p>\"No, I haven't used reusable loo roll yet,\" laughs MacDonald when asked, \"but that's not to say I won't. I do use recyclable toilet paper.\"</p><p>Granted, washing reusable toilet wipes seems a pretty onerous responsibility for an international athlete given their nomadic lifestyle. But judging by MacDonald's competitive drive - she picked up a rugby ball aged 19 at university and just three years later was on England's books - it is surely only a matter of time before she ticks off that next goal.</p><p>The only downside to her career - if there is one - is trying to reconcile her eco-enthusiasm with the demands of life as a professional rugby player. \"When I'm at home, I have more control over what I'm buying and eating,\" she says. \"With a meal, I wouldn't start with a chicken and build around that - I'd much prefer a veggie lasagne or veggie sausages, because I actually prefer the taste of them.\"</p><p>When she is away with England, that routine is not so straightforward. Overnight stays in hotels, where catering is provided, limits what MacDonald can put on her plate, although she has counterbalanced that frustration by projecting her passion for sustainability on to her rugby peers.</p><p>\"In England camp, we might have bottles of water provided - but we'll request jugs of tap water to replace them,\" she says. \"We share cars as much as we can. I also try to buy as few boots as possible. I have one pair of boots and I wear them until they split and my feet are soaking wet when I stand on the pitch.</p><p>\"It's difficult - and it's certainly not perfect by any means - but sport can still play a role while all the technologies around it continue to develop to allow us to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly in the future.\"</p><p>MacDonald's sport is one of many that has already felt the disruptive force of climate change, when matches at the 2019 World Cup in Japan - including England's meeting with France - were cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. More recently, the marathon at this year's Tokyo Olympics was moved because of concerns for athletes' welfare at the hottest Games on record.</p><p>Scientists predict sport will face more disruption of this kind in the future and latest estimates show that by 2050, one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year.</p><p>It is little wonder, then, that last week Fifa, along with several other signatories, agreed to become net zero by 2040 - a move which is at odds with recent proposals put forward by football's world governing body to host a World Cup every two years.</p><p>For MacDonald, there is also the small matter of the delayed women's World Cup next year in New Zealand. Should she make the squad, she would have no option but to board a longhaul flight - and it is partly why she admits to not fitting the definition of a true eco-warrior.</p><p>\"International sport by its very nature requires you to travel, which is probably the highest contributor to CO2 emissions to what a team produces,\" says MacDonald, who will look to make an impact from the bench in England's second autumn meeting against the Black Ferns today. \"The less travel we can do, the better. Unfortunately, we can't dictate what green technologies are available to fly to New Zealand, but we can still become more sustainable as a team.\"</p><p>And yet, due to its growing profile, women's rugby is inadvertently proving more sustainable than other, more lucrative sports. At her club, Wasps, MacDonald plays in the same set of kit for the entire season - and points to Harlequins' kit from last season, which was made from recycled plastic.</p><p>\"For internationals, you get a new shirt for each game,\" MacDonald says. \"Quite often we sign those shirts and give them to charities to raffle off as prizes, so they end up having a secondary life. It's not perfect, but they go to good causes and are reused in some way.\"</p><p>Reusable loo roll might still be on the to-do list, but MacDonald is carving out quite a reputation as the most sustainable scrum-half in rugby.</p><p>'I have one pair of boots and I wear them until they split and my feet are soaking wet on the pitch' England v New Zealand 2.45pm, BBC Two  15 14 13 12 11 10  England E Kildunne (Harlequins) L Thompson (Worcester) H Aitchison (Saracens) H Rowland (Loughborough) A Dow (Wasps) Z Harrison (Saracens) L Infante (Bristol) V Cornborough (Harlequins)   New Zealand C Robins-Reti (Waikato) P Woodman (Northland) S Fluhler (Waikato) G Brooker (Canterbury) A Leti-l'iga (Wellington) R Demant (Auckland) K Cocksedge (Canterbury) P Love (Canterbury) 91234  A Cokayne (Harlequins) S Bern (Bristol) Z Aldcroft (Gloucester) A Ward (Bristol) A Matthews (Worcester) M Packer (Saracens) P Cleall (capt, Saracens)  G Houpapa-Barrett (Waikato) A Pearl-Nelson (Auckland) J Ngan-Woo (Wellington) K Wills (Bay of Plenty) A Bremner (Canterbury) L Elder (capt, Bay of Plenty) L Mikaele-Tu'u (Auckland) Replacements  5678  16 L Davies (Loughborough) 17 H Botterman (Saracens) 18 M Muir (Wasps) 19 H Millar-Mills (Wasps) 20 S Hunter (Loughborough) 21 C MacDonald (Wasps) 22 L Tuima (Harlequins) 23 S McKenna (Saracens)  16 T K N-A'gamate (Manukau) 17 A Itunu (Auckland) 18 A Rule (Canterbury) 19 M Roos (Auckland) 20 K Simon (Waikato) 21 A Bayler (Waikato) 22 P Maliepo (Auckland) 23 Carla Hohepa (Waikato)  Officials  Referee Aurelie Groizeleau (France).
