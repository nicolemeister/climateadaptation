And if there is an artist capable of crossing decades, fashions and civil battles with the same creative and human intensity, it is him. Born as Stevland Hardaway Judkins in Saginaw, Michigan, on May 13, 1950, blind from birth, he transformed an apparent fragility into one of the brightest and most influential talents in pop music history.</p><p>With over 100 million records sold, 25 Grammy Awards and a career that began at just 11 years old with Motown, Stevie Wonder is not just a singer: he is a symbol of the power of imagination, the fight for civil rights and the power of music to change things.</p><p>It's hard to choose just one song to represent Stevie Wonder. 'Superstition', 'Isn\u2019t She Lovely', 'Sir Duke', 'I Wish', 'Living for the City', 'Higher Ground', 'As', 'I Just Called to Say I Love You': each song is a piece of history, not just musical history. His unmistakable voice, his virtuosity on the piano and harmonica, his sense of groove and melody have redefined the very concept of soul, opening it up to funk, pop, jazz, and electronics.</p><p>His album 'Songs in the Key of Life' (1976) is considered one of the absolute masterpieces of pop music: not only for the compositional quality, but for the vision of the world it proposes: empathetic, spiritual, deeply human.</p><p>But Stevie Wonder is not just a giant of music. He has been and continues to be a tireless activist. His campaign for the establishment of Martin Luther King Jr. Day was instrumental in the official recognition of the anniversary in the United States. He has supported the movement for racial equality, the rights of people with disabilities, the end of apartheid and more recently climate justice. His art has always been intertwined with a message: \"Music is a language that everyone understands. And with that language we can talk about peace, justice and love\".</p><p>At 75, Stevie Wonder is still active, albeit less frequently. His latest concerts have thrilled millions of fans around the world. His musical legacy is everywhere: artists like Prince, Alicia Keys, Bruno Mars, John Legend, Anderson Paak, up to Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar, have all acknowledged their debt to his sonic vision. And as time goes by, one thing remains certain: Stevie Wonder has played the world, and he has made it vibrate. With soul. With heart. With the gentle strength of someone who knows how to see, even without eyes, what many cannot even imagine.</p><p>(by Paolo Martini)</p><p>\u00a92025 GMC S.A.P.A. di G. P. Marra.

They sing, they laugh, they chant, they dance and they bang drums. They make jokes. \"The planet is getting hotter than my imaginary girlfriend,\" read a banner at a recent demo. </p><p>But with the prospect of an environmental catastrophe hanging over their futures, when you speak to them one-on-one, many admit to suffering stress, anxiety and even depression in private. A recent global study led by Bath University in Britain reported that nearly 60% of young people were worried or extremely worried about the climate crisis and close to half of 16-to-25-year-olds said it was affecting their everyday lives. Getting involved in activism can help dispel the despair. \"I started ecological activism this summer because I started having eco-anxiety,\" Pascal, a young man from northern France, told ANSA during the Fridays For Future march in Rome on Saturday. \"I stand for non-violent action to invite or strongly invite our representatives and administrators to take more action, lead and choose laws that allow us to transition towards a more respectful economy and a more just system since the crisis we are facing is going to increase the discrepancy between higher and lower classes. \"There is a fight for biodiversity, but there is also the dimension of social justice in this fight\". Chiara d'Avella, a Rome high-school student, said the stress was compounded by the sensation that young people's demands were not being listened to.  \"As Italian students, we are asking for the voices of young people, of students, to be heard by the government, by those who are taking decisions for our future without listening to the people who will actually live that future,\" d'Avella told ANSA at Saturday's march demanding action at last weekend's G20 summit and at the ongoing COP26 UN Climate Conference in Glasgow. \"We are asking for improvements in our education, in our schools, our environment. \"We are the generation that is going to experience the consequences of global warming and nobody is taking action to address it. \"We will also live in a future with a totally precarious work situation. \"Health is also a huge problem that we are asking the government to face, not just ordinary health, but also mental health, which is totally affecting our generation\". Another common feature of the young people campaigning for climate action is that they have thought deeply about the problem. Most of the ones that this reporter spoke to have come to the same conclusion - that we cannot solve the climate crisis unless we tackle deeper issues of social justice. While around 75% of greenhouse gases are produced by G20 States, people in poorer countries are being hit first and worst even though they are largely blameless. For example, tens of thousands of lives are currently at risk in southern Madagascar, one of the potentially many places in the world where famine-like conditions have been driven by climate change, according to the World Food Programme (WFP). It is not just a question of rich countries against less developed ones. The effects of the climate crisis are being felt in the developed world too, of course, but the consequences hit the poorest and the most vulnerable hardest. The elderly and migrant farm workers, for example, were among the groups worst affected by the heat waves that Italy endured in the summer, with degrees reaching a European record high of 48.8 degrees Celsius in Sicily. According to a report by Oxfam and the Stockholm Environment Institute, the wealthiest 1% of the global population were responsible for the emission of more than twice as much carbon dioxide as the poorest 50% of the world between 1990 and 2015. So simply recycling more and phasing out fossil fuels will not solve the climate crisis, they say. Indeed, the mottos used at Fridays For Future protests include 'Uproot the System' and 'System Change not Climate Change'. \"We have some big things at stake and we still have a window of action,\" Beatrice, a 26-year-old trainee lawyer, told ANSA. \"I do not find any purpose or joy in living in a capitalistic economic model. \"It doesn't benefit anyone really, so why not change? \"It would be better for the people, the planet, the animals\". Beatrice, like Pascal, is a member of Extinction Rebellion, a group that stages peaceful, but frequently disruptive protests, to highlight the gravity of the climate crisis.

She said \"we are moving fast in the wrong direction. Our leaders do not act voluntarily, and that is a betrayal. They can't say that they're doing it, because they continue to open coal mines and exploit deposits, without increasing funds for vulnerable countries. They select young people like us pretending to listen to us, but they don't. They have never listened to us\". At the end of her speech, Thunberg swapped slogans with the crowd saying \"what do we want\", to the reply \"climate justice!\" and adding \"when do we want it\", spurring the response \"now!\". The Youth4Climate and Pre-COP26 event is set to last for five days and feature another young activist, Vanessa Nakate of Uganda, as well as Ecological Transition Minister Roberto Cingolani and Education MInister Patrizio Bianchi. Cingolani told the protesting youth Tuesday that \"protests are useful but we must join forces\". Nakate called for more aid to those who are being hit the hardest by climate change saying \"Africa is suffering the biggest damage\". Thunberg reiterated later: \"We must find a transition without trauma, because there is no Plan B, there is no blah blah blah plan. We aren't talking here simply of a costly and politically correct green washing blah blah blah, green economy blah blah blah, net zero by 2050 blah blah blah. \"That's all we hear from our leaders. Words, which seem great, but which have not led to any action. \"Our hopes have been drowning in empty words for 30 years. Change is possible, but not if we go on like this\". Federica Gasbarro, one of two Italian delegates to the conference, told SkyTg24: \"We young people have high expectations from this Youth4Climate conference. Let's not talk about the past any more, about how have failed on climate, but let's talk about the future, with a scientific approach. We must make a common front, all the young people in the world united\". Cingolani said COP26 in Glasgow on November 1-12 will be successful if it boosts action against climate change. Thunberg will take part in a big Fridays for Future demonstration in Milan on Friday.</p>", "publisher": "ANSA English Media Service", "instances": ["They select young people like us pretending to listen to us, but they don't.
