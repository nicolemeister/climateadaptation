The European Commission's plans presented on Tuesday dedicated a section to water, \"a vital resource that is already under pressure in many parts of Europe due to structural mismanagement, unsustainable land use, hydro-morphological changes and pollution\". The Commission warned that there is a risk of \"increased competition over water resources across sectors and uses, including potential risk of conflicts within and among the member states over transboundary water resources\". In Bulgaria, for example, water resources are expected to decline as a result of climate change. This could exacerbate the risk of water scarcity in vulnerable areas and, in years with particularly adverse conditions, elsewhere, said Associate Professor Emil Gachev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences' Climate, Atmosphere and Water Research Institute, at a forum about Bulgaria's water resources, held in Sofia on Tuesday. The forum was organised by the Bulgarian climate science media platform Climateka on the occasion of World Water Day, which takes place on March 22. According to Gachev, one-third of the world's population is experiencing water scarcity, water resources remain scarce and this problem will worsen due to the growing population. </p><p>He specified that the water resources are decreasing due to poor water management and pollution. According to Dr. Valentin Simeonov, a researcher with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, the change in ocean circulation and in particular the slowing down or stopping of the Gulf Stream will lead to a serious reduction in rainfall in Bulgaria. Stormclouds gather over EU's Green Deal. The EU's Green Deal - once a core mission in Brussels' fight against the climate crisis - is also looking increasingly under threat in the bloc's upcoming elections as resistance grows to its costs and consequences. Farmers' protests, consumer cost-of-living worries and some countries' hesitation are already undercutting the ambitious plan to make the EU carbon-neutral by 2050. The climate crisis is becoming \"a real identity politics issue\" caught up in the farmers\" protests, said Susi Dennison, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

The European Commission's plans presented on Tuesday dedicated a section to water, \"a vital resource that is already under pressure in many parts of Europe due to structural mismanagement, unsustainable land use, hydro-morphological changes and pollution\". The Commission warned that there is a risk of \"increased competition over water resources across sectors and uses, including potential risk of conflicts within and among the member states over transboundary water resources\". In Bulgaria, for example, water resources are expected to decline as a result of climate change. This could exacerbate the risk of water scarcity in vulnerable areas and, in years with particularly adverse conditions, elsewhere, said Associate Professor Emil Gachev from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences' Climate, Atmosphere and Water Research Institute, at a forum about Bulgaria's water resources, held in Sofia on Tuesday. The forum was organised by the Bulgarian climate science media platform Climateka on the occasion of World Water Day, which takes place on March 22. According to Gachev, one-third of the world's population is experiencing water scarcity, water resources remain scarce and this problem will worsen due to the growing population. </p><p>He specified that the water resources are decreasing due to poor water management and pollution. According to Dr. Valentin Simeonov, a researcher with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne, Switzerland, the change in ocean circulation and in particular the slowing down or stopping of the Gulf Stream will lead to a serious reduction in rainfall in Bulgaria. Stormclouds gather over EU's Green Deal. The EU's Green Deal - once a core mission in Brussels' fight against the climate crisis - is also looking increasingly under threat in the bloc's upcoming elections as resistance grows to its costs and consequences. Farmers' protests, consumer cost-of-living worries and some countries' hesitation are already undercutting the ambitious plan to make the EU carbon-neutral by 2050. The climate crisis is becoming \"a real identity politics issue\" caught up in the farmers\" protests, said Susi Dennison, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

Una costruttrice di progetti e ponti tra la nostra citt\u00e0 e tutto il mondo. Tra gli incontri professionali che poi si sono trasformati in feconde amicizie Gianni Rodari e James Heckman, Premio Nobel; lo psicologo americano Jerome Bruner (cittadino onorario di Reggio) e Howard Gardner, padre della Teoria psicologica delle intelligenze multiple e del QI. Da tutto il pianeta, anche ieri, sono arrivati messaggi di cordoglio da istituzioni, centri di ricerca, personalit\u00e0. Cristian Fabbi, direttore generale di Frc e presidente di Reggio Children srl, nella sua orazione funebre ha affermato: \u201cLavorare con Carla significa imparare. </p><p>Era una filosofa, una politica, un'intellettuale, e di questo sentiremo la mancanza. Era trasgressiva, sempre capace di tirare fuori i talenti di tutti e di metterci al nostro agio\u201d. Negli ultimi tempi, ha spiegato Fabbi, \u201cera molto interessata ad alcuni temi: il valore della solidariet\u00e0, garantire che le persone ce la facciano da sole. Questo \u00e8 anche il senso del progetto in corso in tutto il mondo con la Fondazione Lego, soprattutto in Africa e Asia, per far progredire le esperienze educative. Carla \u00e8 una figura molto contemporanea. Le sue recenti riflessioni sull'intelligenza artificiale, l'hanno vista contrapporvi l'empatia, soprattutto la fisicit\u00e0. Il tema del corpo, della presenza, soprattutto dopo la pandemia, \u00e8 diventato per lei di attualit\u00e0, anche nella modalit\u00e0 di essere e lavorare insieme... Teniamoci per mano e restiamo insieme\u201d. A nome di tutto il personale di Frc (che ha preparato un video-collage di foto sulle note di 'Ma il cielo \u00e8 sempre pi\u00f9 blu') hanno preso la parola Barbara Donnici ed Elisa Ferrari. \u201c\u00c8 sempre stata molto avanti. Il nostro faro luminoso, la stella pi\u00f9 brillante... Spesso si scherniva: '\u00e8 un risultato di tanti'. In parte \u00e8 cos\u00ec.. ma in questi giorni abbiamo ricevuto messaggi da ogni parte del mondo, tutti la ricordano e Dagli Usa, Marcelo Su\u00e1rez-Orozco, chancellor all'Universit\u00e0 di Boston e membro dell'Executive council dell'Accademia Pontificia di scienze sociali, con la moglie Carola, professoressa ad Harvard, raccontano: \u201cNegli anni di tanti progetti insieme, l'immagine pi\u00f9 forte \u00e8 averla presentata a Papa Francesco, in Vaticano... quando ha guardato Francesco con il suo sguardo affettuoso, con tanta speranza e tanto amore. Francesco \u00e8 stato anche molto contento, lo scorso anno, di sapere che il pensiero di Reggio Children fosse con Carlina al centro del lavoro al Summit sulla Climate Resilience\u201d. Dal Mit di Boston, Mitchel Resnick afferma: \u201cAl meeting Lego disse: 'Gioco e apprendimento sono come due ali di una farfalla, sono interdipendenti'. Molte molte altre cose sono interdipendenti: arte e scienza, scuola e comunit\u00e0, educazione e politica. Per Carla le scelte di educazione erano sempre scelte politiche. Le prime scuole aprirono come risposta al fascismo. Oggi, in questi tempi cos\u00ec difficili, abbiamo bisogno pi\u00f9 di ogni altra cosa della saggezza di Carla e delle sue idee, la giocosit\u00e0, la sua gentilezza\u201d. Il nobel Heckman, dall'Universit\u00e0 of Chicago: \u201cIl suo lavoro e quello di Frc ha ispirato il mondo. Le sue intuizioni e la sua leadership ci mancheranno molto\u201d. Mentre la Lego Foundation l'ha descritta come dotata di \u201cuna leadership visionaria\u201d. Il messaggio pi\u00f9 toccante \u00e8 arrivato dal professor Lester-Irabinna Rigney, dell'Universit\u00e0 del South Australia: \u201cSe lei non \u00e8 pi\u00f9, i figli del mondo risorgeranno.

Parliamo di piccoli fiumi o torrenti che in caso di eventi estremi di maltempo possono dare luogo a esondazioni. Oltre a questi le telecamere, tra cui una installata sulla Torre Fiat, per contribuire al monitoraggio della costa.

Le telecamere invece sul torrente Canal Magro, sul torrente Ricortola, poi alla foce del canale Poveromo e due sulla Torre Fiat: una che guarda il mare e l'altra i monti. \u201cI punti pi\u00f9 vulnerabili sono quelli del reticolo minore - spiega il professore Luca Baldini dell'istituto dell'atmosfera e del clima del Cnr di Pisa - perch\u00e9 appena piove il bacino di raccolta \u00e8 molto piccolo e se la pioggia \u00e8 tanta il reticolo si gonfia in poco tempo provocando danni. Danni comunque limitati in una certa area dove chi ne \u00e8 colpito ne patisce le conseguenze. Quando si parla di cambiamento climatico si dice che gli eventi saranno pi\u00f9 intensi, molto pi\u00f9 localizzati e meno prevedibili. In qualche modo servono strategie di adattamento che cercano di capire i fenomeni in corso per prevenire e attuare misure di riduzione del danno.

Ma stando uniti in solidariet\u00e0, dobbiamo mantenere la nostra speranza nel futuro\", ha affermato Michael Haddad che ha superato la disabilit\u00e0 dovuta a un incidente con l'aiuto di un esoscheletro. \"Vengo dalla regione araba, dove dipendiamo dalle importazioni per la maggior parte del nostro cibo e dove le temperature stanno aumentando pi\u00f9 velocemente della media globale.

In coordinamento con l'Organizzazione delle Nazioni Unite per l'alimentazione e l'agricoltura (Fao), il Centro internazionale per la ricerca agricola nelle aree aride (Icarda) ha preparato per Haddad i pacchetti di semi come parte degli stock ufficiali di semi provenienti da Algeria, Egitto, Iraq, Giordania, Libano, Libia, Marocco, Oman, Stato di Palestina, Siria, Tunisia e Yemen, destinati al deposito nel caveau delle Svalbard. I pacchetti appositamente preparati includono parenti selvatici di grano, orzo, lenticchie, ceci e altri legumi da foraggio. \"Attraverso il secondo obiettivo di sviluppo sostenibile, il mondo si \u00e8 impegnato a porre fine alla fame, raggiungere la sicurezza alimentare e promuovere l'agricoltura sostenibile\", ha sottolineato Melanie Hauenstein, rappresentante residente dell'Undp in Libano. \"Il rispetto di questa promessa richiede sforzi concertati per mitigare il cambiamento climatico, frenare la povert\u00e0 rurale e responsabilizzare i piccoli agricoltori, in particolare le donne che si fanno carico di oneri significativi nella produzione agricola\".</p>", "publisher": "ANSA Notiziario Generale in Italiano", "instances": ["La missione \u00e8 stata ufficialmente presentata questa mattina a Beirut e la partenza per la \"Passeggiata nell'artico\" per sensibilizzare sulla sicurezza alimentare e sull'emergenza climatica e che avr\u00e0 come suo culmine la deposizione di una copia della \"Statio Orbis\" di papa Francesco, il messaggio al mondo del Pontefice durante la pandemia, nel bunker dei semi alle isole Svalbard \u00e8 prevista per il 7 giugno.

Citt\u00e0 con 9 chilometri di costa soggetta quasi tutta a erosione, considerata una seria emergenza ambientale che \u201csta danneggiando la stabilit\u00e0 del turismo e delle attivit\u00e0 economiche correlate\u201d. Non solo, viene presa in considerazione anche per l'eccessivo aumento della temperatura del mare che sta causando l'eutrofizzazione delle stesse acque che le rende inospitali per moltissime specie, in particolare i pesci, oltre a eventi estremi di maltempo e ondate di calore.
