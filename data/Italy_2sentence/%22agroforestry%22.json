Despite the EU's commitment to allocate 10% of its budget to biodiversity by 2026-2027, the communication adopted by the Commission estimates a funding requirement of (EURO)65 billion per year for biodiversity. \"We need to put nature on the balance sheet. </p><p>That is exactly what nature credits do,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in her remarks on the newly adopted EU Roadmap on Nature Credits. \"If well designed, they will be an efficient and market-oriented tool to encourage the private sector to invest and innovate. \"With investment and innovation, we generate income for those working to protect nature - including our farmers, landowners, and foresters.\" The roadmap kicks off this year with the launch of an expert group that will guide technical and regulatory development by helping define criteria, methodologies, and governance mechanisms for these green markets. Experts will be selected after 10 September. The European Commission will also assess the supply and demand for nature credits and, from now until 2027, work to establish a joint pilot project financed through existing EU funds.

It is the second time Tunisian sites have won the GIHAS recognition, after Gafsa Oases in 2011. Both sites reflect profound bonds between the cultivated crops and the natural ecosystem, local fauna and flora, while promoting the preservation of traditional knowledge and biodiversity conservation, FAO said in a statement published on Monday. Their recognition as GIAHS sites will encourage local communities to better treasure and conserve their heritage for future generations. Ramli (''on sand'') are agricultural practices that consist of growing crops on sandy substrates. Unique not only in Tunisia but in the whole world, these gardens were created in the 17th century by the Andalusian diaspora to cope with the lack of cultivable land and fresh water. </p><p>The practices are based on a passive irrigation system where the roots of the plants are fed throughout each season by rainwater stored and floating on the surface of the sea through the movement of the tides. The traditional knowledge preserved over the centuries enables farmers to maintain the lagoon plots through the precise supply of sand and organic matter so that the crops reach the right height, allowing the roots to be irrigated by a fine fresh water and not to be affected by salt water, FAO explained in the statement. Hedges of fruit trees and shrubs on the lagoon barrier protect the cultivated plots from wind and sea spray, help slow down evaporation and fix the sand. Such a multifaceted system makes it possible to grow crops all year round without artificial water supplies, even during periods of drought.  Today, fishing and agriculture are the main subsistence activities in the area. The farms of Ghar El Melh are small (81 percent have less than 5 hectares) and their primary production includes potatoes, beans and onions ''on ramli'', FAO said. Perched on the heights of Mount el Gorra, the gardens of Djebba el Olia form a unique agroforestry system. At an altitude of 600 meters, farmers have been able to shape this mountainous landscape to their advantage by integrating agriculture on terraces derived from natural geological formations or by building them out of dry stone.  Reinforced by an efficient irrigation system, the hanging gardens are examples of innovative and resilient agroforestry that meets the food needs of the local communities throughout the year. Thanks to the preservation of the forests at high altitude and the multitude of species in the tree stratum of the gardens, Djebba El Olia benefits from a  special micriclimate. Based on practices combining agroforestry and agroecology, fig tree cultivation is the mainstay of a varied and resilient multicultural system supported by extensive livestock farming. Apart from figs, a large number of vegetables, pulses and fruit species are produced in the gardens, including solanaceous plants (tomato, pepper) as well as squash, broad bean, onion, bean and potato. Livestock breeding is also a big part of the site's biodiversity, in particular the local breed of sheep Black Thibar, adapted to the rugged terrain, and the Brown Atlas cattle breed known for its hardiness. These gardens benefit from the nearby forests and wild flora and fauna species ensuring that wild pollinators also support biodiversity. The art of managing cultivated and wild species is the basis of the site's ingenious knowledge. The quality of products is highly appreciated - Djebba's AOC labelled figs, fresh and dried fruits and  processed products (jams) are all highly sought after locally and abroad, representing an important source of income. The addition of the two Tunisian sites brings the total number of GIAHS worldwide to 61 in 22 countries.

Il loro riconoscimento come siti Giahs incoragger\u00e0 le comunit\u00e0 locali a valorizzare meglio e conservare il loro patrimonio per le generazioni future.</p><p>Le Ramli (\"sulla sabbia\") sono pratiche agricole che consistono nella coltivazione di colture su substrati sabbiosi. Unici non solo in Tunisia ma in tutto il mondo, questi sistemi agricoli furono creati nel 17mo secolo dalla diaspora andalusa per far fronte alla mancanza di terra coltivabile e acqua dolce. Le pratiche ingegnose si basano su un sistema di irrigazione passivo in cui le radici delle piante sono alimentate durante ogni stagione dall'acqua piovana immagazzinata e che galleggia sulla superficie del mare attraverso il movimento delle maree. Le conoscenze tradizionali conservate nel corso dei secoli consentono agli agricoltori di mantenere le trame lagunari attraverso la fornitura precisa di sabbia e materia organica in modo che le colture raggiungano la giusta altezza, consentendo alle radici di essere irrigate da un'acqua dolce e fine e non essere influenzate dal sale acqua. Siepi di alberi da frutto e arbusti sulla barriera lagunare proteggono le trame coltivate dal vento e dagli spruzzi del mare, aiutano a rallentare l'evaporazione e fissano la sabbia. Un sistema cos\u00ec poliedrico consente di coltivare colture tutto l'anno senza rifornimenti idrici artificiali, anche durante i periodi di siccit\u00e0.</p><p>Arroccati sulle alture del Monte el Gorra, i giardini di Djebba el Olia formano un sistema agroforestale unico. Ad un'altitudine di 600 metri, gli agricoltori sono stati in grado di modellare questo paesaggio montuoso a loro vantaggio integrando l'agricoltura su terrazze derivate da formazioni geologiche naturali o costruendole in pietra a secco. Rinforzato da un efficiente sistema di irrigazione, i giardini pensili sono esempi di sistemi agroforestali innovativi e resistenti che soddisfano le esigenze alimentari delle comunit\u00e0 locali durante tutto l'anno. Grazie alla conservazione delle foreste in alta quota e alla moltitudine di specie presenti nello strato degli alberi dei giardini, Djebba El Olia beneficia di un particolare microclima.</p><p>Basata su pratiche che combinano agroforestry e agroecologia, la coltivazione del fico \u00e8 il pilastro di un sistema policulturale vario e resiliente supportato da un vasto allevamento. Oltre ai fichi, nei giardini viene prodotto un gran numero di verdure, legumi e specie di frutta, tra cui piante solanacee (pomodoro, pepe) oltre a zucca, fave, cipolla, fagioli e patate. L'allevamento del bestiame \u00e8 anche una parte importante della biodiversit\u00e0 del sito, in particolare la razza locale di pecore Black Thibar, adattata al terreno accidentato, e la razza bovina Brown Atlas nota per la sua robustezza. Questi giardini beneficiano delle foreste vicine e delle specie di flora e fauna selvatiche garantendo che gli impollinatori selvatici sostengano anche la biodiversit\u00e0. L'arte di gestire le specie coltivate e selvatiche \u00e8 la base della conoscenza ingegnosa del sito.

Obiettivo dell'Acceleratore sar\u00e0 la creazione di una fonte di reddito pi\u00f9 sostenibile per migliaia di agricoltori locali dello stato amazzonico brasiliano del Par\u00e1, unitamente al ripristino delle native foreste pluviali e alla lotta contro i cambiamenti climatici attraverso il sequestro e lo stoccaggio del carbonio. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Secondo il Comitato intergovernativo sui cambiamenti climatici (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC), le soluzioni naturalistiche sono determinanti per scongiurare gli effetti peggiori dei cambiamenti climatici. Tanto i governi quanto il settore privato possono ridurre le emissioni di carbonio e rimuovere il carbonio dall'atmosfera investendo su larga scala in soluzioni naturalistiche. L'Acceleratore per il ripristino e l'agroforestazione \u00e8 uno di questi progetti di rimozione del carbonio e rientra negli impegni sottoscritti da Amazon nell'ambito di The Climate Pledge, l'iniziativa istituita dalla societ\u00e0 insieme a Global Optimism. I firmatari dell'iniziativa si impegnano all'azzeramento delle emissioni nette di carbonio entro il 2040, con 10 anni di anticipo rispetto all'Accordo di Parigi. </p><p> Nel rispetto dell'impegno assunto con The Climate Pledge, Amazon intende innanzitutto continuare a innovare e investire nella decarbonizzazione delle proprie attivit\u00e0. La societ\u00e0 ha acquistato 100.000 veicoli elettrici per le consegne ed \u00e8 attualmente il maggiore acquirente aziendale di energia rinnovabile al mondo. Amazon sta inoltre investendo in soluzioni naturalistiche al di fuori della propria catena di valore attraverso il Right Now Climate Fund, che sostiene l'Acceleratore e altri progetti finalizzati al ripristino di terreni degradati con modalit\u00e0 atte a migliorare il livello di vita delle comunit\u00e0 locali e a rimuovere il carbonio dall'atmosfera. Attraverso l'iniziativa pubblico-privata LEAF Coalition, annunciata di recente, volta alla mobilitazione di almeno 1 miliardo di dollari a protezione delle foreste tropicali del mondo, Amazon e altri partner stanno collaborando per porre un freno alla deforestazione tropicale, riducendo la quantit\u00e0 di carbonio immessa nell'atmosfera. </p><p> \"Il ripristino delle foreste mondiali \u00e8 una delle azioni pi\u00f9 significative che possiamo intraprendere ora per contrastare i cambiamenti climatici, il cui successo richiede soluzioni innovative\", ha dichiarato Kara Hurst, vicepresidente per la sostenibilit\u00e0 mondiale di Amazon. \"Siamo orgogliosi di lanciare l'Acceleratore per il ripristino e l'agroforestazione in collaborazione con The Nature Conservancy per supportare soluzioni che privilegino un'elevata integrit\u00e0 ambientale e vantaggi importanti per le comunit\u00e0. Amazon \u00e8 lieta di contribuire con la propria passione per l'innovazione, oltre che con un supporto finanziario, al fine di migliorare il livello di vita delle comunit\u00e0 locali del Brasile, aiutando al contempo a proteggere il pianeta per le generazioni future.\" </p><p> \"La scienza non ha dubbi nel considerare i sistemi naturali come prioritari per l'assorbimento del carbonio dall'atmosfera, come sottolineato dall'ultima relazione dell'IPCC\", ha dichiarato Christiana Figueres, cofondatrice di Global Optimism nonch\u00e9 ex responsabile principale per il clima nell'ambito dell'Accordo di Parigi. \"La protezione degli ecosistemi perenni e il ripristino dei terreni degradati saranno strategie fondamentali per la mitigazione delle emissioni di carbonio, soprattutto nei prossimi dieci o venti anni. I progetti in grado di raggiungere questo obiettivo rispettando la natura e migliorando il livello di vita delle comunit\u00e0 locali hanno un valore inestimabile ai fini della trasformazione necessaria per prosperare superando la crisi climatica. Complimenti ad Amazon e a The Nature Conservancy.\" </p><p> L'investimento iniziale di Amazon nell'Acceleratore supporter\u00e0 3.000 agricoltori e consentir\u00e0 il ripristino entro tre anni di circa 20.000 ettari, un appezzamento di terreno grande quasi quanto la citt\u00e0 di Seattle, rimuovendo fino a 10 milioni di tonnellate di anidride carbonica dall'atmosfera entro il 2050. </p><p> The Nature Conservancy collaborer\u00e0 con il Centro Agroforestale Mondiale e diverse organizzazioni della societ\u00e0 civile locale per implementare l'Acceleratore, aiutando le piccole aziende agricole a riconvertire i pascoli degradati dal bestiame in foreste e terreni agroforestali nativi. I sistemi agroforestali forniranno agli agricoltori una fonte sostenibile di reddito attraverso la vendita di cacao e altri raccolti. L'Acceleratore sperimenter\u00e0 anche modalit\u00e0 di sostegno innovative per gli agricoltori e fornir\u00e0 ai mercati beni primari sostenibili ricavati dalle foreste, anche utilizzando le tecnologie digitali, oltre a favorire lo sviluppo di nuove metodologie e tecnologie basate sui satelliti per la quantificazione e il monitoraggio della rimozione del carbonio. </p><p> \"Lo stato del Par\u00e1 ospita il 9% delle foreste tropicali mondiali, ma sta facendo registrare tassi di deforestazione senza precedenti, perdendo ogni giorno 3.300 acri nel corso dell'ultimo anno\", ha rivelato Jennifer Morris, amministratore delegato di The Nature Conservancy. \"Negli ultimi 13 anni, le piccole aziende agricole del Par\u00e1, un'area in cui l'agricoltura basata su tecniche di disboscamento e incendio sembra l'unica opzione, si sono rese responsabili di circa il 40% della deforestazione dello Stato. Per 20 anni, The Nature Conservancy ha collaborato con piccoli agricoltori, rappresentanti delle comunit\u00e0, funzionari governativi e popolazioni indigene per individuare e implementare soluzioni vantaggiose per tutti, come l'agroforestazione, che aiutassero le persone e la natura a prosperare. Questa nuova partnership con Amazon ci consentir\u00e0 di fornire le risorse e l'assistenza tecnica necessarie per portare avanti questo programma e dimostrare che l'agroforestazione rigenerativa e i mercati del carbonio sono modelli aziendali praticabili per le comunit\u00e0 dell'Amazzonia. </p><p> \"Dobbiamo unire le forze per conseguire quello che pu\u00f2 essere l'obiettivo del secolo: sviluppare le nostre economie e salvaguardare i redditi delle persone, preservando e ripristinando al contempo le foreste\", ha dichiarato Helder Barbalho, governatore del Par\u00e1. \"Lo stato del Par\u00e1 \u00e8 pronto ad affrontare questa sfida e la nostra strategia \u00e8 chiaramente illustrata nel piano aziendale <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Amazonia Agora</emphasis>, con il quale ci impegniamo alla totale decarbonizzazione entro il 2036 attraverso la riduzione della deforestazione e la promozione del riassetto forestale.

A parlare \u00e8 Lorenzo Cherubini, in arte Jovanotti, e lo spettacolo in questione \u00e8 quello che sta girando l'Italia sotto il nome di Ora Tour'. Oggi e domani (ore 21) anche gli anconetani potranno vedere il sogno realizzato' del cantante-rapper. L'appuntamento \u00e8 al PalaRossini, dove oltre all'udito sar\u00e0 soddisfatta anche la vista. Spiega infatti Jovanotti: \u00abAbbiamo lavorato tanto, allestendo un laboratorio dove far scorrere le idee, per quello che volevo fosse uno spettacolo che mi permettesse di dare il massimo e di entrare in contatto con ognuno di quelli che verranno a sentirci. </p><p>E' uno spettacolo nel quale si pensa poco ma si gode parecchio, ci si emoziona, si balla come in un rave, mentre davanti agli occhi scorre qualcosa che ha a che fare con quello che c'\u00e8 dentro di noi di pi\u00f9 bello e vivo. Non ho mai avuto cos\u00ec tanta gente a lavorare a un concerto con me, cos\u00ec tante luci, cos\u00ec tanto spazio, cos\u00ec tanta tecnologia, cos\u00ec tanti watt: il minimo che possa fare \u00e8 restituire questa energia a chi ci verr\u00e0 a sentire. Sono molto soddisfatto di quello che siamo riusciti a mettere insieme\u00bb. COME HA DICHIARATO l'artista, i concerti del tour sono \u00abil mio modo di ringraziare tutti per l'affetto che circonda la mia musica pi\u00f9 recente\u00bb. In effetti lo show porter\u00e0 al PalaRossini contenuti innovati ad alto tasso tecnologico ed emotivo. L'evento \u00e8 stato definito come lo spettacolo rock del nuovo millennio', un party evolutivo' in cui gli invitati potranno viaggiare nel nostro tempo, come in un racconto di fantascienza dal vivo, in un'epopea di ritmo e di sonorit\u00e0 sempre in movimento. Una pulsazione potente e tenera, intima ed esplosiva. JOVANOTTI e il suo team di musicisti, videoartisti e ingegneri di scena hanno lavorato per sei mesi al fine di tradurre dal vivo l'energia di Ora', il disco che continua a dominare classifiche e playlist radiofoniche. Sul palco sovrastato da uno schermo di 17 metri si muove una band composta da otto elementi, pronta a scatenarsi insieme al direttore' per due ore e mezzo di musica. Ma in mezzo a tanta tecnologia l'\u00abOra Tour\u00bb \u00e8 anche un progetto di sostenibilit\u00e0 ambientale e sociale. Merito della collaborazione tra Enel e Trident Management, organizzatrice del tour. Tutti i concerti di Jovanotti sono CO2 neutral'. In particolare, attraverso un programma di forestazione che Enel realizzer\u00e0 in Camerun con Treedom nell'ambito del progetto S.A.F.E. (Sustainable AgroForestry Ecosystem), verranno piantati 12.000 alberi, contribuendo a riforestare un\u00b4area complessiva di 20 ettari. Questo intervento azzera le emissioni di gas ad effetto serra associate al tour, pari a circa 6.000 tonnellate di CO2. Gli alberi saranno assegnati agli utenti attraverso un contest lanciato direttamente dal sito <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.enel.it/Jovanotti\">www.enel.it/Jovanotti</url>. DAL SITO si potr\u00e0 partecipare ad un'estrazione, che permetter\u00e0 di avere un albero a cui poter dare un nome, e di cui si seguir\u00e0 tutta la fase della piantumazione direttamente su Google Map. Quanto ai biglietti, per entrambe le date c'\u00e8 ormai quasi il tutto esaurito. In ogni caso ricordiamo i prezzi: Tribuna Gold 46 euro; primo anello numerato 40 euro; parterre 32 euro; secondo anello 32 euro.
