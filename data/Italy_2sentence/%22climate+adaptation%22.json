This was reported by the Copernicus Climate Change Service (Copernicus Climate Change Service - C3S), in the annual report Global Climate Highlights 2024. The C3S is implemented on behalf of the European Commission by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (Ecmwf).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For Carlo Buontempo, Director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, \u201call global temperature data produced internationally show that 2024 was the hottest year since records began in 1850. Humanity is responsible for its own destiny, but how we respond to the climate challenge must be evidence-based. The future is in our hands: swift and decisive action can still alter the trajectory of our future climate.\" \u201cEvery year of the last decade has been one of the ten warmest on record - recalls Samantha Burgess, Strategic Lead for Climate Ecmwf - We are now on the verge of exceeding the 1.5\u00b0C level defined in the Paris Agreement, and the average for the last two years is already above this level. These high global temperatures, coupled with record levels of atmospheric water vapour in 2024, have resulted in unprecedented heat waves and heavy rainfall, causing suffering to millions of people\u201d.</p><p>The 2024 global average temperature of 15.10\u00b0C was 0.72\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average and 0.12\u00b0C above 2023, the previous warmest year. This is equivalent to 1.6\u00b0C above the 1850-1900 period: 2024 thus became the first calendar year to exceed the pre-industrial level by more than 1.5\u00b0C. The 2023-2024 biennium average also exceeds this threshold. \"While this doesn't mean we've crossed the Paris Agreement limit, which refers to temperature anomalies averaged over at least 20 years, it does underscore that global temperatures are rising beyond anything modern humans have ever experienced\", C3S points out. In addition, each of the last 10 years (2015-2024) has been one of the 10 warmest years on record.</p><p>The first half of the year was particularly hot: every month saw higher global temperatures than the same month the previous year. This contributed to a 13-month streak of record monthly temperatures, which ended in June. From July onwards, global temperature anomalies remained significantly above average. August 2024 was as warm as the same month in 2023, and the other months from July to December ranked as the second warmest on record, after 2023. In particular, 22 July marked the hottest day on record, with a global temperature of 17.16\u00b0C.</p><p>2024 was the hottest year on record in Europe, with an average temperature of 10.69\u00b0C, 1.47\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 reference period average and 0.28\u00b0C above the previous record set in 2020. Spring and summer were the hottest on record in Europe.</p><p>In 2024, the annual average sea surface temperature (SST) over the extrapolar ocean reached an all-time high of 20.87\u00b0C, 0.51\u00b0C above the 1991-2020 average.</p><p>Extreme weather events were observed around the world in 2024, ranging from severe storms and floods to heat waves, droughts and fires. According to the report, the total amount of water vapour in the atmosphere reached a record high in 2024, about 5% higher than the 1991-2020 average, significantly higher than in 2023 - it reads - This abundant availability of moisture has amplified the potential for extreme rainfall events. In addition, together with high sea surface temperatures, it has contributed to the development of major storms, including tropical cyclones.</p><p>Not only that. High temperatures can lead to situations where the body is subjected to heat stress. In addition to temperature, other environmental factors such as humidity can also influence heat stress. In 2024 - the report notes - much of the world experienced more days than average with at least 'strong heat stress'. Some regions also experienced more days than average with 'extreme heat stress', a level at which action is essential to prevent heat stroke.

The first was the technology shock brought about by the Internet. The second shock was the great financial crisis and the sovereign debt crisis. It was when the 'twin crises' hit that the European economy fundamentally changed. With investment stalling and fiscal policy becoming restrictive, domestic demand as a percentage of GDP in the euro area has fallen to the lowest level of advanced economies. And the relative gap with the United States has widened. It is difficult to argue that this outcome was entirely accidental,\" the former Italian prime minister said in his speech in Paris at the Annual Symposium of the Centre for Economic Policy Research, the most important research network of economists in Europe.</p><p>According to Draghi, \"governments have made very little effort to complete the EU's internal market, and enforcement of its rules has become weaker, while financial market integration has progressed very little. All these factors have acted as a drag on productivity growth. In addition, European policies have tolerated low wage growth as a means to increase external competitiveness, aggravating the weak income and consumption cycle. There was fiscal space for all governments to counteract weak domestic demand. But at least until the pandemic, in Europe they made a deliberate political choice not to use this space. Overall, policy revealed a preference for a particular economic constellation, based on utilizing foreign demand and exporting capital with low wage levels. A constellation that no longer seems sustainable.</p><p>\"For some time now - Draghi points out - the Chinese market has become less favorable for European producers, as growth slows and local players become more competitive and move up the value chain. The slowdown has increased our dependence on the US market. But the new US administration seems reluctant to act as our buyer of last resort. We will have to deal with a deliberate US strategy to rebalance global demand and suppress trade surpluses in its main trading partners\".</p><p>Therefore - Draghi continues - both structural and macroeconomic policies need to change, to raise domestic growth in Europe. Market reforms are needed for macroeconomic policies to have their full effect. And fully effective macroeconomic policies are needed for market reforms to generate the maximum productivity growth. It should then be noted how what we mean by 'structural reforms' has changed today. Ten years ago, the term was largely confined to increasing labor market flexibility and compressing wages. Today, it means increasing productivity growth without shedding labor, but rather reskilling people. Many different measures have been outlined in the report that can contribute to raising productivity. But the European single market and the capital market are fundamental as they underpin the basic mechanisms that drive productivity growth. If these reforms in the structure of markets were implemented, a major step towards this change would already be taken. Productivity would increase, the effectiveness of policies to support demand would increase and this would translate into even stronger productivity growth. We know, however, that it will take time for such reforms to bear fruit. So we should also reflect on how macroeconomic policies can be used more efficiently in the meantime\".</p><p>\"If the European Union were to issue common debt,\" explains Draghi, \"it could create additional fiscal space to be used to limit periods of sub-potential growth. But we cannot embark on this path unless changes in the structure of markets are already in motion to lift potential growth rates in the medium term. Without this common debt,\" the former prime minister continues, \"we will also need to shift our policy action from changing the orientation of fiscal policy to improving its composition, increasing public investment, and to coordination among Member States. This too creates space to increase demand. Above all, using fiscal space within the new EU fiscal rules would create ample scope for increasing investment. The European Central Bank estimates that if all countries were to make full use of the seven-year adjustment period, a further \u00e2\u201a\u00ac700 billion would be available for investment. A significant share of the required public investment needs\".</p><p>\"It would be comforting to believe that these problems are not as consequential as they seem and that, being a rich continent, Europe can enter a phase of managed and comfortable decline. But in reality there is nothing comfortable about this prospect. If the EU continues with its average rate of labor productivity growth since 2015, given our aging societies, the economy in 25 years will be the same size as it is today. This means a future of stagnant tax revenues and fiscal surpluses to keep debt-to-GDP ratios in check. However, we face spending commitments that will not scale with GDP: unfunded pension liabilities in EU countries range from 150% to 500% of GDP, the \u00e2\u201a\u00ac750-800 billion per year that the Commission and the ECB estimate will be needed to invest in energy, defence, digitization and R&amp;D, not to mention important goals such as climate adaptation and environmental protection. These are all investments that will determine whether Europe remains inclusive, safe, independent and sustainable. We all want that society that Europe has promised us, the one where we can uphold our values \u00e2\u20ac\u2039\u00e2\u20ac\u2039regardless of how the world around us changes. But we have no immutable right for our society to always remain as we wish - Draghi concludes - we will have to fight to keep it\".</p><p>\u00a92024 GMC S.A.P.A. di G. P. Marra.

Inoltre, le balene aiutano a contrastare anche l'aumento delle temperature globali grazie alla loro capacit\u00e0 di determinare l'assorbimento di grandi quantit\u00e0 di CO2, con un valore medio stimato, in termini di servizi ecosistemici, pari a 2 milioni di dollari. Si parla anche di \"effetto fertilizzante\" delle balene, in quanto, dopo essersi nutrite in profondit\u00e0, ritornano in superficie ridistribuendo sostanza organica (nutrienti come ferro e azoto) alla base della produzione primaria.

Tra i relatori della conferenza, il direttore esecutivo e lo scienziato capo dell'Unep, Achim Steiner e Joseph Alcamo.   ''La conferenza rappresenta un punto di svolta nel dibattito su come il mondo affronta il riscaldamento globale'', ha dichiarato Alcamo. ''Non ho mai visto un convegno di questo genere che riunisca tanti specialisti e scienziati per parlare di adattamento al cambiamento climatico. E' il segno che la comunita' scientifica - ha concluso - sta cominciando a rispondere alle necessita' della politica e presenta piani ragionevoli e scientificamente fondati''.</p>", "publisher": "ANSA Notiziario Generale in Italiano", "instances": ["Questo il nuovo messaggio al mondo che arriva dai 1. 000 delegati, fra cui alcuni dei massimi esperti mondiali di cambiamento climatico, riuniti da ieri sera nella Gold Coast del Queensland, in Australia, per la prima conferenza internazionale dedicata interamente all'adattamento ai mutamenti del clima.
