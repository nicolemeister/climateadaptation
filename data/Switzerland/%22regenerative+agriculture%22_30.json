This plan is structured around three key pillars: Net Zero Carbon Emissions, Zero Waste, and Regenerative Agriculture.</p><p>Through its Net Zero Carbon Emissions pillar, the company is implementing a range of strategies to achieve its goal of becoming a net zero carbon emissions company by 2050. One of these initiatives is sustainable mobility. Today, Grupo Bimbo operates more than 7,757 vehicles powered by alternative fuels. Of these, over 4,200 are electric, solidifying its leadership as the company with the largest electric delivery fleet in Latin America and Mexico.</p><p>Under its Zero Waste pillar, Grupo Bimbo reported that 94% of its packaging is now recyclable and reaffirmed its goal that by 2025, 100% of its packaging will be recyclable, biodegradable, or compostable. Additionally, in terms of waste management, we have 80 bakeries and production facilities that send zero waste to landfill.</p><p>Aligned with its Regenerative Agriculture pillar, the company has implemented these practices across nearly 300,000 hectares, with the goal of sourcing all key ingredients from land cultivated using regenerative methods by 2050.</p><p>Alejandra V\u00e1zquez, VP Global Sustainability at Grupo Bimbo, stated: \"2024 was a year of great progress and significant efforts to continue generating a positive impact on the planet, in the lives of our associates, and in the communities where we live and work. We are very proud of these achievements within our Sustainability Strategy, as we continue to take firm steps toward our purpose of Nourishing a Better World.\"</p><p>Recently, the bakery also shared progress on its other two priorities in its latest sustainability report. Under the For You priority, that is focused on offering better nutritional profiles, plant-based diets, and purpose-driven sustainable brands, Grupo Bimbo reported that 99% of its daily consumption products are free from artificial colors and flavors.</p><p>Under the For Life priority, aimed at strengthening communities and caring for our people, Grupo Bimbo highlighted the implementation of 267 community projects in 28 countries through its \"Good Neighbor\" program, benefiting more than 530,000 people.</p><p>To learn more about the company's progress in sustainability, visit Annual Report 2024.</p><p>Contact: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:bbu@buchananpr.com\">bbu@buchananpr.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AWPOE-urn:newsml:awp.ch:20250612:3331:1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AWPOE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1K-FJ83-RRS5-2123-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">319179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><timeReceived>6:10 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 AWP Finanznachrichten AG All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>AWP OTS (Original text service) - English</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"47839\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 12, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This is more than a financial innovation, it's also a social and environmental one. By linking better credit access to sustainable practices, we're not only protecting natural resources - we're improving livelihoods and strengthening rural communities.\"</p><p>Digitizing Credit. Empowering Farmers. Enabling Sustainability.</p><p>Bradesco launched the E-agro marketplace in 2023 to simplify access to rural credit, products, and services. Built on FICO Platform, the solution automates credit evaluation, document verification, and disbursement - removing friction from the lending process and eliminating the need for in-person visits. Small and medium-sized farmers can now apply, qualify, and receive credit entirely online, at the exact moment they need it.</p><p>Since launch, the platform has:</p><p>* Granted over R$1B (USD$197M) in credit with over R$500M in marketplace transactions</p><p>* Reduced contract lead times by 70%</p><p>* Completed 2,000+ complex credit transactions using FICO-powered decisioning</p><p>* Delivered Brazil's first fully digital, government-subsidized rural credit solution A Digital Platform Built for the Field</p><p>Traditionally, rural producers needed to visit branches, notaries, and multiple institutions to access credit, a time-consuming process incompatible with modern farming. With E-agro and FICO Platform, Bradesco has digitized the entire journey. Farmers can now check credit eligibility in real-time, receive tailored offers based on behavioral and agronomic data, submit socio-environmental documentation online, and digitally sign contracts, all from their mobile device or desktop. Once approved, funds are disbursed immediately into the client's account, eliminating the need for any physical visits.</p><p>By integrating FICO Platform into the credit lifecycle, Bradesco reduced steps from dozens to just eight, making the process not only faster but fairer and more inclusive.</p><p>Driving ESG Impact Across Brazil</p><p>Beyond the E-agro offering, Bradesco's ESG commitment extends to playing a supporting role in the ILPF (Integrated Crop-Livestock-Forestry) Network, a regenerative agriculture model that enhances biodiversity, improves soil quality, and reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Through partnerships like the Sustainable Agriculture Finance Facility (SAFF), Bradesco provides lower-cost credit for farmers adopting ILPF practices.</p><p>\"Bradesco is bringing new thinking and technology to banking in agribusiness,\" said Nikhil Behl, president, software at FICO.\"By using advanced decisioning to empower farmers and protect the environment, they're creating lasting economic and ecological value.\"</p><p>For its achievements, Bradesco's E-agro has won the ESG Champion category in the2025 FICO(R) Decision Awards.</p><p>\"Bradesco's E-agro platform stood out to the judging panel as a powerful example of how digital innovation and environmental responsibility can go hand in hand,\" said Allan Tan, group editor-in-chief at Cxociety and FICO Decision Awards judge.\"It's rare to see such a clear fusion of ESG commitment with operational transformation.\"</p><p>To see the full list of 2025 FICO Decision Awards winners, check out: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fico.com/en/fico-decisions-awards-2025\">https://www.fico.com/en/fico-decisions-awards-2025</url></p><p>About Bradesco</p><p>Bradesco is one of Brazil's largest and most respected financial institutions, serving over 71 million customers.

As Chair of the Governance, Nomination &amp; Sustainability Committee, we present this year's Sustainability Report, which demonstrates our progress and commitment to \"Baking Joy, Sustaining Tomorrow\".</p><p>Sustainability has always been a part of ARYZTA's DNA, exemplified by initiatives of Hiestand, our Swiss ARYZTA subsidiary, and its 3yearpartnership with IP-SUISSE, a Swiss sustainability label promoting biodiversity, soil health, and animal welfare, which has championed sustainable agricultural practices. Building on this heritage, 2024 was a year of laying strong founda- tions, embedding sustainability into every facet of the organisation, and preparing for accelerated progress in the years ahead.</p><p>This commitment reflects ARYZTA's belief that sustainability is a long-termstrategy, integral to how we create value for our stakeholders while contributing to a more sustainable planet. Initiatives like the Energy Excellence Programme, identifying over 200 Greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction opportunities, and the Water Conservation Programme, targeting water resource optimi- sation, are evidence of this enduring focus.</p><p>Our governance structure plays a critical role in driving this progress. Led by the Governance, Nomination &amp; Sustainability Committee, ARYZTA ensures transparency and accountability at all levels. Quarterly ESG reviews align sustainability goals with business priorities and guide investment decisions that contribute to meaningful outcomes.</p><p>Additionally, in 2024, we strengthened our reporting practices in reference with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards, the Task Force onClimate-RelatedFinancial Disclosures (TCFD), and the Swiss Code of Obligations. Sustainability is an immensely complex and multifaceted topic, requiring the coordination of diverse governing bodies, frame- works, and initiatives to ensure meaningful progress. These frameworks enable ARYZTA on one side to transparently track and communicate progress, and on the other side ensuring stakeholder confidence in our strategy.</p><p>This report reflects ARYZTA's journey to embed sustainability across its activities and value chain, highlighting both achievements and future opportunities. We invite you to explore the initiatives described within as we continue our path to \"Baking</p><p>Joy, Sustaining Tomorrow\".</p><p>Alejandro Legarda</p><p>Chair of the Governance, Nomination &amp; Sustainability Committee</p><p>[[ARYZTA AG Annual Report 2024  96</p><p>]]</p><p>SUSTAINABILITYREPORT</p><p>ABOUT THIS REPORT</p><p>This report provides a detailed account of ARYZTA's progress in embedding its 5-YearSustainability Strategy, into the way it does business and advancing its 13 Sustainability Goals during 2024. These goals, introduced in 2023, are aligned with ARYZTA's long-term commitment to contributing to a more sustainable planet and society.</p><p>The report has been prepared in reference with leading international frameworks:</p><p>* Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards 2021:Ensuring transparent and comparable disclosures.</p><p>* Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD): Serving as the framework to comply with the Swiss Ordinance on Climate Disclosures.</p><p>* Swiss Code of Obligations (Art. 964a et seqq.): For reporting on non-financial matters which includes disclosures on due diligence and transparency in relation to child labour.</p><p>The report references key international frameworks that guide ARYZTA's sustainability strategy, including the Greenhouse gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi), United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), CDP, International Labor Organization (ILO) Conventions, and OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, among others.</p><p>The baseline year for ARYZTA's sustainability targets is 2022, unless otherwise stated, and the strategy is informed by the materiality assessment conducted that year. The report highlights significant progress, including achievements in GHG reductions, water conservation, and responsible sourcing. It also showcases how ARYZTA is fostering innovation and collaboration across the value chain to drive long-term value creation.</p><p>To illustrate the real-world impact of these efforts, the report includes case studies and examples of community partnerships, regenerative agriculture initiatives, and employee-driven projects.</p><p>Independent limited assurance on key sustainability metrics for 2024 has been provided by Ernst &amp; Young Ltd (see assurance letter in the Appendix).</p><p>For further details on ARYZTA's business model, performance, and results, refer to pages 4-11 of the Annual Report.</p><p>For additional information, please contact:</p><p>Paul Meade, Head of Communication</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Paul.Meade@aryzta.com\">Paul.Meade@aryzta.com</email></p><p>[[ARYZTA AG Annual Report 2024  97</p><p>]]</p><p>SUSTAINABILITYREPORT</p><p>SUSTAINABILITY HIGHLIGHTS 2024</p><p>56%</p><p>Increase in renewable energy use</p><p>[[                                         SAFETY</p><p>5%                                       28%                 82%</p><p>Reduction in Scope                       Reduction in total  Cage Free Eggs</p><p>1?&amp;?2 GHG emissions                      incident rate</p><p>5%                                       99%                 74%</p><p>Reduction in water                       Sustainable         Sustainable</p><p>consumption                              sourced Palm Oil    sourced Cocoa</p><p>(non-product related)</p><p>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</p><p>8,000                     Tonnes of CO2</p><p>reduced</p><p>and removed</p><p>]]</p><p>Supported by 8,500 new hectares of regenerative agriculture</p><p>Percentages are compared to baseline years 2022 or 2023.

More broadly, as of 30 June 2025, 40 portfolio companies have committed to define SBTi targets, of which 23 had their targets validated.</p><p>* Real Estate: At the end of an initial three-year cycle, the SRI (Socially Responsible Investment) labels for SCPI Sofidy Europe Invest and the OPCIs Sofidy Pierre Europe and Soliving have been renewed.

This growth was notably driven by Private Debt funds which have been dynamic in both fundraising and deployment across Direct Lending, CLOs and Credit Secondaries strategies, as well as inflows for Private Equity funds and Capital Markets Strategies.</p><p>* Future fee-paying AuM grew 24% year-over-year to Euro5.4bn as of 30 June 2025, notably driven solid fundraising in Direct Lending strategies, which charge management fees on invested capital as well as the continuation fund linked to Egis and the launch of the unit-linked product dedicated to European defense and security, which will begin to generate fees in the course of H2 2025.</p><p>* Non-fee-paying AuM increased 20% year-over-year to Euro4.8bn as of 30 June 2025, reflecting revaluations of funds in their post-investment period, leverage for some Real Estate funds and a portion of the continuation fund linked to Egis.</p><p>* Management fees and other revenues23reached Euro169m in H1 2025, up 8% compared to H1 2024. Management fees and other revenues represented 93% of Asset management revenues in H1 2025.</p><p>* Average management fee ratewas resilient and stood at 0.90% in H1 2025 (vs. 0.88% in H1 2024). Its evolution reflects the fundraising mix as well as calendar effects on high fee-generating strategies.</p><p>* Performance-related revenues amounted to Euro13m in H1 2025, mainly coming from the third vintage of Direct Lending strategy, co-investment vehicles linked to Egis and Capital Markets Strategies' fixed income funds.</p><p>Performance-related revenues represent a significant value-creation driver embedded in Tikehau Capital's operating model with Euro24bn of AuM eligible to carried interest as of 30 June 2025, representing a 17% year-over-year growth. This profit engine is not yet crystallized in its financial statements, given the firm's conservative accounting policy. Unrealized performance-related revenues for Tikehau Capital, provisioned within the Group's funds stand at approximately Euro215m24at 31 March 2025. This amount only reflects a portion of the long-term value creation potential linked to this type of revenues and will increase as the funds approach maturity and crystallize their performance.</p><p>* As a result, totalAsset Management revenuesreached a total of Euro182m in H1 2025, a 13% growth compared to H1 2024.</p><p>* Solid growth in Asset Management profitability with AM EBIT increasing by 24% YoY</p><p>* Asset management operating expenses25remained under control, amounting to Euro109m in H1 2025, up +8% compared to H1 2024 and +3% compared to H2 2024. Personnel expenses accounted for c.70% of operating expenses. This reflects selective investments carried out by the firm in H1 2025 to strengthen its asset management teams and its multi-local platform as well as the launch of initiatives to support future growth, coupled with efficient cost management.</p><p>* Core Fee-Related Earnings26 (Core FRE) amounted to Euro60m in H1 2025, compared to Euro56m in H1 2024, up 8%. Core FRE margin was resilient at 36% in H1 2025 (stable compared to H1 2024).</p><p>* Fee-Related earnings (FRE) stood at Euro50m in H1 2025, compared to Euro46m in H1 2024. FRE margin reached 30% stable compared to H1 2024.</p><p>* After taking into account Euro13m of Performance-related earnings (PRE), EBIT for the Asset Managementbusiness amounted to Euro64m in H1 2025, compared to Euro51m in H1 2024, representing a 24% growth and a 35% margin (compared to 32% as of 30 June 2024).</p><p>* Group portfolio revenues reached Euro111m in H1 2025, up 42% YoY, despite unfavorable foreign exchange effects</p><p>* Realized revenuesreached Euro114m in H1 2025, driven by an 18% growth in dividends, coupons and distributions, mainly coming from Tikehau Capital's asset management strategies, accounting for c. 70% of total realized revenues. Listed investments, Private Debt and Real Assets strategies were the main contributors to realized revenues in H1 2025.</p><p>* Unrealized revenues stood at Euro(2)m in H1 2025, including Euro(39)m of negative FX impacts. They are composed of positive unrealized revenues notably from the firm's Private Equity strategies (mainly Aerospace &amp; Defense and Growth Equity) and ecosystem investments,as well as negative market effects on some Credit and Real Assets strategies and listed REITs.</p><p>* Net result, Group share reached Euro87m in H1 2025</p><p>* Group corporate expenses for H1 2025 amounted to Euro(37)m, a stable level compared to H1 2024.</p><p>* Financial result reached Euro(33)m in H1 2025, compared to Euro(21)m in H1 2024. This change is due to the refinancing transaction carried out during the first half of 2025, as well as market effects related to interest rate swap.</p><p>* After taking into account Euro10m of positive result from non-recurring and other items (mainly Euro/$ exchange rate effects), net result before tax reached Euro115m, up +55% year-over-year. After deducting a Euro(29)m tax expense and minority interests, net result, Group share reached Euro87m, up +50% compared to H1 2024.</p><p>* A balance sheet generating a substantial skin in the game</p><p>* As of 30 June 2025, consolidated shareholders' equity, Group share reached Euro3.1bn and consolidated cash position reached Euro207m. The Group also has a Euro800m revolving credit facility, maturing in July 2028, drawn for Euro350m as of 30 June 2025.</p><p>* Gross financial debt as of 30 June 2025 increased to Euro2.1bn, with a gearing ratio27of 68%. During the first half of the year, Tikehau Capital announced the successful placement of a Euro500m senior unsecured bond issue with a fixed annual coupon of 4.250%. The strong investor demand, with an oversubscription of 2.8 times, reflects the Group's solid credit profile and investor confidence in a challenging market environment. The proceeds of this new issuance will be used for Tikehau Capital's general corporate purposes, and, an amount of Euro200m has been used to purchase its existing Euro500m 2.250% bonds issued in 2019 and maturing in 202628.</p><p>* In Q2 2025, the financial ratings agencies Fitch Ratings and S&amp;P Global Ratings both confirmed Tikehau Capital's Investment Grade credit rating (BBB-)with a stable outlook, confirming the strength of the firm's financial profile. POST-CLOSING ACHIEVEMENTS</p><p>* Tikehau Capital recently concluded a flagship private credit transaction with the successful refinancing of Dedalus, a leading European healthcare IT provider. This deal marks the conclusion of a multi-year partnership that began in 2016, during which Tikehau Capital's balance sheet invested alongside its Direct Lending funds to support Dedalus' rapid growth and international expansion.</p><p>Over the investment period, Dedalus' revenues grew sixfold, and the Group's Euro180 million financing package played a key role in supporting strategic acquisitions. The 2025 refinancing, arranged by KKR and ClearLake, generated strong returns and P&amp;L for both the Group's Direct Lending funds and balance sheet, with 1.9x of Net MOIC and 14.2% of Net IRR. This transaction demonstrates the power of the Group's integrated investment approach and its ability to deliver value through disciplined, partnership-driven investing.</p><p>* On 28 July 2025, Eurogroup's main shareholder EMS and leading Asian private equity firm FountainVest announced a strategic alliance to accelerate the company's global growth. As part of this transaction, Tikehau Capital, Eurogroup's second largest shareholder, has agreed to sell its entire stake, held through its first vintage of Private Equity energy transition fund, to FountainVest at a significant premium, supporting the company's next phase of expansion. This follows Tikehau Capital's pivotal role in Eurgroup's journey since 2020, including its support during the company's successful IPO on Euronext Milan in 2023.</p><p>The deal, expected to close in H1 2026, will result in a new majority shareholding structure and a subsequent tender offer to delist Eurogroup from Euronext Milan. Tikehau Capital is proud to have supported Eurogroup's transformation into a global leader in electrification and energy transition, and welcomes this new chapter for the company. SHARE BUY-BACK</p><p>* Tikehau Capital announces that it has extended until 23 October 2025 (included), the date of the Group's Q3 2025 announcement, the share buy-back mandate, which was signed and announced on 19 March 2020 and extended until today.</p><p>* As of 30 July 2025, 6,221,828 shares were repurchased under the share buy-back mandate. The description of the share buy-back program (published in paragraph 8.3.4 of the Tikehau Capital Universal Registration Document filed with the French Financial Markets Authority on</p><p>20 March 2025 under number D.25-0123) is available on the company's website in the Regulated Information section (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tikehaucapital.com/en/shareholders/regulated-information\">https://www.tikehaucapital.com/en/shareholders/regulated-information</url>). OUTLOOK</p><p>* Favorable structural tailwinds are expected to continue to support the expansion of private markets globally. In this context, Tikehau Capital is well positioned to navigate ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, capitalizing on by its defensive portfolio construction, disciplined investment approach and compounding balance sheet.</p><p>* The Group's multi-local presence, thematic investment strategies and strong European footprint are proving increasingly relevant amid rising investor interest in the region.</p><p>* Tikehau Capital continues to view its balance sheet as a key asset, having driven the growth of its Asset Management platform. As the firm's well-established Asset Management strategies scale and capital is recycled, capital intensity in these strategies will decrease. Capital allocation will be increasingly rebalancedfrom these mature strategies toward scaling adjacencies, innovation, and ecosystem investments. Tikehau Capital will prioritize selective investments to generate complementary profits, enhance Return on Equity, and maintain strong alignment with clients.</p><p>* Looking ahead, Tikehau Capital anticipates an acceleration in both revenues and FRE generationin the second half of the year, while maintaining its disciplined approach to cost management.</p><p>* Tikehau Capital has set ambitious targets for 2026 that continue to define its strategic vision(generate Euro65bn of AuM, Euro250m of Fee-Relating Earnings and Euro500m of net income). While these goals remain central to its drive for excellence, they remain merely milestones in the Group's long-term growth journey, and their ultimate achievement will naturally depend on the evolving economic and geopolitical landscape.

The firm continued to leverage its robust origination capabilities across geographies to source compelling off-market investment opportunities, in an overall muted market:</p><p>* The first quarter was marked by the second transaction of the firm's second vintage of European value-add strategy in Germany. Alongside residential real estate company Forte, Tikehau Capital acquired two residential properties in Cologne and the greater Cologne area6, comprising 25,000 square meters of rental space and around 300 residential units;</p><p>* Additionally, in March 2025, Tikehau Capital completed, through a club-deal, the off-market acquisition of a multifamily residential building located in Manhattan's Upper East Side.

The Group issued Euro500 million of senior unsecured bonds carrying an annual fixed coupon of 4.250%. The strong investor demand, with an oversubscription of 2.8 times, reflects the Group's solid credit profile and investor confidence in a challenging market environment. The issuance attracted a diverse international base of institutional investors, further reinforcing Tikehau Capital's financial strength and visibility.</p><p>* The proceeds of this new issue will be used for Tikehau Capital's general corporate purposes, and, in an amount of Euro200 million, to purchase the existing bonds tendered to the tender offer announced on 28 March 2025 on its existing Euro500 million 2.250% bonds issued on 14 October 2019 and maturing on 14 October 2026.</p><p>* These transactions allow the Company to manage its debt maturity profile and liquidity in an efficient manner by extending its average debt's maturity to 4.2 years15, compared to 3.6 years without these transactions. SHARE BUY-BACK</p><p>* Tikehau Capital announces that it has extended until 30 July 2025 (included), the date of the Group's 2025 first half results announcement, the share buy-back mandate, which was signed and announced on 19 March 2020 and extended until today.</p><p>* As of 24 April 2025, 6,102,390 shares were repurchased under the share buy-back mandate. The description of the share buy-back program (published in paragraph 8.3.4 of the Tikehau Capital Universal Registration Document filed with the French Financial Markets Authority on</p><p>20 March 2025 under number D.25-0123) is available on the company's website in the Regulated Information section (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tikehaucapital.com/en/shareholders/regulated-information\">https://www.tikehaucapital.com/en/shareholders/regulated-information</url>). OUTLOOK</p><p>* In a context of renewed volatility and uncertainty, Tikehau Capital stands out with its defensive, multi-country profile, well-established thematic strategies and disciplined investment approach. The Group remains highly vigilant regarding the evolution of the macroeconomic and geopolitical environment and the potential impacts on transaction activity and portfolio companies and assets.</p><p>* Tikehau Capital's portfolios have minimal direct exposure to tariffs, with &lt;1% of portfolio companies generating more than 20% of their revenues in the US. The Group's investment footprint is primarily focused onEurope, which accounts for approximately 84% of its assets. The Group maintains low sector concentration and limited exposure to North America with only 9% of assetslocated in the region and &lt;3% of revenuefrom its European portfolio16generated in the U.S. The private assets portfolio is mainly invested in sectors insulated from tariff impact, which together represent approximately 75% of exposure17, including principally software, commercial and professional services and healthcare services.</p><p>* Current market volatility, driven by tightening liquidity and recent trade tariffs, is creating compelling opportunities. As a liquidity provider, Tikehau Capital is well-positioned to capitalize on these dynamics through its well-established strategies such as Credit Secondariesand Tactical Strategies. The Group is also favorably positioned to capture opportunities in core and value-add Real Estate. In addition, momentum remains strong in Decarbonizationwhile interest is accelerating in Aerospace, Defense and Cybersecuritywithin Private Equity - sectors where the Group has built a solid and realized track-record.</p><p>* Investor sentiment towards Europeis strengthening, driven by renewed confidence in the region's economic and strategic direction. With the revival of industrial policies and a growing focus on long-term investment priorities, Europe is entering a new phase of value creation. Tikehau Capital is seeing growing interest from global allocators, especially in Asia and the Middle East, on its European strategies. With a strong local footprint and a focus on key themes, the Group is well positioned to capture the opportunities emerging from this reshaped landscape.</p><p>* Tikehau Capital has set ambitious targets for 2026 that continue to define its strategic vision(generate Euro65bn of AuM, Euro250m of Fee-Relating Earnings and Euro500m of net income). While these goals remain central to its drive for excellence, they remain merely milestones in the Group's long-term growth journey, and their ultimate achievement will naturally depend on the evolving economic and geopolitical landscape.

As a Swiss-based company with affiliates around the world, Nestl\u00e9 is committed to adhering to the legal and regulatory frameworks that govern its operations within Switzerland, in the European Union and globally.</p><p>The Swiss Code of Obligations mandates responsibilities for the Board of Directors concerning the oversight and management of Nestl\u00e9. In accordance with Articles 716a and 717 of the Swiss Code of Obligations, Nestl\u00e9's Board of Directors assumes a proactive role in integrating sustainability considerations into Nestl\u00e9's corporate governance framework (see General Disclosuresand Governance Disclosures).</p><p>This includes ensuring that Nestl\u00e9's strategic decisions are informed by sustainability factors, which are also central to its compliance with Swiss law, and future compliance with European regulatory requirements.</p><p>Under Articles 964a-c of the Swiss Code of Obligations, Nestl\u00e9 is required to disclose material non-financial information, particularly relating to environmental and social matters, employee concerns, respect for human rights, and anti-corruption measures. Nestl\u00e9's Non-Financial Statement 2024 provides transparent reporting on these areas, consistent with reference to the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) and European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), and reflects its commitment to the principles of responsible business conduct as outlined by Swiss law.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 upholds a strong commitment to human rights, labor standards and social responsibility. Nestl\u00e9 conducts regular due diligence across its operations and supply chains to identify, prevent and mitigate potential human rights impacts. Nestl\u00e9's policies and practices are designed to comply with Article 964j of the Swiss Code of Obligations, ensuring that Nestl\u00e9 meets the highest standards</p><p>of corporate responsibility (see Appendix 7 - Key Policies and Documents).</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 discloses its environmental policies, risks and performance metrics. Nestl\u00e9's sustainability initiatives are aimed at achieving long-term environmental goals, such as reducing carbon emissions, conserving natural resources, and promoting circular economy practices (see Resource use and circular economy).</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's commitment to ethical business practices is grounded in both the Swiss Code of Obligations and the ESRS framework (see Own workforceand Business conduct). Nestl\u00e9 maintains anti-corruption policies and practices, in accordance with Article 964b of the Swiss Code of Obligations, to prevent, detect and respond to any instances of corruption or unethical behavior.

(\"Nestl\u00e9\") in accordance with Articles 964a-c of the Swiss Code of Obligations. Moreover, in anticipation of the Group's future obligation to report in accordance with CSRD, the structure, terminology and approach of this report have been prepared with reference to the ESRS.</p><p>Materiality</p><p>In this Non-Financial Statement 2024, Nestl\u00e9 provides data and information on topics that it has assessed as material to Nestl\u00e9's sustainability practices, initiatives and performance, closely aligned with the ESRS.</p><p>For a description of Nestl\u00e9's process to identify and assess material impacts, risks and opportunities, see Double materiality assessment.</p><p>The Content Index in Appendix 2 - Statutory Non- Financial Matter Report Index (Article 964b CO)contains the ESRS topics that Nestl\u00e9 considers material.</p><p>[[Non-Financial Statement 2024  3</p><p>]]</p><p>Part 1 - General Disclosures</p><p>About this Non-Financial Statement 2024</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's Non-Financial Statement 2024 aims to provide a balanced picture of Nestl\u00e9's material topics, related impacts and performance in the calendar year ending December 31, 2024. For investors, Nestl\u00e9 also provides an overview of activities related to its major material issues in the</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Annual Review.</p><p>This Non-Financial Statement 2024 provides an overview of the areas where Nestl\u00e9 may have a significant impact on its surroundings, as well as the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that may have a notable financial impact on Nestl\u00e9. The Non-Financial Statement 2024 also aims to present a transparent and accurate picture of Nestl\u00e9's strategy and progress to advance regenerative food systems at scale, including its goals, roadmaps, guidelines, measures and achieved results in relevant areas. This Non-Financial Statement 2024 is structured with reference to ESRS and in accordance with the Swiss law requirements under Articles 964b and 964j-l of the Swiss Code of Obligations and the Swiss Ordinance on Climate Disclosures.</p><p>This Non-Financial Statement 2024 covers Nestl\u00e9's global operations and contains data for wholly-owned companies and subsidiaries that are consolidated in the Nestl\u00e9 S.A. financial statements as of December 31, 2024, excluding associates, joint ventures and suppliers unless otherwise stated. This ensures consistency and completeness in reporting across both financial and sustainability dimensions. It covers the period from January 1, 2024, to December 31, 2024 unless otherwise stated. Please refer to the Consolidated Financial Statementsof the Nestl\u00e9 Group 2024, page 161, for the list of Nestl\u00e9 Group companies.</p><p>Throughout this Non-Financial Statement 2024, Nestl\u00e9 provides information on strategic and material environmental, social and governance (ESG) key performance indicators (KPIs). These KPIs address key issues to Nestl\u00e9 and its stakeholders. More information on the methodology used to calculate these metrics can be found in Appendix 1 - Reporting Scope and Methodology for ESG Key Performance Indicators 2024, where Nestl\u00e9 details the definition, scope, methodology and assumptions for calculating and reporting on the selected ESG metrics.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's business model is to deliver nutritious products for people and pets. Nestl\u00e9 makes and sells products in: Powdered and Liquid Beverages, PetCare, Nutrition and Health Science, Prepared dishes and cooking aids, Milk products and ice cream, Confectionery and Water. Nestl\u00e9's business operates in five zones: North America (NA), Europe (EUR), Asia, Oceania and Africa including Middle East (AOA), Latin America (LATAM) and Greater China (GC).(1) Nestl\u00e9's diverse portfolio encompasses well-known brands and innovative offerings, allowing it to meet the ever-changing demands of consumers. Please refer to the 'Our business' section of this year's Nestl\u00e9 Annual Reviewfor more details on this topic.</p><p>This Non-Financial Statement 2024 includes material information from the value chain to enable users to understand the significant impacts, risks and opportunities relevant to Nestl\u00e9. This approach aligns with the findings of Nestl\u00e9's double materiality assessment (DMA), which was last reviewed in the autumn of 2024.</p><p>In this Non-Financial Statement 2024, Nestl\u00e9 considers its upstream and downstream value chain as follows:</p><p>* The upstream value chain includes both direct and indirect suppliers.</p><p>* The downstream value chain is limited to customers, unless Nestl\u00e9 identifies a material impact, risk or opportunity beyond its direct customers.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 has not exercised the option to omit any specific piece of information related to intellectual property, knowhow or the results of innovation in this Non-Financial Statement 2024. All relevant information has been disclosed to provide a full and transparent view of Nestl\u00e9's sustainability performance and practices.</p><p>1. In October 2024, the Nestl\u00e9 Board of Directors approved changes to the company's organization, effective as of January 1, 2025, to merge Zone Latin America (LATAM) and Zone North America (NA) to Zone Americas (AMS). Further, Zone Greater China (GC) became part of Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa (AOA).</p><p>[[4  Non-Financial Statement 2024</p><p>]]</p><p>Part 1 - General Disclosures</p><p>Specific definitions and assumptions</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's Non-Financial Statement 2024 uses the definition of short-, medium- and long-term horizons provided by CSRD, except for the disclosures on climate change, which are as stated in Climate change: Strategy and policies.</p><p>The climate change time horizon definitions were applied due to the alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) methodology to assess and disclose climate risks and opportunities. Climate-related risks are treated the same way as other risks at Nestl\u00e9 and are fully embedded in the Nestl\u00e9 Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework, which encompasses multiple complementary processes. This includes the resilience analysis Nestl\u00e9 conducted in 2023 which used scenario-based modeling to identify climate-related impact risks and opportunities. The time horizons considered for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities are medium-term (5 years) and long-term (120 years). These are longer than the time horizon provided by ESRS, as climate risk is expected to materialize on a longer timeline than the time horizons in CSRD. In the short-term (1-2 years), Nestl\u00e9 assumes that the dynamic forecast, which includes an 18-month outlook, incorporates potential climate-related risks and opportunities, similar to other business-related areas. These are covered in Climate changeand summarized in Appendix 5 - TCFD Indexof this Non-Financial Statement 2024.</p><p>There is a degree of uncertainty associated with calculating financial risks and opportunities in all areas deemed material to Nestl\u00e9. Efforts have been made to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information presented in this Non-Financial Statement 2024. However, it should be noted that the metrics included in this Non- Financial Statement 2024 are subject to uncertainties due to limitations in data-collection and measurement methods. The precision of different techniques may also vary. The Non-Financial Statement 2024 incorporates data obtained from external sources or third parties as much as possible.</p><p>This Non-Financial Statement 2024 marks the first year that Nestl\u00e9 is presenting sustainability information in a format intended to follow the ESRS structure, format, and methodology, which may affect its comparability to previous reports. This Non-Financial Statement 2024 does not yet comply with all aspects of ESRS. Nestl\u00e9 does not have material errors from prior periods; therefore, no corrections for prior years' errors have been made.</p><p>This Non-Financial Statement 2024 follows the requirements of:</p><p>* Article 964b of the Swiss Code of Obligations, as outlined onpage 145, including climate disclosures based on the Ordinance on Climate Disclosures and the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, page 164.</p><p>* Article 964l of the Swiss Code of Obligations, which addresses due diligence and transparency related to child labor,page 149.</p><p>Finally, Nestl\u00e9 has reported the information cited in the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) content index, page 167, for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, with reference to the GRI Standards.</p><p>Governance</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's sustainability governance is integrated into its corporate structure, with oversight by the Board of Directors. The Board is responsible for Nestl\u00e9's strategy and organization and provides oversight over its financial and non-financial performance and reporting. The Board approves Nestl\u00e9's ESG and Sustainability Strategy and approves its Non-Financial Statement for submission to the Annual General Meeting.

They relate to affordable nutrition with micronutrients fortification, reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, virgin plastic reduction, reduction of water-use in factories, and management positions held</p><p>by women. These five objectives are equally weighted at</p><p>3% each. Other employees are also linked to similar ESG objectives through employee-specific objectives related to individual priorities and performance. As of 2023, Nestl\u00e9 added an ESG-related KPI, 'Reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions', as a fourth performance metric in the Long-Term Incentive Plan (20% of the target).</p><p>See Business conductfor detailed information related to risk management and internal controls over sustainability reporting.</p><p>Regarding data quality, Nestl\u00e9 continuously works to improve this aspect of reporting, and it has appointed a Data Quality Management Team and Manager to lead these efforts and explore possibilities for automating data capture to replace manual processes.</p><p>Data collection within Nestl\u00e9 involves regional representatives collecting environmental and climate reporting data from suppliers and operations within their respective Zones and Markets.

These steps include the following:</p><p>* Embedding responsible business conduct into policies and management systems.</p><p>* Risk identification: Operations and supply chains are regularly assessed to identify potential adverse impacts.</p><p>* Prevention and mitigation: Strict policies are enforced, and training is provided. Nestl\u00e9 collaborates with partners to manage risks.</p><p>* Monitoring: Audits are conducted, performance tracked and grievance mechanisms maintained.</p><p>* Remediation: Actions are taken promptly to remedy identified issues and engage with affected stakeholders.</p><p>* Transparency: Due diligence efforts and outcomes are reported regularly.</p><p>Engaging with stakeholders</p><p>Engaging with Nestl\u00e9 employees</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 discloses in the Workforce Disclosure Initiative (WDI) how it engages with employees and how it takes their views on board, either as part of a formal information and consultation process, or as part of employee-engagement surveys and different idea-generating platforms.</p><p>Workforce matters are integrated into Nestl\u00e9's 2025 People Strategy, which is overseen by Nestl\u00e9's Global Head of Human Resources.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's commitment aims to ensure healthy and safe working conditions for both employees and the individuals it collaborates with. It also expects suppliers and business partners to uphold these standards. Nestl\u00e9's primary goal is to empower informed decision-making and encourage employees to take responsibility for themselves, their families and the success of Nestl\u00e9's business. Additionally, Nestl\u00e9 proactively works toward identifying and mitigating workplace health and safety risks, offering comprehensive health and well-being programs and providing support to employees throughout their recovery from injuries or illnesses.</p><p>[[8  Non-Financial Statement 2024</p><p>]]</p><p>Part 1 - General Disclosures</p><p>To implement its sustainability-related commitments, Nestl\u00e9 has developed two global strategies:</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9's Global Safety Strategy is dedicated to upholding the highest safety standards across Nestl\u00e9 sites, operations and projects. This strategy focuses on defining life-saving rules with zero tolerance for fatal and serious injuries, while also emphasizing the right behaviors. Nestl\u00e9 embraces digital safety innovation, leveraging technology to seek to eliminate the occurrence of serious accidents. Furthermore, it employs behavioral science to gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving at-risk behaviors and ways to address their root causes.</p><p>* The Nestl\u00e9 Roadmap for Employee Health outlines Nestl\u00e9's priorities for the period 2024-2026. It summarizes the Employee Health Vision, Principles and Pillars with key milestones and deliverables. It serves as a reference for Markets when developing Employee Health Strategies.</p><p>See Nestl\u00e9's Salient Issue Action Plan: Safety and Health at Workfor more details.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is committed to fostering positive relations with workers, worker representative bodies and trade unions, and respects the right of employees to engage in union activities. At the global level, Nestl\u00e9 continues to engage with the International Union of Food, Agricultural, Hotel, Restaurant,</p><p>Catering, Tobacco and Allied Workers' Associations (IUF) through biannual meetings and working groups focused on specific topics such as health and safety, gender equality and non-discrimination.</p><p>In 2024, two meetings of the Nestl\u00e9 IUF working groups took place. The working group on Social Sustainability focused on topics such as the climate crisis, heat impacts and access to water for workers. The working group on Gender Equity discussed the Nestl\u00e9 Global Guidance for Menopause/Andropause at Work.</p><p>At regional and market levels, Nestl\u00e9 engages with works councils, such as the Nestl\u00e9 European Council for Information and Consultation (NECIC), labor federations, external experts and business organizations to find opportunities to continuously improve its labor practices. In 2023, upon the request of Nestl\u00e9 employees at the NECIC, Nestl\u00e9 engaged in a deep-dive discussion on employee health and well-being and presented global, European and select countries' health programs.</p><p>Supporting this approach, Nestl\u00e9 specifically monitors the number of formal agreements (bargaining agreements or other formal documents) with trade unions, with a reference to safety or health.</p><p>Furthermore, Nestl\u00e9 sites are certified to ISO 45001, which stipulates that worker representation is an integral part of Nestl\u00e9's management system, being audited externally by certification bodies.</p><p>Engaging with stakeholders in the value chain</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 values dialogue with stakeholders in its value chain, suppliers, business partners, workers and farmers in its supply chains and local communities, as well as its consumers. Nestl\u00e9 pays particular attention to individuals or groups who may be at greater risk due to their vulnerability or marginalization, such as migrant workers, children, women and girls, gender minorities, ethnic and racial groups and Indigenous Peoples and local communities.</p><p>Ratings</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 has received the following ratings for its stakeholder engagement:</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 has been consistently listed in the FTSE4Good Index since 2011 and was the first breast-milk substitute company to be included. It has maintained a strong standing in the Index, with an overall 2024 environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating of 4.4 out of 5.</p><p>* In 2024, Nestl\u00e9 was rated A by MSCI ESG Research for its performance on ESG issues.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 continues to be in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) leadership band for climate change. It scored a B for water security, an A- for palm oil and a B for other forest commodities.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 received a score of 22.7 and is rated as medium- risk on Sustainalytics' 2024 ESG Risk assessment. This score is Nestl\u00e9's best result in five years and reflects its commitment to the effective management of ESG risks.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 ranked 9th out of 30 global food and beverage manufacturers in the Access to Nutrition Initiative (ATNI) Global Index 2024 and has been recognized for reporting the nutritional value of its portfolio using the Health Star Rating (HSR).</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 ranks second in the 2023 Nature benchmark and the Food and Agriculture benchmark from the World Benchmarking Alliance.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 received the Reuters Responsible Business Awards 2023.

Avolta's Sustainability strategy is built around 4 focus areas - Create Sustainable Travel Experiences, Respect our Planet, Empower our People, and Engage Local Communities. Within the Respect our Planet focus area Avolta addresses climate change as critical matter and develops strategies and drives efforts to reduce carbon emissions, enhance energy efficiency, and adopt sustainable sourcing practices.</p><p>Avolta provides comprehensive updates on its sustainability initiatives, commitments and achievements in its Sustainability Report, which is an integrated part of the Company's Annual Report. The Sustainability Report highlights the Company's ongoing efforts to minimize its environmental footprint while delivering positive contributions for stakeholders.</p><p>To further enhance transparency and provide stakeholders with key insights to assess climate-related risks and opportunities (CRRO), Avolta began publishing in 2023 a report in accordance with TCFD (\"Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures\"). This report complements Avolta's Sustainability Report by detailing how the company assesses and responds to climate- related challenges.</p><p>The TCFD Report, together with the Sustainability Report (including the Sustainability Report 2024 Annex), form Avolta's 2024 Non-Financial Reporting, which has been prepared in accordance with the transparency requirements on non-financial matters outlined in Art. 964(a) et seqq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations, the Ordinance for Climate Disclosures and the DDTrO. The Sustainability report is included on pages 99 - 161 of the Annual Report 2024.</p><p>1. Governance</p><p>The following section provides an overview of Avolta's governance framework regarding sustainability matters as of December 31, 2024.</p><p>1.1 Board oversight of climate risks and opportunities</p><p>The Board of Directors is responsible for overseeing Avolta's Sustainability strategy and its effective imple- mentation, including climate-related initiatives.</p><p>Within the Board, the ESG Committee - chaired by the Lead Independent Director - drives the Company's sustainability agenda by approving the strategy and key initiatives, monitoring progress against targets, and evaluating sustainability impact. Its core responsibilities include assessing the Company's position across key sustainability dimensions (such as financial market performance, ratings, and sustainability indices), strengthening stakeholder engagement, and embedding sustainability principles into the Group's business model and culture. The ESG Committee meets as often as business requires - typically two to four times per year - with meetings lasting approximately one hour.</p><p>The Lead Independent Director plays a central role in overseeing the development and execution of Avolta's Sustainability strategy, ensuring alignment with business objectives. Working closely with the other members of the ESG Committee - whose members are experts in corporate citizenship, sustainability, and governance - the Lead Independent Director contributes to a compre- hensive, holistic approach to sustainability. Climate- related topics are a key focus of the committee's regular discussions, reflecting their relevance to the broader sustainability agenda.</p><p>The Board of Directors receives periodic non-financial updates at least quarterly, covering progress on Sustainability strategy implementation and climate-related projects and initiatives.</p><p>1.2 Management's role</p><p>The Chief Public Affairs &amp; ESG Officer, reporting to the Group CEO, represents sustainability at the Global Executive Committee level and leads the execution of Avolta's Sustainability strategy at the operational level.

Strategy</p><p>2.1 Avolta's climate strategy</p><p>As a key player in the travel experience industry, Avolta recognizes that addressing climate change is not only a moral obligation but also a business imperative to ensure long-term resilience. Given the unique nature of the travel retail and F&amp;B industry, Avolta actively works to reduce its own footprint while closely collaborating with third parties - particularly, concession partners, brand suppliers and logistics providers - to mitigate the broader environmental impacts of its business.</p><p>Avolta's Sustainability strategy covers the different aspects of environmental sustainability, including climate-related risks and opportunities, which are managed by the Global Sustainability team in collaboration with the Global ERM team and other specific departments and functions. This TCFD Report provides an update on the progress achieved to date.</p><p>Avolta has implemented an Environmental Management System (EMS) to systematically assess its environmental impact, set clear goals, and implement target actions to reduce its footprint as well as to prevent or mitigate climate related risks. However, as most shops and restaurants operate in third-party owned premises - such as airports, train stations, and cruise ships - Avolta has limited control over key operational factors, which are typically determined by concession partners. Where it holds greater influence, Avolta introduced energy-saving initiatives and sustainable retail and F&amp;B options. In areas with less direct control, Avolta fosters collaboration with stakeholders - airports, suppliers, and vendors - to assess environmental impacts and explore ways to minimize or offset them. Complementing the EMS, Avolta's Environmental Management Guidelines outline key principles for addressing climate change, improving resource efficiency, and designing sustainable stores.</p><p>Avolta has developed a dedicated Shop and Restaurant Design Strategy to create sustainable shops and restaurants by reducing energy consumption, incorporating recyclable materials and applying circular economy principles in refurbishments. Avolta aligns with principles established by leading green-building certification systems, such as the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED). For more details on the Avolta's Environmental Management Guidelines and additional</p><p>information, please refer \"Respect our Planet\" section on page 130 of the Sustainability Report 2024.</p><p>Amongst other sustainability initiatives, the Company established an emission reduction strategy for Scope 1 and 2 emissions until 2025 (based on the Dufry retail business scope 2022 with 2019 base data), which follows the 1.5\u00b0C pathway.</p><p>For Scope 3 emissions, the Company (based on the Dufry retail business scope 2022 and the 2019 base data) follows SBTi's \"well below 2\u00b0C pathway\" with two separate objectives.</p><p>2.2 Climate related risks and opportunities</p><p>Climate change is expected to impact Avolta's business in the short, medium and long-term. Physical risks, such as extreme nature-related events, could affect Avolta's business operations and supply chain. In the F&amp;B sector, physical risks could also disrupt agricultural output, potentially reducing crop yields and livestock production.</p><p>Avolta also faces transition risks as the global economy moves toward a low-carbon future, driven by stringent environmental regulations, carbon taxes, and rising energy costs, including aviation fuel and gasoline prices. Greater regulatory requirements and higher fuel prices may raise operating expenses, influence pricing, and ultimately impact consumer travel demand. In the F&amp;B segment, evolving customer preferences may require adjustments in product offerings. Despite these chal- lenges, climate change may also present opportunities for Avolta.</p><p>Avolta can enhance its reputation among key stakeholders and gain a competitive edge by developing a distinctive decarbonization strategy. Additionally, incorporating sustainable, plant-based, and ethically sourced products can boost sales, strengthen brand loyalty, and align with evolving consumer preferences. Integrating locally sourced, organic, and regenerative agriculture- based products can also reduce supply chain risks from extreme weather and promote greater operational resil- ience.</p><p>The following table outlines the main climate-related risks and opportunities identified and assessed by the Company to date that may affect Avolta's business and operations.</p><p>4/12</p><p>TCFD Report 2024</p><p>Avolta Annual Report 2024</p><p>[[Type  Risk?/?opportunity factors  Potential impact</p><p>]]</p><p>Avolta's response</p><p>Transition Risks - Regulations on CO2 taxation</p><p>(Policy?&amp;?Legal) for flights, cruise ships, automobiles, and others, causing prices increases and leading to a reduction in passenger traffic.</p><p>* Environmental legislation and requirements related to energy consumption, transportation, packaging materials (e.g., plastic tax) affecting both the Company's operations and the supply chain.</p><p>* Regulations on CO2 taxation for direct emissions from carbon intensive agriculture, such as livestock farming.</p><p>* A reduction in passenger traffic could adversely affect Avolta's sales.</p><p>* Environmental legislation may result in increased compliance, energy and transportation costs and influence business processes through regulations on the use of packaging materials (e.g. single-use plastics).</p><p>* CO2 taxation on carbon- intensive agriculture may impact procurement and increase raw material costs.</p><p>* Business diversification has always been and will continue to be a key strategic element to mitigate risks and drive Company growth.</p><p>* Diversification across geography, sectors, suppliers and channels to mitigate the impact of regional or local regulations on the business (see sales splits on pages 8 - 9 of the Annual Report 2024).</p><p>* Continuous monitoring of sustainability-related regulations by the Global Sustainability team, which proactively alerts and coordinates with impacted functions to support timely compliance and adaptation.</p><p>* Collaboration with industry associations (e.g. ACI, ETRC) airport authorities and other concession partners to develop common solutions to regulatory challenges within the industry.</p><p>* Emission reduction plan in place for Scope 1 and 2 emissions within retail operations.</p><p>* Transition to bio-based fuels for maritime and ground transportation to cut emission in upstream logistic and distribution.</p><p>* Enhancing technical monitoring and management capabilities to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate climate-related risks impacting the business.</p><p>* Engagement with suppliers and vendors to reduce carbon emission along the value chain.</p><p>* Dedicated Shop and Restaurant Design Strategy focused on green building practices, including energy efficiency measures, the use of recyclable materials, and the application of circular economy principles in new construction and refurbishments.

While this work is still ongoing, we are including in this report some of our findings to date.</p><p>Avolta has evaluated the most relevant climate scenarios for its business. Within the travel retail and F&amp;B indus- tries, there is increasing alignment around the suitability of scenarios developed by the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to illustrate different future pathways.</p><p>Although originally designed for central banks and regu- lators, the NGFS framework is widely recognized as a valuable reference for businesses. As part of this anal- ysis, Avolta has begun examining its key risks through the lens of three NGFS reference scenarios: Orderly Transi- tion, Disorderly Transition, and Hot House World.</p><p>The Orderly Transition scenario assumes that climate policies are introduced early and become progressively more stringent. This leads to a gradual and predictable transition to a low-carbon economy. Both physical and transition risks remain relatively low. This scenario projects an increase in global warming ranging between 1.4\u00b0C and 1.7\u00b0C. Overall, in this scenario, a travel retail and F&amp;B firm would be able to plan and adapt to the changing market and regulatory environment in a structured manner, enabling a smoother shift to sustainable practices and aligning its business model with the goals of a low-carbon economy.</p><p>The Disorderly Transition assumes no additional climate policies are implemented until 2030. This scenario envisions a situation where climate action is delayed and then suddenly accelerated. In this scenario, the delay in taking action leads to a more abrupt and disruptive transition later on and to an increase of the planet's temperature above 1.7\u00b0C.</p><p>Overall, a disorderly transition to a low-carbon economy would require swift and significant adaptations from travel retail and F&amp;B firms. While presenting certain risks and challenges, it could also create new opportunities for innovation and sustainability-focused business models.</p><p>The Hot House World scenario assumes that some climate policies are implemented in certain jurisdictions, but global efforts fail to halt significant global warming. Critical temperature thresholds are exceeded, ranging from 2.3\u00b0C to 3.0\u00b0C leading to severe physical risks and irreversible impacts such as sea-level rise.</p><p>Travel retail and F&amp;B firms, like many other businesses, would need to adapt and innovate to navigate these chal- lenges, potentially reshaping their business models, supply chains, and product offerings to remain viable in a drastically changed environment.</p><p>While each of the three climate scenarios - Orderly Tran- sition, Disorderly Transition, and Hot House World - is possible, the extent to which any of them will materialize remains uncertain. For Avolta, it is key to take specific measures to enhance business' resilience and prepare for the future.</p><p>7/12</p><p>TCFD Report 2024</p><p>Avolta Annual Report 2024</p><p>[[Area of business</p><p>potentially affected  Orderly Transition</p><p>Own Operations        A focus on energy efficiency would</p><p>become increasingly important.

Risk Management</p><p>3.1 Organizational processes for identification and management of CRRO</p><p>Avolta's risk management processes identify and address risks across various levels of the organization, with responsibilities distributed among different functions and countries. The risk assessment process integrates both bottom-up and top-down methodologies, leveraging local-level inputs while consolidating insights at the global level. Risk identification follows a structured, questionnaire-based approach, gathering insights from stakeholders across different regions. Risks are classified into key categories, with sustainability serving as a key pillar of Avolta's risk management framework. This includes the management of climate-related risks and opportunities, supporting a proactive response to sustainability challenges. Each risk is evaluated based on a combination of quantitative (financial impact) and qualitative (strategic, reputational) criteria, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of potential threats and opportunities. The process prioritizes material sustainability and climate-related risks, helping maintain alignment with evolving regulations and corporate sustainability goals.</p><p>To support this approach, the Company utilizes the Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) software, an enterprise risk management tool that enables the comprehensive identification and mitigation of potential business risks.</p><p>2.4 Plans to expand scenario analyses</p><p>To enhance climate scenario analysis and develop effective management and resilience measures, Avolta's Sustainability, Risk, and Strategy departments are actively collaborating. These discussions have gained increasing significance following the 2023 business combination of Dufry and Autogrill, requiring updates to the Company's strategy and related initiatives.</p><p>In response to these developments, Avolta plans to refine its approach and provide deeper and more detailed insights in the 2025 TCFD Report, with a focus on expanding scenario analysis, the assessment of climate change's financial impact and the definition of preven-</p><p>3.2 Integration in the organization's overall risk management</p><p>Avolta's overall risk management model is structured around three key pillars:</p><p>1.

Governance and Risk Oversight:Various governance functions across the organization - including Compli- ance, Legal, Finance, Sustainability and Human Resources - are responsible for monitoring. These departments establish controls, enforce policies, and</p><p>9/12</p><p>TCFD Report 2024</p><p>Avolta Annual Report 2024</p><p>oversee compliance with regulatory and internal stan- dards.</p><p>3. Assurance and Independent Valuation: The Internal Audit department provides independent and objec- tive monitoring and consulting services designed to add value and improve Avolta's operations. This func- tion covers all subsidiaries and applies a systematic and disciplined approach to evaluate and improve the effectiveness of governance processes as well as risk management and control, including assessing risk exposure, control effectiveness, and fraud prevention measures across the organizations.</p><p>The main risks identified during internal audits are reported to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors.

For the \"market-based\" calculation, the residual mix factors published bu the Association of Issuing Bodies (AIB) were used, where available. When unavailable, the average emission factors IEA 2024 was used, trade- adjusted for OECD countries. To obtain the total market-based scope 2 emis- sons, the contribution of RECs (calculated with the location-based approach) were subtracted from the locations that had acquired the certification (REC). The total \"location-based\" scope 2 emissions, on the other hand, amounts to 158,215 tCO2e.\"</p><p>10/12</p><p>* Original document</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>Avolta Ltd. published this content on March 12, 2025, and is solely responsible for the information contained therein.

The Global Alliance, one of the hallmarks of the Brazil's G20 presidency, aims to quickly channel resources towards effective programs that reduce poverty and hunger - two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are currently offtrack. As part of its membership, The Rockefeller Foundation is committing its financial and knowledge support to member countries in their expansion of school meal programs - one of the most beneficial investments countries can make to achieve SDG 1 and 2.</p><p>\"When I say that, I get emotional, because hunger is not a natural thing. Hunger is something that requires political decision. We leaders cannot look only - and all the time - at those who are close to us. We need to be able to take an X-ray and look at those who are far away, those who cannot get close to palaces, those who cannot get close to ministers,\" said Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty and President of Brazil, in a speech at the pre-launch of the Global Alliance in July .</p><p>\"Programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, Food Acquisition and School Meals allow healthy meals to reach the most vulnerable, encourage agricultural production and promote local development. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was born out of this political will and spirit of solidarity. It will be the most important legacy of Brazil's G20 presidency,\" President Lula da Silva said in his speech.</p><p>School meal programs make a critical impact on the educational outcomes and quality of life for vulnerable children around the world, especially for girls. The World Food Program indicates that school feeding programs can increase enrolment by an average of nine percent while decreasing dropout rates and significantly increasing children's attendance. Research also shows (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wfp.org/publications/state-school-feeding-worldwide-2022\">https://www.wfp.org/publications/state-school-feeding-worldwide-2022</url>) that school feeding programs can have beneficial effects on agriculture, education, health and nutrition, and social protection, with US$ 9 in returns for every US$ 1 invested. As the most extensive social safety net globally, benefiting 418 million children in 2022, school meal programs feed 20 percent of the population one meal per day, and can also be a powerful demand driver for climate-resilient, regeneratively produced agriculture.</p><p>\"Everyone deserves access to healthy food and economic opportunity. That's why we invite other institutions to join The Rockefeller Foundation in supporting the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty,\" said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. \"As part of the Alliance, we hope to help countries expand their school meal programs, which can help improve nutrition for millions of children while driving demand for more locally grown, regenerative agriculture,\" said The Rockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah.</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation is comitted to supporting a healthier way to produce, purchase, and consume what it calls \"good food\" that is accessible by all and good for the planet. Since 2021 it has focused on generating support and building momentum for expanding climate-resilient school meal programs, alongside the World Food Program, The School Meals Coalition and other partners. The Rockefeller Foundation is working to support countries to improve their school meal programs to achieve climate impacts. Working with producers, corporations, investors, philanthropy and governments, The Rockefeller Foundation aims to align incentives and investment opportunities that support farmers in underserved markets through their regenerative transitions.</p><p>The Permanent Representative of Brazil to FAO, IFAD and WFP, Ambassador Carla Barroso Carneiro, on behalf of the Brazilian Government, expressed her gratitude to The Rockefeller Foundation for its commitment to the Global Alliance.</p><p>\"The Rockefeller Foundation's leadership in advancing sustainable solutions for vulnerable populations, especially in the realm of nutritious school meals, strengthens Brazil's efforts to fight these global challenges and to ensure that effective, long-term, evidence-based solutions reach those most in need,\" said Carla Barroso Carneiro, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Brazil to the UN Rome Based Agencies.</p><p>As part of the Global Alliance, The Rockefeller Foundation expects to provide financial resources, technical assistance, capacity building support, as well as knowledge and data with member countries that are implementing school meal programs. In partnership with others, The Rockefeller Foundation will also work towards supporting large scale, country-owned implementation of policies and programs.</p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organization states, \"FAO is pleased to welcome The Rockefeller Foundation as the first philanthropic entity to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. The Rockefeller Foundation support for climate-resilient regenerative school meals through the Global Alliance will increase the implementation of this policy instrument at scale, directly reducing hunger and malnutrition while promoting the transformation of agrifood systems, building resilience to climate change and strengthening smallholder family farmers. FAO is keen to work with Brazil, The Rockefeller Foundation and all other members of the Alliance to end poverty and achieve Zero Hunger.\"</p><p>Open to all interested stakeholders, the Global Alliance will strive to generate collective action and mobilize resources to eradicate hunger and poverty, aligning efforts and financing from both public and private sources.</p><p>About The Rockefeller Foundation:</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation is a pioneering philanthropy built on collaborative partnerships at the frontiers of science, technology, and innovation that enable individuals, families, and communities to flourish.

Organic growth was 2.2%, with a return to positive real internal growth of 0.8%, and both strengthened in the second half. Free cash flow improved to CHF 10.7 billion, and the Board proposes an increase in the dividend per share to CHF 3.05.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have a clear roadmap to accelerate performance and transform for the future. Increasing investment to drive growth is central to our plan. This means delivering superior product taste and quality with unbeatable value, scaling our winning platforms and brands, accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets' and addressing underperformers. We are creating the fuel for these growth investments through our new CHF 2.5 billion three-year cost savings program. We are making good progress and have already secured over CHF 300 million of these savings for 2025.</p><p>From 2025, we expect our actions to drive an improvement in organic sales growth, with a lower underlying trading operating profit margin in the short term as we invest for growth.

This return to positive RIG came despite soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions, as well as actions taken to reduce customer inventory. Organic growth was 2.1% in the first half (H1) and 2.3% in the second half (H2), with RIG of 0.1% in H1, improving to 1.4% in H2.</p><p>Organic growth of 2.2% was impacted by a slowdown in category growth and our own below-market development. We have a clear focus on accelerating category growth and improving our market share performance in 2025 and over the medium term. An important part of how we deliver this is focusing our resource allocation behind our strongest growth drivers: scaling existing winning platforms and brands; accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets'; and building new growth engines that capture emerging consumer trends.</p><p>On market share performance, in 2024 we gained or held share in approximately half of our business cells by number, but in less than half of our business cells by sales value. The majority of the Group's market share loss is driven by 18 key underperforming business cells, which together account for approximately 21% of Group sales. We are executing our action plans at pace for each cell and are seeing some early signs of improvement.</p><p>A key element of improving our performance is strengthening our value propositions to consumers and customers. We are increasing investment to deliver superior product taste and quality, unbeatable value, unmissable visibility and compelling brand communication. Price competitiveness is a priority in the context of the high inflationary environment for certain commodities, most notably coffee and cocoa. We are taking an agile approach to passing on input cost increases, selectively investing in price as we focus on restoring competitiveness. To strengthen brand communication, we are stepping up investment and improving efficiency and effectiveness. Advertising and marketing spend as a percentage of sales fell from 9.0% in 2019 to a low of 6.6% in H2-2022; in 2024, this recovered to 8.1% and is planned to increase further to 9% by the end of 2025.</p><p>Efficiency and productivity</p><p>At our Capital Markets Day in November 2024, we announced a new three-year cost reduction program we have called Fuel for Growth, which is in addition to existing cost efficiency initiatives. We target CHF 2.5 billion run-rate cost savings from the new program by the end of 2027, and these savings will be used to fund increased investment in growth.</p><p>The Fuel for Growth program is expected to drive in-year savings of CHF 0.7 billion in 2025, CHF 1.4 billion in 2026 and CHF 2.3 billion in 2027. By the end of 2027, we expect to have reached the full run-rate savings of CHF 2.5 billion. In 2025, CHF 300 million of the savings impact this year only, with the further CHF 400 million being recurring savings that reduce the cost base on an ongoing basis. Over CHF 300 million of the expected CHF 0.7 billion cost savings for 2025 have already been secured.</p><p>Approximately three-quarters of the total savings in Fuel for Growth will come in procurement, with the remainder coming from operational efficiencies and commercial investments. Within procurement, the most significant savings will come from AI-powered procurement and supplier management, spend consolidation and aggregation, and e-sourcing expansion and automation. Within operational efficiencies and commercial investments, key initiatives include reviewing operating models as well as opportunities in manufacturing and logistics. The savings in procurement and commercial investments are expected to have limited costs to achieve; operational efficiencies will typically incur one-off costs of approximately 2 times the annual savings.</p><p>These Fuel for Growth savings are in addition to over CHF 1 billion per annum of ongoing efficiencies from existing Nestl\u00e9 Continuous Excellence initiatives.</p><p>Expected phasing of Fuel for Growth cost savings program: </p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">In CHF billion                  2025 2026 2027 <br/><br/> 2025 non-recurring              0.3          <br/><br/> 2025 recurring savings          0.4  0.4  0.4  <br/><br/> 2026 recurring savings              1.0  1.0  <br/><br/> 2027 recurring savings                  0.9  <br/><br/> Total in-year savings           0.7  1.4  2.3  <br/><br/> Run-rate savings at end of 2027         2.5  <br/><br/></pre></p><p>Strengthening foundations</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's success depends on alignment and in-market execution, and people are critical to that. 2024 was an important year of change in our leadership. Our new leadership team moved quickly to align and refocus the organization. We have simplified the Group's structure and reorganized Nestl\u00e9 Waters and premium beverages into a global, standalone business. This is complemented by the introduction of a more aligned performance management framework - our 'Operational Master Plan' - to increase Group-wide performance and drive pace of execution across the organization. We have also accelerated our digital transformation as we move to becoming a real-time, end-to-end connected enterprise, powered by data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Operating sustainably is an important foundation for Nestl\u00e9, and we made progress across multiple areas. In particular, we delivered our 2025 greenhouse gas emission reduction target one year ahead of plan and made strong progress with our regenerative agriculture agenda.</p><p>Guidance</p><p>Our 2025 guidance is in line with the outlook we provided at the Capital Markets Day, with accelerated delivery of cost efficiencies offsetting recent increases in key commodity prices, especially in coffee and cocoa. In 2025, organic sales growth is expected to improve compared to 2024, strengthening through the year as we continue to deliver on our growth plans. UTOP margin is expected to be at or above 16.0% as we invest for growth. Guidance assumes no significant change in key macroeconomic variables.</p><p>Our objective remains to deliver superior, sustainable and profitable growth. In the medium term, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be at 4% plus in a normal operating environment, with an underlying operating profit margin at 17.0% plus.</p><p>Financial review</p><p>Sales</p><p>Total reported sales decreased by 1.8% to CHF 91.4 billion, including negative impacts of 3.7% from foreign exchange movements and 0.3% from net divestitures. Organic growth was 2.2%. Pricing was 1.5%, reflecting a reduction in inflation across most categories after two years of high input cost and price increases. RIG returned to positive growth at 0.8% and was still impacted by soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands in certain markets. Additionally, actions taken to reduce customer inventory in the second half of the year reduced full-year RIG by approximately 20 basis points.</p><p>By geography, organic growth was driven by emerging markets and Europe, which together more than offset a decrease in North America. In developed markets, organic growth was 1.2%, with positive pricing and RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 3.7%, led by pricing with positive RIG.</p><p>Organic growth by product category was as follows:</p><p>* Coffee was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth, supported by the three leading coffee brands: Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and Starbucks.</p><p>* Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by KitKat and key local brands.</p><p>* PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for science-based premium brands Purina ProPlan, Purina ONE and Friskies.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 Health Science achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second half of the year.</p><p>* Water reported low single-digit growth, with solid growth for S.Pellegrino and supported by the successful launch of Maison Perrier.</p><p>* Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, supported by continued momentum for NAN and Lactogen.</p><p>* Dairy posted negative growth, as a decline in coffee creamers and ambient dairy more than offset growth for affordable milks and dairy culinary solutions.</p><p>* Culinary reported negative growth, with mid single-digit growth in Maggi more than offset by a decline in frozen food in North America.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 2.1%. Organic growth of out-of-home channels was 3.2%. E-commerce sales grew organically by 11.3%, reaching 18.9% of total Group sales.</p><p>Gross profit and operating profit</p><p>Gross profit was flat at CHF 42.7 billion, and the gross profit margin increased by 80 bps to 46.7%. The gross profit margin reached 47.2% in H1, then declined 90 bps sequentially to 46.3% in H2, driven by higher input costs in coffee and cocoa.</p><p>Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 8.3%. Marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 90 bps to 19.8%. This comprised: advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales up 40 bps to 8.1%, as we began to step up investment; and administration expenses as a percentage of sales up 50 bps to 11.7% of sales, largely reflecting higher labor costs, the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and one-off items. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 1.8%.</p><p>Underlying trading operating profit was CHF 15.7 billion, a decrease of 2.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1.3% in constant currency. The underlying trading operating profit margin was 17.2%, a decrease of 10 bps on a reported basis and flat in constant currency.</p><p>Restructuring and net other trading items was CHF 1.1 billion compared with CHF 1.5 billion in the prior year, with the reduction mainly due to lower restructuring costs. Trading operating profit increased by 0.8% to CHF 14.6 billion. The trading operating profit margin reached 16.0%, an increase of 40 bps on a reported basis and 50 bps in constant currency. </p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">As % of sales               2024    2023   Reported change  Constant currency   <br/>                                                                   change        <br/><br/> Sales                      100.0%  100.0%         -                            <br/><br/> Cost of goods sold         -53.3%  -54.1%      80bps                          <br/><br/> Gross profit margin         46.7%   45.9%      80bps                          <br/><br/> Other revenue               0.4%    0.4%        0bps                          <br/><br/> Distribution expenses      -8.3%  -8.3%       0bps                          <br/><br/> Marketing and              -19.8% -18.9%    -90bps                         <br/> administration expenses                                                         <br/><br/> Research and development   -1.8%  -1.8%       0bps                          <br/> costs                                                                           <br/><br/> Underlying trading          17.2%   17.3%      -10bps            0bps         <br/> operating profit margin                                                         <br/><br/> Other trading income        0.1%    0.1%        0bps                          <br/><br/> Other trading expenses      -1.3%   -1.8%      50bps                          <br/><br/> Trading operating profit    16.0%   15.6%      40 bps             50 bps        <br/> margin                                                                          <br/><br/> Other operating income      0.5%    0.3%       20 bps                          <br/><br/> Other operating expenses    -0.4%   -0.8%      40bps                          <br/><br/> Operating profit margin     16.1%   15.1%      100bps                         <br/><br/></pre></p><p>Net financial expenses and income tax</p><p>Net financial expenses increased to CHF 1.5 billion from CHF 1.4 billion, reflecting a higher level of average net debt and an increase in interest rates. The average cost of net debt was 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2023.</p><p>The Group reported tax rate was 25.0%, compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to a write-off in deferred tax assets from changes in utilization projections and the absence of the favorable one-off items that positively impacted 2023. The underlying tax rate increased by 70 basis points to 21.9%, driven by higher corporate and withholding tax rates in some jurisdictions, as well as changes in the geographical and business mix of profits.</p><p>Net profit and earnings per share</p><p>Net profit decreased by 2.9% to CHF 10.9 billion. Basic earnings per share decreased by 1.0% to CHF 4.19, reflecting the movement in net profit and the impact of the share buyback program.</p><p>Underlying net profit was CHF 12.4 billion, a decrease of 2.6%, and an increase of 0.6% in constant currency. Underlying earnings per share was CHF 4.77, a decrease of 0.8%, and an increase of 2.5% in constant currency. The share buyback program contributed 1.1% to the underlying earnings per share change, net of finance costs.</p><p>Cash flow</p><p>Cash generated from operations increased to CHF 19.6 billion from CHF 19.2 billion in 2023. Free cash flow was CHF 10.7 billion compared to the prior year free cash flow of CHF 10.4 billion, which included CHF 0.6 billion proceeds from the disposal of a financial asset, with the increase primarily due to lower taxes paid and lower cash restructuring costs, as well as reduced capital expenditure.</p><p>Dividend</p><p>At the Annual General Meeting on April 16, 2025, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 3.05 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. Nestl\u00e9 has maintained or increased the dividend in Swiss francs over the last 65 years. We remain committed to the long-held practice of increasing the dividend in Swiss francs every year.</p><p>The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 17, 2025. The net dividend will be payable as from April 24, 2025. Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on April 9, 2025, at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights.</p><p>Share buyback program</p><p>In 2024, the Group repurchased 48.2 million Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares for CHF 4.4 billion under the CHF 20.0 billion share buyback program that began in January 2022 and was completed as planned in December 2024. Under the program, 187.4 million shares were repurchased in the three-year period, of which 143.9 million have so far been cancelled. At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose the cancellation of the remaining 43.5 million repurchased shares, reducing the share capital of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. from CHF 262,000,000 to CHF 257,652,000. We do not currently anticipate initiating a new share buyback program in 2025.</p><p>Net debt</p><p>Net debt was CHF 56.0 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared to CHF 49.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase largely reflected cash outflows for the dividend payment of CHF 7.8 billion and share buybacks of CHF 4.5 billion as well as the impact of foreign exchange movements. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.90 times at December 31, 2024, compared to 2.54 times at December 31, 2023. This is towards the top of our target range of 2 to 3 times for net debt to Adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Return on invested capital</p><p>Return on invested capital was 14.1%, compared to 13.9% in 2023. This improvement reflects a lower base of average invested capital, mainly linked to working capital, and a reduction in restructuring costs.</p><p>Minority participations</p><p>In late 2024, we established Nestl\u00e9 Equity Holdings to consolidate ownership of many of our minority participations, enhancing governance and allowing for a more consistent and efficient approach to managing these interests.</p><p>Operating segment review </p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">             Total   Zone    Zone    Zone    Zone    Zone    Nestl\u00e9              Other    <br/>               Group   North  Europe    AOA    Latin  Greater  Health  Nespresso Businesses <br/>                      America                 America  China  Science                       <br/><br/> Sales                                                                                      <br/> FY-2024(CHF 91,354  25,336  18,910  16,793  11,933   4,973   6,739     6,378      292     <br/> m)                                                                                         <br/><br/> Sales                                                                                      <br/> FY-2023(CHF 92,998  25,995  19,098  17,519  12,196   5,037   6,498     6,372      283     <br/> m)                                                                                         <br/><br/> Real                                                                                       <br/> internal      0.8%    -0.8%   0.8%    0.6%   -0.3%   4.3%     5.5%     1.6%       5.3%    <br/> growth (RIG)                                                                               <br/><br/> Pricing       1.5%    0.4%    2.5%    2.8%    2.7%   -2.1%    0.7%     0.6%       1.3%    <br/><br/> Organic       2.2%   -0.5%   3.3%    3.4%    2.5%    2.1%     6.2%     2.2%       6.6%    <br/> growth                                                                                     <br/><br/> Net M&amp;A      -0.3%  -0.1%  -1.9%   0.0%    0.4%    0.1%     0.2%     0.2%       0.0%    <br/><br/> Foreign      -3.7%  -2.0%  -2.5%  -7.5%  -4.9%  -3.5%   -2.8%   -2.4%     -2.7%   <br/> exchange                                                                                   <br/><br/> Reported     -1.8%  -2.5%  -1.0%  -4.1%  -2.2%  -1.3%    3.7%     0.1%       3.9%    <br/> sales growth                                                                               <br/><br/> UTOP FY-2024 15,704   5,640   3,192   3,916   2,429    803     943      1,278      -13    <br/> (CHF m)                                                                                    <br/><br/> UTOP FY-2023 16,053   5,768   3,127   4,109   2,520    832     777      1,291      -12     <br/> (CHF m)                                                                                    <br/><br/> UTOP Margin   17.2%   22.3%   16.9%   23.3%   20.4%   16.1%   14.0%     20.0%     -4.3%   <br/> FY-2024                                                                                    <br/><br/> UTOP Margin   17.3%   22.2%   16.4%   23.5%   20.7%   16.5%   12.0%     20.3%     -4.3%   <br/> FY-2023                                                                                    <br/><br/> UTOP Margin  -10bps +10bps +50bps -20bps -30bps -40bps +200bps  -30bps     Flat    <br/> YoY                                                                                        <br/><br/></pre></p><p>Zone North America</p><p>Our growth in North America in 2024 was disappointing. Organic sales growth of -0.5% reflects mixed delivery across the portfolio, in the context of a challenging consumer environment. We delivered RIG-led positive organic growth in approximately two-thirds of the business by sales. This was offset by weak performance in frozen food and coffee creamers. Turnaround plans are underway in both businesses. In Zone North America, UTOP margin increased modestly, which was the result of an improvement in gross profit margin and a step-up in growth investments.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was -0.5%, with -0.8% RIG and 0.4% pricing. Pricing was negative in H2, driven by competitive dynamics in PetCare and price adjustments in frozen food and coffee creamers.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 2.5% to CHF 25.3 billion, including a -2.0% impact from foreign exchange movements and -0.1% from net divestitures.</p><p>* Market share gains were achieved in coffee, while we lost market share in frozen pizza and coffee creamers.</p><p>* UTOP margin increased by 10 bps to 22.3%. Gross profit margin expanded, supported by pricing, price pack architecture and mix management, and structural cost control was strong. Advertising and marketing investment was increased significantly to support future growth.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers by product category</p><p>* PetCare was the largest growth contributor, with low single-digit growth driven by premium brands, particularly in the cat and therapeutic diets segments.</p><p>* Confectionery grew at a double-digit pace, driven by Tollhouse baking products and pricing actions particularly in the second half of the year.</p><p>* Beverages (including coffee and coffee creamers) delivered positive growth overall, with new product launches supporting continued strong momentum for Nescaf\u00e9 and Starbucks, offsetting a decrease in Coffee mate.</p><p>* Infant Nutrition saw a sales decrease, with a decline in Gerber in the context of a category slowdown in baby food.</p><p>* Frozen food posted negative growth, primarily reflecting the impact of price competition in pizza and the winding down of the frozen meals business in Canada.</p><p>Zone Europe</p><p>In Zone Europe, our sales growth was broad-based, with improved market share trends in a number of categories. Growth was mainly pricing led, reflecting the inflationary environment for coffee and confectionery, supported by positive RIG in coffee and PetCare. Growth was impacted by temporary delistings in the third quarter, but recovered in the fourth quarter, driven by coffee and confectionery. UTOP margin increased, with improved gross profit margin and portfolio optimization helping fund the step-up in growth investment.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 3.3%, comprising 0.8% RIG and 2.5% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 1.0% to CHF 18.9 billion, including -2.5% impact from foreign exchange movements and -1.9% from net divestitures.</p><p>* Market share gains were achieved in coffee and PetCare, with losses in confectionery and water.</p><p>* UTOP margin increased by 50 basis points to 16.9%, driven by strong gross profit margin improvement and supported by portfolio optimization.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers by product category</p><p>* Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\u00e9 soluble coffee and Starbucks products.</p><p>* Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and key local brands.</p><p>* PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, led by Purina ONE, Gourmet and ProPlan.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 Professional achieved mid single-digit growth, driven by beverage solutions.</p><p>* Water saw low single-digit growth, impacted by supply constraints in the second half of the year.</p><p>* Infant Nutrition posted negative growth, reflecting a category slowdown.</p><p>Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa</p><p>We achieved solid organic sales growth in Zone AOA, with most categories and regions reporting positive RIG. We improved market share trends, particularly for key global brands like KitKat, reignited growth momentum in PetCare and significantly stepped up e-commerce growth. Several macroeconomic headwinds weighed on growth, with consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions persisting throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we took action to reduce customer inventories in our infant nutrition and dairy categories. For the year, UTOP margin declined, driven by increased investment in advertising and marketing.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 3.4%, with 0.6% RIG and 2.8% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 4.1% to CHF 16.8 billion, strongly impacted by foreign exchange movements, which reduced sales by 7.5%.</p><p>* Key markets driving growth were Central and West Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and the Philippines.</p><p>* Key market share developments were gains in PetCare and losses in dairy and culinary.</p><p>* UTOP margin decreased by 20 basis points to 23.3%, driven by increased investment in advertising and marketing.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers by product category</p><p>* Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\u00e9 soluble and ready-to-drink offerings.</p><p>* Culinary delivered high single-digit growth fueled by strong sales momentum for Maggi.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 Professional achieved high single-digit growth, with strong contributions from most geographies and categories.</p><p>* Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and supported by new product launches.</p><p>* PetCare achieved high single-digit growth, led by key brands Felix and Purina ONE.</p><p>* Infant Nutrition posted low single-digit growth following actions to reduce customer inventories.</p><p>* Dairy saw a sales decline, impacted by the introduction of a sales tax in Pakistan as well as actions to reduce customer inventories and reshape the portfolio.</p><p>Zone Latin America</p><p>Sales growth in Zone Latin America was pricing-led growth, with RIG declining slightly. During the year, consumer demand softened and financial pressure on customers increased in several markets due to higher borrowing costs. These headwinds led to actions to reduce customer inventories, which weighed on RIG in Q3. Improved growth in Q4 was driven by confectionery and coffee, with new price increase measures being taken in both categories. UTOP margin for the year declined due to increased investments in growth as well as higher costs linked to the acquisition of the Grupo CRM confectionery business.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 2.5%, with -0.3% RIG and 2.7% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 2.2% to CHF 11.9 billion, with a negative impact of 4.9% from foreign exchange movements.</p><p>* Key markets driving growth were Brazil and Mexico; weaker performance in smaller markets such as Peru and Colombia.</p><p>* Market share developments included gains in portioned coffee and culinary, with losses in dairy and soluble coffee.</p><p>* UTOP margin decreased by 30 basis points to 20.4%. The reduction follows increased advertising and marketing investments.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers by product category</p><p>* Confectionery delivered high single-digit growth, driven by key local brands, particularly Garoto, and supported by new product launches in chocobakery.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 Professional grew at a double-digit pace, underpinned by customer acquisition.</p><p>* Coffee saw mid single-digit growth, led by Nescaf\u00e9, with strong growth for Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce Gusto.</p><p>* Culinary reported low single-digit growth supported by strong sales momentum for Maggi.</p><p>* PetCare posted flat growth, supported by Felix and Friskies.</p><p>* Infant Nutrition and dairy reported sales declines as robust demand for NAN infant formula was more than offset by a sales decline in Nido.</p><p>Zone Greater China</p><p>In Zone Greater China, growth was underpinned by positive RIG delivery in every quarter despite soft consumer demand and intense price competition in several categories. This performance was achieved by driving faster innovation in key categories and adapting route-to-market and channel strategies to capture new growth opportunities. The decline in UTOP margin reflects increased commodity costs and higher growth investments.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 2.1%, with 4.3% RIG and -2.1% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 1.3% to CHF 5.0 billion, as foreign exchange reduced sales by 3.5%.</p><p>* Market share developments included gains in Infant Nutrition and confectionery, with losses in culinary and dairy.</p><p>* UTOP margin decreased by 40 basis points to 16.1%, reflecting higher input costs and increased advertising and marketing investments.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers by product category</p><p>* Infant Nutrition was the largest contributor to organic growth, with high single-digit growth, driven by NAN and supported by improved sales momentum for illuma.</p><p>* Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by distribution expansion and new innovations, particularly in Nescaf\u00e9 ready-to-drink offerings.</p><p>* Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, with solid growth for Hsu Fu Chi and Shark Wafer, supported by new product launches and e-commerce growth.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 Professional delivered low single-digit growth in challenging market conditions, while culinary and dairy-related categories reported negative growth.</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science delivered a significant step-up in growth and margin in 2024, with all segments contributing to the improved performance. Organic growth recovered through the year, with double-digit growth in the second half. A key driver of the improved performance was the resolution of supply constraints for our U.S. vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business. UTOP margin increased strongly, driven by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 6.2%, with 5.5% RIG and 0.7% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales increased by 3.7% to CHF 6.7 billion, including a foreign exchange impact reducing sales by -2.8%.</p><p>* Market share increased in Medical Nutrition and stabilized in VMS after declining in the second half of 2023.</p><p>* UTOP margin improved by 200 basis points to 14.0%. The increase was driven by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers</p><p>* By geography, North America posted mid single-digit growth, Europe delivered double-digit growth and other regions combined saw positive growth.</p><p>* VMS achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second half and an improvement in market share trends.</p><p>* Active Nutrition posted mid single-digit growth, supported by strong momentum for Orgain, Vital Proteins and healthy aging products.</p><p>* Medical Nutrition delivered double-digit growth, with continued market share gains. Growth was driven by strong sales momentum for adult medical care products, particularly Peptamen and Resource, as well as Vitaflo. Sales for gastrointestinal products continued to grow at a double-digit rate.</p><p>Nespresso</p><p>Nespresso delivered solid RIG-led growth, driven by the continued rollout of Vertuo, particularly in the U.S. and continued good growth in out-of-home channels. Q4 saw the highest quarterly growth of the year, supported by strong seasonal campaigns and the impact of pricing actions. UTOP margin decreased as we invested behind the expansion of Vertuo and structural costs increased.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 2.2%, with 1.6% RIG and 0.6% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales increased by 0.1% to CHF 6.4 billion, including -2.4% impact from foreign exchange movements.</p><p>* We achieved market share gains in the U.S., but lost some share in Europe.</p><p>* UTOP margin was down 30 bps to 20.0%, driven by increased advertising and marketing investments as well as higher structural costs.</p><p>Key sales growth drivers</p><p>* By geography, sales in North America grew at a mid single-digit rate with continued market share gains. In Europe, sales posted close to flat growth.</p><p>* By system, growth was driven by the Vertuo system, with strong sales momentum across all geographies.

Organic growth was 2.2%, with a return to positive real internal growth of 0.8%, and both strengthened in the second half. Free cash flow improved toCHF10.7 billion, and the Board proposes an increase in the dividend per share toCHF3.05.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have a clear roadmap to accelerate performance and transform for the future. Increasing investment to drive growth is central to our plan. This means delivering superior product taste and quality with unbeatable value, scaling our winning platforms and brands, accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets' and addressing underperformers. We are creating the fuel for these growth investments through our newCHF2.5 billion three-year cost savings program. We are making good progress and have already secured overCHF300 million of these savings for 2025.</p><p>From 2025, we expect our actions to drive an improvement in organic sales growth, with a lower underlying trading operating profit margin in the short term as we invest for growth.

This return to positive RIG came despite soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions, as well as actions taken to reduce customer inventory. Organic growth was 2.1% in the first half (H1) and 2.3% in the second half (H2), with RIG of 0.1% in H1, improving to 1.4% in H2.</p><p>Organic growth of 2.2% was impacted by a slowdown in category growth and our own below-market development. We have a clear focus on accelerating category growth and improving our market share performance in 2025 and over the medium term. An important part of how we deliver this is focusing our resource allocation behind our strongest growth drivers: scaling existing winning platforms and brands; accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets'; and building new growth engines that capture emerging consumer trends.</p><p>On market share performance, in 2024 we gained or held share in approximately half of our business cells by number, but in less than half of our business cells by sales value. The majority of the Group's market share loss is driven by 18 key underperforming business cells, which together account for approximately 21% of Group sales. We are executing our action plans at pace for each cell and are seeing some early signs of improvement.</p><p>A key element of improving our performance is strengthening our value propositions to consumers and customers. We are increasing investment to deliver superior product taste and quality, unbeatable value, unmissable visibility and compelling brand communication. Price competitiveness is a priority in the context of the high inflationary environment for certain commodities, most notably coffee and cocoa. We are taking an agile approach to passing on input cost increases, selectively investing in price as we focus on restoring competitiveness. To strengthen brand communication, we are stepping up investment and improving efficiency and effectiveness. Advertising and marketing spend as a percentage of sales fell from 9.0% in 2019 to a low of 6.6% in H2-2022; in 2024, this recovered to 8.1% and is planned to increase further to 9% by the end of 2025.</p><p>Efficiency and productivity</p><p>At our Capital Markets Day in November 2024, we announced a new three-year cost reduction program we have called Fuel for Growth, which is in addition to existing cost efficiency initiatives. We target CHF 2.5 billion run-rate cost savings from the new program by the end of 2027, and these savings will be used to fund increased investment in growth.</p><p>The Fuel for Growth program is expected to drive in-year savings of CHF 0.7 billion in 2025, CHF 1.4 billion in 2026 and CHF 2.3 billion in 2027. By the end of 2027, we expect to have reached the full run-rate savings of CHF 2.5 billion. In 2025, CHF 300 million of the savings impact this year only, with the further CHF 400 million being recurring savings that reduce the cost base on an ongoing basis. Over CHF 300 million of the expected CHF 0.7 billion cost savings for 2025 have already been secured.</p><p>Approximately three-quarters of the total savings in Fuel for Growth will come in procurement, with the remainder coming from operational efficiencies and commercial investments. Within procurement, the most significant savings will come from AI-powered procurement and supplier management, spend consolidation and aggregation, and e-sourcing expansion and automation. Within operational efficiencies and commercial investments, key initiatives include reviewing operating models as well as opportunities in manufacturing and logistics. The savings in procurement and commercial investments are expected to have limited costs to achieve; operational efficiencies will typically incur one-off costs of approximately 2 times the annual savings.</p><p>These Fuel for Growth savings are in addition to over CHF 1 billion per annum of ongoing efficiencies from existing Nestl\u00e9 Continuous Excellence initiatives.</p><p>Expected phasing of Fuel for Growth cost savings program:</p><p>[[In CHF billion                  2025 2026 2027</p><p>2025 non-recurring              0.3</p><p>2025 recurring savings          0.4  0.4  0.4</p><p>2026 recurring savings               1.0  1.0</p><p>2027 recurring savings                    0.9</p><p>Total in-year savings           0.7  1.4  2.3</p><p>Run-rate savings at end of 2027           2.5</p><p>]]</p><p>Strengthening foundations</p><p>Nestl\u00e9's success depends on alignment and in-market execution, and people are critical to that. 2024 was an important year of change in our leadership. Our new leadership team moved quickly to align and refocus the organization. We have simplified the Group's structure and reorganized Nestl\u00e9 Waters and premium beverages into a global, standalone business. This is complemented by the introduction of a more aligned performance management framework - our 'Operational Master Plan' - to increase Group-wide performance and drive pace of execution across the organization. We have also accelerated our digital transformation as we move to becoming a real-time, end-to-end connected enterprise, powered by data and artificial intelligence.</p><p>Operating sustainably is an important foundation for Nestl\u00e9, and we made progress across multiple areas. In particular, we delivered our 2025 greenhouse gas emission reduction target one year ahead of plan and made strong progress with our regenerative agriculture agenda.</p><p>Guidance</p><p>Our 2025 guidance is in line with the outlook we provided at the Capital Markets Day, with accelerated delivery of cost efficiencies offsetting recent increases in key commodity prices, especially in coffee and cocoa. In 2025, organic sales growth is expected to improve compared to 2024, strengthening through the year as we continue to deliver on our growth plans. UTOP margin is expected to be at or above 16.0% as we invest for growth. Guidance assumes no significant change in key macroeconomic variables.</p><p>Our objective remains to deliver superior, sustainable and profitable growth. In the medium term, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be at 4% plus in a normal operating environment, with an underlying trading operating profit margin at 17.0% plus.</p><p>Financial review                      Sales</p><p>Total reported sales decreased by 1.8% to CHF 91.4 billion, including negative impacts of 3.7% from foreign exchange movements and 0.3% from net divestitures. Organic growth was 2.2%. Pricing was 1.5%, reflecting a reduction in inflation across most categories after two years of high input cost and price increases. RIG returned to positive growth at 0.8% and was still impacted by soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands in certain markets. Additionally, actions taken to reduce customer inventory in the second half of the year reduced full-year RIG by approximately 20 basis points.</p><p>By geography, organic growth was driven by emerging markets and Europe, which together more than offset a decrease in North America. In developed markets, organic growth was 1.2%, with positive pricing and RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 3.7%, led by pricing with positive RIG.</p><p>Organic growth by product category was as follows:</p><p>* Coffee was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth, supported by the three leading coffee brands: Nescaf\u00e9, Nespresso and Starbucks.</p><p>* Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by KitKat and key local brands.</p><p>* PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for science-based premium brands Purina ProPlan, Purina ONE and Friskies.</p><p>* Nestl\u00e9 Health Science achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second half of the year.</p><p>* Water reported low single-digit growth, with solid growth for S.Pellegrino and supported by the successful launch of Maison Perrier.</p><p>* Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, supported by continued momentum for NAN and Lactogen.</p><p>* Dairy posted negative growth, as a decline in coffee creamers and ambient dairy more than offset growth for affordable milks and dairy culinary solutions.</p><p>* Culinary reported negative growth, with mid single-digit growth in Maggi more than offset by a decline in frozen food in North America.</p><p>By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 2.1%. Organic growth of out-of-home channels was 3.2%. E-commerce sales grew organically by 11.3%, reaching 18.9% of total Group sales.</p><p>Gross profit and operating profit</p><p>Gross profit was flat at CHF 42.7 billion, and the gross profit margin increased by 80 bps to 46.7%. The gross profit margin reached 47.2% in H1, then declined 90 bps sequentially to 46.3% in H2, driven by higher input costs in coffee and cocoa.</p><p>Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 8.3%. Marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 90 bps to 19.8%. This comprised: advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales up 40 bps to 8.1%, as we began to step up investment; and administration expenses as a percentage of sales up 50 bps to 11.7% of sales, largely reflecting higher labor costs, the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and one-off items. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 1.8%.</p><p>Underlying trading operating profit was CHF 15.7 billion, a decrease of 2.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1.3% in constant currency. The underlying trading operating profit margin was 17.2%, a decrease of 10 bps on a reported basis and flat in constant currency.</p><p>Restructuring and net other trading items was CHF 1.1 billion compared with CHF 1.5 billion in the prior year, with the reduction mainly due to lower restructuring costs. Trading operating profit increased by 0.8% to CHF 14.6 billion. The trading operating profit margin reached 16.0%, an increase of 40 bps on a reported basis and 50 bps in constant currency.</p><p>[[As % of sales              2024    2023    Reported change Constant currency                                                              change</p><p>Sales                      100.0%  100.0%  -</p><p>Cost of goods sold         -53.3%  -54.1%  80 bps</p><p>Gross profit margin        46.7%   45.9%   80 bps</p><p>Other revenue              0.4%    0.4%    0 bps</p><p>Distribution expenses      - 8.3%  - 8.3%  0 bps</p><p>Marketing and              - 19.8% - 18.9% - 90 bps                            administration expenses</p><p>Research and development   - 1.8%  - 1.8%  0 bps                               costs</p><p>Underlying trading         17.2%   17.3%   -10 bps         0 bps               operating profit margin</p><p>Other trading income       0.1%    0.1%    0 bps</p><p>Other trading expenses     -1.3%   -1.8%   50 bps</p><p>Trading operating profit   16.0%   15.6%   40 bps          50 bps              margin</p><p>Other operating income     0.5%    0.3%    20 bps</p><p>Other operating expenses   -0.4%   -0.8%   40 bps</p><p>Operating profit margin    16.1%   15.1%   100 bps</p><p>]]</p><p>Net financial expenses and income tax</p><p>Net financial expenses increased to CHF 1.5 billion from CHF 1.4 billion, reflecting a higher level of average net debt and an increase in interest rates. The average cost of net debt was 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2023.</p><p>The Group reported tax rate was 25.0%, compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to a write-off in deferred tax assets from changes in utilization projections and the absence of the favorable one-off items that positively impacted 2023. The underlying tax rate increased by 70 basis points to 21.9%, driven by higher corporate and withholding tax rates in some jurisdictions, as well as changes in the geographical and business mix of profits.</p><p>Net profit and earnings per share</p><p>Net profit decreased by 2.9% to CHF 10.9 billion. Basic earnings per share decreased by 1.0% to CHF 4.19, reflecting the movement in net profit and the impact of the share buyback program.</p><p>Underlying net profit was CHF 12.4 billion, a decrease of 2.6%, and an increase of 0.6% in constant currency. Underlying earnings per share was CHF 4.77, a decrease of 0.8%, and an increase of 2.5% in constant currency. The share buyback program contributed 1.1% to the underlying earnings per share change, net of finance costs.</p><p>Cash flow</p><p>Cash generated from operations increased to CHF 19.6 billion from CHF 19.2 billion in 2023. Free cash flow was CHF 10.7 billion compared to the prior year free cash flow of CHF 10.4 billion, which included CHF 0.6 billion proceeds from the disposal of a financial asset, with the increase primarily due to lower taxes paid and lower cash restructuring costs, as well as reduced capital expenditure.</p><p>Dividend</p><p>At the Annual General Meeting on April 16, 2025, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 3.05 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. Nestl\u00e9 has maintained or increased the dividend in Swiss francs over the last 65 years. We remain committed to the long-held practice of increasing the dividend in Swiss francs every year.</p><p>The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 17, 2025. The net dividend will be payable as from April 24, 2025. Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on April 9, 2025, at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights.</p><p>Share buyback program</p><p>In 2024, the Group repurchased 48.2 million Nestl\u00e9 S.A. shares for CHF 4.4 billion under the CHF 20.0 billion share buyback program that began in January 2022 and was completed as planned in December 2024. Under the program, 187.4 million shares were repurchased in the three-year period, of which 143.9 million have so far been cancelled. At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose the cancellation of the remaining 43.5 million repurchased shares, reducing the share capital of Nestl\u00e9 S.A. from CHF 262,000,000 to CHF 257,652,000. We do not currently anticipate initiating a new share buyback program in 2025.</p><p>Net debt</p><p>Net debt was CHF 56.0 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared to CHF 49.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase largely reflected cash outflows for the dividend payment of CHF 7.8 billion and share buybacks of CHF 4.5 billion as well as the impact of foreign exchange movements. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.90 times at December 31, 2024, compared to 2.54 times at December 31, 2023. This is towards the top of our target range of 2 to 3 times for net debt to Adjusted EBITDA.</p><p>Return on invested capital</p><p>Return on invested capital was 14.1%, compared to 13.9% in 2023. This improvement reflects a lower base of average invested capital, mainly linked to working capital, and a reduction in restructuring costs.</p><p>Minority participations</p><p>In late 2024, we established Nestl\u00e9 Equity Holdings to consolidate ownership of many of our minority participations, enhancing governance and allowing for a more consistent and efficient approach to managing these interests.</p><p>Operating segment review          [[           Total  Zone    Zone   Zone   Zone    Zone    Nestl\u00e9  Nespresso Other                Group  North   Europe AOA    Latin   Greater Health            Businesses                  AmericaAmerica China   Science</p><p>Sales      91,354 25,336  18,910 16,793 11,933  4,973   6,739   6,378     292       FY-2024                                                                             (CHF m)</p><p>Sales      92,998 25,995  19,098 17,519 12,196  5,037   6,498   6,372     283       FY-2023                                                                             (CHF m)</p><p>Real       0.8%   -0.8%   0.8%   0.6%   - 0.3%  4.3%    5.5%    1.6%      5.3%      internal                                                                            growth                                                                              (RIG)</p><p>Pricing    1.5%   0.4%    2.5%   2.8%   2.7%    - 2.1%  0.7%    0.6%      1.3%</p><p>Organic    2.2%   - 0.5%  3.3%   3.4%   2.5%    2.1%    6.2%    2.2%      6.6%      growth</p><p>Net M&amp;A    - 0.3% - 0.1%  - 1.9% 0.0%   0.4%    0.1%    0.2%    0.2%      0.0%</p><p>Foreign    - 3.7% - 2.0%  - 2.5% - 7.5% - 4.9%  - 3.5%  - 2.8%  - 2.4%    - 2.7%    exchange</p><p>Reported   - 1.8% - 2.5%  - 1.0% - 4.1% - 2.2%  - 1.3%  3.7%    0.1%      3.9%      sales                                                                               growth</p><p>UTOP       15,704 5,640   3,192  3,916  2,429   803     943     1,278     - 13      FY-2024                                                                             (CHF m)</p><p>UTOP       16,053 5,768   3,127  4,109  2,520   832     777     1,291     -12       FY-2023                                                                             (CHF m)</p><p>UTOP       17.2%  22.3%   16.9%  23.3%  20.4%   16.1%   14.0%   20.0%     - 4.3%    Margin                                                                              FY-2024</p><p>UTOP       17.3%  22.2%   16.4%  23.5%  20.7%   16.5%   12.0%   20.3%     - 4.3%    Margin                                                                              FY-2023</p><p>UTOPMargin -      + 10bps +      -      - 30bps - 40bps +       - 30bps   Flat      YoY        10bps          50bps  20bps                  200bps</p><p>]]</p><p>Zone North America</p><p>Our growth in North America in 2024 was disappointing. Organic sales growth of -0.5% reflects mixed delivery across the portfolio, in the context of a challenging consumer environment. We delivered RIG-led positive organic growth in approximately two-thirds of the business by sales. This was offset by weak performance in frozen food and coffee creamers. Turnaround plans are underway in both businesses. In Zone North America, UTOP margin increased modestly, which was the result of an improvement in gross profit margin and a step-up in growth investments.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was -0.5%, with -0.8% RIG and 0.4% pricing. Pricing was negative in H2, driven by competitive dynamics in PetCare and price adjustments in frozen food and coffee creamers.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 2.5% to CHF 25.3 billion, including a -2.0% impact from foreign exchange movements and -0.1% from net divestitures.</p><p>* Market share gains were achieved in coffee, while we lost market share in frozen pizza and coffee creamers.</p><p>* UTOP margin increased by 10 bps to 22.3%.

Zone Latin America</p><p>Sales growth in Zone Latin America was pricing-led growth, with RIG declining slightly. During the year, consumer demand softened and financial pressure on customers increased in several markets due to higher borrowing costs. These headwinds led to actions to reduce customer inventories, which weighed on RIG in Q3. Improved growth in Q4 was driven by confectionery and coffee, with new price increase measures being taken in both categories. UTOP margin for the year declined due to increased investments in growth as well as higher costs linked to the acquisition of the Grupo CRM confectionery business.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 2.5%, with -0.3% RIG and 2.7% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 2.2% to CHF 11.9 billion, with a negative impact of 4.9% from foreign exchange movements.</p><p>* Key markets driving growth were Brazil and Mexico; weaker performance in smaller markets such as Peru and Colombia.</p><p>* Market share developments included gains in portioned coffee and culinary, with losses in dairy and soluble coffee.</p><p>* UTOP margin decreased by 30 basis points to 20.4%.

Zone Greater China</p><p>In Zone Greater China, growth was underpinned by positive RIG delivery in every quarter despite soft consumer demand and intense price competition in several categories. This performance was achieved by driving faster innovation in key categories and adapting route-to-market and channel strategies to capture new growth opportunities. The decline in UTOP margin reflects increased commodity costs and higher growth investments.</p><p>Segment performance summary</p><p>* Organic growth was 2.1%, with 4.3% RIG and -2.1% pricing.</p><p>* Reported sales decreased by 1.3% to CHF 5.0 billion, as foreign exchange reduced sales by 3.5%.</p><p>* Market share developments included gains in Infant Nutrition and confectionery, with losses in culinary and dairy.</p><p>* UTOP margin decreased by 40 basis points to 16.1%, reflecting higher input costs and increased advertising and marketing investments.

Nestl\u00e9 Health Science</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Health Science delivered a significant step-up in growth and margin in 2024, with all segments contributing to the improved performance. Organic growth recovered through the year, with double-digit growth in the second half. A key driver of the improved performance was the resolution of supply constraints for our U.S. vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business.

Nespresso</p><p>Nespresso delivered solid RIG-led growth, driven by the continued rollout of Vertuo, particularly in the U.S. and continued good growth in out-of-home channels. Q4 saw the highest quarterly growth of the year, supported by strong seasonal campaigns and the impact of pricing actions.

Previous investors, including MoreVC, Middleland Capital, Axess Ventures and BPD Agri, materially participated in the round. With this new funding, Groundwork BioAg will accelerate and expand production of its mycorrhizal platform to meet global demand for natural, sustainable solutions that increase agricultural productivity while preserving soil health.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Groundwork BioAg, a global bioagriculture technology company, produces highly effective mycorrhizal inoculants. Mycorrhizae are a cornerstone of regenerative agriculture best practices. In addition to increasing yields, these natural products reduce dependency on phosphorus fertilizer and improve carbon sequestration in soil. Through distribution partnerships in strategic markets across five continents, the company is helping farmers improve the efficiency of major crop production, including corn, soybeans, grains, bio-energy crops, fruits and vegetables, and cannabis.</p><p>\"Over the past few years, we have focused on building production capacity to support millions of hectares and solidify our global presence in the main agricultural markets. With this investment and strong sales, we will be able to fulfill our mission to bring mycorrhiza - the queen of biologicals - to mainstream agriculture and help farmers succeed while protecting our planet,\" said Dr. Yossi Kofman, Co-Founder and CEO of Groundwork BioAg. \"We look forward to working with our investors, strategic partners and distributors to continue bringing meaningful value to farmers around the world.\"</p><p>While naturally occurring in the Earth's soil, mycorrhizae and other beneficial microbes have been destroyed by modern farming practices, including tilling, pasteurization and over fertilization. Following years of research and product development, Groundwork BioAg is the first to crack the code on mass production of highly concentrated, cost-effective mycorrhizal inoculants that improve yield and soil health. The company's flagship products include Rootella\u00ae for commodity, organic and specialty crops, and DYNOMYCO\u00ae for cannabis.</p><p>Following record sales in both the 2019 and 2020 growing seasons, the company is rapidly scaling up production to meet demand expected in 2022 and beyond. Approximately one million acres (400 Kha) will benefit from the company's unique products in 2021.</p><p>Disruptive Technology VC Chooses Groundwork BioAg As First Investment in AgTech</p><p>\"We are pleased to add Groundwork BioAg to our portfolio - not only because of its strong in-field performance and continued growth trajectory, but also because its technology provides the most compelling solution to increase yield while protecting our environment,\" said Gal Gitter, Managing Director of Ibex Investors focused on growth stage investments. \"With its high efficacy and broad applicability, Groundwork BioAg can feasibly treat over one billion hectares, nearly all of the world's farmland, with these beneficial fungi.\"</p><p>Headquartered in Denver, Colorado with offices in Tel Aviv and New York, Ibex Investors is a multi-strategy investment firm targeting outsized returns through differentiated global strategies. Ibex invests internationally in Israel, which has the highest concentration of start-up companies outside Silicon Valley.</p><p>The funding demonstrates Groundwork BioAg's strong growth position and enables efforts to expand its platform technology and accelerate production capacity to meet global demand for regenerative agriculture products.</p><p>About Groundwork BioAg</p><p>Groundwork BioAg, a global bioagriculture company, leverages the natural power of mycorrhizal fungi to improve the productivity, sustainability and profitability of commercial agriculture and expand regenerative agriculture practices. Groundwork BioAg is the first to use innovative techniques to solve challenges inherent in high-volume mycorrhizal inoculant production. We will not rest until every hectare of arable land is protected by mycorrhizae and every farmer benefits from higher crop yields while preserving our soils.

Fresh analysis by Systemiq has revealed that regenerative farming - whilst expanding its footprint over recent years - must triple its rate of growth to deliver against the world's need to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. It needs to make up at least 40% of global cropland by 2030, up from around 15% today.</p><p>The Task Force calls for common metrics and market-based financial incentives for environmental outcomes, targeted government policy and an overhaul of food sourcing - all to make regenerative agriculture a 'no brainer' business decision for farmers.</p><p>The Task Force is comprised of executives from many of the world's largest and most influential agribusiness companies and organisations, united by a common ambition to enable regenerative farming to become mainstream: Bayer, HowGood, Indigo Agriculture, Mars, McCain Foods, McDonald's, Mondelez, Olam, PepsiCo, Sustainable Food Trust, Waitrose &amp;

A six-week open consultation on the thematic areas and sequencing was held in which stakeholders were invited to submit feedback - the first such approach taken by a COP Presidency.</p><p>Kicking off with a two-day World Climate Action Summit, during which the first-ever Global Stocktake response will be presented to world leaders with the COP Presidency seeking commitments and accountability, the program also features new individual thematic days that respond to global challenges.</p><p>For the first time at a COP forum, COP28 will dedicate a day to Health, Relief, Recovery, and Peace, with a high level climate health ministerial, among other thematic activities. COP28 will also be the first to focus on the role of trade in tandem with finance and it will be the COP that brings leaders together from across all levels of government and society - from the local mayors to global leaders- to work towards cleaner, greener, safer cities for current and future generations.</p><p>All thematic days throughout the two weeks will be underpinned with an inclusive approach that prioritizes frontline communities and focuses on how finance, technology and innovation can drive solutions.</p><p>More detailed information about each thematic day will be released in the weeks and months ahead, as the COP28 Presidency continues to ramp up preparations for this year's meeting at Expo City Dubai.</p><p>Below are the key themes and events for each day:</p><p>- 30 November: COP28 UAE opens to the world at Expo City, Dubai. - 1-2 December: World Climate Action Summit - These two days will see heads of state and world leaders come together to tackle the most pressing climate issues in dialogue with leaders from civil society, business, youth, Indigenous Peoples' organizations and others. Typically, the summit helps to firm up the ambition for the remainder of the COP. For COP28, it will go further; it is where the first-ever Global Stocktake response and the urgency of the situation faced will be presented, and the COP Presidency will seek accountability from the highest levels of global governance on a way forward. - 3 December: Health/Relief, Recovery, and Peace - Climate change is already impacting human health across the planet, from the quality of the air we breathe to the water we drink and the places that provide us with shelter. It is also a major cause for displacement of vulnerable communities, leading to increased fragility which can compromise peace. This day, a first for COPs, will explore ways to provide relief to those affected while strengthening resilience and recovery leading to increased stability. - 4 December: Finance/Trade/Gender Equality/Accountability - Neither global financial systems that control and impact access and affordability of climate finance nor international trade networks, are working effectively and equitably. It is widely acknowledged that leaders of the global institutions and countries that govern these systems must accelerate and be accountable for an overhaul. An example of this is freeing up access to international finance and trade to support the implementation of adaptation and mitigation solutions without restrictions such as high interest rates that the poorest countries cannot afford. This is necessary to create fairer and more equal conditions for the world - and especially the most climate vulnerable countries from the Global South - to meet collective climate targets. This day will focus on moving this work forward while championing the importance of gender equality across the full climate spectrum. - 5 December: Energy and Industry / Just Transition / Indigenous Peoples - The world needs to decarbonize rapidly while continuing to progress economically. It is critical that this development happens sustainably and inclusively to support lives and livelihoods while protecting the planet. This day will focus on how the world can accelerate the energy transition while ensuring it is just. The energy needed for day-to-day life must remain affordable but become cleaner, and jobs must be retained but expand as green technologies emerge and provide increased and equitable access to opportunities. The day will look at the broad spectrum of solutions from deploying renewable energy at scale and how hydrogen can support this, to decarbonizing the energy of today through carbon capture technologies and rapidly reducing methane emissions from oil and gas. It will also focus on heavy-emitting industry including steel, cement, and aluminium. Indigenous Peoples are stewards of 80% of our planet's biodiversity and Indigenous Peoples Day will recognize the importance of their intergenerational knowledge, practices, and leadership in climate action. The day will also strengthen their role in the just transition, reinforcing the urgency of a fully inclusive, all-of-society approach. - 6 December: Multilevel Action, Urbanization, and Built Environment/Transport - It is not often that leaders representing all levels of governance, from the local to the global, come together. This day will provide a rare opportunity for mayors and governors, ministers and parliamentarians, and global business and civil society leaders to work together to accelerate climate action solutions across society in every form . This will include exploring how greener urban mobility systems can be designed to withstand and adapt to climate change while supporting the transition to low carbon built environments and infrastructure, and redesigning our systems of production and consumption to minimize waste. In addition, this day will showcase how all of these solutions contribute to safer, healthier and greener cities for current and future generations. - 7 December: Rest Day - 8 December: Youth, Children, Education, and Skills - Children and youth are facing disproportionate risks and impacts from climate change as the generation who will inherit a planet with tougher conditions in which to live and prosper but which was not responsible for contributing to the problem. This day seeks to empower children and youth to shape the outcomes of COP28 and beyond and provide them with clear, defined, accessible opportunities to be a leading part of the solutions proposed at every level. - 9 December: Nature, Land Use, and Oceans - Our world's climate and its biodiversity are inextricably interconnected, one cannot exist without the other. Mitigating both crises must therefore be integrated. In a landmark win for nature, a 30 x 30 biodiversity goal was adopted by world leaders at the CBD COP15 - to protect at least 30 percent of the planet's land and water by 2030. Contributing to the goal, this day will focus on delivering climate and nature co-benefits. This includes co-designing approaches to land use and oceans conservation with local and Indigenous Peoples to protect and manage biodiversity hotspots and natural carbon sinks. - 10 December: Food, Agriculture, and Water - Climate change is creating severe pressure and risks for the food, agricultural and water systems that ensure human wellbeing. At the same time, these systems are also key contributors to climate change: one third of all human-made GHG emissions derive from agri-food systems, and 70% of fresh water consumed worldwide is used for agricultural production. This day will focus on how to fix this, from scaling up regenerative agriculture and water-food systems that support habitat restoration and conservation and increase food security, to implementing stronger, fairer integrated governance between states and corporations, farmers and producers. - 11-12 December: Final Negotiations - On the final two days of COP28, there will be no thematic days to avoid extensive programming when the negotiation text is often being closed.</p><p>For more information on the thematic program, please visit COP28.com here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/thematic-program\">https://www.cop28.com/en/thematic-program</url>) .</p><p>Notes to Editors COP28 UAE:</p><p>- COP28 UAE will take place at Expo City Dubai from November 30-December 12, 2023.

Eagle Genomics is reinventing life sciences research and development by bridging the 'translation gap,' enabling scientific knowledge from a range of disparate sources and data sets to be integrated and analyzed through the e[datascientist] platform to create novel hypotheses and deliver robust, scientifically underpinned practical solutions.</p><p>\"We are energised to partner with ICRISAT, which has over half a century of experience in improving dryland agri-food systems across the poorest communities of the world from which we can draw valuable data and explore the pressing questions of our time that remain unanswered.</p><p>\"This promises enormous consequences for both public policies to incentivize private sector investment in new initiatives, and measures to address global challenges, that are jointly good for humanity and a corporation's bottom line.</p><p>\"Just as the digital revolution has brought new opportunities and improved our world, so can the Bio Revolution - towards which we are working with ICRISAT alongside other partners,\" said Anthony Finbow.</p><p>Sharing Knowledge for More World Firsts Director General ICRISAT, Dr Jacqueline Hughes said the MOU would see ICRISAT share datasets with Eagle Genomics, drawing upon extensive on-the-ground experience in Asia and Africa that had led to several agricultural world firsts. These include developing early maturing groundnut as well as high iron biofortified pearl millet, innovations that have directly responded to the challenges posed by climate change. This new partnership offers an opportunity to address, and even leapfrog beyond, the Sustainable Development Goals to drive science-based targets for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"The efficacy of our interventions both past and emerging and on which some 2.2. billion people depend, will increasingly depend on informed data-driven decisions in an increasingly complex world.</p><p>\"This partnership will advance an understanding of microbiome interactions - from soil, to plant, to farm, to fork, to gut, to health, and their relationship with our food system and offer new approaches to sequester carbon efficiently, enhance nitrogen and phosphate availability for plants, reduce soil erosion and flooding and improve crop and community resilience to climate change and climatic events. Furthermore, it will provide meaningful nature-based metrics to enhance our understanding of regenerative impact from a biological standpoint.</p><p>\"Increasing the nutrient density in our food through enhancement of microbiomes will help ensure ICRISAT's mandate crops can address food security and malnutrition, in populations living in drought-prone dryland areas.</p><p>\"I am delighted that our collaboration with Eagle Genomics, and the strength they bring to our high-calibre partnerships, will advance our mission of reducing poverty, hunger and malnutrition for the world's poor,\" said Dr Hughes .</p><p>At the conclusion of the signing, ICRISAT and Eagle Genomics applauded the Innovations for Drylands Conference. They said that the MOU would help underpin next-generation innovation to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of the over two billion people living in the drylands of Asia, Africa and beyond. It will contribute to safe and nutritious food for all, through a shift to sustainable consumption and nature-positive production systems that can drive One Health outcomes for humans, animals, and the environment.</p><p>Notes</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">1.

Representing billions of dollars in funding and investment in sustainable food systems, hundreds of companies, food producers and civil society groups calling for food systems change, alongside climate and healthcare advocates, and specialist researchers and academics, signatories include the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, The Capitals Coalition, Planetary Health Alliance, Food Tank, Swette Centre for Sustainable Food Systems, amongst others.</p><p>The letter (<url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com/global-alliance-for-the-future-of-food/redefining\">https://medium.com/global-alliance-for-the-future-of-food/redefining</url> -the-value-of-food-systems-f284e67ec602) is an urgent call to the UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres and Special Envoy Agnes Kalibata to ensure that True Cost Accounting is an imperative pathway coming out of the UNFSS:</p><p>Our organizations, which collectively represent multiple sectors, governments, advocates, investors, CSOs, and individual producers worldwide believe that to bring about change we must fundamentally redefine how we measure the real cost of our food. The UNFSS process must commit to measuring the true costs of food, and embrace a measurable systems approach with transparency and integrity. We write today to urge a full and unequivocal commitment to such an approach - \"true cost accounting\" and to redefining the value of food as an outcome of the UNFSS.</p><p>\"Food systems transformation addresses so many urgent and interconnected goals, from climate progress, nutrition, health, jobs, and food security to safety and global stability,\" said Ruth Richardson, Executive Director of the Global Alliance . \"We know that bold action -- whether that's through new metrics to inform decision-making to ramping up investment in solutions like agroecology -- can have transformational effects across agendas for nations worldwide. We need global leaders to act boldly and embrace measurable, transparent approaches like True Cost Accounting to move us forward - especially with COP26 around the corner .\"</p><p>True Cost Accounting is a dynamic policy making approach that captures all of the positive and negative impacts of food systems on our economy, environment and society. A recent report from The Rockefeller Foundation (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rockef\">https://www.rockef</url> ellerfoundation.org/report/true-cost-of-food-measuring-what-matters-to-transform -the-u-s-food-system/) , a Global Alliance member, found that while the United States spends $1.1t annually on food, when the \"hidden\" impacts of the food system -- from rising diet-related disease and accelerating biodiversity loss and increasingly precarious livelihoods -- are factored in, the \"true cost\" of the U.S. food system is at least $3.2 trillion a year. At a global level, the costs are estimated to be USD $19.8 trillion per year (<url normalizedValue=\"https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf\">https://sc-fss2021.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/UNFSS_true_cost_of_food.pdf</url>) .</p><p>In line with its commitment to championing inclusive, participatory governance of food systems, the Global Alliance has also formally joined an ambitious coalition for agroecology (<url normalizedValue=\"https://foodsystems.community/transformation-through-\">https://foodsystems.community/transformation-through-</url> agroecology-and-regenerative-agriculture/) as part of the UNFSS, recognizing it as a key lever to transform food systems.

The network, which has been responsible for providing counsel to the Action Tracks, identifying gaps and key issues and participating in the country-level dialogues, is expected to issue a joint letter identifying the key themes and imperatives for global systems change.</p><p>\"Diverse networks and global coalitions stand ready to be the champions for food systems transformation,\" said Richardson, \"but UN and global leaders must also commit to transformational change - and to measuring the real costs of our food.\"</p><p>The Global Alliance for the Future of Food is a strategic alliance of philanthropic foundations working together and with others to transform global food systems now and for future generations <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.futureoffood.org\">http://www.futureoffood.org</url>/</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSAK-100878027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSAK2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NF-NPR1-JBWT-F1SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">275505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><timeReceived>3:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 News Aktuell GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>News Aktuell Switzerland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21666\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 21, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Helping people affected by cancer shouldn't either\", says Mika Founder and Managing Director Dr Jan Simon Raue. \"We have developed Mika to bring back some of the control when guidance and support is most needed: from diagnosis all the way through the therapy process. Our mission is to empower everyone affected by cancer. Knowing that every cancer patient is a human being with individual needs, Mika provides personalised and comprehensive cancer therapy support, combining the latest insights in cancer research with 24/7 hands-on help wrapped up in an easy-to-handle and engaging digital tool.\"</p><p>The capital raised in this series A round will support Mika's expansion into international terrain. While Fosanis reveals its plan to enter the UK healthcare ecosystem still in 2022, it also wants to partner with renowned international cancer research centres to conduct even more studies on the medical impact of AI-driven personalisation in digital interventions. Mika Co-Founder and Managing Director Dr Gandolf Finke: \"The importance of digital health and digital therapeutics in particular is growing globally. This financing round marks an important milestone in our company history, allowing us to scale our oncology DTx platform and position our offerings internationally. We welcome our new investors on board and look forward to working closely with them to take Mika to new heights.\"</p><p>Debiopharm is an experienced investor in the digital health domain with a special focus on cancer. Tanja Dowe, CEO of Debiopharm Innovation Fund: \"We are convinced that digital solutions can fill many critical gaps in healthcare and, especially with regards to cancer therapy support, provide tremendous relieve for patients and attending physicians alike. Mika promotes patient empowerment and enables those affected to cope with their disease and therapy, independent of time and location. For this very reason, we do not only think of ourselves as mere investors, but we also support the company in strategy and execution and are proud to accompany Mika's further growth.\"</p><p>Ship2B, based in Barcelona, invests primarily in start-ups that have the potential to make a worthwhile and lasting contribution to the world. Impact, i.e., the aspiration to make a real change, is at the forefront of their thinking, as Maite Fibla, Co-Founder and Managing Partner of Ship2B, points out: \"We are proud to contribute to the internationalization of Mika, which means being able to improve the quality of life of many more cancer patients. Not only does its mission meet our parameters of what an impact start-up should be, but we have felt fully committed to it. It seems especially significant to us to think that, thanks to what was achieved in the round, there may be the possibility of giving Spain, among other countries, this innovative proposal in oncological therapies.\"</p><p>Andrea Buhofer, Partner at EquityPitcher Ventures, moreover highlights the growing importance of patient-centric solutions in integrative digital oncology: \"Personalized, digital and accessible support in cancer therapy is becoming increasingly important. Mika has developed an extremely user-friendly application with in-demand content, and we are very pleased to have been able to support Mika in continuing to grow and make therapy support available to more people.\"</p><p>Alongside the new investors, current shareholders contributed to the funding round, led by impact VC Ananda Impact Ventures and several business angels who had already joined Mika's mission in a previous seed investment round. Dr Bernd Klosterkemper, Partner at Ananda Impact Ventures, explains: \"We are a home for entrepreneurs who tackle the pressing challenges of our time in a scalable way. From the very beginning, Mika has been aspiring to create a positive impact on the well-being and quality of life of cancer patients. As its meaningful vision deeply resonates with our ambition to back game-changing and purpose-driven solutions, we are very much looking forward to cementing ties and helping Mika achieve global impact.\"</p><p>About Fosanis</p><p>Founded in 2017 by Dr Gandolf Finke and Dr Jan Simon Raue, the digital health company Fosanis GmbH pursues the objective of empowering people affected by cancer with the aid of digital technology.

Heute stellt die Marke einen umfassenden Plan vor, um den Kaffeeanbau nachhaltiger zu gestalten: den NESCAF\u00c9 Plan 2030. NESCAF\u00c9 arbeitet mit Kaffeebauern zusammen und unterstuetzt sie dabei, sich auf regenerative Landwirtschaft umzustellen. Gleichzeitig treibt die Marke die Arbeit der letzten zehn Jahre (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/20\">https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/20</url> 21-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years-nescafe-plan-2021-en.pdf) im Rahmen des NESCAF\u00c9 Plans weiter voran.</p><p>Bis 2030 investiert die Marke ueber eine Milliarde Schweizer Franken in den NESCAF\u00c9 Plan 2030. Diese Investition baut auf dem bestehenden Programm auf. Somit erweitert NESCAF\u00c9 ihre Nachhaltigkeitsarbeit (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nestle.com/sites\">https://www.nestle.com/sites</url> /default/files/2021-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years-nescafe-plan-2021-en.pdf) . Die Marke erhaelt Unterstuetzung aus Finanzierungsmitteln von Nestl\u00e9 fuer regenerative Landwirtschaft. Das Unternehmen hat sich verpflichtet, den Uebergang zu einem regenerativen Nahrungssystem (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nestle.com/media/pressrelease\">https://www.nestle.com/media/pressrelease</url> s/allpressreleases/support-transition-regenerative-food-system) zu beschleunigen und verfolgt das Ziel, keine Netto-Treibhausgasemissionen zu verursachen. (https ://<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-climate-change-com\">www.nestle.com/media/pressreleases/allpressreleases/nestle-climate-change-com</url> mitment-zero-net-emissions-2050)</p><p>\"Der Klimawandel setzt Kaffeeanbaugebiete unter Druck\", sagt David Rennie, Head of Nestl\u00e9 Coffee Brands . \"Aufbauend auf der 10-jaehrigen Erfahrung des NESCAF\u00c9 Plans beschleunigen wir unsere Arbeit, um den Klimawandel zu bekaempfen und soziale sowie wirtschaftliche Herausforderungen in den NESCAF\u00c9-Wertschoepfungsketten zu bewaeltigen.\"</p><p>Steigende Temperaturen werden die Flaeche bis 2050 um bis zu 50 % reduzieren, die fuer den Kaffeeanbau geeignet ist. Gleichzeitig sind rund 125 Millionen Menschen fuer ihren Lebensunterhalt auf Kaffee angewiesen. Schaetzungsweise leben 80 % der Kaffeeanbaufamilien an oder unter der Armutsgrenze . Es besteht Handlungsbedarf, um den nachhaltigen Kaffeeanbau langfristig zu gewaehrleisten.</p><p>\"Als weltweit fuehrende Kaffeemarke moechte NESCAF\u00c9 einen bedeutenden Beitrag zum Kaffeeanbau weltweit leisten\", sagt Philipp Navratil, Head of Coffee Strategic Business Unit bei Nestl\u00e9 . \"Wir moechten, dass es den Kaffeebauern gut geht und wir moechten, dass Kaffee einen positiven Einfluss auf die Umwelt hat. Unser Handeln kann dazu beitragen, den Wandel in der gesamten Kaffeebranche voranzutreiben.\"</p><p>Unterstuetzung der Landwirte bei der Umstellung auf regenerativen Kaffeeanbau</p><p>Das Ziel der regenerativen Landwirtschaft ist, die Gesundheit und Fruchtbarkeit des Bodens zu verbessern sowie die Wasserressourcen und die biologische Vielfalt zu schuetzen. Gesuendere Boeden sind widerstandsfaehiger gegenueber den Auswirkungen des Klimawandels und koennen die Ertraege steigern. So tragen sie zur Verbesserung der Lebensgrundlage der Landwirte bei.</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 unterstuetzt die Landwirte bei der Umstellung auf regenerative Kaffeeanbaumethoden mit Schulungen und technischer Hilfe. Die Marke stellt darueber hinaus ertragreiche Kaffeepflanzensetzlinge zur Verfuegung. Beispiele fuer regenerative Landwirtschaft sind:</p><p>- Das Pflanzen von Deckfruechten hilft, den Boden zu schuetzen. Es hilft auch, dem Boden Biomasse hinzuzufuegen, was die organische Substanz des Bodens und damit die Kohlenstoffbindung im Boden erhoehen kann. - Die Verwendung von organischen Duengemitteln traegt zur Bodenfruchtbarkeit bei, die fuer eine gute Bodengesundheit unerlaesslich ist. - Die zunehmende Nutzung von Agroforstwirtschaft und der Anbau von Zwischenfruechten traegt zur Erhaltung der biologischen Vielfalt bei. - Das Beschneiden vorhandener Kaffeebaeume oder das Ersetzen durch krankheits- und klimaresistente Sorten wird dazu beitragen, Kaffeeplantagen zu verjuengen und die Ertraege der Landwirte zu steigern.</p><p>Anbaulaender im Fokus, die fuer 90 % des NESCAF\u00c9-Kaffees sorgen</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 wird mit Kaffeefarmern zusammenarbeiten, um die Wirksamkeit mehrerer regenerativer landwirtschaftlicher Praktiken zu testen, zu lernen und zu bewerten. Der Fokus liegt auf sieben wichtige Herkunftslaender: Brasilien, Vietnam, Mexiko, Kolumbien, Elfenbeinkueste, Indonesien und Honduras. Aus diesen Laendern stammen 90 % des Kaffees fuer die Marke.</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 hat zum Ziel:</p><p>- Bis 2025: 100 % Kaffee aus verantwortungsvoller Herkunft zu beziehen (https:// <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years-nesca\">www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years-nesca</url> fe-plan-2021-en.pdf) - Bis 2025 stammen 20 % und bis 2030 50 % des Kaffees aus regenerativen landwirtschaftlichen Methoden. Dies ist im Einklang mit Nestl\u00e9s Zielen, die wichtigsten Zutaten (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nestle.com/sustainability/nature-environment/\">https://www.nestle.com/sustainability/nature-environment/</url> regenerative-agriculture) zu beschaffen.</p><p>Finanzielles Unterstuetzungsprogramm als Pilotprojekt in Mexiko, Elfenbeinkueste und Indonesien fuer den schnelleren Wandel zur regenerativen Landwirtschaft</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 engagiert sich fuer die Unterstuetzung von Farmern, die mit der Umstellung auf regenerative Landwirtschaft verbundene Risiken und Kosten uebernehmen. Landwirte sollten durch die Umstellung ihr Einkommen verbessern koennen. Das Unternehmen wird entsprechend Programme bereitstellen. In Mexiko, Indonesien und in der Elfenbeinkueste wird NESCAF\u00c9 ein Pilotprojekt zur finanziellen Unterstuetzung starten. Das Projekt wird den Farmern dabei helfen, den Wandel zur regenerativen Landwirtschaft zu beschleunigen. Durch dieses Programm wird NESCAF\u00c9 zusammen mit Kaffeebauern den besten Ansatz in den einzelnen Laendern testen und lernen. Massnahmenbeispiele:</p><p>- Bedingte Bargeldanreize fuer die Einfuehrung regenerativer landwirtschaftlicher Praktiken - Schutz des Einkommens durch Wetterversicherung - Mehr Zugang zu Kreditlinien fuer Landwirte</p><p>NESCAF\u00c9 wird die Fortschritte verfolgen und die Ergebnisse seiner Programme vor Ort mit Kaffeebauern bewerten. Rainforest Alliance unterstuetzt die Marke im Rahmen der Monitoring- und Evaluierungspartnerschaft dabei. Diese Aktivitaeten werden durch neue und auf Fachwissen fokussierte Partnerschaften ergaenzt. Ein Beispiel dafuer ist die Zusammenarbeit mit Sustainable Food Lab rund um die Themen Einkommensbewertung, Strategie und Fortschrittsverfolgung von Kaffeebauern.</p><p>Reduzierung der Treibhausgasemissionen durch Bindung und Speicherung von mehr Kohlenstoff im Boden</p><p>Regenerative Landwirtschaft traegt auch dazu bei, der Atmosphaere Kohlendioxid zu entziehen und die Treibhausgasemissionen zu reduzieren. Deshalb ist regenerative Landwirtschaft ein wichtiger Bestandteil des Klima-Aktionsplans von Nestl\u00e9. NESCAF\u00c9 will zu der Netto-Null-Verpflichtung (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nestle.com/media/press\">https://www.nestle.com/media/press</url> releases/allpressreleases/nestle-climate-change-commitment-zero-net-emissions-20 50) von Nestl\u00e9 beitragen, die Treibhausgasemissionen bis 2030 zu halbieren und bis 2050 null Netto-Treibhausgasemissionen zu erreichen. NESCAF\u00c9 wird mit Landwirten, Lieferanten und Partnern zusammenarbeiten, um zum Schutz landwirtschaftlicher Flaechen, zur Verbesserung der Artenvielfalt und zur Verhinderung von Waldrodung beizutragen. Die Marke moechte Landwirte dabei unterstuetzen, auf ihren Kaffeefarmen oder in der Naehe mehr als 20 Millionen Baeume zu pflanzen.</p><p>Auf einem starken Fundament aufbauend vorwaerts gehen</p><p>Die heutige Ankuendigung baut auf den Nachhaltigkeitsbemuehungen von NESCAF\u00c9 in der Kaffeeproduktion auf. Seit 2010 investiert die Marke ueber den NESCAF\u00c9 Plan ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years\">https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-01/sustainable-journey-ten-years</url> -nescafe-plan-2021-en.pdf) in Nachhaltigkeit und macht bedeutende Fortschritte:</p><p>- Kaffee aus verantwortungsvoller Herkunft: 2021 stammten 82 % des Kaffees von NESCAF\u00c9 aus verantwortungsvollem Anbau. - Kaffeepflanzen: NESCAF\u00c9 hat seit 2010 250 Millionen neue Kaffeepflanzensetzlinge an Landwirte verteilt. - Monitoring und Evaluierung: Wirkungsanalyse in 14 Laendern zusammen mit Rainforest Alliance. - Treibhausgasemissionen: 46 % weniger Treibhausgasemissionen in unseren Fabriken fuer loeslichen Kaffee (2020 vs. 2010, pro Tonne Produkt). - Wasserverbrauch: 53 % weniger Wasserentnahme in unseren Fabriken fuer loeslichen Kaffee (2020 vs. 2010, pro Tonne Produkt).</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">1.

Diese zielt darauf ab, Textilabfaelle zu reduzieren, den CO2-Ausstoss in der gesamten Wertschoepfungskette zu halbieren und das Leben der Menschen zu verbessern, die Primark-Produkte herstellen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mit der neuen Strategie verpflichtet sich der internationale Modehaendler dazu, die Herstellungsweise seiner Kleidung zu aendern, ohne jedoch seine erschwinglichen Preise zu veraendern, damit Kundinnen und Kunden nachhaltiger einkaufen koennen.</p><p>Im Rahmen der neuen Selbstverpflichtungen wird das Unternehmen sicherstellen, dass bis zum Jahr 2030 alle seine Kleidungsstuecke aus recycelten oder nachhaltigeren Materialien hergestellt werden. Zurzeit machen diese 25 Prozent aller verkauften Kleidungsstuecke aus. In einem ersten Schritt werden innerhalb eines Jahres alle T-Shirts fuer Maenner, Frauen und Kinder im unteren Preissegment aus nachhaltig angebauter Baumwolle hergestellt.</p><p>Primark wird seinen Designprozess veraendern, um sicherzustellen, dass Kleidungsstuecke am Ende ihres Lebenszykluses recycelt werden koennen und so zur Reduzierung von Textilabfaellen beitragen. Dazu gehoert auch die Zusammenarbeit mit der britischen Hilfsorganisation WRAP (<url normalizedValue=\"https://wrap.org.uk/\">https://wrap.org.uk/</url>) , um neue Industrieleitlinien fuer die Haltbarkeit von Produkten zu definieren. Die Organisation setzt sich fuer den Wandel der Modeindustrie hin zur Kreislaufwirtschaft ein.</p><p>Paul Marchant, CEO von Primark, sagte zur Einfuehrung der globalen Strategie: \"Dies ist ein neues und aufregendes Kapitel in Primarks Geschichte. Unser Ziel ist es, den Kundinnen und Kunden die erschwinglichen Preise zu bieten, fuer die sie uns kennen und lieben - aber mit Produkten, deren Herstellung nicht auf Kosten unseres Planeten und seiner Bewohner geht. Wir wissen, dass sich unsere Kundinnen und Kunden und unsere Kolleginnen und Kollegen genau das wuenschen und auch von uns erwarten.</p><p>Dies ist nicht der Beginn einer neuen Reise. Wir arbeiten schon seit mehr als zehn Jahren daran, ein nachhaltigeres und ethischeres Unternehmen zu werden. Jedes vierte Kleidungsstueck, das wir verkaufen, stammt bereits aus unserem Primark Cares-Sortiment, das aus recycelten oder nachhaltigeren Materialien hergestellt wird. Unsere neuen Selbstverpflichtungen bedeuten jedoch eine erhebliche Beschleunigung des Tempos und des Umfangs der Veraenderungen in unserem Unternehmen und verlangen von uns, dass wir unser Geschaeft ueberdenken. Dies beginnt beim Design und der Herstellung unserer Kleidung und endet beim Verkauf in unseren Geschaeften.</p><p>Wir haben noch nicht alle Antworten auf alle Fragen. Aber wir sind uns bewusst, dass wir den Wandel nicht alleine schaffen koennen. Wir haben uns deshalb zur Zusammenarbeit innerhalb unserer Branche verpflichtet, um echte Veraenderungen in grossem Massstab voranzutreiben.\"</p><p>Die neue Strategie baut auf der Arbeit auf, die Primark in den letzten zehn Jahren geleistet hat. Die neuen Selbstverpflichtungen, die von Experten aus der Branche ausgearbeitet wurden, beziehen sich sowohl auf Primarks eigenes Geschaeft als auch auf seine globale Lieferkette. Die Strategie erweitert die bestehenden Selbstverpflichtungen, die das Unternehmen als Unterzeichner wichtiger Brancheninitiativen bereits eingegangen ist. Dazu gehoert die WRAP-Initiative \"Textiles 2030\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://wrap.org.uk/taking-action/textiles/initiatives/textiles-2030\">https://wrap.org.uk/taking-action/textiles/initiatives/textiles-2030</url>) , die darauf abzielt, den Uebergang der Mode- und Textilindustrie zur Kreislaufwirtschaft zu beschleunigen und einen Systemwandel herbeizufuehren. Das Unternehmen arbeitet ausserdem mit der Ellen MacArthur Foundation (<url normalizedValue=\"https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/\">https://ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/</url>) zusammen, um alle seine Kleidungsstuecke recycelbar zu entwerfen.</p><p>Primark wird nicht nur die Art und Weise, wie seine Kleidung hergestellt wird, aendern. Das Unternehmen wird auch mit seinen Zulieferern zusammenarbeiten, um die Kohlenstoffemissionen in der Wertschoepfungskette um die Haelfte zu reduzieren und so den Wandel auf Branchenebene voranzutreiben. Ausserdem wird Primark Einwegplastik abschaffen - aufbauend auf 500 Millionen bereits entfernten Artikeln.</p><p>Primark wird sein Sustainable Cotton Programme, das bereits das groesste seiner Art in der Modeindustrie ist, ausweiten und Landwirte darin schulen, regenerative Anbaumethoden anzuwenden. Diese bauen auf nachhaltige Methoden wie den Einsatz von weniger Wasser und Chemikalien auf. Dies geschieht im Rahmen der Partnerschaft mit CottonConnect (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cottonconnect.org/\">https://www.cottonconnect.org/</url>) , die den branchenfuehrenden REEL Regenerative Code (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cottonconnect.org/stories\">https://www.cottonconnect.org/stories</url>/ regenerative-agriculture-and-carbon-sequestration-practices-with-organic-cotton- farmers-in-india) anwendet, um die biologische Vielfalt zu foerdern, sich an den Klimawandel anzupassen und die Lebensgrundlage der Landwirte zu verbessern.</p><p>Das Unternehmen wird auf seinen etablierten Initiativen fuer ethischen Handel aufbauen und die Partnerschaft mit der Lohn-Initiative ACT (<url normalizedValue=\"https://actonlivingwages.com/\">https://actonlivingwages.com/</url>) ausweiten, um das Leben der Menschen, die seine Kleidung herstellen, zu verbessern. So wird Primark sich fuer existenzsichernde Loehne fuer die ArbeiterInnen in seiner Lieferkette einsetzen und in Programme investieren, die Frauen mehr Chancen bieten.</p><p>Christiane Wiggers-Voellm, Geschaeftsfuehrerin von Primark Deutschland und Oesterreich, sagte: \"Gerade in Deutschland und Oesterreich haben das Bewusstsein fuer und die Nachfrage nach nachhaltig produzierter Mode stark zugenommen. Wir sind der Meinung, dass Nachhaltigkeit nicht mit einem Aufpreis einhergehen sollte, den sich nur wenige Menschen leisten koennen. Eben weil wir Primark sind, sind wir ueberzeugt, dass wir nachhaltigere Mode fuer alle erschwinglich machen koennen.\"</p><p>Primark wird seine 397 Filialen in 14 Laendern nutzen, um seine Kundinnen und Kunden mithilfe der Kampagne \"How Change Looks\" ueber die Veraenderungen zu informieren, die das Unternehmen vornimmt. Darueber hinaus wird es den Kunden leichter gemacht, selbst Dinge zu veraendern. Zu den Initiativen gehoert unter anderem die Aufklaerung der Verbraucher ueber Methoden zur Verlaengerung der Lebensdauer ihrer Garderobe, beispielsweise durch die Vermittlung von Naehkenntnissen oder durch Anleitungen zum Waschverfahren.</p><p>Das Unternehmen wird jaehrlich ueber seine Fortschritte bei der Umsetzung der globalen Primark Cares-Strategie berichten. Weitere Informationen ueber die Strategie, die neun Selbstverpflichtungen in den Bereichen People, Planet und Product sowie ueber die Arbeit, die das Unternehmen in diesem Bereich leistet, finden Sie unter <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.primark.com/howchangelooks\">http://www.primark.com/howchangelooks</url> .</p><p>Primark nutzt seine globale Groesse und die Reichweite seiner gesamten Lieferkette und seiner eigenen Geschaefte, um die neue Primark Cares-Strategie mit neun Schluesselverpflichtungen in drei Schluesselbereichen umzusetzen. Diese sind:</p><p>Kleidung ein laengeres Leben geben . Wir werden ein kreislauforientiertes und nachhaltigeres Unternehmen werden.</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">1. Erschwingliche, langlebige Kleidung. Wir werden die Langlebigkeit unserer <br/>   Kleidung bis 2025 verbessern. <br/>2. Recyclebare Kleidung. Unsere Kleidung wird bis 2027 recyclegerecht designt <br/>   werden. <br/>3. Kleidung aus recycelten Fasern. Bis 2030 wird unsere gesamte Kleidung aus <br/>   recycelten oder nachhaltiger gewonnenen Materialien hergestellt. <br/></pre></p><p>Schutz des Lebens auf unserer Erde . Wir werden die Natur schuetzen, unsere Kohlenstoffemissionen halbieren und Abfaelle vermeiden.</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">1. Halbierung unseres CO2-Fussabdrucks. Wir werden die CO2-Emissionen in unserer <br/>   gesamten Wertschoepfungskette bis 2030 halbieren. <br/>2. Vermeidung von nicht-textilen Abfaellen. Wir werden Einwegplastik und alle <br/>   nicht-textilen Abfaelle bis 2027 aus unserem Unternehmen entfernen. <br/>3. Wiederherstellung der biologischen Vielfalt. Im Rahmen unseres Programms fuer <br/>   nachhaltige Baumwolle werden wir bis 2030 Landwirte darin schulen, <br/>   regenerative Anbaumethoden anzuwenden. <br/></pre></p><p>Das Leben der Menschen verbessern . Wir werden den Lebensunterhalt und die finanzielle Sicherheit der Menschen, die unsere Kleidung herstellen, schuetzen und verbessern.</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">1. Finanzielle Sicherheit schaffen. Wir setzen uns fuer einen existenzsichernden <br/>   Lohn fuer die ArbeiterInnen in unserer Lieferkette ein, unterstuetzen sie bis <br/>   2030 mit Schulungen zur Staerkung ihrer Finanzkompetenzen und erleichtern <br/>   ihnen den Zugang zu sozialer Absicherung. <br/>2. Foerderung der Chancengleichheit fuer Frauen. Wir werden die Position von <br/>   Frauen in unserer gesamten Lieferkette bis 2030 staerken, indem wir die <br/>   Entwicklung von Kompetenzen am Arbeitsplatz unterstuetzen und Faktoren, die <br/>   ihren beruflichen Aufstieg verhindern, beseitigen. <br/>3. Verbesserung der Gesundheit und des Wohlbefindens von ArbeitnehmerInnen. Wir <br/>   werden bis 2030 sicherstellen, dass ArbeitnehmerInnen in unserer Lieferkette <br/>   Zugang zu effektiven Beschwerdeverfahren haben und den Zugang zu physischer <br/>   und psychischer Gesundheitsfuersorge verbessern. <br/></pre></p><p>Ueber Primark:</p><p>Primark ist ein internationaler Einzelhaendler, der die neueste Mode, Kosmetik und Wohnaccessoires anbietet. Das Unternehmen ist fuer sein ausgezeichnetes Preis-Leistungsverhaeltnis bekannt: tolle Basics und Artikel des taeglichen Bedarfs oder die neuesten Trends zu Preisen, die sich jeder leisten kann. Primark wurde 1969 in Irland unter dem Namen Penney's gegruendet und ist heute in 14 Laendern in Europa und den USA vertreten - und waechst weiter. Weltweit unterhaelt das Unternehmen heute 397 Filialen und beschaeftigt mehr als 65.000 Mitarbeiter.</p><p>Primark setzt sich fuer eine bessere Zukunft fuer die Menschen und unseren Planeten ein und arbeitet daran, ein nachhaltigeres Unternehmen zu werden. Dazu gehoeren der Beitritt zur Modecharta der Vereinten Nationen (UNFCCC), die Unterstuetzung des Netto-Null-Ziels der Charta und die Verpflichtung, den Ausstoss von Treibhausgasen (THG) bis 2030 um</p><p>30 Prozent zu reduzieren. Darueber hinaus hat sich das Unternehmen der WRAP-Initiative \"Textiles 2030\" angeschlossen, um die Entwicklung der Mode- und Textilindustrie hin zur Kreislaufwirtschaft zu unterstuetzen und den Systemwandel in Grossbritannien zu beschleunigen. Primark baut in diesem Kontext sein Primark Cares-Label weiter aus. Dabei handelt es sich um Kleidung und andere Produkte, die unter Verwendung nachhaltigerer Materialien oder Fertigungsmethoden hergestellt werden. Mittlerweile machen sie mehr als ein Viertel des gesamten Bekleidungsumsatzes von Primark aus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWAKG-100877597</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWAKG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M4-HN31-DYBW-52HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">275510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1802\"/><timeReceived>9:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 News Aktuell GmbH Alle Rechte Vorbehalten</copyright><publicationName>News Aktuell Schweiz</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21667\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>Mittwoch 15.
