The fourth annual report outlines the company's continued commitment to responsible business practices and transparent progress across key environmental, community, and governance priorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 2024 report records a milestone year for First Advantage, marked by its acquisition of Sterling Check Corp., that closed on Oct. 31, 2024. Throughout this period of growth, First Advantage reaffirmed its sustainability focus areas: people and community, environment and climate, governance and accountability, and policy and process-all while upholding its values and elevating stakeholder trust.</p><p>Highlights covered in First Advantage's 2024 Sustainability Impact Report include:</p><p>* Culture and Inclusion Post-Acquisition: Following the Sterling acquisition, the company updated its Culture &amp; Inclusion (C&amp;I) priorities to reflect a unified vision. Employee Resource Groups were expanded and rebranded to Employee Impact Groups, and inclusion strategies were integrated across both legacy organizations, reinforcing a culture where every employee feels seen, heard, and valued.</p><p>* Upskilling and Leadership Development: Employees across 19 countries completed 131,740 training hours. The company also introduced The FA Way; a structured technical training methodology designed to eliminate waste in learning design and accelerate time to productivity by enabling trainees to perform independently sooner. This initiative resulted in a 74% increase in the speed at which new hires became ready to work on live cases. Additionally, the company scaled its award-winning leadership development program, SOAR, to support approximately 100 managers and emerging leaders, equipping them with the skills to lead with purpose, empathy, and effectiveness.</p><p>* Climate Resilience and Emissions Reporting: The company advanced its alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) by conducting third-party assessments of Scope 1, 2, and 3 greenhouse gas emissions. It also continued to consolidate physical office spaces, reduce non-essential business travel, and expand remote work to improve operational resilience.</p><p>* Strengthening Trust Through Data Privacy and Compliance: The company maintained its ISO 27001 and ISO 27701 certifications, with Australian operations newly certified in 2024. Additionally, it earned Data Privacy Framework certifications across its EU, UK, and Swiss locations, reflecting its global commitment to data protection and regulatory compliance.</p><p>* Supplier Excellence and Resilience: The company initiated the onboarding of suppliers acquired through the Sterling acquisition to its supplier platform, enabling the assessment of these suppliers for 2025. All suppliers are required to adhere to a standardized Code of Business Conduct which outlines key expectations for ethical and responsible business practices.</p><p>* Governance and Corporate Oversight: The company demonstrated its commitment to strong governance through a well-qualified board of directors, composed of individuals from various backgrounds who oversee the Audit, Compensation, and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committees.</p><p>\"In 2024, our sustainability efforts became even more vital as we welcomed Sterling to First Advantage. Our combination provides an opportunity not just to grow, but to lead-with a deeper sense of purpose, responsibility, and impact. Together, we are building a global software and data company that puts people first, operates responsibly, and helps our customers make smarter, more informed decisions,\" Scott Staples, CEO of First Advantage said.</p><p>\"This report is more than a summary of progress-it's a statement of intent. We're committed to operating with integrity, transparency, and an unrelenting focus on long-term sustainability as we continue to grow and evolve as the new First Advantage,\" Staples concluded.</p><p>The 2024 Sustainability Report includes disclosures aligned with both the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) standards for the professional and commercial services industry and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.</p><p>To view the full report, visit: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investors.fadv.com/sustainability\">https://investors.fadv.com/sustainability</url></p><p>About First AdvantageFirst Advantage (NASDAQ: FA) is a leading provider of global software and data in the HR technology industry.

While this backlog growth and operational improvements are occurring later in the year than we expected due to slower bidding activity related to previous macroeconomic uncertainties and challenges on remaining Non-Core Projects, we are encouraged by our progress so far and the rebound in the infrastructure market both with public and private clients,\" said Ural Yal, Chief Executive Officer of Shimmick.</p><p>Financial Results</p><p>A summary of our results is included in the table below: </p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">                  Three Months Ended               Six Months Ended         <br/><br/> (In millions,                    June 28,                          June 28,     <br/> except per    July 4, 2025       2024       July 4, 2025       2024      <br/> share data)                                                                     <br/><br/> Revenue       $         128   $        91   $         251   $       211  <br/><br/> Gross margin             8          (31 )            13          (47 ) <br/><br/> Net loss                                                                        <br/> attributable             (9            (51              (18            (85   <br/> to Shimmick                                                                     <br/> Corporation                )              )                )              ) <br/><br/> Adjusted net             (5            (45              (12            (74   <br/> loss                       )              )                )              ) <br/><br/> Adjusted                  -

(2) Projects that started under prior ownership or focus on foundation drilling are referred to as \"Non-Core Projects\" (formerly referred to as \"Legacy and Foundations Projects\"). The Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of foundation drilling Non-Core Projects in the second quarter of 2024 and continued to wind down remaining work during the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year and six months ended July 4, 2025. As a result, revenue from foundation drilling Non-Core Projects will continue to decline during the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year.</p><p>Shimmick Projects</p><p>Projects started after the AECOM Sale Transaction (\"Shimmick Projects\") have focused on critical infrastructure aligned with our strategy, including water, climate resilience, energy transition and sustainable transportation. Revenue recognized on Shimmick Projects was $113 million and $84 million for the three months ended July 4, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. The $29 million increase in revenue was primarily the result of $18 million of revenue from a California Palisades fire clean-up project and $18 million of revenue from new water and infrastructure projects ramping up, partially offset by a $7 million decrease from lower activity on existing projects and projects winding down. </p><p>Gross margin recognized on Shimmick Projects was $15 million and $5 million for the three months ended July 4, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. The $10 million increase in the gross margin was primarily the result of $6 million in gross margin from new water and infrastructure projects ramping up and $4 million in gross margin from a California Palisades fire clean-up project.</p><p>Non-Core Projects</p><p>As part of the AECOM Sale Transaction, we acquired projects and backlog that were started under prior ownership (formerly referred to a \"Legacy and Foundations Projects\"). Separately, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our foundation drilling Non-Core Projects in the second quarter of 2024 and continued to wind down the remaining work which is largely completed.</p><p>Non-Core Projects revenue was $16 million and $7 million for the three months ended July 4, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. The $9 million increase was primarily the result of the settlement of a claim on a large Non-Core Loss Project, which included a reduction to revenue during the three months ended June 28, 2024, which did not reoccur during the three months ended July 4, 2025.</p><p>Gross margin recognized on Non-Core Projects was $(7) million for the three months ended July 4, 2025 as compared to $(36) million for the three months ended June 28, 2024. The $29 million increase was primarily the result of the settlement of a claim discussed above, which included a reduction to revenue and did not reoccur during the three months ended July 4, 2025.</p><p>A subset of Non-Core Projects (\"Non-Core Loss Projects\") have experienced significant cost overruns due to the COVID pandemic, design issues, legal costs and other factors. In the Non-Core Loss Projects, we have recognized the estimated costs to complete and the loss expected from these projects. If the estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a further loss, the entire amount of the additional loss expected over the life of the project is recognized as a period cost in the cost of revenue. As these Non-Core Loss Projects continue to wind down to completion, no further gross margin will be recognized and in some cases, there may be additional costs associated with these projects. Revenue recognized on these Non-Core Loss Projects was $13 million and $(7) million for the three months ended July 4, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. Gross margin recognized on these Non-Core Loss Projects was $(3) million and $(32) million for the three months ended July 4, 2025 and June 28, 2024, respectively. The change in gross margin was primarily the result of the settlement of a claim discussed above, which included a reduction to revenue and which did not reoccur during the three months ended July 4, 2025.</p><p>Selling, general and administrative expenses</p><p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $4 million primarily driven by the continued implementation of our Transformation Plan.</p><p>Equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures</p><p>Equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased by $2 million during the three months ended July 4, 2025 primarily as the result of elevated costs due to schedule extensions experienced during the three months ended June 28, 2024 which did not reoccur during the three months ended July 4, 2025.</p><p>Gain on sale of assets</p><p>Gain on sale of assets decreased by $4 million during the three months ended July 4, 2025 primarily due to the gain recognized on the sale of the assets of foundation drilling Non-Core Projects during the second quarter of 2024.</p><p>Interest expense</p><p>Interest expense remained approximately flat period over period.</p><p>Other (income) expense, net</p><p>Other (income) expense, net increased by $2 million during the three months ended July 4, 2025 primarily as the result of a $1 million loss recognized on the settlement of certain claims with AECOM as well as other costs incurred during the three months ended June 28, 2024 which did not reoccur during the three months ended July 4, 2025.</p><p>Income tax expense</p><p>Due to an expected tax loss for the fiscal year ending 2025 and a realized tax loss for the fiscal year ended 2024, no income tax expense was recorded for either the three months ended July 4, 2025 or the three months ended June 28, 2024.</p><p>Net loss</p><p>Net loss decreased by $43 million to a net loss of $8 million for the three months ended July 4, 2025, primarily due to increase in gross margin of $39 million, decrease in salary, general and administrative expenses of $4 million, decrease in equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures of $2 million and increase in other (income) expense, net of $2 million, partially offset by decrease in the gain on the sale of assets of $4 million, all as described above.</p><p>Diluted loss per common share attributable to Shimmick Corporation was $(0.25) for the three months ended July 4, 2025, compared to diluted loss per common share of $(1.83) for the three months ended June 28, 2024.</p><p>Adjusted net loss was $(5) million for the three months ended July 4, 2025, compared to an adjusted net loss of $(45) million for the three months ended June 28, 2024.</p><p>Adjusted diluted loss per common share attributable to Shimmick Corporation was $(0.14) for the three months ended July 4, 2025, compared to $(1.60) for the three months ended June 28, 2024.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was $(0.2) million for the three months ended July 4, 2025, compared to $(40) million for the three months ended June 28, 2024.</p><p>Outlook and Guidance</p><p>\"Due to stronger first-half revenue performance in both Shimmick and Non-Core Projects, we are increasing our full-year revenue guidance. Non-Core Projects revenue increase is driven by putting more non-core work in place due to increased efforts towards completing these projects. Shimmick Projects showed strong gross margins in the first half which we expect to continue into the second half, while Non-Core Projects' gross margin came in near the low end of guidance for the first half. While we expect higher revenue burn in both Shimmick Projects and Non-Core Projects for the full year, it creates an unfavorable gross margin mix impact as a result of the Non-Core revenue increase being a higher percentage of our total revenue for the year. We now expect Adjusted EBITDA for the full year of between $5 million and $15 million,\" said Todd Yoder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>We are updating our full year 2025 fiscal year guidance and now expect:</p><p>* Shimmick Projects revenue in the range of $405 million and $415 million, up from our initial guidance of $392 million to $410 million, with overall gross margin between 9% and 12%</p><p>* Non-Core Projects revenue in the range of $80 million and $90 million, up from our initial guidance of $50 million to $60 million, with overall gross margin between (15%) and (5%)</p><p>* Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA between $5 million and $15 million, down from our initial guidance of $15 million to $25 million</p><p>Conference Call and Webcast Information</p><p>Shimmick will host a video webcast conference call on Thursday, August 14, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

Measures</p><p>Adjusted Net Loss and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Common Share</p><p>Adjusted net loss represents Net loss attributable to Shimmick Corporation adjusted to eliminate stock-based compensation, legal fees and other costs for Non-Core Projects and other costs. We have also made an adjustment for transformation costs we have incurred including advisory costs in connection with settling outstanding claims, exiting the Non-Core Projects and transforming the Company to shift our strategy to meet the nation's growing need for water and other critical infrastructure and grow our business.</p><p>We have included Adjusted net loss in this press release because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget and to develop short and long-term operational plans.

Business decision makers can use this component to evaluate region-specific sustainability risks and opportunities. - Global coverage with local relevance: With key markets in North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia-Pacific, the Atlas delivers insights relevant to diverse geographies and industries. - Industry-specific insights: Covering key sectors such as energy, financial services, manufacturing, and retail, the Atlas can be used to extract industry-specific insights. For example, business leaders in the energy sector can use it to track and compare their company's progress within the industry on reducing emissions. Policy researchers, designing targeted industrial regulation, may use the Atlas to identify and prioritize the key sustainability challenges for different sectors.</p><p>Jonathan Birdwell, Global Head of Policy &amp; Insights, Economist Impact, said, \"Over the past decade, Economist Impact has built dozens of indices and published hundreds of reports across a wide range of sustainability topics from food security to plastics management, to climate resilience.

This means taking into consideration both financial and non-financial information not only to evaluate our performance, but also to assess our risk profile and evaluate the opportunities available to Swissquote.\"</p><p>YVAN CARDENAS</p><p>CFO</p><p>[[Sustainability Report  Annual Report 2024  264</p><p>]]</p><p>OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>OUR UNDERSTANDING</p><p>We strive to deliver long term sustainable value to society and aim to prioritise the application of ESG criteria in our strategic decisions and day-to-day activities.</p><p>At Swissquote, our mission to \"democratise finance and empower our clients to achieve their financial goals\" serves as the foundation of our sustainability efforts. Our sustainability strategy brings this mission to life through five key pillars, each reflecting our commitment to creating long- term value for all stakeholders: innovation and technology, responsible business conduct, customer centricity, sustainable growth and value creation and employee engagement.</p><p>For us, this means that we challenge convention on the delivery of innovation and technology, constantly pioneering</p><p>new and better ways of banking. We build relationships based on trust, conducting our business responsibly and transparently. We champion our customers by delivering exceptional products and services, creating a bespoke user experience that enhances as well as eases banking and investment decision-making, and we relentlessly seek out our clients' opinions to understand their needs, motivations and aspirations. We cherish our employees and work hard to make Swissquote an attractive place to work. Our understanding of sustainability drives us to deliver sustainable growth and create value for all our stakeholders, which includes reducing our environmental footprint.</p><p>Our five key pillars are directly connected with our material topics and since 2024 to specific UN Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs). Aligning our sustainability strategy with the UN SDGs enhances transparency and credibility in our reporting, showcasing our commitment to globally recognised standards.</p><p>[[Sustainability Report  Annual Report 2024  265</p><p>]]</p><p>OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>BUSINESS MODEL</p><p>Swissquote originated as a financial platform that revolutionised Swiss securities trading in 1996 by offering free access to the pricing of all securities traded on the Swiss Exchange. Today, Swissquote is a global financial group with main presence in Switzerland and offices in Gland, Zurich,</p><p>Bern, London, Hong Kong, Dubai, Luxembourg, Singapore, St. Julian's, Limassol, Bucharest and Cape Town. With 1,217 employees including 1,006 in Switzerland, we generate an operating income exceeding CHF 660 million.</p><p>The following visual representation illustrates our value chain, highlighting the key activities, resources, and stakeholders that drive value creation across our business.</p><p>SWISSQUOTE VALUE CHAIN</p><p>Our strategy stems from our clear vision: to be the first bank for digital-first mass affluent traders and investors, challenging the code to deliver innovative services and products that make financial opportunities accessible to ambitious, self-directed people.</p><p>Our strategy centres on the long-term growth of our operations, emphasising innovative products, enhancing client experience, and expanding into new markets. To achieve sustainable growth, we carefully balance profitability and capital efficiency. We have pioneered online securities trading and steadily expanded our services over the years. Today, we have become a digital universal bank and our business model stands on three core pillars:</p><p>* The Trade pillar provides a comprehensive app covering all trading needs: securities, forex, CFDs, cryptocurrencies, and thematic trading. Notably, we were the first Swiss multi-asset platform to offer cryptocurrencies.</p><p>* The Invest pillar makes investing and saving accessible, offering portfolio solutions, sustainable investing, and savings plans.</p><p>* The Bank pillar includes services like debit cards, online payments, eMortgages, and loans.</p><p>Together, these pillars create a holistic financial ecosystem, ensuring seamless access to trading, investing, and banking solutions. Additionally, the company's treasury function</p><p>[[Sustainability Report  Annual Report 2024  266</p><p>]]</p><p>OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>oversees Swissquote strategy for safeguarding financial interests including risk management strategies, regulatory compliance, and the integration of ESG criteria into our own investment decisions. This approach is designed to protect Swissquote's assets and boost long-term risk-adjusted returns for our stakeholders.</p><p>We offer over three million tradable financial products online across all types of financial instruments, ensuring a superior customer experience with competitive and transparent pricing. In addition to trading and investment, we offer high-quality 36degree banking and credit solutions ensuring a holistic and customer-centric approach.</p><p>Swissquote collaborates with a broad network of business partners to create value across the financial ecosystem. These include financial partners such as banks, stock and crypto exchanges, brokers, prime brokers, liquidity providers, and market makers. Additionally, we engage with suppliers such as data feed providers, software engineering firms, IT infrastructure providers, office space landlords, and professional service firms, including those in advertising, sponsorship, consulting, and law. Other key inputs the group relies on in its value creation process are capital and infrastructure (financial resources coming from shareholders and customers as well as infrastructures such as public infrastructure and physical fixed assets supporting financial stability and sustainable growth), employees and know-how (human and intellectual capital driving innovation, ensuring compliance and the delivery of high-quality services) and regulations (adhering to relevant regulations ensuring transparency, financial security, and compliance with legal and ethical standards, reinforcing the bank's credibility). As a digital financial services provider, our value chain primarily consists of capital, software, and data flows, with limited physical transactions. Our influence on stakeholders is proportional to the size of our operations. While we have identified a limited impact on our upstream business partners, we serve two key customer segments on the downstream side:</p><p>* Private clients</p><p>* Institutional clients</p><p>Indeed, with a diverse range of products and services, we cater to all types of customers, including retail, affluent and high-net-worth individuals (HNWI), corporate, family offices, fund managers, asset managers, brokers, and banks. For details on how we integrate ESG criteria into our solutions (including ESG bonuses on Lombard loans and Swissquote's ESG tools) refer to the sections on Innovation, product governance, and access to finance.</p><p>The revenue model is diversified, with income generated from both transactional and non-transactional sources.</p><p>Transactional income (52%) comes from trade commissions, FX transactions, eForex, and crypto-related revenues. Non- transactional income (48%) is driven by custody and management fees, interest income, and other non- transactional revenues. This diversification allows us to benefit from market conditions while maintaining a stable income stream from our multi-asset platform and banking services.</p><p>Our business model implies that Swissquote does not typically hold a management mandate or decision-making authority on its customers' assets. As a result, these assets qualify as assets under custody rather than assets under management GRI2-6.</p><p>ESG GOVERNANCE</p><p>Sustainability is an integral part of Swissquote's strategy. Swissquote's Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for all environmental, social and governance (ESG) decisions and supervises the achievement of the objectives assigned to the Executive Management and, indirectly, to employees eligible for cash bonuses, which include ESG-related objectives. The Board consists of eight members and has two board committees that make recommendations to the Board on specific matters. These two committees have specific functions related to non-financial matters as defined in the publicly available dedicated charters.</p><p>In particular, it is worth noting that:</p><p>* As part of its activities, the Audit &amp; Risk Committee monitors non-financial reporting processes and internal controls, provides recommendations to the Board on reporting frameworks and standards as well as assurance scope, reviews the content of the non-financial report and assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities related to non-financial reporting.</p><p>* The Nomination &amp; Remuneration Committee follows up on the achievement of annual objectives assigned to the Executive Management and indirectly employees eligible for cash bonuses, which include ESG-related objectives.</p><p>Please refer to page 316 of the Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures Report for more details about their respective roles.</p><p>An overview of the Board and its committees, including their functions and responsibilities, can be found in the Corporate Governance Report starting on page 174. None of the Board members undertakes activities, holds mandates or has vested interests other than described in Section 3.1 starting on page 183. For more information on activities and</p><p>[[Sustainability Report  Annual Report 2024  267</p><p>]]</p><p>OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>vested interests of the Board, see Corporate Governance Report, page 191 GRI2-15.</p><p>In 2023, all Board members attended ESG training, including a refresher on double materiality. The session covered ESG demand drivers, Board responsibilities, Swissquote's sustainability journey, and peer practices GRI 2- 17. The Board delegates the duties of implementing the business strategy, including sustainability matters, to the Executive Management, which reports back to the Board of Directors during Board meetings or otherwise as appropriate GRI2-13. A cross-departmental working group overseen by the Executive Management is in charge of assisting with the implementation of the strategy and meets at least annually. It comprises members of the management and employees from various departments such as Finance, Human Resources, Legal, Controlling and Risk, Asset and Liability Management and Treasury, Marketing, Product Strategy, IT and Security, Software engineering, Data Management, Building and Support, and Investor Relations. The Executive Management oversees the progress made on the sustainability strategy.</p><p>The Chair of the Board ensures that all relevant matters are part of the Board meeting agenda and subject to an appropriatefollow-up(at least annually). Relevant matters include, among others, strategy, business, financial risks, risk management, compliance matters as well as sustainability (including environmental risks).ESG-relatedtopics and risks are presented to the Board mainly during the Annual Conference on Risks and the Strategy Board meeting (unless otherwise commended by the circumstances) GRI 2-12.Depending on the topic of concern, the corresponding department will prepare dedicated reporting to the Board including negative impacts and remediation measures, if applicable. For example,employee-relatedtopics are part of the reporting from the Human Resources department to the Board of Directors GRI 2-25.For more information on the governance structure and composition, nomination and selection processes, together with details on the Chair of the Board, see Corporate Governance Report, pages193-201 GRI 2-9, GRI 2-10, GRI 2-11, GRI 2-12.</p><p>The purpose of Swissquote's remuneration policy is to encourage the delivery of long-term sustainable growth and performance to shareholders, promote our vision and strategy and foster the achievement of our sustainability goals. The policy is designed to attract and retain qualified employees and reward achievements as well as long-term performance. It is also elaborated with due care to the Group's success and stage of development and align the interests of the Board and the Executive Management with those of shareholders.</p><p>The objectives assigned by the Board of Directors to the Executive Management as well as indirectly to employees</p><p>eligible for cash bonuses are classified in three categories: financial objectives, growth objectives and ESG objectives (15% weight). These objectives are derived from the materiality assessment, which is a cornerstone of the Group's sustainability strategy. For more information on the remuneration policy and how it is determined, see the Remuneration Report pages 222- 254 GRI2-19, GRI2-20.</p><p>In line with our commitment to transparency, our Code of Conduct, Supplier Code of Conduct, Speak Up (Whistleblowing) Policy, as well as some other key Sustainability policies are publicly available on our website, under the corporate documents section.</p><p>The Board of Directors approved sustainability-related materiality matrix and the Sustainability Report as part of the Annual Report prior to publication GRI2-14,GRI3-1.</p><p>[[Sustainability Report  Annual Report 2024  268</p><p>]]</p><p>OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>MATERIALITY ASSESSMENT</p><p>Our aim is to present our contribution to society in a credible way. This includes focusing on topics where we, as a specialised financial services provider, can make a difference. By engaging with our stakeholders and analysing the issues that matter most, we ensure our efforts drive positive change where it counts. Swissquote has determined the most relevant topics by assessing the impacts of its business activities on sustainable development and the relevance of these topics on Swissquote's long-term success. These priorities form the foundation of our sustainability strategy and reporting.</p><p>In 2023 we conducted a comprehensive double materiality assessment. Laws, standards and frameworks, as well as partners and competitors, were included in the analysis. We evaluated topics based on potential impacts from both an outside-in (financial materiality) and inside-out (impact materiality) perspective and finally identified 15 topics as material. For more details on this process, please refer to our Sustainability Report 2023.</p><p>In 2024, we decided to conduct interviews with external experts to assess the need for changes and updates to the</p><p>matrix. With the support of external consultants, semi- structured interviews were held with several third-party experts with a diverse range of expertise. The purpose of these discussions was to critically review and, if necessary, update the material topics, as well as to refine the descriptions of the identified topics, impacts, risks, and opportunities. The experts were asked to evaluate the current materiality assessment based on the descriptions of material and less material (descoped) topics, as well as their impacts, risks, and opportunities within their field of expertise. Discussions included reflecting on potential adjustments to topic descriptions and expanding the scope of existing topics based notably on industry developments in the past 12 months.</p><p>The experts interviewed confirmed the relevance of all material topics in Swissquote's current materiality matrix.</p><p>Following the expert discussions, we merged the topics \"Product governance\" and \"Innovation and access to finance\" due to thematic proximity and relabeled the topic \"Environment and climate resilience\", allowing us to capture our latest efforts to collect and disclose a larger range of environmental data. For the reporting year, 14 topics were defined as material.</p><p>Our materiality matrix GRI3-2</p><p>[[BUSINESSSUCCESS VERYHIGH                    ?Customer  ?Business    ?Innovation,                                             experience continuity   product                                                             and</p><p>?Compensation ?Diversity,   governance                 and benefits  equity and    and access</p><p>?Financial   IT                                                                  performance  resilience</p><p>?Talent      ?Compliance, to                                                            recruitment, governance   finance</p><p>development  and ethics                                                                 and                                                                                     retention</p><p>?Data                                                                            privacy and                                                                      security</p><p>TERM-</p><p>HIGH                          ?Transparency inclusion                                             and</p><p>?Prudent                                                                         investment</p><p>LONG                                                   credibility                                                                      in the                                                                           market</p><p>approach</p><p>RELEVANCEFOR                                           ?Environment                                                                            and</p><p>MEDIUM                                      climate                                                                          resilience</p><p>?Protection                                                         of human                                                            rights</p><p>?Social                                                                                 engagements                                                                             with</p><p>communities</p><p>LOW</p><p>LOW                      MEDIUM       HIGH         VERY                                                                                    HIGH</p><p>]]</p><p>IMPACT RELEVANCE OF OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES ON PEOPLE, PLANET AND ECONOMY</p><p>[[Sustainability Report  Annual Report 2024  269</p><p>]]</p><p>OUR COMMITMENT TO SUSTAINABILITY</p><p>STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT</p><p>We strive to integrate our stakeholders' perspectives at the core of our business strategy.

These segments remain critical to national priorities and are benefiting from public and private investments, positioning us well for continued growth,\" said Ural Yal, Chief Executive Officer of Shimmick.</p><p>Financial Results</p><p>A summary of our results is included in the table below: </p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">                                         Three Months Ended                   <br/><br/> (In millions, except per      April 4, 2025             March 29, 2024       <br/> share data)                                                                     <br/><br/> Revenue                  $                    122   $                   120  <br/><br/> Gross margin             $                      5   $                   (16 ) <br/><br/> Net loss attributable to $                    (10 )  $                   (33 ) <br/> Shimmick Corporation                                                            <br/><br/> Adjusted net loss        $                     (7 )  $                   (29 ) <br/><br/> Adjusted EBITDA          $                     (3 )  $                   (24 ) <br/><br/> Diluted loss per common                                                         <br/> share attributable to    $                  (0.28 )  $                 (1.30 ) <br/> Shimmick Corporation                                                            <br/><br/> Adjusted diluted loss                                                           <br/> per common share         $                  (0.22 )  $                 (1.15 ) <br/> attributable to Shimmick                                                        <br/> Corporation                                                                     <br/><br/></pre></p><p>The following table presents revenue and gross margin data for the three months ended April 4, 2025 compared to the three months ended March 29, 2024: </p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">                                         Three Months Ended                   <br/><br/> (In millions, except           April 4, 2025            March 29, 2024       <br/> percentage data)                                                                <br/><br/> Shimmick Projects(1)                                                       <br/><br/> Revenue                   $                    93    $                  90   <br/><br/> Gross Margin              $                     5    $                  (1 )  <br/><br/> Gross Margin (%)                               6 %                     (2 )% <br/><br/> Legacy and Foundations                                                     <br/> Projects(2)                                                                     <br/><br/> Revenue                   $                    29    $                  30   <br/><br/> Gross Margin              $                    (1 )   $                 (15 )  <br/><br/> Gross Margin (%)                              (2 )%                   (52 )% <br/><br/> Consolidated Total                                                         <br/><br/> Revenue                   $                   122    $                 120   <br/><br/> Gross Margin              $                     5    $                 (16 )  <br/><br/> Gross Margin (%)                               4 %                    (13 )% <br/><br/></pre></p><p>(1) Shimmick Projects are those projects started after prior ownership that have focused on water, climate resilience, energy transition, and sustainable transportation. (2) Legacy Projects are those projects started under prior ownership. Projects that focus on foundation drilling are referred to as \"Foundations Projects\". The Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of non-core foundation projects in the second quarter of 2024 and continued to wind down remaining work during the remainder of the 2024 fiscal year and three months ended April 4, 2025. As a result, revenue from Foundations Projects will continue to decline during the remainder of the 2025 fiscal year.</p><p>Shimmick Projects</p><p>Projects started after the AECOM Sale Transaction (\"Shimmick Projects\") have focused on critical infrastructure aligned with our strategy, including water, climate resilience, energy transition and sustainable transportation. Revenue recognized on Shimmick Projects was $93 million and $90 million for the three months ended April 4, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively. The $3 million increase in revenue was primarily the result of $13 million of revenue from a California Palisades fire clean-up project and $10 million of revenue from new water and infrastructure projects ramping up, partially offset by a $20 million decrease from lower activity on existing projects and projects winding down. </p><p>Gross margin recognized on Shimmick Projects was $5 million and $(1) million for the three months ended April 4, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively. The $6 million increase in the gross margin was primarily the result of $3 million in gross margin from a California Palisades fire clean-up project and $3 million in gross margin from new water and infrastructure projects ramping up.</p><p>Legacy and Foundations Projects</p><p>As part of the AECOM Sale Transaction, we acquired the Legacy Projects and backlog that were started under prior ownership. The Company entered into an agreement to sell the assets of our non-core Foundations Projects in the second quarter of 2024 and continued to wind down the remaining work which is largely completed.</p><p>Legacy and Foundations Projects revenue was $29 million and $30 million for the three months ended April 4, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively. The $1 million decrease was due to the Company working to wind down these projects.</p><p>Gross margin was $(1) million for the three months ended April 4, 2025 as compared to $(15) million for the three months ended March 29, 2024. The $14 million increase was primarily the result of cost increases for time and design-related schedule extensions identified during the first quarter of 2024 which did not reoccur during the three months ended April 4, 2025.</p><p>A subset of Legacy Projects (\"Legacy Loss Projects\") have experienced significant cost overruns due to the COVID pandemic, design issues, legal costs and other factors. In the Legacy Loss Projects, we have recognized the estimated costs to complete and the loss expected from these projects. If the estimates of costs to complete fixed-price contracts indicate a further loss, the entire amount of the additional loss expected over the life of the project is recognized as a period cost in the cost of revenue. As these Legacy Loss Projects continue to wind down to completion, no further gross margin will be recognized and in some cases, there may be additional costs associated with these projects. Revenue recognized on these Legacy Loss Projects was $18 million and $15 million for the three months ended April 4, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively. Gross margin recognized on these Legacy Loss Projects was $(2) million and $(11) million for the three months ended April 4, 2025 and March 29, 2024, respectively. The change in gross margin was primarily the result of cost increases for time and design-related schedule extensions identified during the first quarter of 2024 which did not reoccur during the three months ended April 4, 2025.</p><p>Selling, general and administrative expenses</p><p>Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $2 million primarily as a result of reduced salary, bonus and legal expenses incurred during the three months ended April 4, 2025 as compared to the three months ended March 29, 2024.</p><p>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures</p><p>Equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures remained approximately flat period over period.</p><p>Gain (loss) on sale of assets</p><p>Gain (loss) on sale of assets remained approximately flat period over period.</p><p>Interest expense and Other (income) expense, net</p><p>Interest expense and other (income) expense, net remained approximately flat period over period.</p><p>Income tax expense</p><p>Due to an expected tax loss for the fiscal year ending 2025 and fiscal year ended 2024, no income tax expense was recorded in either period.</p><p>Net loss</p><p>Net loss decreased by $24 million to a net loss of $10 million for the three months ended April 4, 2025, primarily due to increase in gross margin of $21 million and decrease in salary, general and administrative expenses of $2 million as described above.</p><p>Diluted loss per common share was $(0.28) for the three months ended April 4, 2025, compared to diluted loss per common share of $(1.30) for the same period in 2024.</p><p>Adjusted net loss was $(7) million for the three months ended April 4, 2025, compared to an adjusted net loss of $(29) million for the same period in 2024.</p><p>Adjusted diluted loss per common share was $(0.22) for the three months ended April 4, 2025, compared to $(1.15) for the same period in 2024.</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA was $(3) million for the three months ended April 4, 2025, compared to $(24) million for the same period in 2024.</p><p>Fiscal Year 2025 Guidance</p><p>For the full 2025 fiscal year, we expect:</p><p>* Shimmick Projects revenue to increase 10% to 15%, with overall gross margin between 9% and 12%</p><p>* Legacy Projects and Foundations Projects revenue between $50 million and $60 million with gross margin between (5)% and (15)% as we complete these projects</p><p>* Adjusted EBITDA between $15 million and $25 million.</p><p>\"We are pleased with our first quarter results and the momentum it provides to start 2025. We grew our top-line, slightly, while achieving significant improvement in our gross margin for the quarter, year-over-year. The results are a testament to the work the team is doing to advance our strategy, which is centered around building a Sustainable Backlog, with a renewed focus on Operational Excellence and People and Culture. While we continue to closely monitor the fluidity of tariff policy, at this point we are reaffirming our full year guidance, and we expect to deliver results in our previously stated guidance ranges,\" said Todd Yoder, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.</p><p>Conference Call and Webcast Information</p><p>Shimmick will host a video webcast conference call on Wednesday, May 14, 2025 at 5:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

I'm Sophie Lang, Head of Investor Relations, and our session today will be hosted by our CEO, Peter Feld, and our CFO, Peter Vanneste.</p><p>After the presentation, we'll have a Q&amp;A session for investors and analysts and, as normal, please limit yourself to no more than two questions.</p><p>Before we start, please take note of the disclaimer on slide two, and I'd also like to remind you that today's session is being recorded. And, with that, I will hand you over to our CEO, Peter Feld.</p><p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p><p>Key Highlights</p><p>Peter Feld, Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Thank you very much, Sophie, and good morning and good day from my side. Thank you for joining our Half-Year Results Presentation today.</p><p>As you are fully aware, we are, today, in a never-seen environment, also in our chocolate industry. On one side, we have the pleasure to create little happy moments for millions of consumers and to operate in a category that will prevail to be a growth opportunity globally.</p><p>It is also very good to see that we have started our next level investment programme already 18 months ago, and we're strongly progressing delivering on our set course. However, we must recognise today that we're sailing through what one could call a perfect storm right now.</p><p>The key thing that I want to leave with you is we are here to play to win. We're in an unprecedented bean price volatility environment, as we have experienced in the last 12 months, which, especially in the last course, has significantly impacted customer behaviour and, hence, our financial performance in the short term.</p><p>We're enhancing our operating and financing model in the new market reality to deleverage and to drive higher returns. This will take some time to be fully implemented in the market.</p><p>Given offsetting costs from highly disruptive and volatile environment, we will anticipate a 12- month delay to fully reflect the Barry Callebaut's next level savings into the bottom line.</p><p>We're confirming the initial plan of CHF 250m synergies and 75% of that to flow through into the P&amp;L. So, ultimately, we're building Barry Callebaut into an even stronger leader and unlocking sustainable, profitable growth for our next decade.</p><p>So, when we step back a little bit and look at the past 12 months, and one can say we've seen a never ever experienced impact from highly volatile and spiking bean prices in the sourcing countries. The most important thing I want to share though today is that we believe that the bean price in the terminal market has disconnected to a good degree from the reality of what it takes to actually farm a cacao bean and price to that.</p><p>2</p><p>So, we've seen significantly higher and more volatile bean prices, with prices almost doubling on average year on year, and it's good, then, to see that the market has self-corrected itself, probably at around 10,000 GBP for the second time in February.</p><p>The exchange open interest more than 60% lower than February 2024. All of that has, obviously, had a significant impact to the entire industry. Operating costs are sky high right now, with initial margins nine times higher than before. Stronger backwardation creates higher cost to roll short futures, 65% more expensive in the first half year peak. We also see significantly higher carry costs given the market prices in this environment that impact our short-term results.</p><p>The surplus in the harvest in 2024/25, as we indicated earlier to you, is coming through but about with an 8% increase year on year. Remember, the downwards trend in the last year's crop was about 20% to 30% depending on the crop and the sourcing country.</p><p>We, at Barry Callebaut, have secured bean supply into early 2026 to safeguard our paths going forward and protect our customers' deliveries.</p><p>So, when we sum this up then, you know, next to the turbulences that we've seen in the bean price, we, obviously, also have a shifting macroeconomic landscape in the United States which has temporarily paused some network decisions that we were preparing in North America.</p><p>The key achievements that we have is we secured additional liquidity through the euro and the Swiss bond issuances, and that is a major accomplishment that is a strong sentiment to the conviction that our investors have in Barry Callebaut into the journey and the strategy that we've mapped out to you.</p><p>We're also delivering strong progress on all key Barry Callebaut next level initiatives.</p><p>I've, personally, over the past six to eight weeks, had several top-to-top meetings with key customers and, together with them, we're working on shortening our cash cycle to improve the operating in the entire industry.</p><p>And then, as we're understanding more where we're heading, we, clearly, now see our path for the North American network strategy and confirming the investments that we have done there and expanding rapidly to build an even stronger supply environment for our customers globally.</p><p>We're very proud also to talk about the progress we have on Future Farming Initiative, and I will take you through that in a minute.</p><p>Peter Feld, Chief Executive Officer</p><p>Yes. So, let me just maybe continue to talk a bit about the bean price volatility and what has happened.</p><p>So, in general, we are seeing bean prices, obviously, sky high. The chocolate industry, however, and that is the most important thing I want to share with you, will remain the top flavour ingredient for our customers and the number one choice of all consumers globally. We see 84% of consumers that maintain or increase chocolate consumption year on year.</p><p>3</p><p>It is important to reflect that the confectionery pricing has consecutively gone up, so we see value increase in our category as we drive more of the innovation to our customers, and they then unfold that to their consumers.</p><p>And then, as we've mentioned before, the industry will see clear growth through per capita increases and new consumers entering the market in Asia with 2.5 billion consumers coming into the chocolate industry as we speak.</p><p>However, the market turbulences that we've seen on the other side clearly present an opportunity for Barry Callebaut to start from already being the market leader in this attractive, resilient chocolate segment to become an even better partner for our customers.</p><p>We're expanding our full range of chocolatey experiences beyond the chocolate offerings into compound and also into non-cacao alternative offerings.</p><p>We have just launched, in the UK as well as in the Benelux, our non-cacao solutions from precision fermented sunflower seeds offerings that expand the portfolio of Barry Callebaut and offer all the variety of chocolatey experiences for our customers.</p><p>The uniquely vertically integrated global business model from cacao to chocolate is the stronghold of Barry Callebaut and, combined with the unmatched expertise, our large origin country footprint, strong R&amp;D know-how and sustainability capabilities, we can create significant competitive advantage in the market. And, as we've said before already, the strong balance sheet and banking relationships allow us to see through the disruption and the turbulences we currently experience.</p><p>So, going forward, we firmly believe that Barry Callebaut is well positioned to navigate the midterm supply dynamics.</p><p>When you think about the declining production in the Ivory Coast and Ghana that we actually have experienced, we, on the other side, see increases in harvest through growth and new planting in Ecuador and probably stable developments over the other sourcing countries.</p><p>In Barry Callebaut, we have mapped out our two-pronged strategy. First, to really drive change in cocoa farming was our North Star Strategy that is focusing on smallholder farming in current origins, pre-competitive. Here, we are focusing on growing incomes for our farmers, increasing yields and implementing agroforestry to build climate resilience.</p><p>The second element, and that is competitive, is our Future Farming Initiative. Here, we're scaling sustainable high-tech cocoa farming in Brazil. FFI will catalyse the industry and diversify the geographical footprint. Our new CEO for that undertaking, Jorge Costa, has now joined, and he has built, since he came in in October, a strong team, experienced team specifically coming from the citrus and orange large-scale farming in Brazil to join our new Future Farming Initiative. And, just this week, with the Board of Directors, we have established our Board of Directors Committee for Future Farming to safeguard and provide the right governance for this undertaking into the future.</p><p>So, with that, now let me hand over to Peter. Thank you, Peter.</p><p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .</p><p>4</p><p>Financial Update</p><p>Peter Vanneste, Chief Financial Officer</p><p>Thank you. All right and good morning everyone. Let me now walk you through the half year performance in more detail. And, let me start with a short summary maybe.</p><p>We have been operating in an increasingly volatile and highly challenging market environment with a knock-on effect on customer behaviour but also, especially, on the cost of operating in this market, and that goes beyond the bean price, like the massive increases we've seen in futures rolling costs and in financing costs. We are focusing on protecting EBIT with a higher EBIT per tonne.</p><p>We have passed CHF 3bn of higher costs through cost-plus model but, at the same time, the turbulence of the market created an environment where new elements emerged that need to be added to our cost-plus model, and those could not be done at the same speed as the market movements, resulting in a decline of our net profit.</p><p>Our free cash flow was also impacted very much by the cocoa bean price increase, which doubled in one year, to fund a CHF 2bn increase in our inventory values.</p><p>In all of that, we have been successful, as Peter said, to proactively raise financing at good rates, so we have secured comfortable liquidity to operate in this environment.</p><p>Now, starting with how the market dynamics impact volume, as said, cocoa bean price rapidly doubled unprecedented volatility and that has its impact on market pricing and demand and volumes. We've seen some short-term consumer reaction to price increases, but this is also driven, to a good extent, by customer reactions. So, consumer reactions to some point but especially customer reactions playing in this area now.</p><p>Sometimes difficult customer retailer price negotiations with, at some points, limits to shelf availability of some of the products and some food manufacturers also temporarily halted promotions to go to the disruption first. And, in fact, if you look at it in H1, the B2B impact of the cocoa market turbulence has been more pronounced than the B2C impact because we've also seen historically low levels of customer coverage and stock in Half Year One as some customers were taking a wait-and-see approach waiting for bean prices to come down from the high peaks. Sometimes also we've been prudent in light of the retailer discussions on pricing that were going on.</p><p>We've also seen some other selective short-term customer actions, like looking for cost-effective non-cocoa recipe adjustments, compound reformulation, customers implementing more sophisticated multiple pack size changes and so on. And, of course, we're working very closely with our customers through all of that.</p><p>All these factors play a role in our Half Year One volumes but, importantly, all of them are also short term. Mid and long term, we remain very confident in the long-term proven resilience of the chocolate category and all the opportunities that it contains.</p><p>Now, looking at our volume performance, our volume was down 4.7% in Half Year One. In Global Cocoa, we saw, basically, two things; first of all, a decline in our third-party sales as we made intentional decisions to prioritise internal chocolate in a supply constrained environment and also, within that, to focus on more profitable segments. Next to that, the higher prices also</p><p>5</p><p>had their impact in cocoa, with a lower demand for some of the cocoa products, especially something we've seen in AMEA and Central Eastern Europe.</p><p>In Global Chocolate, volume decreased, entirely driven by food manufacturers and, here, the delayed customer orders played a role as did some of the selective customer actions I just mentioned in my previous page. We also saw a negative effect of SKU rationalisation as we reached the end of our important simplification programme there.</p><p>Gourmet has been resilient, delivering 0.7% volume growth with a broad-based recovery to 3.1% in the second quarter.</p><p>Now, looking at the regions now, Western Europe was heavily impacted by the customer dynamics I have just been explaining. The business also faced a high base of comparison in the first quarter with a large one-off contract in the prior year - I talked about that in our last meeting.</p><p>Next to that, the effect of the SKU rationalisation was also material for Western Europe, and particularly in Gourmet.</p><p>Central Eastern Europe saw negative growth, with lower volumes for several large regional and local food manufacturers as well as some intensive competitive local environment, especially in countries like Turkey.</p><p>Volume in North America decreased by less than the overall market. Large food manufacturers in the market and with us saw a decline, and our Mexico intervention on quality also led to some temporary volume softness. However, we grew strongly with regional accounts and had a number of new customer wins that partly helped to offset that pressure and perform better than the market.</p><p>Latin America saw a strong volume growth. Brazil has been the key player here to contribute to growth and, particularly, we've seen a strong momentum there in Gourmet and compound products.</p><p>And, finally, in Asia, Middle East and Africa, excluding China, we've been growing high single digits for the sum of all the other geographies. China, in itself, remains challenged due to the overall economic slowdown for us but for the whole industry.</p><p>Now, importantly, the four strategic growth pillars that we've been talking about in the previous conferences, they remain valid, and they remain resilient.</p><p>Outsourcing has seen some short-term pressures, with FMCG customers also managing through the disruption and all the uncertainties themselves. However, we strongly continue to believe that the intense volatility of the market, that is there to stay, and capital requirements are really a positive driver of outsourcing, and we see that in the ongoing conversations and initiatives we have with customers in that area.</p><p>Gourmet business saw a strong return to growth in the second quarter, and this channel is really expected to continue to drive above average growth for us.</p><p>Specialty chocolates, the third pillar, saw positive growth with, actually, a double-digit improvement in North America, AMEA and LATAM. And, in AMEA, Asia, I talked about it but,</p><p>6</p><p>again, India, Indonesia, Middle East all delivered strong double-digit growth and we are continuing to progress well towards our aim to achieve fair market share in the region and, of course, we are doubling down on China to also address the challenges there. That was volume.</p><p>Now, moving to profit. We had an extremely dynamic market in this half year, and we all witnessed what happened end of November, December, January, doubling bean prices, crazy bean price volatility, extreme market backwardation. This has had a major impact on the industry in three key ways.</p><p>First one, significantly higher financing needs and costs. The speed of the magnitude of the bean price end Q1 and beginning of Q2 was extremely high and that required more financing. And, on top of that, our hedging strategy requires the payment of initial and variation margins.</p><p>So, financing costs increased very rapidly in a short space of time. So, our cost-plus model is designed to pass on financing costs for the long working capital cycle, but these extreme margin payments created a new element in the game and caused a delay in pricing those through.</p><p>The second element is the unprecedented market costs in the environment, backwardation in the cocoa market has steepened during half year one, meaning that the near term, more expensive prices, versus the longer term less expensive prices gap has widened throughout the half year. And this is creating bigger costs to roll short futures, which has been, at some point, at the peak of H1, been 60% more expensive than before. That's a big driver and, of course, that weighs more through when customers, and I'll talk about that later as well, when customers are covered lower, we have more of those futures open to that.</p><p>Second, carry costs for storing, insuring has increased significantly, and differentials have been very volatile throughout the half year.</p><p>Third area is phasing and customer behaviour. Customer orders have been at historically low levels at H1, I've talked about it before, and this, obviously, amplifies the effect of these costs that I have been talking about in the previous points.</p><p>Another element to keep in mind here is the longer pricing cycle in Gourmet. We have price lists to distributors in this channel, which are now three or a bit more months. Now, it's much less than what it was before because we shortened it, but still, that's several months to pass some of that pricing, which, obviously, is slower than what the market has been moving at.</p><p>Historically, also, we've given our customers quite some flexibility in the timing of the contract execution, which, in moments like this, creates, again, a number of costs that need to be managed and we're collaborating well with them on making sure that it is completely under control.</p><p>Now, let's look at the EBIT bridge. Our recurring EBIT increased by 1.5%, as you could see on the left of this chart, 1.5f% in local currencies, with an EBIT per tonne that grew 6.5% versus last year, as we have been focusing on more profitable segments and we benefited from a positive mix, especially, also, both in the channel and in the product segments.</p><p>BC Next Level cost savings amounted to CHF 38m in Half Year One, and they were partly offset by lower volumes and then also additional costs that we carried to navigate through the market disruption.</p><p>7</p><p>Reported EBIT landed at CHF 296m at the very right of the chart, and that's up 74% in local currency.</p><p>One-off costs in this half year were at CHF 35m, and they relate to BC Next Level investments and then the Mexico quality intervention we did in Toluca.</p><p>Recurring net profit, an important metric as well, of course, these days, was, and you can see it at the right of this page, was at CHF 64m, down 69% in local currencies.</p><p>While we did pass a lot of higher costs related to the bean price, market structure and financing, net profit was impacted by a delay in pricing through to our customers given, again, the unprecedented speed and volatility of the market movements, the low levels of customer orders and the longer pricing cycle we have in Gourmet. In particular, as you can see, the financing costs increased by CHF 125m year on year, and we carried significant other costs, as I mentioned before, in the unprecedented environment. We have taken actions to enhance the coverage and the speed of our cost-plus model going forward, of course.</p><p>On cash, no surprise versus last year, these kind of bean price increases significantly impact the cash requirements of the industry. The most pronounced area here, of course, is the bean price itself which directly impacts the value of our inventories. But also, given our strategy to hedge, we face, if the cocoa bean price increases, margin calls that negatively impacts cash flow already before the beans actually enter into our inventories.</p><p>In addition, over the past 18 months, Peter mentioned it, initial margin increased by nine times, a factor of nine, because of the higher volatility. These initial margins is the amount of money that future exchanges require you to pay upfront when you want to buy or sell a future. So, that's an additional cost that really was added.</p><p>And finally, from a phasing perspective, keep in mind that, due to the timing of the cocoa harvest with the peak season just running out, our inventory levels are typically higher at the end of February than they are in August.</p><p>Importantly, we secured additional liquidity, as mentioned already, with the Swiss bond of CHF 300m with the oversubscribed 1.8bn Euro bond. It allows us to take now a proactive approach on upcoming maturities in the next year. And it's important to note that our revolving credit facility is fully untapped at the end of February as it is also fully untapped today.</p><p>Overall, our free cash flow, if you look at the third bar, on the chart you have three last half years. Our free cash flow declined by CHF 2.1bn.</p><p>By far, the dominant driver, and here you need to look at the blue bar, is the CHF 1.7bn impact from the cocoa bean price. This is due to the long cycle between the moment that we contract beans in the sourcing countries and the moment that we sell in the form of chocolate to our customers, with bean prices increasing over the half year from \u00a35,300 end of August to \u00a37,300 at the end of February.</p><p>Next to that, and that's the light brown bar on the chart, we have invested CHF 164m in capex and BC Next Level spend, continuing our investment programme there. And, finally, we saw, and you can see that in the red bar, CHF 200m operational free cash outflow, which hides, actually, strong operational improvements in reducing our cash conversion cycle, so our number of days, but has been offset by higher bean volumes due to the seasonality that we have always between</p><p>8</p><p>February and August, higher finished good stocks due to the demand slowdown that we've seen in the market, keeping our finished good stocks a bit higher at that moment than what we normally have and, of course, here, also, we see some of that impact of the higher interest costs that we have over the half year.</p><p>Now, in this chart, you can see, from top to bottom, total inventory value first, then, below that, our net debt and, below, that our reported and adjusted leverage. In the right box, you see this half year; the left box, you see the fiscal 2023/24 landing.</p><p>Importantly, first of all, in the middle bar, you see our increase of the net debt increasing by CHF 2.3bn to CHF 6.1bn now. Importantly, the vast majority of this increase is explained by a CHF 1.7bn increase in inventory value given the significantly higher bean prices that we've seen rising over the half year. The remainder can be explained by settlement of liquidity swaps and some other working capital movements.</p><p>In the first half, our RMI adjusted net debt over EBITDA, so adjusted leverage, that's the red ball you see on the chart, was 3.1x, which is higher than what we would like to see. Now, I want to note that this RMI, which is all the red parts you see also in the top bars, is the readily marketable inventories, and that definition only comprises of the bean stock, the actual beans.</p><p>The adjusted leverage, the 3.1x, would be significantly lower if we fully adjust it for liquor, butter, powder inventories that we have. So, if you would correct it for more than just the bean stocks.</p><p>It really shows that our debt is fully backed by solid, very solid inventories and, notably, if you look at the top two bars to the right of the chart, the value of our inventories are at CHF 7.3bn, which is CHF 1.2bn higher than our total net debt.</p><p>So, yes, the story of our net debt and our leverage is fully linked to the increasing bean price and, therefore, the value growth of our inventory and, although it sits in the higher inventories, we're very focused on bringing that number and that leverage down without betting on a bean price correction, of course, and also bringing return on invested capital back to where it was before.</p><p>We're taking, therefore, significant actions to address this, which we do expect to take 12 to 18 months to see the full effect. We're pulling all levers, more specifically also on pricing and the working capital cycle, where we work closely with other stakeholders to bring exposure down, but we're also looking to step up inventory-linked financing to manage our liquidity needs more in sync and more in a simple way in our hedging model, but with less exposure to the day-to-day bean price volatility that has increased a lot.</p><p>Finally, of course, we will see the step up from BC Next Level programme in terms of cost savings and capital benefits, the effect of the SKU reduction, the planning excellence initiatives, just to name a few.</p><p>Now, let me recap before I hand over back to Peter, let me recap with a bit more granularity the different initiatives that we are taking. We are gradually pricing for the higher cost of capital to drive return on invested capital, including passing through initial margin and variation margin costs. We are pursuing a broader value pricing opportunity through our Next Level Programme. We're very focused on reducing the length of our long working capital cycle. Again, it's not just us, the whole industry is working that way. We had several top-to-top meetings since January with key customers. We've established joint task forces to look at that. One clear outcome, for instance, is to seek or avoid to reduce costs of the total supply chain, for example, by focusing on</p><p>9</p><p>* Original document</p><p>Disclaimer</p><p>Barry Callebaut AG published this content on April 24, 2025, and is solely responsible for the information contained herein.

As the climate clock is ticking and Europe's energy independence demands faster electrification, the electricity sector needs stronger investments in adaptation measures.</p><p>Over the past decade, extreme climate-related events caused over EUR145 billion in economic losses across the EU. A new report (<url normalizedValue=\"https://resilience.eurelectric.org/\">https://resilience.eurelectric.org/</url>) from industry body Eurelectric documents the amplitude and acceleration of extreme weather impacts on the power sector. In July 2021, floods in Belgium and Germany resulted in 200 000 customer outages. During the winter 2021-2022, storms in the UK and Ireland led to over one million households being without power.</p><p>The latest COP brought the need for climate adaptation to the attention of world leaders. The power sector is already acting and investing now to avoid higher costs later. Such investment is needed in the entire system: both in grids and generation assets.</p><p>Eurelectric Secretary General Kristian Ruby said:</p><p>\"Adaptation to climate change and extreme weather has become a big challenge for power companies. Climate-related resilience is a growing component of utilities' investment strategies and requires all actors to act together: utilities but also policymakers and other sectors which are critical during extreme weather events, such as telecommunications.\"</p><p>The need for grid investments amounts to some EUR400 billion by 2030, out of which 8% (EUR32 billion) would be for resilience. This share is set to grow as the world is not on track for the 1.5\u00b0C scenario.

This result puts Zurich in an excellent position for further growth and allows the Group to return more than USD 5 billion to its shareholders.</p><p>We delivered record returns in 2023, well ahead of all targets for 2023-2025, with particularly strong growth in P&amp;C and Life and highly effective management actions at the Farmers Exchanges. I expect this positive momentum to continue and to achieve EPS growth above 10% over the cycle.</p><p>Mario Greco, Group Chief Executive Officer</p><p>1</p><p>Select financial highlights (unaudited)</p><p>in USD billions, for the 12 months ended December 31, 2023, unless otherwise stated (For a more comprehensive set of financial highlights see page 6)</p><p>[[BOP                  NIAS                 BOPAT ROE</p><p>7.4                  4.4                  23.1%</p><p>20225: 6.1           20225: 4.0           20225: 17.8%</p><p>Change in USD6: 21%  Change in USD6: 10%  Change in USD6: 5.3pts</p><p>]]</p><p>This strong set of results was driven by all of Zurich's businesses. Life contributed a record USD 2.1 billion BOP, and P&amp;C achieved double digit premium growth, well above rate increases of 6%.7 Commercial Insurance showed continued strong returns with a BOP contribution of USD 3.6 billion and a combined ratio of 91.4%. It has made great strides in improving its profitability, by focusing on underwriting discipline, ensuring a balanced portfolio, and simplifying customer and broker interactions through enhanced connectivity and data analytics capabilities.</p><p>The excellent results of the Life business reflect the ongoing successful execution of the Group's Life strategy that focuses on protection and capital light savings business. Top-line growth was strong in all parts of the business, contributing to profit growth. Long-term insurance saw an increase in new business premiums, which will drive profits over time, and short-term insurance continued to grow strongly while maintaining stable underwriting margins. Fee business saw a strong improvement compared with the prior year, which was affected by adverse market performance.</p><p>Farmers in the U.S. also achieved strong growth, with a 10% increase in BOP and a Farmers Management Services margin of 7.0%. Gross written premiums for the Farmers Exchanges3 grew 5% on an underlying basis, and the combined ratio for the fourth quarter was better than expected, falling to 89.8%. Farmers Re also benefited from the improved underwriting at the Exchanges, contributing USD 117 million to the Group BOP. This performance reflects the successful management actions in 2023.</p><p>Zurich's Retail business continues to improve as the 2023 accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, improved by 0.5 percentage points. In Retail, Zurich's customer retention rate has remained stable over the past years, improving customer loyalty despite rate increases. Further, Zurich has improved its brand consideration ranking in eight markets since 2019.</p><p>Enhancing the customer experience through investments in people and digitalization</p><p>Over the last three years, Zurich has invested USD 1.8 billion on technology, mostly focused on digitalizing the business, improving efficiency and customer experience. For instance, 89% of Zurich's retail quotes are now digitalized. Zurich is also leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) in more than 160 use cases providing advanced data insights to help underwriters, risk engineers and claims adjusters take better-informed decisions. Zurich strengthened its workforce with digital capabilities through an extensive upskilling program and the recruitment of over 1,000 digital technology specialists with critical skills, in areas like data analytics, AI, cyber security and cloud computing.</p><p>Natural catastrophes</p><p>Zurich's diligent management of its exposure to extreme weather events helped to reduce earnings volatility and make the quality of its financial performance more predictable and solid. The actions are paying off, with natural catastrophe losses within the guided range for the full-year 2023, despite severe flooding and hailstorms in Europe during the third quarter.</p><p>Industry-leading shareholder return</p><p>Generating industry-leading shareholder returns is one of Zurich's key ambitions, which is evidenced by its attractive dividend policy. Since 2016, Zurich has generated a shareholder return of 16% per annum. This compares favorably with the 9% annual shareholder return delivered by leading peers during the same period.8 Due to its record results and strong capital position, Zurich proposes an 8% dividend increase to CHF 26, a 19% increase in USD.9 Zurich plans to supplement the ordinary dividend with an additional share buyback of up to CHF 1.1 billion.</p><p>Outlook</p><p>Zurich now expects compound annual growth in 2023-2025 earnings per share (EPS) to exceed 10%. This compares with the target of 8%, which was established at the 2022 Investor Day.</p><p>The investor and media presentation provides more detailed guidance for the 2024 earnings outlook. It includes mid-single digit growth in insurance revenue for P&amp;C, with the Life BOP expected to be at least in line with the record high level of 2023.</p><p>2</p><p>Business performance</p><p>Property &amp; Casualty</p><p>in USD millions, for the 12 months ended December 31 unless otherwise stated.</p><p>[[                                           2023    20225   Change   Change</p><p>in USD5  like-for-</p><p>like2,6</p><p>P&amp;C business operating profit (BOP)        3,893   3,634   7%       10%</p><p>P&amp;C gross written premium and policy fees  44,401  41,435  7%       9%</p><p>P&amp;C insurance revenue                      42,293  39,164  8%       9%</p><p>P&amp;C combined ratio                         94.5%   94.5%   0.0pts   nm</p><p>]]</p><p>P&amp;C business operating profit (BOP) of USD 3,893 million was up 7% on a reported basis and 10% on a like-for- like2 basis compared with the prior year period. This was mainly driven by the increase in insurance revenue and an improvement in the investment result.</p><p>The combined ratio remained stable year-over-year at 94.5%. The strength of the Group's reserves is evidenced by its consistent prior year reserve development. The steps taken to manage exposure to natural catastrophes has resulted in a catastrophe loss ratio within the guided range and improving year-on-year. Commercial maintained strong returns with an accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes of 90.7%, compared with 89.5% in the prior year. Retail P&amp;C saw an improvement compared with the prior year period, with the accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophes improving by 0.5 percentage points to 97.3%.</p><p>Gross written premiums grew 9% on a like-for-like2 basis, adjusting for currency movements, with growth in both retail and commercial insurance across all regions. In EMEA, growth was driven by a strong performance across the region, mainly in the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Spain. North America continued to benefit from higher rates, particularly in property and motor lines. Asia Pacific saw a strong recovery in the travel insurance business and growth in the retail motor business while Latin America showed strong commercial growth and increased retail sales across the region. In U.S. dollars, the Group's gross written premiums rose 7%.</p><p>The Group achieved price increases of about 6%, supported by a commercial insurance rate change of 7% (9% in North America) and an acceleration of rate increases in the retail business.</p><p>Life</p><p>in USD millions, for the 12 months ended December 31 unless otherwise stated.</p><p>[[                                            2023    20225   Change   Change</p><p>in USD6  like-for-</p><p>like2,6</p><p>Life business operating profit (BOP)        2,060   1,487   39%      55%</p><p>Life present value of new business premiums 16,384  13,241  24%      26%</p><p>(PVNBP)</p><p>Life new business contractual service       1,037   987     5%       10%       margin (NB</p><p>CSM)</p><p>Life insurance revenue, short-term          2,311   2,042   13%      9%        contracts</p><p>Life fee revenue, investment contracts      648     532     22%      19%</p><p>]]</p><p>The Life business delivered a very strong performance in the year, with an all-time high BOP of USD 2,060 million and top-line growth across all parts of the business.</p><p>3</p><p>Life insurance new business premiums increased 24% in U.S. dollar terms and 26% on a like-for-like2 basis, with growth in EMEA, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Key drivers of growth include large sales volumes of a retail savings product in Spain, written by the Group's joint venture with Banco Sabadell primarily in the first quarter, protection sales in Asia Pacific and unit-linked sales in Latin America. New business written in the year added USD 1,037 million to the contractual service margin (CSM), 5% more than in the prior year, with increased sales volumes more than offsetting the impact of lower new business margin due to a less favorable business mix.</p><p>Short-term insurance contracts, predominantly related to the Latin America protection business, generated USD 2,311 million of insurance revenue, up 13% year on year. Fee revenue generated by investment contracts, which are mainly written in EMEA, grew 22% to USD 648 million, rebounding from a low level in the prior year, which was affected by adverse market movements.</p><p>Life BOP of 2,060 million was 39% higher than in the prior year in U.S. dollar terms, with all regions contributing to growth. The year-on-year increase reflects solid underlying performance of the business, favorable experience, as well as the non-repeat of approximately USD 350 million of adverse impacts from transition- related adjustments and other one-offs which occurred in 2022. Underlying performance benefited from higher CSM, strong growth in the short-term protection business and improved fee result.</p><p>Farmers</p><p>in USD millions, for the 12 months ended December 31 unless otherwise stated.</p><p>[[                                         2023    20225   Change</p><p>in USD6</p><p>Farmers Exchanges3</p><p>Gross written premiums                   27,351  26,519  5%10</p><p>Gross earned premiums                    26,702  25,842  3%</p><p>Combined ratio                           103.3%  105.2%  1.9pts</p><p>Surplus ratio                            33.5%   35.0%   (1.5pts)</p><p>Farmers</p><p>Farmers business operating profit (BOP)  2,296   2,086   10%</p><p>]]</p><p>The Farmers Exchanges,3 which are owned by their policyholders, achieved 5% growth in gross written premiums excluding the commercial rideshare business (3% on a reported basis). Rate actions have contributed to growth in most books of business.</p><p>The Farmers Exchanges3 combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses improved 5.4 percentage points to 91.9%. The continued strong focus on pricing led to an earned rate impact of 15% for the period. The Farmers Exchanges3 surplus ratio decreased to 33.5% mainly as a consequence of the underwriting loss in the period following historic high catastrophe losses, partially compensated by the favorable impact of the sale of three brokerages and the flood business.</p><p>Farmers Management Services (FMS) BOP grew 10% compared with the prior-year period, due to the increase in gross earned premiums (GEP) at the Farmers Exchanges3 and higher managed GEP margin. The full year managed GEP margin was 7.0%, a 0.4 percentage points improvement compared with the prior year.</p><p>The Farmers Re BOP was USD 117 million, USD 105 million higher than the prior year following a lower combined ratio at a higher reinsurance participation rate.</p><p>The Farmers Life BOP was 25% lower than the prior year, driven by a lower insurance service result, as Farmers Life entered into a reinsurance transaction with Resolution Life for its individual life in-force book, which was completed on August 1, 2023.</p><p>4</p><p>Capital position</p><p>As of January 1, 2024, Zurich's Swiss Solvency Test (SST) ratio is estimated at 233%4 and remains well in excess of the Group's target level of 160% or above. This compares with 267% as of January 1, 2023, with the reduction reflecting the accrual of the proposed 2023 dividend and an additional share buyback of up to CHF 1.1 billion, as well as the redemption of EUR 500 million of subordinated debt and the acquisition of three brokerage entities and the flood program servicing arm from Farmers Exchanges.3</p><p>Board nomination</p><p>The Board of Directors will propose the election of John Rafter to the Board at Zurich's Annual General Meeting on April 10, 2024. His nomination follows a distinguished career as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs.

This includes ensuring access to safe and healthy food and targeting novel microbial-based solutions to improve nutrition, enhance wellness and reduce disease.</p><p>The e[datascientist] (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eaglegenomics.com/what-we-do/e-datascientist-platform\">https://www.eaglegenomics.com/what-we-do/e-datascientist-platform</url>) (TM) is a platform powered by network science1 and multilayer hypergraphs2, applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide a data-driven insight journey into solving complex problems and delivering greater impact in climate resilience, improving plant nutrient density, and increasing data-driven wellness and human health outcomes.</p><p>The platform integrates active learning at every step of the microbiome innovation journey, from characterising and describing microbiomes, to a better understanding of complex causal mechanisms to elucidating host-microbiome interactions. Eagle Genomics is reinventing life sciences research and development by bridging the 'translation gap,' enabling scientific knowledge from a range of disparate sources and data sets to be integrated and analyzed through the e[datascientist] platform to create novel hypotheses and deliver robust, scientifically underpinned practical solutions.</p><p>\"We are energised to partner with ICRISAT, which has over half a century of experience in improving dryland agri-food systems across the poorest communities of the world from which we can draw valuable data and explore the pressing questions of our time that remain unanswered.</p><p>\"This promises enormous consequences for both public policies to incentivize private sector investment in new initiatives, and measures to address global challenges, that are jointly good for humanity and a corporation's bottom line.</p><p>\"Just as the digital revolution has brought new opportunities and improved our world, so can the Bio Revolution - towards which we are working with ICRISAT alongside other partners,\" said Anthony Finbow.</p><p>Sharing Knowledge for More World Firsts Director General ICRISAT, Dr Jacqueline Hughes said the MOU would see ICRISAT share datasets with Eagle Genomics, drawing upon extensive on-the-ground experience in Asia and Africa that had led to several agricultural world firsts. These include developing early maturing groundnut as well as high iron biofortified pearl millet, innovations that have directly responded to the challenges posed by climate change. This new partnership offers an opportunity to address, and even leapfrog beyond, the Sustainable Development Goals to drive science-based targets for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"The efficacy of our interventions both past and emerging and on which some 2.2. billion people depend, will increasingly depend on informed data-driven decisions in an increasingly complex world.</p><p>\"This partnership will advance an understanding of microbiome interactions - from soil, to plant, to farm, to fork, to gut, to health, and their relationship with our food system and offer new approaches to sequester carbon efficiently, enhance nitrogen and phosphate availability for plants, reduce soil erosion and flooding and improve crop and community resilience to climate change and climatic events. Furthermore, it will provide meaningful nature-based metrics to enhance our understanding of regenerative impact from a biological standpoint.</p><p>\"Increasing the nutrient density in our food through enhancement of microbiomes will help ensure ICRISAT's mandate crops can address food security and malnutrition, in populations living in drought-prone dryland areas.</p><p>\"I am delighted that our collaboration with Eagle Genomics, and the strength they bring to our high-calibre partnerships, will advance our mission of reducing poverty, hunger and malnutrition for the world's poor,\" said Dr Hughes .</p><p>At the conclusion of the signing, ICRISAT and Eagle Genomics applauded the Innovations for Drylands Conference. They said that the MOU would help underpin next-generation innovation to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of the over two billion people living in the drylands of Asia, Africa and beyond. It will contribute to safe and nutritious food for all, through a shift to sustainable consumption and nature-positive production systems that can drive One Health outcomes for humans, animals, and the environment.</p><p>Notes</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">1.

Forever Chocolate tackles the material issues in our cocoa and chocolate supply chain and operations through investment as well as through the implementation of due diligence. Forever Chocolate's ultimate aim is to generate a living income for cocoa farmers, to protect human rights and children's rights, to become forest positive, to decarbonize our carbon footprint in order to become a net-zero company and to have 100% certified or verified ingredients in all of our products, traceable to farm level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forever Chocolate was launched in 2016. Founded upon Barry Callebaut's long-standing investment in a sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain, it added transparent annual reporting with a set of time-bound metrics. Resolving the material issues in the cocoa and chocolate supply chain is imperative for social and environmental reasons, plus it helps to build a more resilient supply chain and operations, to the advantage of farmers, our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and, ultimately, chocolate lovers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key highlights of 2023/24</p><p>This marks our eighth year of reporting on our Forever Chocolate progress. Throughout fiscal year 2023/24, we faced significant hurdles in advancing sustainability, with cocoa prices hitting record highs due to a global shortage of beans, caused by weather and climate- related challenges. Nevertheless, our dedication to making sustainable chocolate the norm, did not waver. We enhanced our collaboration with customers, industry partners, and broader society, combining our practical experience with their needs. These efforts further solidified our role as a trusted partner for sustainable chocolate solutions Our key highlights include:</p><p>* Implementation of a rigorous organizational-wide approach to prepare for the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which has profoundly transformed our traceability efforts and set a new standard for transparency in our supply chain. As</p><p>\"In 2023/24 we set a new standard for traceability in our supply chain. This significant effort is exemplified by the 669,174 (+22.2%) cocoa farm plots we mapped ensuring traceability to farm level for these farms.</p><p>such, we have mapped 669,174 farm plots (+22.2%) in 2023/24.</p><p>* Significant increase in carbon removals (-388,433 tCO2e). through the upscaling of our agroforestry approach, which reached 33,795 hectares of agroforestry newly established in 2023/24.</p><p>* Scale-upof our paid Labor Groups program by +125.8% in comparison to 2022/23, now covering close to 44,000 hectares.</p><p>* Partnership with three international child rights organizations to address socio-economic factors driving child labor and child rights, supporting our new community-based approach in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria.</p><p>In addition, in 2023/24, we launched our Future Farming Initiative(FFI) which aims to be a catalyst for the industry for scaling sustainable, high-tech cocoa farming. The development of an initial 5,000 hectares in Bahia, Brazil, is designed to pilot innovative, sustainable practices and create a scalable, high-tech model for profitable cocoa farming. Through this project, we aim to set new benchmarks in the industry while sharing our insights and expertise from FFI with partners across all our sourcing regions, supporting their ongoing efforts toward more productive and sustainable cocoa farming.</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 2</p><p>]]</p><p>Continued commitment to traceability</p><p>Traceability is fundamental to our commitment to making sustainable chocolate the norm. Our traceability systems ensure transparency and accountability, allowing us to precisely track the origins of our products while promoting ethical practices, protecting human rights, and minimizing environmental impact through deforestation monitoring, education, and prevention programs. In response to both regulatory requirements and growing customer demand for segregated supply chains that uphold brand sustainability ambitions, we are continuously developing innovative solutions to meet these requirements and expectations. Consequently, in 2023/24, our mapping initiatives were expanded to include 669,174 cocoa farm plots, marking a 22.2% increase. This progress has enabled farm-level traceability for the cocoa sourced from the mapped farms.</p><p>With the continued support of our customers, we also raised the percentage of products containing 100% verified or certified cocoa or chocolate to 55.5%, up from 51.5% in the previous year. Setting industry-wide standards and programs is crucial for the sustainable sourcing of raw materials, as certification serves as just the initial step. We remain committed to collaborating with suppliers and industry initiatives to shape and implement sustainability benchmarks for all the ingredients we source. More information on these and other achievements is provided in each pillar of this report - Prospering Farmers, Human Rights, Thriving Nature and Sustainable Ingredients.</p><p>Fit for a changing regulatory landscape</p><p>Forever Chocolate ensures Barry Callebaut is fit for a changing regulatory landscape. Sustainability is no longer just nice to have, but a \"must-have\" as part of a corporate license to operate. This shift is the direct result of both industry and societal groups that acknowledged the limits of voluntary industry action in building sustainable supply chains. Regulators across the world have in recent years introduced and implemented legislation that requires products to fulfill certain minimum sustainability standards. Both in the United States and in the European Union, authorities can, and will, block the import/distribution of products if they do not fulfill human rights (EU and US) or environmental criteria (EU).</p><p>Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which entered into force in June 2023, and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) adopted in 2024.</p><p>EUDR requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market are legal, traceable and deforestation-free. Through our Forever Chocolate actions, we have considerably advanced in our traceability efforts prior to EUDR adoption, by mapping the farmers in our supply chain to verify that the cocoa we supply is legal and deforestation-free. This is by no means an easy exercise, but thanks to the 1,600 people</p><p>we have on the ground, interacting on a daily basis with cocoa farmers, we have made great strides in mapping our supply chain, and will be EUDR compliant by the application date1.</p><p>The EU CSDDD requires companies to implement a due diligence process on human and environmental issues. This means mitigating the risk of potential human rights and environmental harms, identifying and remediating actual human rights and environmental harms, and reporting on due diligence framework. Forever Chocolate has been the platform through which Barry Callebaut has been openly communicating over the years about issues in the cocoa and chocolate supply chain and about the remediation steps it has been carrying out. For a detailed description of the implementation of due diligence in our supply chain and operations, please see the section on due diligencebelow.</p><p>In addition, we are also working towards the quantitative analysis required by the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures(TCFD). Whilst we already disclose the core elements of TCFD via our Social and Environmental Impact Report, Net Zero Roadmapand CDPreports, we are continuously working on our scenario modelling and risk and mitigation strategies.</p><p>In addition, in 2023/24, Barry Callebaut initiated a project to align its business activities with the EU Taxonomy regulation for sustainable activities, enhancing its data collection and reporting processes to ensure compliance and transparency. This initiative will support our strategic growth in sustainable sectors and strengthen our commitment to environmental responsibility. Furthermore, during the current fiscal year we also commenced a project to ensure preparedness for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD), an EU directive aimed at establishing a more standardized approach for the disclosure of information on ESG-related topics, enabling stakeholders to more effectively compare companies' progress in addressing and managing ESG risks. Barry Callebaut will comply with TCFD, CSRD and EU Taxonomy reporting requirements in 2025/26.</p><p>Protect, Grow, Transform</p><p>To make sustainable chocolate the norm we have developed our \"North Star\", a vision of the key enablers to achieve a radical transformation of the cocoa sector. Our \"North Star\" approaches are country-specific and built upon a deep understanding of the respective economic and political context. Achieving the \"North Star\" vision will require a mix of corporate sustainability programs and an enabling policy environment implemented by the public sector. We view this as a long-term process consisting of three sequenced phases - Protect, Grow and Transform. What does this mean in practice?</p><p>It starts with the Protect phase. This is focused on ensuring compliance with certification standards and applicable legislation in cocoa origin and in cocoa consuming regions. Legislation creates a level playing</p><p>* On October 2, 2024, the European Commission proposed a 12 month delay for EUDR implementation, making the law applicable on 30 December 2025 for large companies and 30 June 2026 for micro- and small enterprises. At the time of drafting of this report, the EU co-legislators, the European Parliament and the Council, were reviewing the European Commission's proposal..</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 3</p><p>]]</p><p>field and ensures that all actors are taking responsibility. Barry Callebaut has in the past three years been an ardent supporter of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as well as the African Regional Standards on cocoa sustainability (ARS 1000). These are important regulatory developments ensuring the protection of forests and human rights in cocoa and chocolate production through the implementation of supply chain traceability. Together they form the foundation upon which we can implement our corporate sustainability programs in the Grow and Transform phases.</p><p>In the Grow phase we will implement a number of activities that have been proven to deliver impact. The focus is on growing incomes, increasing cocoa farmer yields, implementing agroforestry to build climate change resilience and building a community environment that protects human rights. These actions lay the stepping stones for the Transform phase, where the focus is on modernizing smallholder farming, and piloting industrial cocoa farming as a potential answer to some of the structural challenges inherent in today's smallholder farming model, including traceability and land-use intensity.</p><p>Recognition of our progress and impact</p><p>CDP, an independent organization that assesses the carbon reduction strategies of over 21,000 companies, awarded Barry Callebaut an 'A' and recognized us as a CDP Leader for our efforts in reducing carbon emissions and engaging suppliers to address Scope 3 emissions - which includes emissions beyond our direct supply chain. This recognition reinforces our dedication to transparency, proactive risk management, and setting ambitious, impactful targets for climate action. For our customers and partners, this highlights our unwavering commitment to supporting their sustainability goals. With a proven track record in implementing cutting-edge environmental practices, we continue to lead the way in sustainability innovation and excellence. Additionally, CDP also ranked Barry Callebaut as 'A-' for Forest Stewardship, recognizing our transparency in forest stewardship and our strong efforts in combating deforestation. In addition, Barry Callebaut's 'AA' MSCI ESG rating as at August 31, 2024 has been confirmed.</p><p>By 2025, 500,000 cocoa farmers in our supply chain will have been lifted out of</p><p>poverty. By 2030, we will have mobilized key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model generating living income.</p><p>By 2025, our entire supply chain will be covered by Human Rights Due Diligence, remediating all child labor cases identified. By 2030, the farming communities we source from are empowered to protect child rights.</p><p>By 2025, we will be forest</p><p>positive. By 2030, we will have decarbonized our footprint in line with global efforts to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees</p><p>Celsius. By 2050, we will be a net zero company.</p><p>By 2030, we will have 100% certified or verified cocoa and ingredients in all of our products, traceable to farm level.</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 4</p><p>]]</p><p>Due diligence, what is it and how is it included in Forever Chocolate?</p><p>Forever Chocolate aligns with the OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct, which provide a comprehensive framework for promoting responsible business practices. The guidelines provide enterprises: \"with the flexibility to adapt the characteristics, specific measures and processes of due diligence to their own circumstances\".</p><p>This framework applies universally to Barry Callebaut employees, suppliers, contractors, agency workers, and volunteers. It also extends to Barry Callebaut's wholly owned affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as employees of any joint venture.</p><p>Alignment with the OECD Guidelines helps us to:</p><p>* Establish a unified framework that recognizes the company's obligation to uphold all material risks, encompassing all personnel, business operations, and affiliations across Barry Callebaut's entire value chain;</p><p>* Define a proactive and efficient due diligence strategy for the entire Group;</p><p>* Describe a systematic approach to assess, monitor, and mitigate material risks in Barry Callebaut's value chain following the six steps of the OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct</p><p>framework.</p><p>By implementing the OECD guidelines, Barry Callebaut seeks to align with incoming regulations, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), adopted in 2024.</p><p>Governance: embedding responsible business conduct into policies and management systems</p><p>The OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct entails a six-step process:</p><p>1. Embedding responsible business conduct into policies and management systems</p><p>Barry Callebaut's Board of Directors has the overall responsibility of ensuring that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), related policies and strategies, including activities for Forever Chocolate, align with the long-term strategy and business model of the company.</p><p>ESG governance is embedded into our policies and management systems by integrating clear policies that align with ESG goals, such as our Supplier Code, which applies to all suppliers and their employees providing products, materials, expertise and related services to any entity of the Barry Callebaut Group. The Supplier Code sets out the essential minimum requirements expected from each supplier and flanks their commitments under applicable laws, regulations and contractual arrangements. Our Global Statement on safeguarding human rights, including the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking, in our supply chain describes Barry Callebaut's approach and efforts toward safeguarding human rights and ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in</p><p>any part of our business or our supply chain. This statement is updated on an annual basis.</p><p>Our approach to ethical governance is structured to enforce these policies, with regular monitoring, reporting, and adjustments to ensure compliance and continual improvement. By embedding ESG into the core of business operations, we not only adhere to regulatory requirements but also build trust with stakeholders, reduce risks, and create long-term value.</p><p>For further details of our activities and policies please see: Our Position on ESG.</p><p>2. Identify and assess adverse impacts in operations, supply chains and business relationships</p><p>To ensure that we are focusing on addressing the most pressing material topics in the chocolate and cocoa value chain, we aim every two years to undertake a materiality assessment to align with the evolving needs of our stakeholders and the changing dynamics of our industry. Our 2023 double materiality assessment reaffirmed our commitment to the Forever Chocolate pillars: Prospering Farmers, Human Rights, Thriving Nature, and Sustainable Ingredients.</p><p>As indicated above, from this assessment, five significant areas emerged as material: Supply Chain Traceability, Climate and Energy, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Workers in the Value Chain, and Affected Communities. The Board of Directors officially approved these material topics in April 2023. The outcomes of our materiality assessment are visualized in a Materiality Matrix, accessible in our Barry Callebaut's Approach to Double Materiality Method Paper.</p><p>3. Cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts</p><p>For each of our four pillars and their material issues, we have created strategies to achieve our targets and to cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts. Our approach is based on the solid foundation of the skills and insights of our people on the ground, scientific evidence and data analysis. Through the mapping of the location and size of the cocoa farms in our direct supply chain, the funding of productivity improving measures for cocoa farmers through Cocoa Horizons, the definition and implementation of industry-wide sustainable sourcing standards and the development of a community-based approach to fighting child labor, to name but a few action plans, we are making good progress in tackling the adverse impacts in our value chain and operations.</p><p>Through constant engagement with stakeholders, including local communities, experts, societal stakeholders, and industry partners, we ensure that our efforts are informed by diverse perspectives and address relevant concerns.</p><p>For a detailed description of our activities to cease, prevent or mitigate, please see the chapters describing how we are tackling the issues in each of the four pillars of Forever Chocolate.</p><p>4. Track implementation and results</p><p>Through on-the-ground assessment and data gathering we track implementation and progress. In</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 5</p><p>]]</p><p>close collaboration with strategic partners we have established a robust digital infrastructure for precise data collection, storage, retrieval, and collaboration among supply chain stakeholders. To illustrate, our ever-growing cocoa farmer database, which maps the geographical location and the size of the farms from which we are sourcing, currently covers 80% of our direct cocoa supply chain, resulting in traceability to farm level.</p><p>Furthermore, in close collaboration with external experts we are developing tools to track progress on several fronts, e.g. by establishing the industry-first carbon calculation methodology for land-use change emissions and developing satellite-imagery-based High Carbon Stock (HCS) maps. In addition, we are conducting independent Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) for all the main cocoa sourcing countries and regions, and using the results to prioritize and develop interventions and engagement with suppliers to ensure the protection of human rights in our supply chain.</p><p>For a detailed description of how we track implementation and their results, please see the chapters describing how we are tackling the issues for each of the four pillars of Forever Chocolate.</p><p>5. Communicate how impacts are addressed</p><p>We communicate our efforts to resolve the material issues in our supply chain on a regular basis through various channels and reports. This fiscal year we are publishing for the first time our Social and Environmental Impact Report, which includes</p><p>references to all our ESG-related publications and policies, including our GRI Report. In addition, we maintain a dedicated public websitecovering the full range of relevant ESG topics and related reports and policies. We have obtained independent limited assurance over select Forever Chocolate KPIs, from an third-party assuranceprovider.</p><p>6. Provide for, or cooperate in, remediation when appropriate</p><p>Remediation is an integral part of our Forever Chocolate efforts to resolve the material issues in our supply chain. The provision of input support to cocoa farmers, the remediation of identified cases of child labor and the distribution of shade trees are examples of how we are actively remediating the negative impacts from the material issues in the cocoa and chocolate supply chain.</p><p>For a detailed description of our remediation activities, please see Forever Chocolate chapters.</p><p>Engagement with relevant stakeholders &amp; grievance mechanism procedure</p><p>Both for the design and execution of Forever Chocolate, we are in active contact with relevant stakeholders.

We believe this collaboration is essential for cultivating an environment of trust and accountability by encouraging NGOs to communicate their concerns directly with Barry Callebaut. By strengthening our relationships with NGOs, we aim to enhance our due diligence processes, addressing potential non- compliance risks at their source. NGOs commended Barry Callebaut for its transparent and proactive approach, as well as its strategic rigor and ambition, and strongly appreciated our commitment to cover all technical compliance costs for farmers and farmer groups.</p><p>With over 1,600 colleagues in cocoa origin countries, we are in daily contact with cocoa farmers across the globe to deepen our understanding and support them in their concerns and needs. Through Cocoa Horizons, our preferred vehicle for the implementation of sustainability activities in the cocoa supply chain, and through customer programs, we are partnering with our customers to build a sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain. We are partnering with academics and experts to design tools and approaches in support of reaching our Forever Chocolate targets.</p><p>Barry Callebaut has established a dedicated whistleblowing platform: Integrity Line. The Integrity Line platform is part of Barry Callebaut's Compliance program. It was launched to facilitate reporting of non- compliance and suspicious transactions in cases where employees do not feel comfortable addressing such issues directly. The platform also allows for anonymous reporting. Employees can also call the Integrity Line hotline (24/7).</p><p>In addition, to encourage stakeholders and affected groups from the supply chain to report any potential grievances and concerns on human rights, deforestation, and governance violations, Barry Callebaut has established a grievance platform. Through the grievance platform we are inviting input from all stakeholders that will help us to identify potential issues or violations, increase transparency and promote continuous improvement. Our grievance platform covers our entire supply chain. The Compliance team hosts the grievance platform and acts as a coordinator to ensure the adequate processing of incoming grievances. A complaint can be raised by parties who are themselves affected, such as workers or local communities, by an organization representing the affected parties, such as a trade union, or by an independent organization, such as an NGO. With this grievance mechanism, Barry Callebaut has established a process to systematically receive, investigate, and respond to complaints affecting Barry Callebaut's supply chain from rights holders and implement time-bound actions to resolve these issues. In order to distinguish the grievance mechanism from the internal reporting process and internal vulnerability identification processes, it is important to understand that the grievance mechanism deals with complaints coming from external parties in the company's supply</p><p>chain. In this way, Barry Callebaut ensures that an effective grievance mechanism is in place for all external stakeholders.</p><p>Building an enabling policy environment</p><p>Forever Chocolate defines the actions that Barry Callebaut is taking to promote and strengthen a sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain, but for systemic change we need the support of public intervention. Topics such as land consolidation, access to land titles, national traceability systems and access to quality education cannot be addressed through sustainability programs. They require legislation. For this Barry Callebaut is actively engaged in industry associations such as the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) and the European Cocoa Association (ECA) to unite the industry behind a transformative agenda.</p><p>The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) will ensure that the cocoa containing products on the EU market will fulfill minimum standards on environmental and human rights protection, driving a level playing field and a baseline sustainability standard in the sector. In the past fiscal year much effort has been put into understanding the specific implementation details of the EUDR, ensuring consistent implementation by industry and harmonized enforcement by authorities. In cocoa origin countries we continued our close cooperation with industry and governments on building a cocoa farmer database, sharing our data on the mapped cocoa farmers in our supply chain. Having a clear line of sight of who produces cocoa and where it is being grown is a prerequisite for establishing country wide traceability and for discouraging cocoa farm expansion into forested land.</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 7</p><p>]]</p><p>Prospering</p><p>Farmers</p><p>Our goal</p><p>By 2025, 500,000 cocoa farmers in our supply chain will have been lifted out of poverty. By 2030, we will have mobilized key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model generating living income.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>A sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain starts with prospering farmers. The reality on the ground unfortunately tells a different story. A large proportion of cocoa farmers, globally, and particularly in West Africa, earn an income below the extreme poverty line. Low yields on small plots of land keep cocoa farmers in a state of poverty. As a result many cocoa farmers lack the means to invest in improving their farms, lack the means to send their children to school and to hire professional farm hands. Our philosophy is to provide the needed support to empower cocoa farmers to leverage their cocoa farming expertise to improve their yields and to increase their financial resilience by diversifying their income.</p><p>Barry Callebaut has committed to lifting 500,000 cocoa farmers out of poverty by 2025. By 2030 we will have mobilized key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model generating living income.</p><p>Our approach</p><p>Farmer Income</p><p>To lift cocoa farmers out of poverty and get them on a trajectory towards a living income, we need to have deep insights into the components of a farmer's income. For this we conducted in-depth research into cocoa farmer incomes in three major cocoa producing countries: Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The purpose of our research is to support the development and implementation of Living Income Interventions, ranging from increased access to finances, training, coaching, production inputs and labor services, in close collaboration with other key stakeholders in the cocoa value chain.</p><p>A typical farmer that has reached a living income has on average 5 hectares of land dedicated to cocoa with a yield of more than 600 kg/ha. This is a different reality for the average cocoa farmer, who cultivate 3.8 hectares of land dedicated to cocoa with an average yield of 450 kg/ha.</p><p>Cocoa farmers and their families whose income does not meet the living income benchmark is an economic development issue. Even if cocoa prices increase, as they did in the past fiscal year, not all cocoa farmers will earn an income above the living income benchmark. To achieve a living income for cocoa farmers in our supply chain, we need to work at a landscape level. This means working with the governments of cocoa origin countries to accelerate the stimulation and diversification of rural economies, working together with other sectors beyond cocoa and openly sharing data and insights on income.</p><p>Barry Callebaut's living income approach is structured around various interventions leading to a smart mix for the cocoa farmers we work with. First, there are the interventions to increase cocoa yield and create income from other sources than cocoa. These interventions include providing cocoa farmers with access to professional labor groups that can help them prune their cocoa trees. Labor group members are often cocoa farmers operating on smaller size farms, who can thus earn additional income to support their households. Cocoa farmers are also given access to Farm Services, a combination of fertilizers, crop protection inputs, coaching, as well as soil analysis to drive tailored farm-specific interventions. In addition, the interventions we offer can also entail payments for Environmental Services Agroforestry, which aim to increase survival rates of seedlings. Through this</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 8</p><p>]]</p><p>program, Barry Callebaut distributes non-cocoa trees to help diversify farmer incomes, provide shade for cocoa seedlings, sequester carbon dioxide and improve soil quality and biodiversity. Further details are given on page 19.</p><p>Second, there is the transfer of cash. This can take the form of cash premiums on top of the cocoa price to bridge the gap towards a living income, conditional cash transfers, including the implementation of good agricultural practices, and unconditional cash transfers.</p><p>Third, we support cocoa farming communities in setting up of Village Savings Loans Associations (VSLAs), collective savings and loans schemes managed by the women in the community that increase the financial resilience of cocoa communities in general and women (farmers) in particular.</p><p>And finally, efforts toward land size consolidation are supported to increase the size of farms.</p><p>Partnering with our customers for change</p><p>Alongside our own interventions, we partner with our customers to support cocoa farmers on their journey to achieving a living income. Most programs are thus set up to become self-sustaining, i.e. to not be dependent on open-ended external funding. This means that subsidies are often conditional on co-investment by the cocoa farmers or conditional upon successful implementation of certain activities, such as cocoa tree pruning.</p><p>We support Nestl\u00e9, as a part of its Living Income Action Plan, with the implementation of its Income Accelerator. Under the program, participating cocoa- farming families receive, on top of certification premiums, a mobile cash payment for enrolling children in the household in school, implementing good agricultural practices, performing agroforestry activities to increase climate resilience and diversifying incomes, for example by growing other crops and raising livestock.</p><p>Our data and research across multiple studies clearly and consistently demonstrate that targeted pre- harvest interventions, such as increased labor for cocoa tree pruning and the strategic application of fertilizers, lead to significantly higher cocoa yields and improved farmer incomes. However, the financial burden of these necessary investments remains a major challenge for cocoa farmers. Given that cocoa farming is predominantly a family-run business, the cost of additional labor and fertilizers often exceeds what these farmers can afford. This issue is not due to a lack of farming expertise, but rather stems from structural and economic barriers related to cost of production. Despite these challenges, our work, including a trial project with a major global partner at our Farm Services division, underscores the potential of pre- harvest interventions. By addressing the financial barriers, we can help cocoa farmers unlock the full potential of their farms.</p><p>Increased use of labor groups to increase cocoa yields</p><p>In addition to the application of soil fertilizers, proper cocoa tree pruning plays a vital role in enhancing</p><p>cocoa production. To support farmers in these labor- intensive tasks, Barry Callebaut launched the Labor Groups program in the 2021/22 season, in collaboration with key partners like Mondelez International and Ben</p><p>* Jerry's, and customers of the Cocoa Horizons Foundation.</p><p>By combining effective pruning with the use of fertilizers and good agronomic practices, cocoa trees can maximize fruit production, resulting in improved quality and higher yields. Labor groups provide farmers with critical assistance in areas such as pruning, weeding, pesticide application, and fertilizer management. This program also creates professional service providers by contracting local community members and cocoa farmers to form labor groups through farmer organizations. Equipped with essential tools and training, these groups not only provide essential support to farmers but also create additional</p><p>\"</p><p>With the backing of our customers, labor group activities increased significantly in 2023/24. As a result, 43,631 (+125.8%) hectares were covered by programs to support farmers with labor groups.</p><p>income opportunities for local workers. With the backing of our customers, the program continued to expand significantly in 2023/24 covering all cocoa- producing regions in West Africa.</p><p>At Barry Callebaut, we are actively collaborating with our customers on various premium-paying programs. We are also making it easier for farmers receive their premiums. In 2023/24 we continued scaling our digital premium payment solutions across West Africa, Indonesia and South America. Digital premium payments benefit cocoa farmers by establishing credible proof of income and improving their access to financial services. Our digital payment program has also helped thousands of West African farmers to obtain a national ID by working with community and government authorities. In 2023/24, our digital payments initiative covered more than 60,000 cocoa farmers.</p><p>We are also a living income implementer, encouraging and supporting our customers to follow suit. For example, Barry Callebaut enables Tony's Open Chainas the cocoa processing partner and has implemented sustainability projects on the ground for Ben &amp; Jerry's Living Income Program since 2016.</p><p>In addition, in 2023/24 we made efforts to enhance our purchasing practices. This included a review of our</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 9</p><p>]]</p><p>contracts, particularly for cooperatives in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire that cater specifically to our customers, reflecting our customers' multi-year commitments. In C\u00f4te d' Ivoire, we have signed three-year contracts with 90% of the cooperatives from which Barry Callebaut directly sources.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2023/24 Barry Callebaut actively participated in the working group on pricing mechanisms under the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire-Ghana Cocoa Initiative (CIGCI) Economic Pact. Our aim is to shift the focus of discussion to the farm gate price, recognizing that higher farm gate prices can significantly contribute to poverty reduction. We believe that analyzing the appropriate mechanisms in a broader context of price construction, including the significance of farm gate prices and export prices, will have a considerable positive impact on farmers' incomes.</p><p>From providing training to offering support in implementation through our Farm Services business</p><p>Based on these insights and our direct engagement with farmers, in the past fiscal year, we continued to deploy our refined Farm Services business. We have shifted our focus from farmer training to providing more robust support for pre-harvest activities. To enhance cocoa farmers' quality yield per hectare, we now emphasize better soil management, such as the correct timing and amount of fertilizer application, financial support for third-party labor services, and access to improved planting materials.</p><p>It is essential to have an in-depth understanding of the conditions, challenges, and potential of the farms and farmers we work with. During the past fiscal year, we significantly expanded our extensive database by adding more farmers with full data. This means we have captured their socioeconomic and household information through census interviews and mapped the geographical location and size of their farms. Gathering this data helps us gain a more detailed picture of farmer profiles and a better understanding of their needs, allowing us to enhance our Farm Services business.</p><p>Our Farm Services specialists collaborate closely with farmers to assess their unique farm environments, including soil conditions, the age of cocoa trees, and the presence of other crops and livestock. They also evaluate the farmer's existing agricultural skills and resources. This thorough assessment allows us to develop tailored Farm Business Plans (FBPs) for each farmer, outlining a multi-year strategy to maximize the farm's potential income through optimal management.</p><p>Better soil management through subsidized fertilizer</p><p>Decreasing soil fertility and the suboptimal use of agrochemicals are associated with declining cocoa yields. We continued to support farmers with soil management techniques and productivity packages in 2023/24. Given the increased cost of fertilizers, we also continued to focus on subsidizing fertilizers for farmers in West Africa. Funded by Cocoa Horizons customers, a</p><p>total of almost CHF 1.1 million was allocated to such subsidies.</p><p>Providing improved planting material</p><p>Beyond offering pre-harvest labor assistance and optimizing soil management, the age and variety of cocoa trees are crucial factors in determining crop yields. To help rejuvenate cocoa farms, Barry Callebaut is committed to distributing more resilient, high-yield cocoa varieties, aimed at boosting long-term productivity. Seedlings are carefully bred for resistance against various pests and diseases that negatively impact cocoa production.</p><p>However, a resilient ecosystem for cocoa farms also requires a variety of other tree species. In the 2023/24 period, we distributed nearly 3.3 million non-cocoa trees, contributing to income diversification for farmers, while offering vital shade for cocoa seedlings, removing CO2, and improving soil health and biodiversity. The benefits of sustainable cocoa cultivation through agroforestry, alongside our emphasis on long-term success through training, ongoing monitoring, and payments for ecosystem services (PES), are detailed further on page 19.</p><p>The relationship between farm size and income</p><p>In May 2023, we released a White Paperfollowing six years of collaboration between Barry Callebaut, Agri- Logic, IDH, and Rainforest Alliance. It outlines actionable steps for transforming cocoa farming in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and West Africa. By addressing key drivers of poverty reduction - yield, farm size, and price - the findings provided critical insights for refining our strategy to enhance farmers' income, boost cocoa yields, and safeguard surrounding forests. Our data analysis shows that a larger farm can significantly increase income by allowing for greater cocoa production, but only if coupled with adequate investment.</p><p>However, encouraging farmers to pursue long-term yield improvement activities (such as soil management and planting material) can be a challenge due to limited land tenure and tree rights. In contrast to many other countries, applying for land certificates in West Africa is often an expensive and time-consuming process. To help tackle this issue, we have cooperated with industry partners, donors and local implementers through the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Land Partnership (CLAP)since 2019. Our joint efforts have resulted in the development of an upscaling model for land registration, granting farmers access to more affordable and faster land documentation. This initiative places significant emphasis on including marginalized groups and preventing land conflicts.</p><p>Systemic change together with all supply chain actors</p><p>Achieving a fully sustainable cocoa and chocolate sector requires commitment from all stakeholders in the supply chain. To enhance the implementation and impact of our Farm Services offerings, collaboration among sector-wide stakeholders and the public sector</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 10</p><p>]]</p><p>is imperative in driving structural change and reducing poverty.</p><p>Government action at origin is essential to address the issues of traceability, rural infrastructure development and proper enforcement of national policies and legislation. These interventions must be coupled with regulatory interventions and sensitization in cocoa- consuming regions to drive demand for sustainably sourced cocoa.</p><p>This is why we are committed to mobilizing key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model that generates a living income.</p><p>Land consolidation is needed to increase farm size and encourage higher levels of investment in farms. This effort must be accompanied by the creation of mainstream banking opportunities for farmers, facilitating investments in their farms, as well as the development of integrated agricultural policies that ensure adequate cocoa supply management, land titles for farmers, a registry for cocoa farmers and alternative livelihoods for cocoa farmers in protected forest areas. While the modernization of cocoa farming practices is imperative, the resulting increase in cocoa yield needs to be addressed by consolidating the number of cocoa farms. To facilitate this transition, these farm policies should also encourage the production of other essential agricultural goods that promote income diversification and alternative livelihoods for farmers. Lastly, it is crucial to optimize the pricing structure to maximize its impact on farmer incomes.</p><p>Only through a broad and coordinated mobilization of public and private actors will we be able to drive the change that is required in the cocoa supply chain.</p><p>Our measured impact</p><p>At Barry Callebaut, we are aiming for a consistent poverty reduction perspective, and a living income- enabling farming model towards 2030. The first step towards living income is to support the lifting of cocoa farmers out of poverty, measured against the International Poverty Line threshold.2 However, achieving this is just the beginning. To measure our progress towards our target to have more than 500,000 cocoa farmers lifted out of poverty by 2025, we refer to the International Poverty Line definition of extreme poverty as a benchmark, which is USD 2.15/ day, adjusted for purchasing power parity3.</p><p>Fiscal year 2023/24 presented a challenging landscape, with a combination of weather and climate factors resulting in a shortage of cocoa beans, subsequently driving bean prices to historic high levels. In response, the governments of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana raised the farm-gate prices to CFA 1500 /kg and GHS 33.12 GHS/ kg, respectively. While the farm-gate price increase was positive, the fact is, that cocoa farmers' incomes, particularly in West Africa, remain too low.</p><p>Our data4 shows that poverty reduction is driven by three key factors - yield, size of farm, and price. Price mechanisms can support an increase in farmer income, as illustrated this year with the increase in farm-gate prices.</p><p>However, it is also critical to highlight that overall, particularly in West Africa, which is the world's largest cocoa producing region, cocoa trees are aging and cocoa bean yield is decreasing. Increasing productivity is only possible with proper farm management practices, such as pruning cocoa trees, managing soil health, maintaining shade, and controlling pests, especially as farmers face tougher climatic conditions and heightened disease pressure.</p><p>This is why, in 2023/24, we have continued to expand our efforts in pre-harvest interventions, including the scaling up of labor groups. Along with boosting yields, this work has also deepened our engagement with farmers, strengthening the partnership between Barry Callebaut and the farmers we source from. As a result, despite bean shortages, the volume of cocoa beans supplied by these farmer groups has remained stable.</p><p>It is important to note that our analysis shows that in the previous fiscal year (2022/23), around 40% of farmers in our supply chain were below the poverty line with USD 1/per person/, per day, away from the poverty line baseline, while the other 60% of farmers, were below the poverty line by USD 1 - 3 USD/per person/, per day. On average, in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the amount in farm-gate price increase, provides farmers with an additional 0.78 USD per person per day, bringing the farmers placed below the poverty line in 2022/23, above it this year. Finally, we have also slightly revised our methodology for better alignment with the OECD Household Modified scale.</p><p>In 2023/24, measured against the International Poverty Line threshold of USD 2.15/day, we estimate 475,752 cocoa farmers in our supply chain are no longer in poverty, compared to prior year (+76.4%).</p><p>To support farmers in these labor-intensive tasks, Barry Callebaut launched the labor group program in 2021/22 season, and we have continued to expand on this work over the last two years. Supported by our customers, the number of labor groups grew significantly in 2023/24, with 43,631 hectares (+125.8%) now covered by labor group activities.</p><p>* World Bank Data Hub.

Forever Chocolate tackles the material issues in our cocoa and chocolate supply chain and operations through investment as well as through the implementation of due diligence. Forever Chocolate's ultimate aim is to generate a living income for cocoa farmers, to protect human rights and children's rights, to become forest positive, to decarbonize our carbon footprint in order to become a net-zero company and to have 100% certified or verified ingredients in all of our products, traceable to farm level.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forever Chocolate was launched in 2016. Founded upon Barry Callebaut's long-standing investment in a sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain, it added transparent annual reporting with a set of time-bound metrics. Resolving the material issues in the cocoa and chocolate supply chain is imperative for social and environmental reasons, plus it helps to build a more resilient supply chain and operations, to the advantage of farmers, our employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders and, ultimately, chocolate lovers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key highlights of 2023/24</p><p>This marks our eighth year of reporting on our Forever Chocolate progress. Throughout fiscal year 2023/24, we faced significant hurdles in advancing sustainability, with cocoa prices hitting record highs due to a global shortage of beans, caused by weather and climate- related challenges. Nevertheless, our dedication to making sustainable chocolate the norm, did not waver. We enhanced our collaboration with customers, industry partners, and broader society, combining our practical experience with their needs. These efforts further solidified our role as a trusted partner for sustainable chocolate solutions Our key highlights include:</p><p>* Implementation of a rigorous organizational-wide approach to prepare for the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which has profoundly transformed our traceability efforts and set a new standard for transparency in our supply chain. As</p><p>\"In 2023/24 we set a new standard for traceability in our supply chain. This significant effort is exemplified by the 669,174 (+22.2%) cocoa farm plots we mapped ensuring traceability to farm level for these farms.</p><p>such, we have mapped 669,174 farm plots (+22.2%) in 2023/24.</p><p>* Significant increase in carbon removals (-388,433 tCO2e). through the upscaling of our agroforestry approach, which reached 33,795 hectares of agroforestry newly established in 2023/24.</p><p>* Scale-upof our paid Labor Groups program by +125.8% in comparison to 2022/23, now covering close to 44,000 hectares.</p><p>* Partnership with three international child rights organizations to address socio-economic factors driving child labor and child rights, supporting our new community-based approach in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria.</p><p>In addition, in 2023/24, we launched our Future Farming Initiative(FFI) which aims to be a catalyst for the industry for scaling sustainable, high-tech cocoa farming. The development of an initial 5,000 hectares in Bahia, Brazil, is designed to pilot innovative, sustainable practices and create a scalable, high-tech model for profitable cocoa farming. Through this project, we aim to set new benchmarks in the industry while sharing our insights and expertise from FFI with partners across all our sourcing regions, supporting their ongoing efforts toward more productive and sustainable cocoa farming.</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 2</p><p>]]</p><p>Continued commitment to traceability</p><p>Traceability is fundamental to our commitment to making sustainable chocolate the norm. Our traceability systems ensure transparency and accountability, allowing us to precisely track the origins of our products while promoting ethical practices, protecting human rights, and minimizing environmental impact through deforestation monitoring, education, and prevention programs. In response to both regulatory requirements and growing customer demand for segregated supply chains that uphold brand sustainability ambitions, we are continuously developing innovative solutions to meet these requirements and expectations. Consequently, in 2023/24, our mapping initiatives were expanded to include 669,174 cocoa farm plots, marking a 22.2% increase. This progress has enabled farm-level traceability for the cocoa sourced from the mapped farms.</p><p>With the continued support of our customers, we also raised the percentage of products containing 100% verified or certified cocoa or chocolate to 55.5%, up from 51.5% in the previous year. Setting industry-wide standards and programs is crucial for the sustainable sourcing of raw materials, as certification serves as just the initial step. We remain committed to collaborating with suppliers and industry initiatives to shape and implement sustainability benchmarks for all the ingredients we source. More information on these and other achievements is provided in each pillar of this report - Prospering Farmers, Human Rights, Thriving Nature and Sustainable Ingredients.</p><p>Fit for a changing regulatory landscape</p><p>Forever Chocolate ensures Barry Callebaut is fit for a changing regulatory landscape. Sustainability is no longer just nice to have, but a \"must-have\" as part of a corporate license to operate. This shift is the direct result of both industry and societal groups that acknowledged the limits of voluntary industry action in building sustainable supply chains. Regulators across the world have in recent years introduced and implemented legislation that requires products to fulfill certain minimum sustainability standards. Both in the United States and in the European Union, authorities can, and will, block the import/distribution of products if they do not fulfill human rights (EU and US) or environmental criteria (EU).</p><p>Particularly noteworthy in this respect is the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which entered into force in June 2023, and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) adopted in 2024.</p><p>EUDR requires companies to ensure that the products they place on the EU market are legal, traceable and deforestation-free. Through our Forever Chocolate actions, we have considerably advanced in our traceability efforts prior to EUDR adoption, by mapping the farmers in our supply chain to verify that the cocoa we supply is legal and deforestation-free. This is by no means an easy exercise, but thanks to the 1,600 people</p><p>we have on the ground, interacting on a daily basis with cocoa farmers, we have made great strides in mapping our supply chain, and will be EUDR compliant by the application date1.</p><p>The EU CSDDD requires companies to implement a due diligence process on human and environmental issues. This means mitigating the risk of potential human rights and environmental harms, identifying and remediating actual human rights and environmental harms, and reporting on due diligence framework. Forever Chocolate has been the platform through which Barry Callebaut has been openly communicating over the years about issues in the cocoa and chocolate supply chain and about the remediation steps it has been carrying out. For a detailed description of the implementation of due diligence in our supply chain and operations, please see the section on due diligencebelow.</p><p>In addition, we are also working towards the quantitative analysis required by the Task Force on Climate Related Disclosures(TCFD). Whilst we already disclose the core elements of TCFD via our Social and Environmental Impact Report, Net Zero Roadmapand CDPreports, we are continuously working on our scenario modelling and risk and mitigation strategies.</p><p>In addition, in 2023/24, Barry Callebaut initiated a project to align its business activities with the EU Taxonomy regulation for sustainable activities, enhancing its data collection and reporting processes to ensure compliance and transparency. This initiative will support our strategic growth in sustainable sectors and strengthen our commitment to environmental responsibility. Furthermore, during the current fiscal year we also commenced a project to ensure preparedness for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive(CSRD), an EU directive aimed at establishing a more standardized approach for the disclosure of information on ESG-related topics, enabling stakeholders to more effectively compare companies' progress in addressing and managing ESG risks. Barry Callebaut will comply with TCFD, CSRD and EU Taxonomy reporting requirements in 2025/26.</p><p>Protect, Grow, Transform</p><p>To make sustainable chocolate the norm we have developed our \"North Star\", a vision of the key enablers to achieve a radical transformation of the cocoa sector. Our \"North Star\" approaches are country-specific and built upon a deep understanding of the respective economic and political context. Achieving the \"North Star\" vision will require a mix of corporate sustainability programs and an enabling policy environment implemented by the public sector. We view this as a long-term process consisting of three sequenced phases - Protect, Grow and Transform. What does this mean in practice?</p><p>It starts with the Protect phase. This is focused on ensuring compliance with certification standards and applicable legislation in cocoa origin and in cocoa consuming regions. Legislation creates a level playing</p><p>* On October 2, 2024, the European Commission proposed a 12 month delay for EUDR implementation, making the law applicable on 30 December 2025 for large companies and 30 June 2026 for micro- and small enterprises. At the time of drafting of this report, the EU co-legislators, the European Parliament and the Council, were reviewing the European Commission's proposal..</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 3</p><p>]]</p><p>field and ensures that all actors are taking responsibility. Barry Callebaut has in the past three years been an ardent supporter of the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), as well as the African Regional Standards on cocoa sustainability (ARS 1000). These are important regulatory developments ensuring the protection of forests and human rights in cocoa and chocolate production through the implementation of supply chain traceability. Together they form the foundation upon which we can implement our corporate sustainability programs in the Grow and Transform phases.</p><p>In the Grow phase we will implement a number of activities that have been proven to deliver impact. The focus is on growing incomes, increasing cocoa farmer yields, implementing agroforestry to build climate change resilience and building a community environment that protects human rights. These actions lay the stepping stones for the Transform phase, where the focus is on modernizing smallholder farming, and piloting industrial cocoa farming as a potential answer to some of the structural challenges inherent in today's smallholder farming model, including traceability and land-use intensity.</p><p>Recognition of our progress and impact</p><p>CDP, an independent organization that assesses the carbon reduction strategies of over 21,000 companies, awarded Barry Callebaut an 'A' and recognized us as a CDP Leader for our efforts in reducing carbon emissions and engaging suppliers to address Scope 3 emissions - which includes emissions beyond our direct supply chain. This recognition reinforces our dedication to transparency, proactive risk management, and setting ambitious, impactful targets for climate action. For our customers and partners, this highlights our unwavering commitment to supporting their sustainability goals. With a proven track record in implementing cutting-edge environmental practices, we continue to lead the way in sustainability innovation and excellence. Additionally, CDP also ranked Barry Callebaut as 'A-' for Forest Stewardship, recognizing our transparency in forest stewardship and our strong efforts in combating deforestation. In addition, Barry Callebaut's 'AA' MSCI ESG rating as at August 31, 2024 has been confirmed.</p><p>By 2025, 500,000 cocoa farmers in our supply chain will have been lifted out of</p><p>poverty. By 2030, we will have mobilized key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model generating living income.</p><p>By 2025, our entire supply chain will be covered by Human Rights Due Diligence, remediating all child labor cases identified. By 2030, the farming communities we source from are empowered to protect child rights.</p><p>By 2025, we will be forest</p><p>positive. By 2030, we will have decarbonized our footprint in line with global efforts to cap global warming at 1.5 degrees</p><p>Celsius. By 2050, we will be a net zero company.</p><p>By 2030, we will have 100% certified or verified cocoa and ingredients in all of our products, traceable to farm level.</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 4</p><p>]]</p><p>Due diligence, what is it and how is it included in Forever Chocolate?</p><p>Forever Chocolate aligns with the OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct, which provide a comprehensive framework for promoting responsible business practices. The guidelines provide enterprises: \"with the flexibility to adapt the characteristics, specific measures and processes of due diligence to their own circumstances\".</p><p>This framework applies universally to Barry Callebaut employees, suppliers, contractors, agency workers, and volunteers. It also extends to Barry Callebaut's wholly owned affiliates and subsidiaries, as well as employees of any joint venture.</p><p>Alignment with the OECD Guidelines helps us to:</p><p>* Establish a unified framework that recognizes the company's obligation to uphold all material risks, encompassing all personnel, business operations, and affiliations across Barry Callebaut's entire value chain;</p><p>* Define a proactive and efficient due diligence strategy for the entire Group;</p><p>* Describe a systematic approach to assess, monitor, and mitigate material risks in Barry Callebaut's value chain following the six steps of the OECD Guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct</p><p>framework.</p><p>By implementing the OECD guidelines, Barry Callebaut seeks to align with incoming regulations, such as the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD), adopted in 2024.</p><p>Governance: embedding responsible business conduct into policies and management systems</p><p>The OECD guidelines for Responsible Business Conduct entails a six-step process:</p><p>1. Embedding responsible business conduct into policies and management systems</p><p>Barry Callebaut's Board of Directors has the overall responsibility of ensuring that Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG), related policies and strategies, including activities for Forever Chocolate, align with the long-term strategy and business model of the company.</p><p>ESG governance is embedded into our policies and management systems by integrating clear policies that align with ESG goals, such as our Supplier Code, which applies to all suppliers and their employees providing products, materials, expertise and related services to any entity of the Barry Callebaut Group. The Supplier Code sets out the essential minimum requirements expected from each supplier and flanks their commitments under applicable laws, regulations and contractual arrangements. Our Global Statement on safeguarding human rights, including the prevention of modern slavery and human trafficking, in our supply chain describes Barry Callebaut's approach and efforts toward safeguarding human rights and ensuring that slavery and human trafficking are not taking place in</p><p>any part of our business or our supply chain. This statement is updated on an annual basis.</p><p>Our approach to ethical governance is structured to enforce these policies, with regular monitoring, reporting, and adjustments to ensure compliance and continual improvement. By embedding ESG into the core of business operations, we not only adhere to regulatory requirements but also build trust with stakeholders, reduce risks, and create long-term value.</p><p>For further details of our activities and policies please see: Our Position on ESG.</p><p>2. Identify and assess adverse impacts in operations, supply chains and business relationships</p><p>To ensure that we are focusing on addressing the most pressing material topics in the chocolate and cocoa value chain, we aim every two years to undertake a materiality assessment to align with the evolving needs of our stakeholders and the changing dynamics of our industry. Our 2023 double materiality assessment reaffirmed our commitment to the Forever Chocolate pillars: Prospering Farmers, Human Rights, Thriving Nature, and Sustainable Ingredients.</p><p>As indicated above, from this assessment, five significant areas emerged as material: Supply Chain Traceability, Climate and Energy, Biodiversity and Ecosystems, Workers in the Value Chain, and Affected Communities. The Board of Directors officially approved these material topics in April 2023. The outcomes of our materiality assessment are visualized in a Materiality Matrix, accessible in our Barry Callebaut's Approach to Double Materiality Method Paper.</p><p>3. Cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts</p><p>For each of our four pillars and their material issues, we have created strategies to achieve our targets and to cease, prevent or mitigate adverse impacts. Our approach is based on the solid foundation of the skills and insights of our people on the ground, scientific evidence and data analysis. Through the mapping of the location and size of the cocoa farms in our direct supply chain, the funding of productivity improving measures for cocoa farmers through Cocoa Horizons, the definition and implementation of industry-wide sustainable sourcing standards and the development of a community-based approach to fighting child labor, to name but a few action plans, we are making good progress in tackling the adverse impacts in our value chain and operations.</p><p>Through constant engagement with stakeholders, including local communities, experts, societal stakeholders, and industry partners, we ensure that our efforts are informed by diverse perspectives and address relevant concerns.</p><p>For a detailed description of our activities to cease, prevent or mitigate, please see the chapters describing how we are tackling the issues in each of the four pillars of Forever Chocolate.</p><p>4. Track implementation and results</p><p>Through on-the-ground assessment and data gathering we track implementation and progress. In</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 5</p><p>]]</p><p>close collaboration with strategic partners we have established a robust digital infrastructure for precise data collection, storage, retrieval, and collaboration among supply chain stakeholders. To illustrate, our ever-growing cocoa farmer database, which maps the geographical location and the size of the farms from which we are sourcing, currently covers 80% of our direct cocoa supply chain, resulting in traceability to farm level.</p><p>Furthermore, in close collaboration with external experts we are developing tools to track progress on several fronts, e.g. by establishing the industry-first carbon calculation methodology for land-use change emissions and developing satellite-imagery-based High Carbon Stock (HCS) maps. In addition, we are conducting independent Human Rights Impact Assessments (HRIAs) for all the main cocoa sourcing countries and regions, and using the results to prioritize and develop interventions and engagement with suppliers to ensure the protection of human rights in our supply chain.</p><p>For a detailed description of how we track implementation and their results, please see the chapters describing how we are tackling the issues for each of the four pillars of Forever Chocolate.</p><p>5. Communicate how impacts are addressed</p><p>We communicate our efforts to resolve the material issues in our supply chain on a regular basis through various channels and reports. This fiscal year we are publishing for the first time our Social and Environmental Impact Report, which includes</p><p>references to all our ESG-related publications and policies, including our GRI Report. In addition, we maintain a dedicated public websitecovering the full range of relevant ESG topics and related reports and policies. We have obtained independent limited assurance over select Forever Chocolate KPIs, from an third-party assuranceprovider.</p><p>6. Provide for, or cooperate in, remediation when appropriate</p><p>Remediation is an integral part of our Forever Chocolate efforts to resolve the material issues in our supply chain. The provision of input support to cocoa farmers, the remediation of identified cases of child labor and the distribution of shade trees are examples of how we are actively remediating the negative impacts from the material issues in the cocoa and chocolate supply chain.</p><p>For a detailed description of our remediation activities, please see Forever Chocolate chapters.</p><p>Engagement with relevant stakeholders &amp; grievance mechanism procedure</p><p>Both for the design and execution of Forever Chocolate, we are in active contact with relevant stakeholders. For the preparation of our biannual materiality assessment, we engaged with a broad range of stakeholders to ensure that our activities and investments under Forever Chocolate are in line with the expectations from cocoa farmers, societal actors, customers, investors and our colleagues.</p><p>OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Business Conduct: risk-based due diligence framework</p><p>[[Communicate      Identify &amp; assess</p><p>how impacts are  adverse impacts</p><p>addressed        in operations,</p><p>supply chains &amp;</p><p>business</p><p>relationships</p><p>Embed responsible   Provide for</p><p>or cooperate</p><p>business conduct    in remediation when</p><p>into policies &amp;     appropriate</p><p>management systems</p><p>Track            Cease, prevent</p><p>or mitigate</p><p>implementation</p><p>adverse impacts</p><p>and results</p><p>]]</p><p>Source: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/due-diligence-for-responsible-business-conduct.html\">https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/due-diligence-for-responsible-business-conduct.html</url></p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 6</p><p>]]</p><p>In fiscal year 2023/24, we also hosted a dedicated consultation with global NGO's on our compliance with EUDR as well as our grievance handling process. We believe this collaboration is essential for cultivating an environment of trust and accountability by encouraging NGOs to communicate their concerns directly with Barry Callebaut. By strengthening our relationships with NGOs, we aim to enhance our due diligence processes, addressing potential non- compliance risks at their source. NGOs commended Barry Callebaut for its transparent and proactive approach, as well as its strategic rigor and ambition, and strongly appreciated our commitment to cover all technical compliance costs for farmers and farmer groups.</p><p>With over 1,600 colleagues in cocoa origin countries, we are in daily contact with cocoa farmers across the globe to deepen our understanding and support them in their concerns and needs. Through Cocoa Horizons, our preferred vehicle for the implementation of sustainability activities in the cocoa supply chain, and through customer programs, we are partnering with our customers to build a sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain. We are partnering with academics and experts to design tools and approaches in support of reaching our Forever Chocolate targets.</p><p>Barry Callebaut has established a dedicated whistleblowing platform: Integrity Line. The Integrity Line platform is part of Barry Callebaut's Compliance program. It was launched to facilitate reporting of non- compliance and suspicious transactions in cases where employees do not feel comfortable addressing such issues directly. The platform also allows for anonymous reporting. Employees can also call the Integrity Line hotline (24/7).</p><p>In addition, to encourage stakeholders and affected groups from the supply chain to report any potential grievances and concerns on human rights, deforestation, and governance violations, Barry Callebaut has established a grievance platform. Through the grievance platform we are inviting input from all stakeholders that will help us to identify potential issues or violations, increase transparency and promote continuous improvement. Our grievance platform covers our entire supply chain. The Compliance team hosts the grievance platform and acts as a coordinator to ensure the adequate processing of incoming grievances. A complaint can be raised by parties who are themselves affected, such as workers or local communities, by an organization representing the affected parties, such as a trade union, or by an independent organization, such as an NGO. With this grievance mechanism, Barry Callebaut has established a process to systematically receive, investigate, and respond to complaints affecting Barry Callebaut's supply chain from rights holders and implement time-bound actions to resolve these issues. In order to distinguish the grievance mechanism from the internal reporting process and internal vulnerability identification processes, it is important to understand that the grievance mechanism deals with complaints coming from external parties in the company's supply</p><p>chain. In this way, Barry Callebaut ensures that an effective grievance mechanism is in place for all external stakeholders.</p><p>Building an enabling policy environment</p><p>Forever Chocolate defines the actions that Barry Callebaut is taking to promote and strengthen a sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain, but for systemic change we need the support of public intervention. Topics such as land consolidation, access to land titles, national traceability systems and access to quality education cannot be addressed through sustainability programs. They require legislation. For this Barry Callebaut is actively engaged in industry associations such as the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) and the European Cocoa Association (ECA) to unite the industry behind a transformative agenda.</p><p>The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) and the EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (CSDDD) will ensure that the cocoa containing products on the EU market will fulfill minimum standards on environmental and human rights protection, driving a level playing field and a baseline sustainability standard in the sector. In the past fiscal year much effort has been put into understanding the specific implementation details of the EUDR, ensuring consistent implementation by industry and harmonized enforcement by authorities. In cocoa origin countries we continued our close cooperation with industry and governments on building a cocoa farmer database, sharing our data on the mapped cocoa farmers in our supply chain. Having a clear line of sight of who produces cocoa and where it is being grown is a prerequisite for establishing country wide traceability and for discouraging cocoa farm expansion into forested land.</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 7</p><p>]]</p><p>Prospering</p><p>Farmers</p><p>Our goal</p><p>By 2025, 500,000 cocoa farmers in our supply chain will have been lifted out of poverty. By 2030, we will have mobilized key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model generating living income.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>A sustainable cocoa and chocolate supply chain starts with prospering farmers. The reality on the ground unfortunately tells a different story. A large proportion of cocoa farmers, globally, and particularly in West Africa, earn an income below the extreme poverty line. Low yields on small plots of land keep cocoa farmers in a state of poverty. As a result many cocoa farmers lack the means to invest in improving their farms, lack the means to send their children to school and to hire professional farm hands. Our philosophy is to provide the needed support to empower cocoa farmers to leverage their cocoa farming expertise to improve their yields and to increase their financial resilience by diversifying their income.</p><p>Barry Callebaut has committed to lifting 500,000 cocoa farmers out of poverty by 2025. By 2030 we will have mobilized key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model generating living income.</p><p>Our approach</p><p>Farmer Income</p><p>To lift cocoa farmers out of poverty and get them on a trajectory towards a living income, we need to have deep insights into the components of a farmer's income. For this we conducted in-depth research into cocoa farmer incomes in three major cocoa producing countries: Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana. The purpose of our research is to support the development and implementation of Living Income Interventions, ranging from increased access to finances, training, coaching, production inputs and labor services, in close collaboration with other key stakeholders in the cocoa value chain.</p><p>A typical farmer that has reached a living income has on average 5 hectares of land dedicated to cocoa with a yield of more than 600 kg/ha. This is a different reality for the average cocoa farmer, who cultivate 3.8 hectares of land dedicated to cocoa with an average yield of 450 kg/ha.</p><p>Cocoa farmers and their families whose income does not meet the living income benchmark is an economic development issue. Even if cocoa prices increase, as they did in the past fiscal year, not all cocoa farmers will earn an income above the living income benchmark. To achieve a living income for cocoa farmers in our supply chain, we need to work at a landscape level. This means working with the governments of cocoa origin countries to accelerate the stimulation and diversification of rural economies, working together with other sectors beyond cocoa and openly sharing data and insights on income.</p><p>Barry Callebaut's living income approach is structured around various interventions leading to a smart mix for the cocoa farmers we work with. First, there are the interventions to increase cocoa yield and create income from other sources than cocoa. These interventions include providing cocoa farmers with access to professional labor groups that can help them prune their cocoa trees. Labor group members are often cocoa farmers operating on smaller size farms, who can thus earn additional income to support their households. Cocoa farmers are also given access to Farm Services, a combination of fertilizers, crop protection inputs, coaching, as well as soil analysis to drive tailored farm-specific interventions. In addition, the interventions we offer can also entail payments for Environmental Services Agroforestry, which aim to increase survival rates of seedlings. Through this</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 8</p><p>]]</p><p>program, Barry Callebaut distributes non-cocoa trees to help diversify farmer incomes, provide shade for cocoa seedlings, sequester carbon dioxide and improve soil quality and biodiversity. Further details are given on page 19.</p><p>Second, there is the transfer of cash. This can take the form of cash premiums on top of the cocoa price to bridge the gap towards a living income, conditional cash transfers, including the implementation of good agricultural practices, and unconditional cash transfers.</p><p>Third, we support cocoa farming communities in setting up of Village Savings Loans Associations (VSLAs), collective savings and loans schemes managed by the women in the community that increase the financial resilience of cocoa communities in general and women (farmers) in particular.</p><p>And finally, efforts toward land size consolidation are supported to increase the size of farms.</p><p>Partnering with our customers for change</p><p>Alongside our own interventions, we partner with our customers to support cocoa farmers on their journey to achieving a living income. Most programs are thus set up to become self-sustaining, i.e. to not be dependent on open-ended external funding. This means that subsidies are often conditional on co-investment by the cocoa farmers or conditional upon successful implementation of certain activities, such as cocoa tree pruning.</p><p>We support Nestl\u00e9, as a part of its Living Income Action Plan, with the implementation of its Income Accelerator. Under the program, participating cocoa- farming families receive, on top of certification premiums, a mobile cash payment for enrolling children in the household in school, implementing good agricultural practices, performing agroforestry activities to increase climate resilience and diversifying incomes, for example by growing other crops and raising livestock.</p><p>Our data and research across multiple studies clearly and consistently demonstrate that targeted pre- harvest interventions, such as increased labor for cocoa tree pruning and the strategic application of fertilizers, lead to significantly higher cocoa yields and improved farmer incomes. However, the financial burden of these necessary investments remains a major challenge for cocoa farmers. Given that cocoa farming is predominantly a family-run business, the cost of additional labor and fertilizers often exceeds what these farmers can afford. This issue is not due to a lack of farming expertise, but rather stems from structural and economic barriers related to cost of production. Despite these challenges, our work, including a trial project with a major global partner at our Farm Services division, underscores the potential of pre- harvest interventions. By addressing the financial barriers, we can help cocoa farmers unlock the full potential of their farms.</p><p>Increased use of labor groups to increase cocoa yields</p><p>In addition to the application of soil fertilizers, proper cocoa tree pruning plays a vital role in enhancing</p><p>cocoa production. To support farmers in these labor- intensive tasks, Barry Callebaut launched the Labor Groups program in the 2021/22 season, in collaboration with key partners like Mondelez International and Ben</p><p>* Jerry's, and customers of the Cocoa Horizons Foundation.</p><p>By combining effective pruning with the use of fertilizers and good agronomic practices, cocoa trees can maximize fruit production, resulting in improved quality and higher yields. Labor groups provide farmers with critical assistance in areas such as pruning, weeding, pesticide application, and fertilizer management. This program also creates professional service providers by contracting local community members and cocoa farmers to form labor groups through farmer organizations. Equipped with essential tools and training, these groups not only provide essential support to farmers but also create additional</p><p>\"</p><p>With the backing of our customers, labor group activities increased significantly in 2023/24. As a result, 43,631 (+125.8%) hectares were covered by programs to support farmers with labor groups.</p><p>income opportunities for local workers. With the backing of our customers, the program continued to expand significantly in 2023/24 covering all cocoa- producing regions in West Africa.</p><p>At Barry Callebaut, we are actively collaborating with our customers on various premium-paying programs. We are also making it easier for farmers receive their premiums. In 2023/24 we continued scaling our digital premium payment solutions across West Africa, Indonesia and South America. Digital premium payments benefit cocoa farmers by establishing credible proof of income and improving their access to financial services. Our digital payment program has also helped thousands of West African farmers to obtain a national ID by working with community and government authorities. In 2023/24, our digital payments initiative covered more than 60,000 cocoa farmers.</p><p>We are also a living income implementer, encouraging and supporting our customers to follow suit. For example, Barry Callebaut enables Tony's Open Chainas the cocoa processing partner and has implemented sustainability projects on the ground for Ben &amp; Jerry's Living Income Program since 2016.</p><p>In addition, in 2023/24 we made efforts to enhance our purchasing practices. This included a review of our</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 9</p><p>]]</p><p>contracts, particularly for cooperatives in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire that cater specifically to our customers, reflecting our customers' multi-year commitments. In C\u00f4te d' Ivoire, we have signed three-year contracts with 90% of the cooperatives from which Barry Callebaut directly sources.</p><p>Furthermore, in 2023/24 Barry Callebaut actively participated in the working group on pricing mechanisms under the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire-Ghana Cocoa Initiative (CIGCI) Economic Pact. Our aim is to shift the focus of discussion to the farm gate price, recognizing that higher farm gate prices can significantly contribute to poverty reduction. We believe that analyzing the appropriate mechanisms in a broader context of price construction, including the significance of farm gate prices and export prices, will have a considerable positive impact on farmers' incomes.</p><p>From providing training to offering support in implementation through our Farm Services business</p><p>Based on these insights and our direct engagement with farmers, in the past fiscal year, we continued to deploy our refined Farm Services business. We have shifted our focus from farmer training to providing more robust support for pre-harvest activities. To enhance cocoa farmers' quality yield per hectare, we now emphasize better soil management, such as the correct timing and amount of fertilizer application, financial support for third-party labor services, and access to improved planting materials.</p><p>It is essential to have an in-depth understanding of the conditions, challenges, and potential of the farms and farmers we work with. During the past fiscal year, we significantly expanded our extensive database by adding more farmers with full data. This means we have captured their socioeconomic and household information through census interviews and mapped the geographical location and size of their farms. Gathering this data helps us gain a more detailed picture of farmer profiles and a better understanding of their needs, allowing us to enhance our Farm Services business.</p><p>Our Farm Services specialists collaborate closely with farmers to assess their unique farm environments, including soil conditions, the age of cocoa trees, and the presence of other crops and livestock. They also evaluate the farmer's existing agricultural skills and resources. This thorough assessment allows us to develop tailored Farm Business Plans (FBPs) for each farmer, outlining a multi-year strategy to maximize the farm's potential income through optimal management.</p><p>Better soil management through subsidized fertilizer</p><p>Decreasing soil fertility and the suboptimal use of agrochemicals are associated with declining cocoa yields. We continued to support farmers with soil management techniques and productivity packages in 2023/24. Given the increased cost of fertilizers, we also continued to focus on subsidizing fertilizers for farmers in West Africa. Funded by Cocoa Horizons customers, a</p><p>total of almost CHF 1.1 million was allocated to such subsidies.</p><p>Providing improved planting material</p><p>Beyond offering pre-harvest labor assistance and optimizing soil management, the age and variety of cocoa trees are crucial factors in determining crop yields. To help rejuvenate cocoa farms, Barry Callebaut is committed to distributing more resilient, high-yield cocoa varieties, aimed at boosting long-term productivity. Seedlings are carefully bred for resistance against various pests and diseases that negatively impact cocoa production.</p><p>However, a resilient ecosystem for cocoa farms also requires a variety of other tree species. In the 2023/24 period, we distributed nearly 3.3 million non-cocoa trees, contributing to income diversification for farmers, while offering vital shade for cocoa seedlings, removing CO2, and improving soil health and biodiversity. The benefits of sustainable cocoa cultivation through agroforestry, alongside our emphasis on long-term success through training, ongoing monitoring, and payments for ecosystem services (PES), are detailed further on page 19.</p><p>The relationship between farm size and income</p><p>In May 2023, we released a White Paperfollowing six years of collaboration between Barry Callebaut, Agri- Logic, IDH, and Rainforest Alliance. It outlines actionable steps for transforming cocoa farming in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and West Africa. By addressing key drivers of poverty reduction - yield, farm size, and price - the findings provided critical insights for refining our strategy to enhance farmers' income, boost cocoa yields, and safeguard surrounding forests. Our data analysis shows that a larger farm can significantly increase income by allowing for greater cocoa production, but only if coupled with adequate investment.</p><p>However, encouraging farmers to pursue long-term yield improvement activities (such as soil management and planting material) can be a challenge due to limited land tenure and tree rights. In contrast to many other countries, applying for land certificates in West Africa is often an expensive and time-consuming process. To help tackle this issue, we have cooperated with industry partners, donors and local implementers through the C\u00f4te d'Ivoire Land Partnership (CLAP)since 2019. Our joint efforts have resulted in the development of an upscaling model for land registration, granting farmers access to more affordable and faster land documentation. This initiative places significant emphasis on including marginalized groups and preventing land conflicts.</p><p>Systemic change together with all supply chain actors</p><p>Achieving a fully sustainable cocoa and chocolate sector requires commitment from all stakeholders in the supply chain. To enhance the implementation and impact of our Farm Services offerings, collaboration among sector-wide stakeholders and the public sector</p><p>[[Barry Callebaut  Page 10</p><p>]]</p><p>is imperative in driving structural change and reducing poverty.</p><p>Government action at origin is essential to address the issues of traceability, rural infrastructure development and proper enforcement of national policies and legislation. These interventions must be coupled with regulatory interventions and sensitization in cocoa- consuming regions to drive demand for sustainably sourced cocoa.</p><p>This is why we are committed to mobilizing key stakeholders around a transformative cocoa farming model that generates a living income.</p><p>Land consolidation is needed to increase farm size and encourage higher levels of investment in farms. This effort must be accompanied by the creation of mainstream banking opportunities for farmers, facilitating investments in their farms, as well as the development of integrated agricultural policies that ensure adequate cocoa supply management, land titles for farmers, a registry for cocoa farmers and alternative livelihoods for cocoa farmers in protected forest areas. While the modernization of cocoa farming practices is imperative, the resulting increase in cocoa yield needs to be addressed by consolidating the number of cocoa farms. To facilitate this transition, these farm policies should also encourage the production of other essential agricultural goods that promote income diversification and alternative livelihoods for farmers. Lastly, it is crucial to optimize the pricing structure to maximize its impact on farmer incomes.</p><p>Only through a broad and coordinated mobilization of public and private actors will we be able to drive the change that is required in the cocoa supply chain.</p><p>Our measured impact</p><p>At Barry Callebaut, we are aiming for a consistent poverty reduction perspective, and a living income- enabling farming model towards 2030. The first step towards living income is to support the lifting of cocoa farmers out of poverty, measured against the International Poverty Line threshold.2 However, achieving this is just the beginning. To measure our progress towards our target to have more than 500,000 cocoa farmers lifted out of poverty by 2025, we refer to the International Poverty Line definition of extreme poverty as a benchmark, which is USD 2.15/ day, adjusted for purchasing power parity3.</p><p>Fiscal year 2023/24 presented a challenging landscape, with a combination of weather and climate factors resulting in a shortage of cocoa beans, subsequently driving bean prices to historic high levels. In response, the governments of C\u00f4te d'Ivoire and Ghana raised the farm-gate prices to CFA 1500 /kg and GHS 33.12 GHS/ kg, respectively. While the farm-gate price increase was positive, the fact is, that cocoa farmers' incomes, particularly in West Africa, remain too low.</p><p>Our data4 shows that poverty reduction is driven by three key factors - yield, size of farm, and price. Price mechanisms can support an increase in farmer income, as illustrated this year with the increase in farm-gate prices.</p><p>However, it is also critical to highlight that overall, particularly in West Africa, which is the world's largest cocoa producing region, cocoa trees are aging and cocoa bean yield is decreasing. Increasing productivity is only possible with proper farm management practices, such as pruning cocoa trees, managing soil health, maintaining shade, and controlling pests, especially as farmers face tougher climatic conditions and heightened disease pressure.</p><p>This is why, in 2023/24, we have continued to expand our efforts in pre-harvest interventions, including the scaling up of labor groups. Along with boosting yields, this work has also deepened our engagement with farmers, strengthening the partnership between Barry Callebaut and the farmers we source from. As a result, despite bean shortages, the volume of cocoa beans supplied by these farmer groups has remained stable.</p><p>It is important to note that our analysis shows that in the previous fiscal year (2022/23), around 40% of farmers in our supply chain were below the poverty line with USD 1/per person/, per day, away from the poverty line baseline, while the other 60% of farmers, were below the poverty line by USD 1 - 3 USD/per person/, per day. On average, in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the amount in farm-gate price increase, provides farmers with an additional 0.78 USD per person per day, bringing the farmers placed below the poverty line in 2022/23, above it this year. Finally, we have also slightly revised our methodology for better alignment with the OECD Household Modified scale.</p><p>In 2023/24, measured against the International Poverty Line threshold of USD 2.15/day, we estimate 475,752 cocoa farmers in our supply chain are no longer in poverty, compared to prior year (+76.4%).</p><p>To support farmers in these labor-intensive tasks, Barry Callebaut launched the labor group program in 2021/22 season, and we have continued to expand on this work over the last two years. Supported by our customers, the number of labor groups grew significantly in 2023/24, with 43,631 hectares (+125.8%) now covered by labor group activities.</p><p>* World Bank Data Hub.

He said: \"The connection between health and climate change is evident, yet it has not been a specific focus of the COP process - until now. This must change.\"</p><p>He continued, \"As we prepare for the groundbreaking Health Day at COP28, we are resolute in our determination to address the challenges posed to health by climate change and encourage ambitious investment in the health sector. Our goal is to build resilient, equitable health systems capable of withstanding the impact of climate change.\"</p><p>He went on to thank the country champions, Brazil, the UK, the USA, the Netherlands, Kenya, Fiji, India, Egypt, Sierra Leone, and Germany for their work to lead the climate health discussions at COP28.</p><p>During his remarks, Dr. Al Jaber highlighted the risks climate change poses to human health, including shifting disease patterns, expanding vectors, and the resurgence of previously contained diseases.</p><p>He noted that WHO statistics reveal that air pollution alone leads to seven million excess deaths annually and that vector-borne diseases, such as Malaria, are expanding their reach due to rising temperatures and changing weather patterns, disproportionately affecting vulnerable communities.</p><p>Alongside this growing threat, the COP28 Health Day - scheduled for the 3rd December -will also take into account the fragility of public health systems worldwide, as exposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the urgent need for transformative changes to adapt these systems in response to climate change.</p><p>\"COP28 is determined to shine a light on these issues and to bring together partners who can make a positive difference. We are determined to reverse these trends by bringing the world together around an inclusive action agenda centered around a just transition, fairer climate finance and improved lives and livelihoods.\" Dr. Al Jaber said.</p><p>Finance will also be a priority during COP28's Health Day. The financial toll of health crises attributed to climate change is estimated to reach between $2-4 billion annually by 2030, exacerbating poverty, particularly in disadvantaged regions. The World Bank projects that nearly 40 percent of climate-related poverty will result from the direct health impacts of climate change, impacting productivity, income, and health expenses.</p><p>In his remarks, Dr. Al Jaber called for increased concessional funds to the Global South to lower risks and attract private capital. He emphasized the need to rebalance finance and called on governments to double adaptation finance by 2025, urging them to contribute generously to replenish the Green Climate Fund.</p><p>Dr. Al Jaber also underscored the significance of investing in health as a crucial aspect of climate resilience, emphasizing that these expenses should be viewed as investments rather than costs. According to the World Bank, every dollar invested in building climate resilience yields an average benefit of four dollars.</p><p>As such, he called on financial institutions, including development banks, to prioritize climate-health investments. Dr. Al Jaber commended the leadership of organizations such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank, the Green Climate Fund, the Rockefeller Foundation for their commitment to closing the climate-health financing gap at COP28.</p><p>During the session, Dr. Al Jaber highlighted the UAE's legacy and leadership to safeguard human health. He underscored the commitment of Founding Father His Highness Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and President His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan to prioritize the lives and livelihoods of people.</p><p>He highlighted initiatives such as 'Reaching the Last Mile', which, through His Highness Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed, has committed over $455 million to improve global health outcomes, with an emphasis on supporting resilient health systems that best serve vulnerable communities.</p><p>The UN event, 'Looking Forward Towards COP's First-Ever Day of Health: Advancing A Bold Vision for Action, Equity, and Accountability', featured prominent figures including His Excellency Adnan Amin, CEO of COP28; and Dr. Maria Neira, Director of the Department of Environment, Climate Change, and Health at the WHO. The session was moderated by Vanessa Kerry, WHO's Special Envoy on Climate Change and Health.</p><p>The COP28 Presidency's Action Agenda outlines a science-based, action-oriented plan focused on charting a new course to address the climate crisis. It combines passion with pragmatism and ambition with realism.</p><p>Health sits within the part of the Agenda that focuses on people, lives, and livelihoods.

The policy brief was prepared by the Global Center on Adaptation and African Adaptation Initiative and outlines a plan of action for African countries to ensure stimulus spending is used to build back better from the COVID-19 crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The policy brief recommends adaptation actions for three key systems affected by both the pandemic and climate change in Africa: systems that produce our food; protect and manage our water and plan and build our infrastructure. Specifically, the recommendations include adaptation actions to secure the food supply for vulnerable populations and strengthen the agricultural value chain; increase access to water and sanitation in parallel with efforts to improve water governance; and investment in resilient infrastructure to create jobs. These recommendations result in a triple dividend for African countries: reduced pandemic risk, increased climate resilience and strengthened economic recovery.</p><p>Commenting on the brief's release, Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of Gabon and African Union Champion of the African Adaptation Initiative said:</p><p>\"The real impact of the coronavirus crisis on climate will ultimately depend on the choices we make in how we recover. Meeting the Paris Agreement's goals for mitigation and adaptation must be central to this effort to ensure we reduce the likelihood of future pandemics.\"</p><p>Ban Ki-moon, 8th United Nations Secretary General and Co-Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation said:</p><p>\"If the virus is a shared global challenge, so too should be the need to build resilience against future shocks. Emerging and developing countries are the least prepared for the arrival of COVID-19, just as they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.\"</p><p>Patrick Verkooijen, CEO of the Global Center on Adaptation said:</p><p>\"Previous epidemic outbreaks have provided us with vital lessons, local knowledge and expertise that is also relevant in helping us to find innovative ways to address our climate crisis.\"</p><p>Other global leaders also endorsed the policy brief recommendations:</p><p>Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund said:</p><p>\"The world is about to deploy enormous, gigantic fiscal stimulus and we can do it in a way that we tackle both crises at the same time. If our world is to come out of this crisis more resilient, we must do everything in our power to make it a green recovery.\"</p><p>Feike Sijbesma, Honorary Chairman of Royal DSM and Co-Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation said:</p><p>\"The COVID-19 pandemic has reinforced the critical role of initiatives like Africa Improved Foods to ensure we can guarantee Africa's food security while adapting to the impacts of climate change.\"</p><p>Peter Eriksson, Minister of International Development for Sweden said:</p><p>\"For Africa, the COVID-19 pandemic has collided with our climate emergency. We must ensure we integrate solutions to both crises into a coherent response in support of African countries. This can be achieved through intensifying climate adaptation efforts through the Global Center on Adaptation. The GCA is a key solutions broker and center of excellence with a holistic approach, that aims to accelerate adaptation solutions for a climate resilient future in Africa.\".</p><p>Dag-Inge Ulstein, Minister of International Development for Norway said:</p><p>\"The COVID-19 crisis is creating an even greater need for international cooperation. Using the stimulus spending to assist poorer countries in addressing the impacts of our climate crisis is not only the smart thing to do, it's the right thing to do as we continue to work in close collaboration with the Global Center on Adaptation in building climate and pandemic resilience in Africa.\"</p><p>Akinwui Adesina, President of the African Development Bank said:</p><p>\"The combination of COVID-19 pandemic and the massive invasion of desert locusts in parts of Africa present a twin challenge for health and food security for millions of people, and exacerbates Africa's vulnerabilities and development challenges. It is time to devote more resources to Africa to expand its fiscal space to secure lives during the COVID-19 pandemic and for safeguarding the environment, on which all lives today and the future depend, by enhancing climate adaptation.\"</p><p>About the Global Center on Adaptation</p><p>Please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gca.org/about\">http://www.gca.org/about</url></p><p>About the African Adaptation Initiative</p><p>Please visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://africaadaptationinitiative.org/#about2\">https://africaadaptationinitiative.org/#about2</url></p><p>Logo - <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1044191/GCA_Logo.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1044191/GCA_Logo.jpg</url> Logo -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171710/African_Adaptation_Initiative_Logo.jpg\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171710/African_Adaptation_Initiative_Logo.jpg</url> PDF -       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171711/The_Global_Center_on_Adaptation.pdf\">https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1171711/The_Global_Center_on_Adaptation.pdf</url></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Additional content: <br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100068156/100848282?langid=2\">https://www.presseportal.ch/de/pm/100068156/100848282?langid=2</url> <br/>OTS:                The Global Center on Adaptation </pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSAK-100848282</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NEWSAK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YYJ-JBS1-DYBW-52HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">275505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"844\"/><timeReceived>2:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 News Aktuell GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>News Aktuell Switzerland</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21666\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"05\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>May 22, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The new sustainability program entitled The Positive Cup will be based on an investment of CHF 500 million over the next six years. Part of this investment will be used to establish a new Sustainable Development Fund, which will play a key role in channelling resources into specific projects. The new strategy is supported by members of the Nespresso Sustainability Advisory Board (NSAB) including the Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and brand ambassador George Clooney.</p><p>The Positive Cup strategy, based on the Nestl\u00e9 approach to Creating Shared Value, builds upon the significant steps that the company has already taken over the last five years* to improve farmer welfare and drive environmental sustainability in coffee sourcing and consumption. It sets out concrete steps that the company will implement to achieve its sustainability goals by 2020. The fund will be used to finance the range of programs, which form part of the strategy as well as to attract additional external partner funding.</p><p>\"Our sustainability approach has always been designed to do more than simply minimise impacts,\" said Mr. Duvoisin. \"The development of even more innovative programs with our partners demonstrates our commitment to creating shared value and generating positive impacts for all stakeholders across the entire value chain. This CHF 500 million investment significantly builds on our current sustainability investment to ensure the long-term success of our business model. This includes securing access to the one to two percent of coffee produced in the world that meets our strict quality and taste standards through our AAA Sustainable Quality(TM) Program. This approach also allows us to innovate thanks to the direct relationships we build with farmers. The Sustainable Development Fund will allow us to allocate new funding to groundbreaking programs such as the reviving of the coffee sector in South Sudan.\"</p><p>The Positive Cup Commitments</p><p>The Positive Cup program incorporates ambitious goals in the areas of coffee sourcing and social welfare; aluminium sourcing, use and disposal; and resilience to climate change. Specifically, by 2020 Nespresso commits to:</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">   Coffee - 100% sustainably sourced coffee      <br/>   - Source 100% of its permanent range of Grand Cru coffees        <br/>     sustainably through the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality        <br/>     Program by significantly expanding the AAA Program in Ethiopia, <br/>     Kenya and South Sudan, and investing over CHF 15 million in      <br/>     these countries over six years. <br/>   - Assist farmers to achieve high certification standards (in       <br/>     water management, biodiversity and fair treatment of workers,    <br/>     for example) through our long-term partner Rainforest Alliance   <br/>     (since 2003) and Fairtrade.      <br/>   - Pursue innovative solutions to farmer welfare, including the    <br/>     expansion of the AAA Farmer Future Program initially through a   <br/>     retirement fund for farmers in Colombia.  <br/></pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">   Aluminium - 100% sustainably managed aluminium      <br/>   - Expand the capacity to collect used aluminium capsules to 100% <br/>     wherever the company does business and increase recycling        <br/>     rates.      <br/>   - Recycle Nespresso capsules collected by the company into new    <br/>     Nespresso capsules each time it makes sense environmentally**.   <br/>   - Source 100% of virgin aluminium capsule material compliant with <br/>     the new Aluminium Stewardship Initiative standard, being        <br/>     developed within a multi-stakeholder programme led by the IUCN. <br/></pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">   Climate - 100% carbon insetting***      <br/>   - Further reduce by 10% the carbon footprint of the company.

Nespresso plans to inset  <br/>     its residual operational carbon footprint and increase farm  <br/>     climate resilience through an extensive agroforestry programme. <br/></pre></p><p>\"Our business model enables us to be involved in every stage of coffee sourcing, production and sale. It allows us to maintain particularly close relationships and have a direct dialogue with our consumers and Club Members,\" said Mr. Duvoisin. \"As a result, we have a unique opportunity to strongly engage with our Club Members to achieve our Positive Cup commitments, in particular as it relates to capsule recycling. Nespresso cannot achieve its objectives alone. We call on our Club Members to actively take part in furthering our recycling efforts.\"</p><p>Nespresso Sustainability Advisory Board - Driving innovation and collaboration</p><p>The second annual NSAB brought together long-time Nespresso brand ambassador George Clooney, partners including The Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International, TechnoServe, IUCN and Pur Projet and Nespresso management, to help the company enhance its long term sustainability strategy and to serve as a base for partnership on sustainability initiatives.</p><p>The collaborative platform has played an important role in shaping the companys approach and informing the development of innovative and impactful programs.</p><p>\"We are proud of our long-standing relationship with Nespresso,\" said Tensie Whelan, President of the Rainforest Alliance. \"This cutting edge approach will help us further build on the real impact we together are having on the ground in farming communities, driving economic and environmental benefits for over 60,000 farmers who are part of the AAA Program. The Nespresso commitment to increase the amount of Rainforest Alliance certified coffee to 50% is an important next step in our collaboration and will provide further assurances to consumers that the coffee they are buying is having a positive impact.\"</p><p>\"The AAA Farmer Future Program, coming out of the Nespresso and Fairtrade commitment to work together, will bring measurable benefits to farmers and their families in Caldas, Colombia,\" said Harriet Lamb, CEO of Fairtrade International. \"Farmers selling to Nespresso now have the option to invest Fairtrade Premiums in this first-of-its-kind retirement fund. Its good news for the farmers - whose average age is over 50 and who face an uncertain future - and one way to help protect the future of coffee in Colombia by offering better, long-term prospects.\"</p><p>\"If there is to be lasting peace and prosperity in South Sudan, part of the equation will be a diversified economy and opportunities that benefit the people of the country,\" said George Clooney. \"The investment by Nespresso and TechnoServe in South Sudans coffee sector, even while the conflict is ongoing, is providing much-needed income for hundreds of farmers and their families living in coffee communities. It is also an investment in South Sudans future prospects for peace and economic development, where wealth is created and shared. What Nespresso and TechnoServe are doing in partnership with South Sudanese agricultural cooperatives in the coffee sector can provide a model for other agricultural investments.\"</p><p>\"The approach that Nespresso is taking is completely aligned with the vision we have to integrate social and environmental innovations into the heart of business,\" said Tristan Lecomte, President of Pur Projet. \"We believe that investing in reforestation of agricultural regions will not only restore natural ecosystems but ultimately also improve coffee quality and productivity and provide better returns for farmers.\"</p><p>\"We are pleased to be able to work with Nespresso to foster greater sustainability and transparency throughout the aluminium value chain,\" said Julia Marton-Lef\u00e8vre, Director General of IUCN. \"The forward looking approach that the company is taking to further expand its recycling solutions and encourage consumers to recycle will be greatly strengthened by the commitment to source 100% of virgin aluminium capsule material compliant with the new Aluminium Stewardship Initiative standard. The company has played a leading role in initiating the new standard and continues to be a strong proponent for sustainable aluminium use.\"</p><p>- Ends -</p><p>*Nespresso 2013 sustainability commitments Nespresso has met and surpassed its 2013 sustainability commitments, set out in 2009. The company has exceeded its goal of sourcing 80% of its coffee from its AAA Sustainable Quality(TM) Program (84%), putting in place the capacity to recycle over 75% of Nespresso capsules sold worldwide (80%) and reducing the carbon footprint of a cup of Nespresso coffee by 20% (-20.7%).</p><p>** For example, in UK, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Austria and Italy.</p><p>*** Definition of insetting: unlike \"offsetting\" traditional carbon compensation where compensation takes place in a different location using uncorrelated actors and technical activities, \"insetting\" integrates socio-environmental commitments at the heart of the companies business activities and networks.</p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">   More information:  <br/>   Videos: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.youtube.com/nespresso\">www.youtube.com/nespresso</url>  <br/>   Backgrounders on AAA Program in Africa, AAA Farmer Future Program  <br/>   and agroforestry available here:  <br/>         \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nestle-nespresso.com/media/library/documents\">www.nestle-nespresso.com/media/library/documents</url>  <br/>   Nespresso Sustainability Advisory Board members and description:  <br/>         \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ots.ch/06Kgt\">http://ots.ch/06Kgt</url> <br/></pre></p><p>About Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA is the pioneer and reference for highest-quality portioned premium coffee.

Die ernuechternde Realitaet ist, dass die ueberwiegende Mehrheit - 142 Laender - in den unteren Bereich der Widerstandsfaehigkeit faellt, in dem die Buerger staerker durch extreme Umweltereignisse wie Waldbraende, Hurrikane, Hitzewellen, Ueberschwemmungen, Duerren und Stuerme gefaehrdet sind. Die Infrastruktur wird sowohl schwaecher als auch anfaelliger sein, und die Faehigkeit, sich auf extreme Wetterereignisse vorzubereiten und auf deren Folgen zu reagieren, wird geringer sein.</p><p>Der Klimavertraeglichkeitsindex fuer Investitionsmigration (https://www.henleyglob al.com/publications/investment-migration-climate-resilience-index) kombiniert in einzigartiger Weise Weltbank (<url normalizedValue=\"https://data.worldbank.org/\">https://data.worldbank.org/</url>) -BIP-Daten (der Durchschnitt des normalisierten BIP und des BIP pro Kopf fuer jedes Land) mit den neuesten Daten der Notre Dame Global Adaptation Initiative (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gain.nd.edu/\">https://gain.nd.edu/</url>) (ND-GAIN) Laender-Index (<url normalizedValue=\"https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/\">https://gain.nd.edu/our-work/country-index/</url>) , der die Anfaelligkeit der Laender fuer den Klimawandel und die Bereitschaft, finanzielle Investitionen (Klimafinanzierung) in Klimaanpassungsmassnahmen umzuwandeln, zusammenfasst. Das neue Global Climate Resilience Ranking von Henley &amp; Partners beruecksichtigt die wirtschaftliche Faehigkeit eines Landes, sich an den Klimawandel anzupassen und seine Buerger vor den schlimmsten Auswirkungen zu schuetzen, indem es die BIP-Daten mit einbezieht.</p><p>Es ueberrascht nicht, dass die fuenf fuehrenden Laender alle auf der noerdlichen Hemisphaere liegen. Die USA liegen mit einem Wert von 70,6 auf Platz 1, gefolgt von Deutschland (70,3), dem Vereinigten Koenigreich (69,4), der Schweiz (68,4) und Kanada (68,3), das mit knappem Abstand auf Platz 5 liegt.
