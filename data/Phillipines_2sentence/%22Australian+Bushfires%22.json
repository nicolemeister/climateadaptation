Prolonged droughts and record-breaking temperatures intensified the fires that have burned more than 10 million hectares of land mostly in the Australian outback, killing around one billion animals and driving species to near extinction.</p><p>  Galicha remarked that climate-related disaster has impacts beyond Australian biodiversity and communities. He added that preventing disasters of this magnitude \"require global holistic action beneficial not only to a particular race, not only to humanity but the planet as a whole.</p><p>\" Global and local leaders must recognize the urgency for mitigating climate change to prevent similar incidents in the future, he said, expressing disappointment on the outcomes of the recent climate talks in Madrid, Spain. \"Denial of the climate crisis is the denial of humanity's future existence,\" he said.</p><p> Despite the warning of scientists for drastic emissions cuts to limit global warming by 2030, there was a lack of significant progress made in Madrid. Key calls including raising targets for climate change mitigation pledges, strengthening mechanisms to avert loss and damage, and rules for the global carbon market fell through in the negotiations.</p><p> Thaddeus Martinez, veteran forester from the Haribon Foundation, emphasized that governments must look beyond the short-term benefits of fossil fuels on economic development. He said \"it is not just the economic production supported by this power generation that needs to be examined, but also the impacts on us.</p><p> Renewable energy power generation will be more appropriate.\" Forest fires in Phl The Philippines is not at risk of forest fires in the scale of Australia's, according to Martinez.</p><p> However, global warming could increase the occurrences of small forest fires that would have devastating effects on ecosystems and nearby communities. While the country lacks recent data on forest fires, Martinez observed from anecdotal evidence that climate change has made forests more vulnerable.</p><p> \"There is the same case of fire, but given that we have climate change, we can say that there are more hazards now compared to the previous decades,\" he said. Around 90 percent of all forest fires in the Philippines are caused by human activities, such as the kaingin or slashing-and-burning of forests to create more agricultural lands, he said.</p><p> This, however, has long been rendered illegal under the Forestry Reform Code of 1975. Martinez noted the Cordilleras and the Zambales mountains are two sites most prone to forest fires. Around 797 hectares of forestlands were destroyed from January to March 2019 in the Cordilleras due to kaingin, causing nearly P21 million in damage.</p><p> These cases, according to Martinez, show that nearly all the causes of forest fires, whether directly through kaingin or indirectly through climate change impacts, are ultimately anthropogenic. \"Maybe there are some social aspects that we need to look at.</p><p> Why are some people deliberately causing the fire? It's not only the natural causes, but it's anthropogenic as well,\" he said. To avoid this, Martinez highlighted the need to empower local communities to protect the forests.</p><p> By educating them about forest-related laws, climate change, burning of fossil fuels and the importance of biodiversity, he hopes that the people would \"have a true and deep concern for the environment.\" He noted one of Haribon's rain forestation sites in Mt.</p><p> Banahaw-San Cristobal was burned down last April. The three farmers responsible for the fires have been apprehended and would be trained to help restore the forests, in collaboration with the local community and government agencies.</p><p> Martinez also urged an increase in capacity and resources of the Bureau of Fire Protection, which is legally mandated to handle forest fires. He said the Philippine government must lead the way in phasing out coal plants and coal-mining operations on the domestic front as actively as it campaigns for it in the climate talks.</p><p> This is to avoid adding forest fires to the growing list of hazards that one of the most climate vulnerable countries must deal with.  \"If the people seated in government are the ones advocating for these coal-fired power plants, what is the return for us?\" he said.</p>", "publisher": "The Philippine Star", "instances": ["-- --  (The Philippine Star) - January 30, 2020 - 12:00am  The Australia bushfires serve as a warning for countries to accelerate the phaseout of fossil fuels and scale up climate action, according to local environment advocates. \"We have a moral responsibility to our common dreams for our families for a safe and secured life at present and the future."]}, {"relevance_score": 37, "title": "Fiesta Se\u00f1or 2023", "published": "2023-01-07", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> 'Pundok na ta'g balik, it's 2023 na' - I sent this message in an online chat with a group of friends. It's actually an inside joke among the five of us since 2020.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three years ago this month, we were sitting in a bar along Banilad in Cebu City having drinks and talking about the world and our lives. At night's end, I blurted something we had no clue was prophetic. I said, 'See you three years from now, in 2023.'</p><p>I swear it had nothing to do with the looming pandemic that was going to explode two months later in March. I said 'three years from now' as a joke about how friends keep making plans to meet but then cancel them because life happens, people are busy.</p><p>I should have known better not make that joke, considering that the start of the year 2020 was already greeted at that time by a series of tragic events --the Taal Volcano eruption, Australian bushfires, the Iran-US conflict following a missile strike that killed an Iranian general, and a Ukrainian plane crash with 176 souls on board after it was accidentally struck by a missile over Iranian airspace. Then the pandemic happened and 2020 became a nightmare, such that two weeks into the lockdown I pinched myself one morning to see if it was all a dream and no, it wasn't.</p><p>Now finally it's 2023. 'Pundok na ta'g balik!' The return to face-to-face learning last semester was a successful experiment as it did not lead to a surge in serious infections, and healthcare utilization rate continues to be stable. With cautious optimism, the world has indeed moved on, except for China which is still battling its own pandemic nightmare after three years of zero-COVID policy.</p><p>In the country, Cebu leads the way in 2023 with the full celebration of Fiesta Se\u00f1or. The other day, the penitential Walk with Jesus at dawn resumed after a two-year hiatus. Reports say it drew a crowd of at least 300,000 Catholic devotees. I was touched by the bittersweet story in The FREEMAN yesterday which mentioned a man whose sick wife was no longer around to witness the return of the religious celebration.</p><p>The in-person Novena Masses are also back in full swing. Yesterday noon I was stuck in downtown traffic coming back from my court appointment in the south. It was due to the rerouting in areas surrounding the Sto. Ni\u00f1o church. Still, it was a pleasant disruption considering that the traffic was connected to the Fiesta Se\u00f1or season.</p><p>People are also looking forward to the 'Visperas' day on January 14, Saturday --the midnight 'traslacion' from Mandaue to Lapu-Lapu City with a send-off Mass at the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Virgen de la Regla Parish at dawn, followed by a procession and then the Fluvial Parade at the Mactan Channel. The solemn foot procession of the Sto. Ni\u00f1o will start at 1 p.m. later that day.</p><p>The most anticipated event is still the Sinulog grand parade happening on Sunday, January 15. If all goes to plan, it will be held for the first time at the South Road Properties. The stage and pathways are being built, and I'm sure the city government is doing what it can to make the return to 'pre-pandemic' Sinulog successful and safe for all.</p><p>This won't be the first time, however, that the Sinulog will be held in an open space in a reclamation area. I recall that sometime in the early or mid-1980s the Sinulog parade culminated near the old (now demolished) White Gold department store along the area where Robinsons Galleria now stands. It was a memorable scene for me as child wherein my father carried me high on his shoulders so I could see the street dancing. But it was also a chaotic, free-for-all Sinulog with many people smearing revelers' faces with black 'asiete' as sort of an accepted part of the tradition.</p><p>This year, there are valid concerns about the venue at the SRP possibly made unsuitable for the expected large crowd of spectators in the event of rainy weather. Other people are also worried about a possibly searing hot day in a largely open area with not much shade from trees or structures available.</p><p>Nevertheless, following the tradition of not spoiling the fiesta atmosphere, there's that spirit of cooperation and assistance in making Cebu's Fiesta Se\u00f1or a fitting return to normalcy after two to three years of subdued celebrations.</p>", "publisher": "The Freeman", "instances": ["I swear it had nothing to do with the looming pandemic that was going to explode two months later in March.

Every prediction the guy made, including the demise of the Philippines and sub-$40 crude oil, was as accurate as if Nostradamus did it. Jesse disappeared for a while and then we find him back on SocMed with \"2021 was a very dark year for me and I logged off social media in utter disgust.

Then-CCP Museum Director Roberto Chabet curated an exhibit called Thirteen Artists in 1970 which eventually transformed into an award.

But I need to forewarn you, guys, about the many fearful things to come. The global warming has started to make itself felt and feared worldwide. Nature is getting back at man's insatiable greed and recklessness. The whole world should discern the indubitable signs that many disasters are coming to hit us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, and bushfires, locusts and pests, pestilence and pandemics are the series of revenge from an overly abused, devastated and ravaged natural environment. Humanity is being forewarned.</p><p>Let us review the ten worst natural disasters in 2020 and reflect on our own mindless ravaging of Mother Earth. First, the global COVID-19 pandemic; second, Australia bushfires; third, the flash floods in Indonesia; fourth, the Philippines' volcano eruption; fifth, the earthquakes in China, Iran, Russia, Turkey, the Caribbean and the Philippines; sixth, the swarms of locusts in Asia, East Africa, India and the Middle East; seventh, the cyclone Amphan in Bangladesh and India; eighth, the forest fires in west California and in Uttarakhand, India; ninth, the Assam floods in India; and tenth, the Green Snow in Antarctica.</p><p>The Covid crisis is deemed a natural disaster because it is driven by a living virus brought about by something wrong in our natural habitat. As of this writing, 72.2 million people worldwide have been infected, with 1.7 million deaths and 47.1 million having recovered. The USA leads with 16.4 million infected and more than 300 thousand deaths. India follows with 9.9 million infections and 144 thousand deaths. Brazil has 7 million infected and 182 thousand dead. France has 2.4 million infections and 47 thousand deceased. The UK and Italy both have 1.9 infected and 65 thousand dead, followed by Turkey with 1.9 million infected also but with just 17 thousand deaths. The Philippines is number 28, and has only 450 thousand infections and less than 9,000 deaths.</p><p>The Australian bushfires, called the black Summer was deemed one of the biggest conflagrations in all history with more than 47 million acres of forestlands destroyed, with millions of flora and fauna dead, over 9,000 buildings and homes destroyed, and more than 400 dead caused directly and indirectly by it. It started in October 2019 and was still burning towards the end of January 2020. In the Indonesia floods on the first of January, 4 million people were displaced and about 100 died and many more missing and unaccounted. Rivers and canals overflowed destroying entire towns and communities and inundating urban and rural centers alike. The Taal Volcano eruption in January caused more than 2,000 volcano induced tectonic earthquakes, out of which 176 were felt. It dislocated more than 8,000 people and destroyed homes, crops and killed farm animals.</p><p>While the global pandemic continued to bring sufferings to the people worldwide, no less than 45 major earthquakes hit at varying times respectively in China, India, Iran, Turkey, the Carribean and the Philippines. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed, thousands of people died, billions worth of crops and properties were destroyed. People suffered a lot and epidemic follows after natural disasters with the destruction of water supply and electical connections. Then, many swarms of locusts descended in the farms and forests and plantations in East Asia, Africa, India and the Middle East eating in matter of few minutes foods enough to feed 35,000 people. Cyclone Amphan hit India and Bangladesh, killing more than 30 people and destroying homes, causing landfalls and dams to burst, inundating rice fields and devastating communities and settlements. It was a category 5 hurricane that terrified millions in the poverty-stricken localities. There was also a forest fire in Uttarackhand, India which caused hundreds of kilometers of forests and caused multiple deaths and destructions.</p><p>Finally, snow algae grew in Antarctica changing the color of the entire mountains causing freezing temperature. This rare phenomenon is still being studied, whether good or bad. But since it started, the temperature has attained unprecedented of below zero freezing points that caused destruction of faunas, including penguins, seals and other marine animals. It also killed some floras and seaweeds, and disturbed the balance of the marine life.

We cannot stop working and just stay at home fearing we might catch nCoV during our commute or at work. Some precautionary measures are called for, as standard precautions any time. These include frequent hand-washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based sanitizer, avoiding people who show symptoms, staying at home if we have mild symptoms, but seeking consultation if there are more alarming symptoms, like shortness of breath, difficulty in breathing, sensorial changes and persistently high temperature.</p><p>The public should be made more aware of the proper way to cough or sneeze. Many instinctively cover their nose and mouth with the palm of their hands, but then they later shake the hands of others, which spreads the virus faster. It's better to cover one's nose and mouth with the flexed arm, either left or right, pulled over the face.</p><p>The front side of the elbow should be the one used to cover one's nose and mouth, even if one is not wearing long sleeves.</p><p>Wearing face masks in public places is also good practice. But one must remember that if we use disposable face masks, they must be replaced daily, as they could harbor germs. It's like having a Petri dish on your face.</p><p>It's also best to avoid unnecessary travels at this time, especially to China, where it all started. But if one really needs to travel elsewhere, the risk is still fairly minimal. Your reliable face mask may make a good fashion accessory, though, and one should keep it on for the duration of the flight, in case you're seated next to someone who does not have symptoms yet but is already in the incubation stage of nCoV infection, which may be anywhere from two to 14 days after being exposed to the virus. Again, though, rein in your fears; this is probably a one-in-a-million chance at this point.</p><p>No definitive treatmentShould you immediately seek hospitalization if you have flu-like symptoms? Definitely not! You should be admitted only if you have more severe symptoms, including shortness of breath or difficulty of breathing, like you have an asthma attack. There's no definitive treatment for the virus, just supportive, including hydration, nutrition and assisting breathing with mechanical respirators. Even granting one tests positive for nCoV, it's not the end of the world for the patient. If we base it on the stats reports from China, and we presume they're accurate, only around one to two in a hundred infected patients really worsen and die. The far bigger majority, around 98 percent, survive and get well.</p><p>Some also ask if the regular flu vaccine can also cover for nCoV infection. I'm afraid not. This is an entirely new and different bug, which seems to keep on mutating. The National Institutes of Health in the US are working on one, and hopefully it could be made available soon.</p><p>That may take some time, though, since they have to do preliminary tests to make sure the vaccine is safe, and won't do more harm than good. I don't think we've recovered from the dengue vaccine panic. Dengvaxia is an effective and safe vaccine, but could be harmful if given to the wrong people. But that's another story.</p><p>So, regarding the nCoV, take usual precautions to prevent it, but don't let it stop you from getting on with your normal life. INQ</p>", "publisher": "Philippines Daily Inquirer", "instances": ["And with this super-activated alarm system, the recent scare about the 2019 novel coronavirus (nCoV) spreading to our country revs it up further and has put many in panic mode.

They didn't go into specifics, just that it's all but confirmed, and that I would be thanking them later.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Apparently, starting today, Saturday, Metro Manila will be on a lockdown and malls, supermarkets and other establishments will be closed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Both the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) and Department of Health (DOH), however, immediately released advisories denouncing it as 'fake news.'</p><p>For all our sakes, I do hope it is fake news.</p><p>Still, I don't think it's a bad idea to stock up on food that's good for at least a few weeks, which we did. Just to be clear, we weren't panic buying, we just want to avoid going to the malls or supermarkets.</p><p>As for those people hoarding tissue paper, hand sanitizers and alcohol, you are either stupid (with your priorities) or opportunists who want to take advantage of the situation, just like those who sold face masks at ridiculous prices when Taal erupted.</p><p>NOTHING SPREADS LIKE FEAR</p><p>WHEN I was a kid, the only diseases that scared us every summer were either mumps (they said it can make you sterile), chicken pox (because of the scars and scabs), sore eyes, and prickly heat (because we'll get coated with cornstarch)-all of which are barely and rarely fatal. Still, we were afraid because getting sick would rob us a few weeks off our school break.</p><p>But with the coronavirus outbreak, it looks like it's going to be a long school break. Classes have already been suspended, and there are schools that have canceled their graduation/moving-up ceremonies. The frightening part is not knowing how and when it will end.</p><p>The 2020s already started off pretty rough. You can even say the past few months have been horrible. From that Ukranian plane being shot down, the Australian bushfires, Jakarta floodings, Thailand mall shooting, to the eruption of Taal Volcano and many other tragic events. But it's the coronavirus that has turned our life in into a nervous waiting game for updates.</p><p>Which events and concerts will be canceled next? How many new cases are there? Is the number increasing? Why aren't there enough test kits? What can we do to keep ourselves and our families safe? Did anyone understand what our dear president was trying to say about those kits and\u2026 witches?</p><p>It's not that we are lacking news and updates, because we already have an overwhelming mishmash of information. My social-media feed has been overrun by advisories and so many 'expert' tips. It's trying to filter the real ones from the fakes that are making people even more scared.</p><p>Heck, even James Bond (No Time to Die) already went into quarantine.</p><p>Anxiety is rising and paranoia has driven me to watch Contagion again last week. Turns out I wasn't alone, and there are a lot people who have turned to Steven Soderbergh's 2011 medical thriller about an eerily similar virus that rapidly spreads around the world, just to see how bad things could get. Let me just warn you that it's not the most reassuring movie to watch at this time.</p><p>It's been nine years since it was first released, yet the movie has proven to be so eerily prescient with its similarity to the ongoing coronavirus. If it wasn't for the star-studded Hollywood cast, you might even think you're watching a special news report.</p><p>Contagion is an explanatory drama and follows the frantic quest of various health organizations, crisis managers, scientists and bureaucrats who are looking for answers, tracking the virus's origins, devising containment strategies, and working to develop a vaccine.</p><p>The filmmakers worked with the World Health Organization and medical experts to create a film that depicts a frighteningly believable pandemic based on viruses like SARS and the swine flu.</p><p>In one scene, Laurence Fishburne, who plays Dr. Ellis Cheever, said; 'Our best defense has been social distancing, no handshaking, staying home when you're sick, washing your hands frequently.'</p><p>Isn't that what every newscaster on TV is telling us right now?</p><p>In real life, COVID-19 was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, resulting in more than 113,000 confirmed cases and more than 4,000 deaths. In the film, the MEV-1 virus is unleashed in Minneapolis by Gwyneth Paltrow's character who has just returned from a business trip to Hong Kong. Within a month, the death toll in US is at 2.5 million. The worldwide total reaches 26 million.</p><p>The coronavirus puts the elderly and those with underlying medical conditions at the most risk while in the movie the virus hits all ages. The effects of the MEV-1 virus in the movie are also a lot more dramatic and terrifying. People get sick with alarming rapidity and those infected get worse in just a few days before collapsing, suffering seizures, foam coming out of their mouths, before eventually ending in a gruesome death. I told you it isn't reassuring.</p><p>In fact, Contagion will scare you into washing your hands with soap and water immediately and frequently, and make you avoid close contact with people or anything that hasn't been washed or disinfected.</p><p>Yet, the thing that struck me most about the movie was how it showed the ripple effects of the outbreak, things we have been seeing the past few days. These include the lockdown of several cities in the world, inadequate or late government response, and supply shortages caused by panic buying. Then there's Jude Law's character, a popular online personality, peddling 'forsythia', a fake cure, to make money, much like those web sites telling people to drink bleach or some other concoction.</p><p>Nothing spreads like fear, and that is proving to be true.</p><p>Is it the perfect time to panic?</p><p>No.</p><p>Panicking will just spread more fear.</p><p>Instead, now is the perfect time to prepare. The more facts you have, the better off you are. Seek information from legitimate sources and use social media responsibly.</p><p>Smart, Sun and TNT subscribers, for example, can access the Department of Health (DOH)'s tracking site for free at ncovtracker.doh.gov.ph through their mobile phones to help them get correct and up-to-date information on COVID-19.</p><p>The DOH tracker web site provides the latest information regarding the number and general location of Persons Under Investigation (PUI). Earlier, Smart had made the main DOH web site (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.doh.gov.ph\">www.doh.gov.ph</url>) accessible free of charge, along with the Phivolcs web site (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph\">www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph</url>).</p><p>Since the end of January, PLDT Inc.'s wireless subsidiary Smart has made access to DOH websites free. Following the government's declaration of a State of Public Health Emergency, the public's need to access accurate and reliable information about COVID-19 has become more urgent.</p><p>I know that even the DOH is using TikTok now, but there are a lot of other preventive measures to learn instead of just doing those dance challenges all day.</p><p>Like I said, adding a few more food items to your regular grocery list is preparation, but buying stuff like alcohol and toilet paper like it's going out of style is just ridiculous. Panic buying can get dangerous as some goods such as soap, medicines and alcohol become unavailable for those in immediate need.</p><p>As for those planning to make money out of the situation, know that there's a special place in hell waiting for you.</p><p>Lockdown or not, in these times of panic, please don't forget to be kind.</p><p>MR. JEFF CELEBRATES WOMEN'S MONTH</p><p>BECAUSE of everything that's been happening, we've almost forgotten that March is recognized as Women's Month. To commemorate the occasion, Spanish start-up Jeff app, serviced by Mr Jeff Laundry Hubs, shares a few tips to empower women, and help them achieve 'self-care' and self-fulfillment.</p><p>You may be mindful of the environment just by being conscious of your carbon footprint. That's good, but are you mindful about yourself? Jump-start your health by doing some exercise. Be mindful of your looks by treating yourself to a salon. By taking care of yourself, people are bound to take notice and will also be mindful of you.</p><p>When making decisions-from small to big ones-ask yourself: 'Do I need this or do I want this?' Focusing on the things you truly need will give your life direction. Avoid toxicity in your daily life. These may include activities, as well as other people.</p><p>A lot of stress comes from trying to so do many things at the same time. Delegating some tasks like your scheduled laundry can help you relax and save quality time for the things you'd rather be doing. Unplug, even for just a day.</p><p>Using the Jeff app for your home-delivery laundry and dry-cleaning needs, for instance, will ease your life. The Jeff app and web site-downloadable and accessible through any mobile phone or computer-allows you to select the exact location, time, and day of laundry pick up. A driver then picks up your laundry, then delivers them, cleaned and folded, ironed or dry cleaned, in just 48 hours. The laundry is washed in Mr Jeff Laundry Hubs located in several areas, such as Alabang, Las Pi\u00f1as, Ermita, Congressional Avenue, West Fairview, Tiendesitas and Santa Rosa. More hubs are opening in Metro Manila and Cebu in the coming months. Mr Jeff guarantees a 48-hour turnover.</p>", "publisher": "Business Mirror (Philippines)", "instances": ["The 2020s already started off pretty rough.
