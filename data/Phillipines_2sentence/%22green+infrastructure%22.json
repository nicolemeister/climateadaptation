It inevitably feels like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, with the business sector on the front lines of disaster-recalculating lost sales, ruined equipment and supplies, and weighing the risks to the city's role as the heart of the country's economy.</p><p>Every rainy season re-exposes a harsh truth: flood infrastructure failures are more than a public inconvenience; they are a direct threat to supply chains, office productivity, and investor sentiment. Even the most resilient entrepreneurs know the 'business as usual' mantra does not apply during times like these.</p><p>Many analysts and watchdog groups have flagged questionable government contracts tied to major flood projects. Reports of overpricing, vague procurement processes, and 'ghost' contractors have plagued river dredging operations, drainage network upgrades, and newly minted anti-flood schemes. It is no wonder that, despite years of funding and construction, project delays and patchy results remain the norm. Until accountability and transparency are restored, every million spent may float away with the next flood.</p><p>Floods in our cities are a business risk. International business groups-from manufacturers to BPO providers-are beginning to look at 'infrastructure reliability' alongside labor costs and tax incentives. </p><p>It is, indeed, time for a change in attitude. Flood-proofing is not just a government concern-it is a business imperative. Companies, business organizations, and sectoral associations must advocate for smarter flood control and higher standards of project delivery. The collective voice of business leaders is needed to push for efficient spending, robust maintenance schedules, and real-time monitoring of public projects.</p><p>Public-private partnership (PPP) opportunities are growing and should not be overlooked. Business has the expertise and motivation to be more than lobbyists-they can be active co-investors in new drainage systems, green infrastructure, and community education campaigns. Strategic action can go beyond charity and branding; it can help cement long-term economic stability.</p><p>Climate adaptation cannot be sidelined. Metro Manila's vulnerability to climate change is only intensifying. Short-term, patchwork fixes do little to address the magnitude of the challenge. What is needed are investments in rainwater parks, permeable pavements, river restoration, and smart data-driven planning-solutions that build resiliency and minimize future disruptions. Forward-thinking businesses know their future bottom lines depend on these proactive infrastructure choices.</p><p>Finally, this is a moment for urgent action-for the business community to demand results, for policymakers to listen, and for civil society to join in sustained advocacy. The cost of inaction can no longer be ignored. I hope that we can end the cycle of excuses and allow businesses to lead the call for infrastructure that works-not just for profits, but for the people who make Metro Manila thrive.</p>", "publisher": "Business Mirror (Philippines)", "instances": ["The collective voice of business leaders is needed to push for efficient spending, robust maintenance schedules, and real-time monitoring of public projects.

With typhoons intensifying, natural resources depleting, and inequality widening, newly elected lawmakers face a historic opportunity: to legislate sustainability not as an option, but as the backbone of national development. This is a golden opportunity for all to stand up and turn the spotlight away from themselves and on to all issues that matter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They should all realize that sustainability is not a buzzword, a slogan, and, worse, an empty promise. It is no longer just a conviction for environmentalists. It has become an economic, social, and moral imperative for all. The choices this Congress makes will determine if we continue to chase short-term growth or build a resilient, inclusive, and low-carbon future.</p><p>This space offers 10 legislative proposals that the new Philippine Congress should consider enacting immediately:</p><p>1. Philippine Sustainable Finance Act. This law would mandate all financial institutions to embed Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) principles into their lending, investment, and risk management strategies.</p><p>Key provisions:</p><p>\u2022 Climate risk disclosures;</p><p>\u2022 Incentives for green bonds and loans;</p><p>\u2022 Creation of a transition fund for carbon-heavy industries;</p><p>\u2022 Alignment with global green taxonomies.</p><p>This complements the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas\u2019 sustainable finance guidelines by giving them statutory backing.</p><p>2. National Waste Reduction and Reuse Act. Despite RA 9003, poor implementation has led to growing waste problems. A stronger law must reinforce extended producer responsibility (EPR) across all sectors.</p><p>What it should include:</p><p>\u2022 EPR compliance for all businesses, not just large corporations;</p><p>\u2022 Mandatory reusable or compostable packaging standards;</p><p>\u2022 Tax perks for circular businesses;</p><p>\u2022 A national \u201cMaterials Marketplace\u201d platform.</p><p>3. Just Energy Transition Framework Act. A clean energy shift cannot come at the cost of jobs. This act ensures fossil fuel-dependent communities are protected during the renewable energy transition.</p><p>Key elements:</p><p>\u2022 Coal worker retraining and relocation support;</p><p>\u2022 Just Transition Fund for vulnerable regions;</p><p>\u2022 Hiring quotas for local workers in renewable energy projects;</p><p>\u2022 Clear phaseout timelines for coal-fired plants.</p><p>4. Philippine Blue Economy Act. With one of the world\u2019s richest marine ecosystems, a national law should prioritize ocean protection and livelihood preservation.</p><p>Main proposals:</p><p>\u2022 Legal recognition of marine spatial planning;</p><p>\u2022 Incentives for sustainable fisheries and eco-tourism;</p><p>\u2022 Blue carbon credit trading for mangrove and reef conservation;</p><p>\u2022 Fisherfolk access to credit, training, and tech.</p><p>5. Revised Climate Change Act. The current Climate Change Commission needs decentralization and better implementation.</p><p>Legislative fixes:</p><p>\u2022 Institutionalization of Local Climate Change Action Plans (LCCAPs);</p><p>\u2022 Climate risk zoning for LGUs;</p><p>\u2022 Climate innovation grants for local governments;</p><p>\u2022 Climate education in civil service and public schools.</p><p>6. National Green Jobs and Skills Development Act. To prepare for green economic sectors, this act will train Filipinos for jobs in renewable energy, organic agriculture, green construction, and environmental services.</p><p>Components:</p><p>\u2022 TESDA (the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority) and state university green skills programs;</p><p>\u2022 Industry incentives for offering apprenticeships;</p><p>\u2022 A National Green Workforce Development Council;</p><p>\u2022 Labor market forecasts for emerging green sectors.</p><p>7. Corporate ESG Disclosure Act. While some firms voluntarily report on ESG, many still do not. This law mandates ESG reporting for large corporations.</p><p>Details:</p><p>\u2022 Alignment with global standards (Global Reporting Initiative or GRI, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board or SASB, Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures or TCFD);</p><p>\u2022 Securities and Exchange Commission oversight and audit mechanisms;</p><p>\u2022 Capacity-building for small- and medium-sized enterprises;</p><p>\u2022 Penalties for greenwashing and non-disclosure.</p><p>8. Urban Sustainability and Green Infrastructure Act. Metro Manila and other cities need urgent greening. This law would mandate sustainable urban planning.</p><p>Policy priorities:</p><p>\u2022 Green building codes;</p><p>\u2022 Rainwater collection, bike lanes, and public parks;</p><p>\u2022 Urban heat island mitigation plans;</p><p>\u2022 Incentives for private sector green developments.</p><p>9. Green Fiscal Incentives Reform Act. Tax reform can support green growth and penalize polluters.</p><p>Proposal highlights:</p><p>\u2022 Carbon taxes and cap-and-trade schemes;</p><p>\u2022 Higher taxes on single-use plastics;</p><p>\u2022 Tax holidays for sustainable enterprises;</p><p>\u2022 \u201cPolluter Pays Fund\u201d for rehabilitation and recovery.</p><p>10. Legislative Sustainability and Futures Office Act. Modeled after Finland\u2019s Parliamentary Committee for the Future, this body will ensure long-term thinking in legislation.</p><p>Mandates:</p><p>\u2022 Assessing intergenerational impact of all proposed laws;</p><p>\u2022 Futures scenario planning;</p><p>\u2022 SDG integration into budgets;</p><p>\u2022 Annual sustainability review of government programs.</p><p>The time to legislate is now.</p><p>These aren\u2019t just ideas. They are national imperatives. The science is clear, the risks are real, and the window for meaningful action is rapidly closing.</p><p>What this Congress enacts today will define the future we bequeath to our children. And for a nation as climate-vulnerable as the Philippines, that future depends on what we legislate now.</p><p>Next: In Part 2, I will present some successful international models of sustainability legislation and how the Philippines can adapt them to our local context.</p><p>Dr. RON F.

This is not just a distant American tragedy; it is a preview of what is looming over our own archipelago. The Philippines, after all, lies in the bullseye of the Pacific typhoon belt. We expect an average of 20 typhoons to enter our area of responsibility each year, many bringing torrential rains, storm surges, and flash floods. And in 2025, with only two typhoons in, the signs are already ominous.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Texas, climate denial, underfunded forecasting systems, and broken emergency response links compounded the catastrophe. In the Philippines, we may be even more vulnerable, not because we lack knowledge, but because we fail to act on it.</p><p>We know that we are one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth. The World Risk Report 2023 ranks the Philippines as number one in overall disaster risk globally. We also know that our worst disasters-Typhoon 'Ondoy' in 2009, Supertyphoon 'Yolanda' in 2013, 'Ulysses' in 2020-were not only natural but political. Every failure to relocate informal settlers, every missing dam gate protocol, every delayed warning broadcast has turned rain into ruin.</p><p>The institutions are in place. The Philippines has a strong legal framework for disaster risk reduction. Republic Act No. 10121 mandates a shift from reactive to proactive disaster governance. The Climate Change Act of 2009 created the Climate Change Commission. Local government units (LGUs) are required to prepare Local Climate Change Action Plans. Pagasa, the national weather agency, has been partially modernized, equipped with Doppler radars and automated weather stations. But equipment is not enough when plans sit unimplemented, warnings go unheeded, and hazard maps gather dust.</p><p>Worse, we have dismantled some of the very tools that once gave us an edge. Project Noah, a world-class hazard mapping and early warning system developed after Ondoy, was defunded in 2017. Its team of scientists-recognized internationally-was disbanded just when climate-related disasters were growing fiercer and more frequent. Today, some of its functions survive under the University of the Philippines Resilience Institute, but it no longer has the budgetary muscle or national reach to keep Filipinos safe.</p><p>What's happening is a pattern of learned helplessness, masked as budget prioritization. Apathy has replaced urgency. Like the United States under Trump, we've turned off some of our satellites and laid off the scientists, not because the storms have stopped coming, but because we've stopped listening.</p><p>This negligence is not without cost. The People's Survival Fund, designed to help LGUs finance climate adaptation projects, remains underutilized-less than 6 percent disbursed, according to the Commission on Audit. The reasons? Red tape, a lack of local proposal-writing capacity, and the absence of political will.</p><p>Most local governments still rely on post-disaster response instead of investing in prevention. Many lack updated comprehensive land use plans or zoning regulations that align with flood hazard maps. Barangays in floodplains continue to host housing settlements. Urban drainage remains archaic. In some towns, a single rainstorm still means days of flooding, economic paralysis, and school closures.</p><p>The irony is that we do not suffer from a lack of knowledge. We have the maps, the rainfall models, the flood projections. We know where the danger zones are. What we lack is the courage to govern accordingly-to relocate communities, to impose building moratoriums, and to invest in green infrastructure and localized early warning systems.</p><p>We also lack accountability. Every typhoon season, we hold our breath, issue advisories, and pray that disaster won't strike. When it does, we send relief. We thank responders. Then we forget.</p><p>But if the Texas tragedy teaches us anything, it is this: disaster follows dysfunction. When systems are defunded, when forecasts are ignored, when response chains are broken, nature punishes the most vulnerable. In the Philippines, that means the poor, the coastal, the remote, the urban fringe-dwellers who have no escape when the floods come.</p><p>We need to refund, rebuild, and re-empower science. We need to revive and scale up Project Noah and integrate its tools directly into local planning and emergency operations centers. We need to train LGUs not just in writing plans but in implementing them. We need to enforce zoning, update hazard maps, and redesign public infrastructure for a climate-changed world.</p>", "publisher": "Philippines Daily Inquirer", "instances": ["We have the maps, the rainfall models, the flood projections.

We are living through a time that demands not only action but also reinvention. As sea levels rise, temperatures soar, and urban-rural divides widen, the call for initiatives that restore, empower, and regenerate both people and the planet has never been more urgent. Sustainability can no longer be a corporate buzzword; it must become a mandate framed within the goal of ?nding creative solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regeneration is not simply about minimizing harm; it is about the active and conscious restoration of ecosystems and communities. In our archipelagic nation, marked by both vulnerability and resilience, this approach takes on deep signi?cance. Few companies are stepping forward not only with plans but with tangible proof. Acciona, a Spanish infrastructure and sustainable solutions ?rm operating in the Philippines, offers an instructive example of how regenerative business can contribute to social progress in deeply local, measurable ways.</p><p>Take the case of 'Light at Home Palawan,' a project by the Acciona.org Foundation with support from Ayala Foundation and the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation. It provides electricity service through solar home systems to communities that have never had that service. At the beginning of 2025, over 2,600 homes in off-grid areas of Palawan had been electri?ed by clean, renewable energy, giving schoolchildren light to study after dark, midwives better tools to assist deliveries, and families the ability to run small businesses or preserve food. This is what regeneration looks like: when clean technology uplifts human dignity. The project also helped families save on energy costs, reducing monthly expenses by up to 35 percent, unlocking opportunities for economic growth: over P33.5 million per year may now be available in those homes, showing how green infrastructure can create long-term value for those left behind.</p><p>Acciona is also helping power the country's renewable future. Its investments in solar and wind energy align with the national government's targets of 35 percent renewable energy by 2030 and 50 percent by 2040. The 150-megawatt Daanbantayan solar plant in Cebu, part of the capitol's ?rst public-private solar partnership, marks a transformative moment. These projects mean fewer carbon emissions, cleaner air, and greater energy independence for a nation still reliant on fossil fuels.</p><p>Water, too, is part of the regenerative solution. In Pakil, Laguna, Acciona is building the East Bay 2 drinking water treatment plant, which will deliver clean water to over 2 million people. This complements earlier projects, such as the Putatan II and Laguna Lake water treatment plants. Access to safe drinking water is foundational to health, productivity, and human development.</p><p>Gender equity is another essential element of social progress. In the male-dominated construction sector, Acciona is breaking new ground. Initiatives, such as the International Women Acceleration Track and Global Mentoring Program, fast-track high-potential women into decision-making roles. Locally, the Malolos-Clark Railway Project (package 2) hit a milestone: one of the ?rst concrete segments was produced entirely by an all-female crew-proof that equity is a prerequisite for regeneration.</p><p>What distinguishes regenerative efforts from traditional corporate social responsibility is that they are not about giving back but building forward. They frame communities not as bene?ciaries, but as cocreators of solutions. Infrastructure is not just about concrete and steel; it is also about trust, opportunity, and the scaffolding for better futures. The regenerative path is long, but it is the only one that acknowledges both the damage of the past and the promise of a new development model.</p><p>In a country that faces around 20 typhoons a year, where one ?ood can undo a decade of progress, resilience must be designed into everything we build. And in a region where inequality rises despite GDP growth, social impact must be embedded in every business case. Regeneration is not a utopian vision, but a practical framework for inclusive progress in the 21st century.</p><p>After all, social progress is not just about where we want to go. It is about how we get there, and who gets to come along.</p><p>Samantha Betia-Pagdanganan is a marketing, communications, and sustainability professional, currently leading Acciona's marketing and communications for Southeast Asia, with the Philippines as the company's regional hub for infrastructure, water, and renewable energy solutions in Asia.</p>", "publisher": "Philippines Daily Inquirer", "instances": ["This is what regeneration looks like: when clean technology uplifts human dignity.

Yet, beneath this storm of uncertainties, there's a vital message gaining momentum from global leaders and climate experts: the new wave of Nationally Determined Contributions is not merely about reducing emissions but fundamentally about fostering economic growth and curbing instability. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As Simon Stiell, the United Nations climate change executive secretary, beautifully articulates during the 2025 Nature Summit held recently in Panama City, Panama, these plans are \"really about growth\" and serve as \"an antidote to economic uncertainty.\" </p><p>Historically, climate policies were often framed as burdens or costly mandates that slowed economic activity. While emissions reductions remain a critical goal, today's innovative climate strategies are shifting the narrative. Governments worldwide now see their climate commitments as opportunities, catalysts for industrial innovation, job creation and sustainable development. Countries like Germany and China are investing billions in renewable energy (RE), green infrastructure and climate resilience measures recognizing that the clean energy transition is an extraordinary business opportunity. In fact, over 90 percent of new energy last year was renewable, illustrating the market's pivot toward sustainable solutions. </p><p>This transition signifies a fundamental change: climate policies are now viewed as engines of economic growth. By integrating clean technologies, energy efficiency and sustainable industries into national development plans, nations can stimulate employment, attract investments and unlock new markets. They are turning environmental responsibility into a driver of prosperity. </p><p>Global supply chains are fragile, already strained by geopolitical tensions, pandemic disruptions and extreme weather events. The Panama Canal, a crucial hub for international trade, exemplifies how climate change directly affects commerce. Lower water levels due to droughts threaten shipping routes, increase transportation costs, delay deliveries and reduce access to vital goods such as food, medicine and energy supplies. </p><p>Market confidence </p><p>Stiell emphasizes that strong, clear climate policies act as \"antidotes\" to this economic volatility. By committing to transformative change, countries establish predictable frameworks that reassure markets and investors. These policies provide the signals needed for private-sector confidence, encouraging multibillion-dollar investments in RE, smart infrastructure and climate adaptation. Such investments create a virtuous cycle: more jobs, increased revenues and a more resilient economy less vulnerable to external shocks. </p><p>One of the most compelling elements is the visible leadership from major economies. Brazil is now positioning nature at the heart of its climate plans, emphasizing conservation as both an ecological and economic necessity. Germany has committed billions to green initiatives that bolster energy security. China, for the first time, has announced comprehensive targets covering all greenhouse gases across every sector, signaling that decarbonization is the path to future economic strength. These actions demonstrate an undeniable truth: the transition to a low-carbon economy is the largest economic transformation of our age, presenting vast opportunities for innovation, competitiveness and sustainable growth. </p><p>While competition fuels innovation, Stiell warns against zero-sum thinking. The race for clean energy markets valued at $2 trillion is a collective challenge that requires shared effort. A \"two-speed\" transition, where some nations advance quickly while others lag behind, could fragment global supply chains, weakening the entire system. To avoid this, international cooperation is critical. The recent breakthroughs at global forums like COP26 and COP27 showcase that world leaders remain committed to collaboration on climate. This cooperation ensures that advancements, technology transfer and investments are shared equitably, enabling countries at different development levels to benefit. </p><p>Today's climate week in Panama symbolizes this collective pursuit, transforming words into action. It's not just about signing commitments but about implementing them on the ground. Stakeholders from governments, businesses, academia and civil society are working together to scale innovative solutions, reduce costs and ensure that no one is left behind. </p><p>The shipping industry's passage through the Panama Canal underscores a broader fact: the building blocks of a global, clean energy economy are already in motion. The numbers are growing, and their impact - creating jobs, strengthening economies and protecting our planet - is becoming undeniable. This momentum must be sustained. As Stiell underscores, the global decarbonization effort is unstoppable; the key is to leverage this energy to drive economic stability and inclusive growth. </p><p>The message from global leaders, including Stiell, is clear: ambitious climate plans are no longer just environmental imperatives but are economic imperatives. They promise a future of growth, innovation and resilience. Countries that embrace this shift will safeguard their citizens from climate shocks and unlock vast economic opportunities: more jobs, more revenue and a more stable world order. </p><p>The author is the founder and chief strategic advisor of the Young Environmental Forum and a director of Climate Tracker Asia Inc.

If not properly managed, riverine disasters may derail our towns' and cities' progress with severe long-term consequences.</p><p>The government's approach to the challenges of riverine disasters, however, continues to emphasize conventional flood control structures such as dikes, dams, and engineered channels that modify river channels and cut them off from their floodplain. These structures tend to be rigid, not easily adapted to increased flooding events and have adverse environmental consequences. Such actions limit the natural hydrologic benefits of floodplains such as storing floodwaters, improving water quality, providing habitat for wildlife, and supporting a multitude of cultural activities. In other words, the government's conventional flood control approach not only alters the natural character of rivers and floodplains, but it also does not take advantage of the contribution that these resources make to reduce flood risks, restore floodplain ecosystems, and ensure food security.</p><p>An alternative approach is natural river management (NRM) which is a way to harness the functions of natural river systems to nurture climate resilience at a lower cost while also achieving environmental and social benefits. NRM reflects the increasing realization that the hard (gray) infrastructure of conventional flood control systems alone is no longer sufficient to build climate resilience. Nonetheless, gray infrastructure will continue to be critical to mitigating flood risk, especially in dense urban areas with limited space, but it is no longer expected to provide the integrated and higher levels of flood protection needed in the future with more severe weather events.</p><p>NRM recognizes the value of nature-based solutions (NBS), particularly green infrastructure, which is increasingly being adopted worldwide as an effective strategy to build resilience to natural disasters. As an ecosystem-based adaptation approach, green infrastructure protects people against floods, water scarcity, landslides, and impacts from extreme weather events, while addressing climate change and biodiversity threats.

The more severe and frequent weather events due to climate change have revealed the limitations and inability of existing gray infrastructure alone to manage floods effectively. The integrated approach that combines NBS with gray infrastructure has increasingly proven to be an effective contributor to flood risk management. In river systems, the integrated approach that respects river dynamics and ecosystem functions provides effective flood management interventions, namely flood conveyance, water retention, and detention, river bank erosion control, and flood impact reduction.</p><p>Every river basin is different, which means that for the reduction of flood and erosion risk in river basins, there is no one-size-fits-all example available.

the country's environment and transportation sectors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mario Valbuena Jr., David D'Angelo and Modesto Floranda focused on the two issues as they went head-to-head in Episode 6 of Bakit Ikaw: The TownHall Election Series.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Valbuena, president of the transport group Manibela, saw the need for better disaster monitoring and mitigation technology as he called for more funding for Project Nationwide Operational Assessment of Hazards (NOAH).</p><p>He cited the lack of resources in local government units (LGUs) leads to insufficient information and heightens disaster risks. </p><p>Valbuena pushed for investments in technology that could better predict typhoon strength, water volume, and wind speeds to improve preparedness and minimize casualties.</p><p>D'Angelo, the national president of the Green Party of the Philippines, pushed for a Climate Emergency Act to institutionalize a proactive approach to climate change. </p><p>He also advocated for restoring Project NOAH's funding and strengthening disaster response centers across all local levels.</p><p> D'Angelo stressed the need for sustainable stormwater management, opposing environmentally destructive projects like the Kaliwa Dam while promoting alternative solutions used in Japan.</p><p>Floranda, representing the Makabayang Koalisyon ng Mamamayan, took a firm stand against rampant mining and deforestation, blaming them for the worsening floods and landslides. </p><p>He called for tougher environmental regulations and a halt to large-scale mining that exploits natural resources at the expense of disaster-vulnerable communities.</p><p>While all three highlighted the struggles of farmers and fisherfolk, they proposed varied solutions.</p><p>Valbuena called for more government subsidies and financial aid to lift the agricultural sector. </p><p>He criticized delays in budget allocations and called for free medical services and mechanized farming support to enhance productivity.</p><p>D'Angelo advocated for food sovereignty, calling on the government to establish a state-funded agricultural workforce that could address the aging farmer population.</p><p>He opposed commercial fishing encroachment on municipal waters and criticized the Supreme Court's recent ruling that limited the rights of small fisherfolk.</p><p>Floranda said he was for genuine agrarian reform and that unequal land distribution and foreign control over agriculture perpetuate economic hardship.</p><p>He proposed state intervention to ensure fair farmgate prices and increase government purchases of local produce.</p><p>While Valbuena focused on improving transparency in flood control projects and reallocating funds toward effective public service programs, D'Angelo called for a shift from the Build, Build, Build program to Green Infrastructure.</p><p>D'Angelo proposed sustainable water management solutions, including reservoir-based energy conversion.</p><p>Floranda warned against infrastructure projects that displace Indigenous communities, stressing the need for transparent governance to prevent corruption in disaster mitigation efforts.</p><p>Valbuena promoted strict enforcement of waste management laws at the village level and educational campaigns for proper disposal practices.</p><p>D'Angelo took a grassroots approach, highlighting Project 3M, an initiative to upcycle plastic waste into eco-bricks, school chairs and police batons.</p><p>Floranda challenged the narrative that blames poor communities for waste problems, calling on both the government and corporations to take accountability for environmental degradation.</p><p>The debate intensified when the topic turned to public transportation.</p><p>Valbuena, the leader of Manibela, strongly opposed the phaseout of traditional jeepneys under the Public Utility Vehicle (PUV) Modernization Program, arguing that it bankrupts small operators. </p><p>Instead, he proposed a PUV Local Industrialization Act to manufacture modernized jeepneys locally, generating jobs and preserving this cultural icon.</p><p>D'Angelo supported modernization but condemned its flawed execution, calling for a just transition that does not unfairly burden small operators.</p><p>He also proposed congestion charges for private vehicles on major roads like EDSA, and expanding exclusive public transport lanes to encourage a commuter-first approach.</p><p>Floranda aligned with Valbuena in opposing the modernization program's impact on small operators but went further by advocating for a nationalized transportation industry.</p><p>He called for increased public transport units, expanded ferry systems, and safer biking infrastructure.</p><p>Valbuena called for the repeal of the Oil Deregulation Law, arguing that excessive taxation inflates fuel prices.</p><p>He demanded the suspension of excise taxes when global oil prices surpass a certain threshold and proposed fuel subsidies for public transport operators.</p><p>D'Angelo, a signatory to the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, championed a transition to renewable energy and pushed for tax reductions on residential consumers while increasing taxes on large industries profiting from fossil fuels.</p><p>Floranda took a more radical stance, advocating for the nationalization of vital energy assets such as Petron and Malampaya to stabilize fuel prices and lessen reliance on foreign oil markets.</p><p>All three candidates agreed on key themes like
