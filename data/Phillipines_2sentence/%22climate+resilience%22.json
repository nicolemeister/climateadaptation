Yet integrating climate resilience remains a peripheral concern in many local development plans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The challenge for newly elected officials is to bring transformative change through low hanging fruits such as renewable energy (RE). Indigenous renewable energy sources can provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy that Filipinos have long deserved. Its declining costs dismantle the outdated argument that RE is too expensive. Solar photovoltaic technology costs have dropped by 82 percent, from $378 to $68 per megawatt-hour. Adding just 3 percent more RE into the grid led to a 28 percent reduction in electricity rates, demonstrating that renewables are both sustainable and economically smart, and warrant being part of local energy strategies.</p><p>RE projects also generate financial benefits for host communities through the Renewable Energy Act of 2008 and Energy Regulation No. 1-94. These mechanisms allocate funds for electrification, livelihood, health, and environment enhancement-creating tangible local development outcomes and enhancing local communities' well-being and resilience. Coal power plants, which dominate the country's energy mix, have proven to be unreliable due to frequent unplanned outages that disrupt power supply.</p><p>The alternative is to shift from a power system centralized on large baseload coal power plants, towards a flexible and distributed power grid anchored on renewables. Having distributed energy resources allows for localized power generation during grid outages. By reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels and increasing the share of renewables in their energy mix, LGUs can foster local policies that accelerate RE deployment, stabilize energy supply, and shield the country from global price volatility or geopolitical tensions.</p><p>A common misconception that hinders renewable energy adoption is the belief that it requires large upfront investments, leading to implementation delays. In reality, small-scale RE installations are possible. In fact, renewable energy bridges energy access gaps in rural and underserved areas, empowering marginalized populations with reliable and affordable electricity while reducing reliance on diesel generators.</p><p>Solar energy presents an affordable option, providing immediate cost savings and improving public service delivery in communities. The towns of Guiuan, Eastern Samar and Paranas, Samar-which have recently powered their municipal buildings through solar-present an ideal example. They have demonstrated that with proper technical support and small-scale financing, renewable energy projects can be quickly implemented and scaled over time.</p><p>Renewable energy is not just about power, but about empowering people and communities. The Solar Scholars program of the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Cities-where community members are trained to operate portable solar-powered systems-shows that when LGUs invest in local knowledge and capacity, communities actively participate and contribute to their own resilience.</p><p>Beyond power generation, the energy transition serves as the backbone of decarbonizing entire local economies-and this extends to the transport sector. We cannot afford to treat transport as a separate issue in the push for climate resilience, as it is regarded as one of the sources of emissions and urban air pollution. Integrating renewable energy into the transport sector to power electric vehicles and the public transport fleet, coupled with interconnected, multimodal, and safe transport options will efficiently move more people and goods, and ultimately, promote more comprehensive and resilient systems.</p><p>However, achieving this vision requires a systems change approach within the transport sector, with all stakeholders included in the process, leveraging technology as tools.

For microfinance institutions (MFIs), the challenge is not just to provide financial services to the poor and marginalized but also to ensure that vulnerable communities have the tools to build resilience and thrive in an increasingly unpredictable world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last March 21, the Rafael B. Buenaventura Micro Finance Resource Center Foundation (RBBMFFI), in collaboration with the Bankers Association of the Philippines (BAP), hosted a forum titled \"The Importance of Adapting Climate-Resilient Products for Microfinance Institutions.\" Held at the BAP Conference Room in Makati City, the event gathered 33 participants from various MFIs and featured expert-led discussions on climate change, sustainable development, and the role of green financing in building resilient financial products and services.</p><p>I am pleased that RBBMFFI, under the leadership of Patty Calilong, spearheaded this initiative. It reflects our strong commitment to the vision set forth by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Eli Remolona, who challenged us in our meeting last year to integrate climate change adaptation into our microfinance operations.</p><p>Empowering communities</p><p>The RBBMFFI forum provided valuable insights into how MFIs can empower communities to adapt to the increasing threats of climate change.The keynote speaker, Mr. Ludwig O. Federigan, director of Climate Tracker Asia, Inc., kicked off the discussion with a session on climate change concepts, sustainable development, and the socioeconomic impact of climate-related changes on vulnerable communities.</p><p>One of the key issues discussed was the staggering financial impact of natural disasters on the Philippines. Over the past 15 years, typhoons such as Yolanda (2013), Odette (2021), and Pablo (2012) have resulted in approximately P358.70 billion in damages. These figures underscore the urgent need for proactive investments in disaster preparedness and climate adaptation. Experts also tackled the growing frequency of typhoons, heatwaves, and droughts, which continue to threaten agriculture, water resources, and local ecosystems. Strengthening early warning systems, implementing recovery programs, and promoting sustainable practices were identified as critical strategies in reducing climate-related risks.</p><p>Faced with these challenges, the forum proceeded with a series of sessions featuring ongoing initiatives from several MFIs aimed at helping individuals and small businesses prepare for and recover from climate-related disasters. Resource speakers from KASAGANA-KA Cooperative, Ahon sa Hirap, Inc., and CARD MRI highlighted the crucial role of grassroots organizations and MFIs in strengthening community resilience against natural disasters and climate-related risks.</p><p>The role of MFIs</p><p>At the grassroots level, MFIs serve as vital financial lifelines, offering climate-adaptive solutions to vulnerable communities. Specialized loan programs enable individuals to invest in climate-friendly technologies, such as solar panels, energy-efficient cooking stoves, and biogas systems. Additionally, MFIs extend financial support to farmers by promoting climate-resilient crops and offering insurance products that protect against agricultural losses due to extreme weather conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, MFIs work closely with insurance providers to offer crop insurance and financial guarantees, ensuring that grassroots farmers can recover quickly from climate-induced losses. Some institutions have also adopted digital innovations, such as fast-payment insurance systems, to streamline financial assistance during crises.</p><p>Beyond financial services, MFIs actively engage in environmental conservation efforts, including tree-planting initiatives, waste management programs, and advocacy campaigns promoting sustainable livelihoods. The adoption of digital banking solutions, like mobile banking and e-wallets, has further enhanced accessibility to financial services in rural and underserved areas.</p><p>The road to climate resilience</p><p>Collaboration among MFIs, government agencies, and private sector partners is crucial. Public-private partnerships can facilitate investments in climate-resilient infrastructure, provide funding for sustainable projects, and support knowledge-sharing initiatives that help communities implement adaptive strategies effectively.</p><p>The government's commitment to green financing programs, such as BSP's Sustainable Finance Framework, has created opportunities for MFIs to expand their climate-resilient product offerings. Through blended finance models-combining public funds, private investments, and development assistance - MFIs can scale up their efforts in helping communities transition to sustainable practices.</p><p>As climate change continues to impact lives and livelihoods, MFIs could be at the forefront of efforts to build more resilient and sustainable communities. By offering climate-responsive financing, insurance solutions, and capacity-building programs, these institutions play a key role in strengthening the ability of grassroots communities to withstand the challenges of a changing climate.</p><p>However, the road ahead requires continuous innovation, policy support, and stakeholder collaboration. Fostering climate resilience at the grassroots level is not just about mitigating risks - it is about empowering communities with the financial tools and knowledge they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving world. By working together, MFIs, policymakers, business and community leaders can create a future where financial inclusion and environmental sustainability go hand in hand.</p><p>* * *</p><p>\"The greatest threat to our planet is the belief that someone else will save it.\" - Robert Swan</p><p>(Dr. Jaime Aristotle B.

In linking energy affordability with climate adaptation, the SONA reflects a growing international consensus: that energy transitions are not just about carbon; they're about equity and survival.</p><p>Amid these bold promises, one uncomfortable truth remained unspoken: the Philippine electricity sector is structurally broken. Not a single word in the President's address acknowledged that reality.</p><p>Despite the noble goals, the current power system remains skewed against consumers and innovation. Distribution utilities still operate as legal monopolies in exclusive franchise areas. Generation is dominated by a handful of vertically integrated conglomerates. The national transmission grid is under the management of a private monopoly that has faced repeated criticism for delays in connecting renewable projects.</p><p>What this means is simple: no matter how generous the subsidy or widespread the solar rollout, the delivery and pricing of electricity will still be filtered through a highly concentrated, opaque system with limited accountability. This system doesn't just slow progress-it actively resists it.</p><p>Take Net Metering, for example. In theory, it empowers households to install solar panels and sell excess energy back to the grid. In practice, interconnection delays and regulatory bottlenecks-often at the level of local distribution utilities-make the process slow, costly, and discouraging for small consumers.</p><p>Consider the Lifeline Rate subsidy. While expanding it to non-4Ps low-income households is a socially responsible step, the subsidy itself applies to electricity still predominantly generated from coal and natural gas. Without conditions to encourage clean energy use-or reforms to the generation mix-the government may end up subsidizing the very emissions that worsen climate risks like flooding.</p><p>None of these structural issues were addressed in the SONA. There was no mention of accelerating Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) to give consumers real choice. No reference to unbundling or regulating vertically integrated players.</p><p>No commitment to reviewing the performance of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), whose delays in transmission projects have frustrated renewable developers for years. And no action on reforming Power Supply Agreements (PSAs), which are often secured through closed-door negotiations favoring affiliate generators.</p><p>This isn't a new critique. Business groups, consumer advocates, and even the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) have long identified these structural barriers as key reasons why Philippine electricity remains among the most expensive in Southeast Asia. High power rates not only burden households-they erode industrial competitiveness and discourage green investment.</p><p>The President's speech acknowledged the what and the why-the need for clean, affordable, and resilient energy. But it avoided the how, particularly when that how would mean confronting powerful interests and longstanding inefficiencies in the sector.</p><p>Energy policy cannot be distinct from climate policy. If the administration is serious about using energy reform as a tool for flood control and resilience, then it must go beyond subsidies and solar handouts. A full structural overhaul of the power sector is needed-starting with transparency, competition, and consumer empowerment.</p><p>The idea is that floods are not just natural events-they are symptoms of infrastructure and governance failure. And while distributed solar systems designed to control flooding can help power evacuation centers and flood-prone communities, their full potential will remain unrealized if the grid refuses to accept them, or if fossil fuels continue to dominate generation contracts.</p><p>To be clear, the SONA made important progress in framing energy within a broader agenda of social protection and climate resilience. It seems to signal that the government understands the multidimensional nature of today's energy challenges.</p><p>However, unless understanding is matched by structural reform, the Philippines risks building a green agenda on an outdated and dysfunctional foundation. You cannot fix a flood-prone country by going after corrupt contractors while subsidizing the emissions that cause the floods. And you cannot develop inclusive energy by giving out subsidies but simultaneously relying on a system designed to exclude competition and consumer choice.</p><p>If this administration wants to leave a legacy of climate leadership and energy justice, it must do more than light the way-it must rewire the system itself. The private sector should demand nothing less.</p>", "publisher": "Business Mirror (Philippines)", "instances": ["President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. The headline pledges-expanding the Lifeline Rate electricity subsidy to more low-income households, deploying over a million solar home systems by 2028, and accelerating the Net Metering Program-mark a clear shift toward inclusive energy access.
