The headline pledges-expanding the Lifeline Rate electricity subsidy to more low-income households, deploying over a million solar home systems by 2028, and accelerating the Net Metering Program-mark a clear shift toward inclusive energy access.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tying these initiatives to flood prevention and environmental goals was both politically timely and policy-relevant. After all, clean energy can reduce emissions that worsen typhoons and flooding. Distributed solar power strengthens resilience in areas often left in the dark after disasters. In linking energy affordability with climate adaptation, the SONA reflects a growing international consensus: that energy transitions are not just about carbon; they're about equity and survival.</p><p>Amid these bold promises, one uncomfortable truth remained unspoken: the Philippine electricity sector is structurally broken. Not a single word in the President's address acknowledged that reality.</p><p>Despite the noble goals, the current power system remains skewed against consumers and innovation. Distribution utilities still operate as legal monopolies in exclusive franchise areas. Generation is dominated by a handful of vertically integrated conglomerates. The national transmission grid is under the management of a private monopoly that has faced repeated criticism for delays in connecting renewable projects.</p><p>What this means is simple: no matter how generous the subsidy or widespread the solar rollout, the delivery and pricing of electricity will still be filtered through a highly concentrated, opaque system with limited accountability. This system doesn't just slow progress-it actively resists it.</p><p>Take Net Metering, for example. In theory, it empowers households to install solar panels and sell excess energy back to the grid. In practice, interconnection delays and regulatory bottlenecks-often at the level of local distribution utilities-make the process slow, costly, and discouraging for small consumers.</p><p>Consider the Lifeline Rate subsidy. While expanding it to non-4Ps low-income households is a socially responsible step, the subsidy itself applies to electricity still predominantly generated from coal and natural gas. Without conditions to encourage clean energy use-or reforms to the generation mix-the government may end up subsidizing the very emissions that worsen climate risks like flooding.</p><p>None of these structural issues were addressed in the SONA. There was no mention of accelerating Retail Competition and Open Access (RCOA) to give consumers real choice. No reference to unbundling or regulating vertically integrated players.</p><p>No commitment to reviewing the performance of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP), whose delays in transmission projects have frustrated renewable developers for years. And no action on reforming Power Supply Agreements (PSAs), which are often secured through closed-door negotiations favoring affiliate generators.</p><p>This isn't a new critique. Business groups, consumer advocates, and even the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) have long identified these structural barriers as key reasons why Philippine electricity remains among the most expensive in Southeast Asia. High power rates not only burden households-they erode industrial competitiveness and discourage green investment.</p><p>The President's speech acknowledged the what and the why-the need for clean, affordable, and resilient energy. But it avoided the how, particularly when that how would mean confronting powerful interests and longstanding inefficiencies in the sector.</p><p>Energy policy cannot be distinct from climate policy. If the administration is serious about using energy reform as a tool for flood control and resilience, then it must go beyond subsidies and solar handouts. A full structural overhaul of the power sector is needed-starting with transparency, competition, and consumer empowerment.</p><p>The idea is that floods are not just natural events-they are symptoms of infrastructure and governance failure. And while distributed solar systems designed to control flooding can help power evacuation centers and flood-prone communities, their full potential will remain unrealized if the grid refuses to accept them, or if fossil fuels continue to dominate generation contracts.</p><p>To be clear, the SONA made important progress in framing energy within a broader agenda of social protection and climate resilience. It seems to signal that the government understands the multidimensional nature of today's energy challenges.</p><p>However, unless understanding is matched by structural reform, the Philippines risks building a green agenda on an outdated and dysfunctional foundation. You cannot fix a flood-prone country by going after corrupt contractors while subsidizing the emissions that cause the floods. And you cannot develop inclusive energy by giving out subsidies but simultaneously relying on a system designed to exclude competition and consumer choice.</p><p>If this administration wants to leave a legacy of climate leadership and energy justice, it must do more than light the way-it must rewire the system itself.

While the law promotes a \"comprehensive, integrated, and proactive\" approach to disaster management, it does not clearly define how businesses can contribute beyond post-disaster recovery. </p><p>As a result, private sector participation is often limited to donations and relief, leaving prevention, preparedness and mitigation underutilized. </p><p>Amending the law to actively encourage private sector investment is crucial, not merely as a philanthropic act, but as a strategic approach to safeguarding business operations and supporting the communities they rely on.</p><p>Section 2 should be amended to explicitly prioritize public-private partnerships (PPPs) as a cornerstone of disaster risk reduction. This would emphasize their role in developing climate-resilient infrastructure, preparedness programs, and innovative risk financing mechanisms, strengthening the foundation for collaboration.</p><p>Similarly, Section 6 should mandate the creation of a National PPP Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. This would define roles, responsibilities, and risk-sharing mechanisms for private sector engagement while identifying priority areas such as water systems, flood control and early warning technologies. </p><p>Section 13 should be revised to expand the private sector's role beyond post-disaster relief. An accreditation system for businesses actively participating in disaster risk reduction (DRR) could incentivize companies to adopt disaster-prone communities, fund preparedness projects, or provide technical expertise for mitigation efforts.</p><p>At the local level, Section 21 offers an opportunity to strengthen PPPs. Allowing local government units (LGUs) to allocate resources for PPP projects would encourage collaboration on initiatives like climate-resilient infrastructure and capacity-building programs, enhancing disaster preparedness while maximizing resource use.</p><p>Risk financing is another critical area of reform. Innovative solutions, such as catastrophe bonds, parametric insurance and disaster resilience funds, could help distribute financial risks and ensure a faster recovery. </p><p>For example, businesses could invest in catastrophe bonds for immediate payouts after disasters or partner with the government to create affordable insurance products for vulnerable communities and small businesses.</p><p>Climate-resilient infrastructure</p><p>Another crucial reform is integrating climate change adaptation into the law. As disasters grow more frequent and severe, existing infrastructure often fails to withstand these evolving risks. </p><p>Section 6 should mandate climate-resilient designs for all DRR projects under public-private partnerships (PPPs) to ensure investments are future-proof. Encouraging private sector participation in innovative infrastructure, such as renewable energy-powered evacuation centers and sustainable water systems, would align the law with the demands of a changing climate.</p><p>The 2024 APMCDRR emphasized the importance of pre-disaster planning for faster and cost-effective recovery, aligning with the Philippine government's push for infrastructure resilience. </p><p>Strengthening the law is both a moral and strategic necessity.

This is not just a distant American tragedy; it is a preview of what is looming over our own archipelago. The Philippines, after all, lies in the bullseye of the Pacific typhoon belt. We expect an average of 20 typhoons to enter our area of responsibility each year, many bringing torrential rains, storm surges, and flash floods. And in 2025, with only two typhoons in, the signs are already ominous.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Texas, climate denial, underfunded forecasting systems, and broken emergency response links compounded the catastrophe. In the Philippines, we may be even more vulnerable, not because we lack knowledge, but because we fail to act on it.</p><p>We know that we are one of the most disaster-prone countries on Earth. The World Risk Report 2023 ranks the Philippines as number one in overall disaster risk globally. We also know that our worst disasters-Typhoon 'Ondoy' in 2009, Supertyphoon 'Yolanda' in 2013, 'Ulysses' in 2020-were not only natural but political. Every failure to relocate informal settlers, every missing dam gate protocol, every delayed warning broadcast has turned rain into ruin.</p><p>The institutions are in place. The Philippines has a strong legal framework for disaster risk reduction. Republic Act No. 10121 mandates a shift from reactive to proactive disaster governance. The Climate Change Act of 2009 created the Climate Change Commission. Local government units (LGUs) are required to prepare Local Climate Change Action Plans. Pagasa, the national weather agency, has been partially modernized, equipped with Doppler radars and automated weather stations. But equipment is not enough when plans sit unimplemented, warnings go unheeded, and hazard maps gather dust.</p><p>Worse, we have dismantled some of the very tools that once gave us an edge. Project Noah, a world-class hazard mapping and early warning system developed after Ondoy, was defunded in 2017. Its team of scientists-recognized internationally-was disbanded just when climate-related disasters were growing fiercer and more frequent. Today, some of its functions survive under the University of the Philippines Resilience Institute, but it no longer has the budgetary muscle or national reach to keep Filipinos safe.</p><p>What's happening is a pattern of learned helplessness, masked as budget prioritization. Apathy has replaced urgency. Like the United States under Trump, we've turned off some of our satellites and laid off the scientists, not because the storms have stopped coming, but because we've stopped listening.</p><p>This negligence is not without cost. The People's Survival Fund, designed to help LGUs finance climate adaptation projects, remains underutilized-less than 6 percent disbursed, according to the Commission on Audit. The reasons? Red tape, a lack of local proposal-writing capacity, and the absence of political will.</p><p>Most local governments still rely on post-disaster response instead of investing in prevention. Many lack updated comprehensive land use plans or zoning regulations that align with flood hazard maps. Barangays in floodplains continue to host housing settlements. Urban drainage remains archaic. In some towns, a single rainstorm still means days of flooding, economic paralysis, and school closures.</p><p>The irony is that we do not suffer from a lack of knowledge. We have the maps, the rainfall models, the flood projections. We know where the danger zones are. What we lack is the courage to govern accordingly-to relocate communities, to impose building moratoriums, and to invest in green infrastructure and localized early warning systems.</p><p>We also lack accountability. Every typhoon season, we hold our breath, issue advisories, and pray that disaster won't strike. When it does, we send relief. We thank responders. Then we forget.</p><p>But if the Texas tragedy teaches us anything, it is this: disaster follows dysfunction. When systems are defunded, when forecasts are ignored, when response chains are broken, nature punishes the most vulnerable. In the Philippines, that means the poor, the coastal, the remote, the urban fringe-dwellers who have no escape when the floods come.</p><p>We need to refund, rebuild, and re-empower science. We need to revive and scale up Project Noah and integrate its tools directly into local planning and emergency operations centers. We need to train LGUs not just in writing plans but in implementing them. We need to enforce zoning, update hazard maps, and redesign public infrastructure for a climate-changed world.</p>", "publisher": "Philippines Daily Inquirer", "instances": ["Like the United States under Trump, we've turned off some of our satellites and laid off the scientists, not because the storms have stopped coming, but because we've stopped listening.

Our geography, an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, makes us exceptionally susceptible to climate change's worst consequences. The past decade has witnessed an alarming rise in the frequency and intensity of typhoons with stronger winds and heavier rainfall, devastating coastal communities, destroying livelihoods and displacing millions.</p><p>Rising sea levels threaten to swallow entire towns, particularly low-lying island communities, leaving families at risk of losing their homes and ways of life.</p><p>The National Adaptation Plan indicates that the Philippines, ranking first globally in the World Risk Index from 2022-2024, faces a future where climate shocks could exacerbate poverty, threaten food and water security, and strain our economy. In 2024 alone, the country faced losses totaling P673.3 billion from typhoons and disasters - an immense economic burden that hampers our development and resilience efforts.</p><p>Yet, amid these challenges, the Philippines has demonstrated remarkable progress in the transition to renewable energy (RE). Our country's Renewable Energy Act of 2008 laid the groundwork for innovative policies like the Green Energy Auction Program and the Renewable Portfolio Standards, helping to lower costs and attract investments in solar, wind, hydro and bioenergy.</p><p>BloombergNEF's 2024 Climatescope Report ranks the Philippines as the second most attractive emerging market for clean power investments in the Asia-Pacific region. All this underscores our nation's unwavering commitment to decarbonization and sustainable growth. Based on the Department of Energy's data, offshore wind potential capacity is 69.3 gigawatts.</p><p>A game changer</p><p>By 2030, our goal is that 35 percent of our power generation will come from renewable sources. We aim to push this further to 50 percent by 2040. These targets are bold but crucial steps in aligning ourselves with the global climate agenda, ensuring our country's energy independence and safeguarding our environment for future generations.</p><p>Amid this landscape of ambition, offshore wind energy emerges as a game changer that the Philippines must harness to meet our climate and energy goals. Offshore wind farms generate power by capturing the kinetic energy of the wind over water: vast, largely untapped and sustainable resources along our extensive coastline. Unlike land-based wind projects, offshore wind farms do not compete for space with agriculture or urban development, making them an ideal solution for our dense coastal areas.</p><p>Science demonstrates the potential. The Philippines benefits from wind speeds exceeding 8 meters per second along many coastlines, especially in the northern and central regions such as Camarines Norte and Sur, where the San Miguel Offshore Wind Project is set to generate 1 gigawatt of clean energy with an investment of approximately P170 billion. This project, under the leadership of Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, will be the country's first fully offshore wind farm, paving the way for regional leadership in ocean-based RE.</p><p>Offshore wind projects hold immense socioeconomic potential. They can provide reliable power to remote islands, reducing dependence on imported, expensive and polluting fossil fuels. They can generate employment, stimulate local economies and promote energy equity across our archipelago.</p><p>Offshore wind acts as a climate-resilient infrastructure. Less vulnerable to floods, typhoons or saltwater intrusion, they ensure a dependable, clean energy supply that supports our broader disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation strategies. By integrating offshore wind into our national grid, the Philippines can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, advance our commitments under the Paris Agreement and bolster climate resilience in vulnerable communities.</p><p>The future of offshore wind projects in the Philippines hinges on strategic planning, supportive policies and international collaboration. Infrastructure investments, innovative financing schemes and robust ecological assessments are necessary to scale these projects rapidly and responsibly.</p><p>Regional collaboration, especially with neighboring countries with similar coastal profiles, can unlock shared opportunities.

With temperatures rising, the Philippines faces a future where millions of children will suffer unprecedented lifetime exposure to heatwaves, threatening their development, education, and well-being. (Read the BusinessMirror story, 'With relentless heat, can kids truly learn?,' May 18, 2025).</p><p>The data is striking and thought-provoking. If global warming reaches the worst-case scenario of 3.5 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, nearly 94 percent of Filipino children born today-roughly 1.4 million-will endure relentless heat stress throughout their lives. The immediate consequences are visible even now: young children are forced to stay indoors, deprived of outdoor play, while sweating, dizzy, and restless. These are not just childhood discomforts but warning signs of serious health risks like dehydration and heatstroke.</p><p>The impact extends beyond physical health. Learning under extreme heat is a formidable challenge. Schools without proper ventilation, cooling systems, or even running water become harsh environments where concentration falters and attendance drops. The educational setbacks could hobble an entire generation's potential, exacerbating existing inequalities, especially in low-income communities that are most vulnerable to climate change.</p><p>This crisis underscores the urgency of the Paris Agreement's goal to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

It aimed to curb hyperinflation and restore fiscal discipline through: A balanced national budget, Dissolution of state credit institutions,Fixed exchange rates (360 yen to 1 USD) ,Austerity and deflationary measures.</p><p>While it succeeded in stabilizing Japan's economy, it also triggered a severe recession known as the 'Dodge Squeeze', marked by mass layoffs and economic contraction.</p><p>Extension to the Philippines</p><p>Though less documented, the principles of the Dodge Plan were extended to the Philippines through U.S. economic advisors and institutions like the World Bank and IMF, which promoted a similar 'debt-for-development' paradigm.</p><p>This model discouraged state-led industrialization and instead emphasized:Export-oriented growth,Import liberalization,Reliance on foreign capital and loans ,Suppression of domestic manufacturing,</p><p>This policy orientation was formalized through structural adjustment programs and trade liberalization in the 1980s and 1990s, but its roots trace back to the post-war economic architecture imposed by the U.S..</p><p>Consequences for the Philippines</p><p>The long-term effects of this externally imposed model include:1)The collapse of domestic industries and the rise of import dependency,2)Chronic underinvestment in science, technology, and manufacturing,3)The mass export of Filipino labor, with over 10 million OFWs today,4) A population of 120 million, far exceeding the 'ideal' demographic capacity of 27 million as estimated by U.S. intelligence sources</p><p>5)Entrenchment of elite capture and corruption, beginning with the Marcos Sr. dictatorship and magnified under subsequent administrations</p><p>Reclaiming Regenerative Sovereignty</p><p>The way forward begins with acknowledging that these failures were engineered.

This requires structural reform: repealing EO 62 and revising RTL to restore rice tariffs and use revenues for agroecological renewal; scrapping PD 1177 to redirect debt payments to education and climate resilience; and institutionalizing participatory budgeting and citizen-led audits to fight corruption at its root.</p><p>More than fiscal tools, the country needs a shift in consciousness. It must revalue its citizens not as labor units but as stewards of regenerative development. Overpopulation must be addressed through equity, education, and restored rural livelihoods-not moral panic. Labor migration must be treated as displacement-not triumph-and countered by sovereign industry and innovation. And poverty must be reframed not as laziness or poor choices-but as the predictable result of decades of foreign and elite sabotage.</p><p>The Path Forward: Regenerative Food Sovereignty</p><p>To regenerative food sovereignty, the Philippines must 1) reinstate rice tariffs ( abolish RTL) and redirect revenues to climate-resilient farming,2) Expand crop insurance with weather-indexed payouts and farmer cooperatives, 3)Audit and reform infrastructure spending, linking it to ecological and logistical outcomes,4) Invest in agroecology, seed sovereignty,and decentralized food systems as the main thrusts of DAFW,5) Integrate climate adaptation into budgeting, education, and transport planning.</p><p>Redirecting ?25 billion from the alleged ?28-33 billion kickback-laden rice import budget toward local palay procurement could transform the nation's food system from the ground up. This investment would secure 1 million metric tons of local palay at ?25 per kilo, directly benefiting 1 million Filipino rice farmers-each earning approximately ?50,000 net income, a tenfold increase over the current ayuda given to smallholders cultivating less than two hectares. The ripple effect across rural economies could stimulate ?40-50 billion in circulation through labor, farm inputs, transport, milling, and trade. Crucially, this isn't just a fiscal reallocation-it's a moral restoration. By positioning farmers as central contributors to national food security rather than passive recipients of charity, this shift restores their dignity as heroes feeding the nation .</p><p>In stark contrast, the status quo of import-driven rice supply perpetuates dependency, fiscal leakage, and ecological harm. Allegedly tainted by rent-seeking and foreign supplier payoffs, this approach disburses public funds outward, benefiting intermediaries while delivering only minimal support to farmers. Imports entail a heavy carbon footprint due to shipping, packaging, and spoilage; they undermine local food sovereignty and escalate debt servicing linked to foreign currency outflows.</p><p>'Farmers are portrayed as subsidy-reliant victims rather than heroes feeding the nation'.</p><p>Rechanneling even a fraction of the import budget into local procurement is not only more economically efficient-it carries profound cultural and ecological significance. It affirms that Filipino farmers, and the soils they steward, are the heartbeat of national renewal. Back to Qr procurement boost local food sovereignty and morale without harming treasury.</p><p>The way forward begins with acknowledging that these failures were engineered and they had backfired .</p><p>The Philippines must end its addiction to debt, its dependency on labor exports, and its subservience to foreign markets.</p><p>This requires structural reform: repealing EO 62 scrapping RTL to restore rice tariffs and use revenues for agroecological renewal; scrapping PD 1177 to redirect debt payments to education and climate resilience; and institutionalizing participatory budgeting and citizen-led audits to fight corruption at its root.</p><p>More than fiscal tools, the country needs a shift in consciousness.

It MUST be written by citizens who dare to reclaim their dignity, their land, and their voice.</p>", "publisher": "Philippines Daily Inquirer", "instances": ["Labor migration must be treated as displacement-not triumph-and countered by sovereign industry and innovation.
