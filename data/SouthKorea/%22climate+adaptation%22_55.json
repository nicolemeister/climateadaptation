The award, presented to him in Nairobi, recognized not only his extensive diplomatic achievements but also his profound and ongoing commitment to advancing multilateral cooperation in the fight against climate change.</p><p>To put this into perspective, during his tenure at the United Nations, he championed landmark agreements, including the Paris Climate Accord.</p><p>His relentless efforts to unite nations in pursuit of a greener, fairer world have left an indelible mark on global policy and inspired a new generation of leaders.</p><p>Kenya's decision to recognize Ban's contributions serves as a testament to the country's leadership in environmental matters, reinforcing its reputation as a beacon of hope and innovation on the African continent.</p><p>President William Ruto, in his tribute, described Ban as \"a bridge-builder and a champion of the world's most vulnerable,\" praising his \"tireless advocacy and unwavering dedication to building a peaceful, just and sustainable world.\" President Ruto noted that Ban's tenure as the eighth secretary-general of the United Nations was characterised by significant and transformative initiatives.</p><p>His leadership played a crucial role in the adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change, the establishment of UN Women to promote gender equality, and the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals, which collectively aimed to address some of the most pressing global challenges.</p><p>In his acceptance speech, Ban expressed deep gratitude, saying, \"It is humbling for me to receive such recognition in this beautiful country. Kenya means so much to me professionally and personally,\" he said, noting that his daughter met her husband in Kenya and that his grandson spent his early years in Nairobi. This intimate and personal connection is not lost on Kenya, which has previously welcomed Ban Ki-moon in both private and official capacities.</p><p>The award ceremony coincided with the groundbreaking of the dual headquarters of the Global Centre on Adaptation at the Kenya School of Government in Nairobi. The GCA is a leading international organization, currently headquartered in Rotterdam, Netherlands, housed in the world's largest floating office, with a focus on accelerating climate adaptation solutions. Its new African base will serve as a regional hub for policy dialogue, research and capacity-building.</p><p>The establishment of dual headquarters symbolizes a bridge between the Global North and South in tackling climate challenges.</p><p>The GCA's presence in Nairobi is an affirmation of Kenya's leadership in climate resilience and sustainable development.</p><p>Ban's post-UN leadership is deeply rooted in climate resilience and sustainable development. As the President and Chair of the Global Green Growth Institute and co-founder of the GCA, he has continued to champion climate adaptation and green growth, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Africa.</p><p>Kenya's connection with these two organizations is no coincidence. It shows a shared vision: that climate action should be inclusive, locally led and globally supported. When Ban was awarded in Nairobi, the only city in the global South hosting the United Nations headquarters, the United Nations Environment Program, which also houses the United Nations Office at Nairobi, offers a unique symbol of multilateral diplomacy that highlights Ban's career as a diplomat. It is worth noting that President William Ruto presented the award, as he is a leading voice in global climate leadership, serving as the chair of the Committee of African Heads of State and Government on Climate Change. Kenya's decision to honor Ban is not only symbolic but also a strategic affirmation of the country's dedication to environmental diplomacy.</p><p>Ban's remarks during the ceremony captured the urgency and hope that characterize the climate movement: \"Climate change is the greatest collective challenge we face as a human family. But it is also our greatest opportunity for common progress towards a sustainable future.\" He added, \"The longer we delay, the more we will pay.\"</p><p>These words resonate deeply in Kenya, where communities are already grappling with the effects of droughts, floods and biodiversity loss. Yet, through innovation, policy reform and international cooperation, Kenya is forging a path forward that prioritizes people, the planet and prosperity.</p><p>The conferment of the Chief of the Order of the Golden Heart on Ban is more than a ceremonial gesture. It is a declaration of Kenya's values: solidarity, sustainability and global citizenship. It honors a legacy of leadership that has shaped the world and signals Kenya's readiness to lead in the next chapter of international climate action.</p><p>As Ban eloquently stated, \"That this century is Africa's century and Kenya is not just a leader in Africa, it is a global example of how nations can rise to meet the challenges of our time with courage, innovation and unity.\"</p><p>In celebrating Ban, Kenya celebrates the power of diplomacy, the promise of green growth and the potential of a continent poised to shape the future.</p><p>Emmy Kipsoi is the Kenyan Ambassador to South Korea.

The age restriction on U.S. beef was put in place in 2008 amid fears over mad cow disease.</p><p>Yeo hinted at the possibility of accepting the demand by saying, \u201cIn these sectors, we need to make strategic decisions.\u201d</p><p>Experts point out that decisions on this issue require a strategic approach, balancing the immediate stakes of the negotiations against broader economic impacts.</p><p>International trade professor Heo Yoon of Sogang University explained that a blanket refusal of U.S. demands could lead to missed opportunities in other negotiation areas.</p><p>\u201cTrade negotiations are about give and take. If there are too many items we refuse, there will be less that the U.S. will concede for us,\u201d he said.</p><p>Regarding 30-month-old U.S. beef, Heo explained Seoul can opt out on reasonable grounds.</p><p>\u201cEven in the U.S., opinions are divided. Cattle over 30 months old account for less than 10 percent of production. Export volume to Korea would be small, but it could trigger a major food safety scare in the Korean market. So, in reality, I think it\u2019s unlikely the U.S. will press too hard for it,\u201d he said, adding that Seoul has leverage in Korea being one of the biggest U.S. beef export markets.</p><p>\u201cRight now, the U.S. exports more beef to Korea than to any other country, accounting for over 25 percent (of the total exports). So if we explain to the U.S. negotiators that it would not make sense to jeopardize trust in their major export market for the sake of a small volume of over-30-month beef, I think it would make a convincing point.\u201d</p><p>However, he said that opening up the agricultural market could bring a positive effect for Korean consumers amid soaring food prices. Pointing out the Korean government\u2019s control over the distribution of imported agricultural goods in the local market, he noted that opening up the import and distribution system will help consumers\u2019 welfare.</p><p>\u201cThe U.S. has continuously raised issues with the Korean government being involved in (distributing) imported agricultural goods in the local market \u2026 The reason for the government system is to protect farmers, but because of this, consumers are paying four to five times the international price for rice,\u201d he said, noting that strict quarantine measures on GMOs, far above the international standard, have also been considered a harsh nontariff barrier.</p><p>\u201cIn order to improve consumers\u2019 real purchasing power and overall welfare in this environment, I believe the government could consider making a broader, more forward-looking decision.\u201d</p><p>Lee Tae-kyu, a senior research fellow at the Korea Economic Research Institute, noted it all comes down to understanding how serious the U.S. is in pushing its agricultural exports.</p><p>\u201cWe have to figure out whether the U.S. is leveraging the issues in order to secure higher tariff levels than what we\u2019re demanding, which only those directly involved in the negotiations can really sense,\u201d he said.</p><p>\u201cAgricultural products, like apples, come with various conditions, like whether U.S. apples are actually of good enough quality for us to consume by the time they arrive. We need to thoroughly assess these factors before we can have a serious internal discussion about accepting such imports.\u201d</p><p>The farming industry is strongly protesting the government\u2019s decision to consider easing agriculture-related barriers.</p><p>\u201cWhen it comes to agriculture, (allowing) any imports on American agricultural products would actually put us at a disadvantage \u2026 In the U.S., with vast land, it focuses on mass production, making the costs for all agricultural goods much lower,\u201d an industry insider said on condition of anonymity.</p><p>\u201cUltimately, incomes (for farmers) will decrease due to a disadvantage in price competitiveness. In fact, in the long run, people will recognize the taste and quality of locally produced goods. However, right now, with the difficult economic situation, people are more likely to simply opt for the cheaper products.\u201d</p><p>The Rural Development Administration also pointed out the dilemma that the lower barrier might interfere with Korea\u2019s ongoing development of GMO crops.</p><p>\u201cWe are consistently improving apple varieties and introducing new ones, but if imported apples from the U.S. suddenly flood in as a result of negotiations, it could make the long-term process of breeding and distributing new varieties more difficult,\u201d it said.</p><p>\u201cOur ongoing innovation and plans for climate adaptation could be thrown off if supply conditions change abruptly.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsimg.koreatimes.co.kr/2025/07/17/c6002fe9-d81d-4b13-a183-9e556141c171.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Cuts of U.S. beef are displayed at a discount chain store in Seoul, Tuesday.

While desertification and droughts are slow-moving and less dramatic than wars, floods, and fires, they are just as devastating. Just ask the more than 500 million people living in the MENA region who must cope with them each day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whereas healthy land produces food, retains water, absorbs carbon, and supports livelihoods, degraded land does not. And from the Atlas Mountains to the Tigris-Euphrates river valley, the MENA region features some of the driest - and most rapidly degrading - landscapes on Earth. With temperatures in the region rising nearly twice as fast as the global average, water scarcity, extreme heatwaves, and desertification are increasingly shaping everyday life. Add to that some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing populations, and the risks to food security, economic stability, and social cohesion will only grow.</p><p>MENA\u2019s experiences are an ominous portent of what awaits other regions, which will soon find themselves facing many of the same challenges. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the frequency and duration of droughts have increased globally by nearly 30 percent since 2000. More than 3.2 billion people worldwide are now affected by land degradation, with 12 million hectares of arable land lost each year.</p><p>But the MENA region also offers reason for hope. For example, Saudi Arabia - for which I am the FAO\u2019s program director - has been investing heavily in mitigating and, where possible, reversing the effects of climate change, including through land rehabilitation, rangeland restoration, reforestation, and climate adaptation.</p><p>The Kingdom\u2019s ambition is exemplified by the Saudi Green Initiative, which includes pledges to plant ten billion trees and rehabilitate 40 million hectares of degraded land. Innovation is central to this effort. One novel land-restoration technique, developed through a collaboration between Saudi technical institutions and the FAO, uses dry palm leaves to stabilize sand dunes in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province. This organic material, which was historically considered waste, protects topsoil from wind erosion and slows the rate at which water evaporates, thereby ensuring enough moisture for dormant native seeds to germinate.</p><p>The FAO is also working with Saudi Arabia to implement science-based land-monitoring systems, scale up sustainable land-management techniques, and train national experts in climate-smart practices. More than 40 professionals have been trained across key regions, including Al-Jouf, Riyadh, and the Eastern Province. While solutions are always adapted to the local ecosystem, they are designed with scalability in mind.</p><p>But climate change is not bound by national borders. That is why Saudi Arabia created the Middle East Green Initiative, which aims to strengthen regional cooperation. At the global level, the Kingdom is spearheading the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership, aimed at helping the most vulnerable countries cope with drought.</p><p>Since the initiative\u2019s announcement at the 2024 UN Convention to Combat Desertification (COP16), more than $3 billion has been mobilized. It helps that, beyond being crucial to human well-being, land restoration is a high-return investment: the FAO estimates that every dollar invested in it can yield up to $30 in economic and environmental returns.</p><p>Local NGOs and communities are playing a growing role in land-restoration efforts, such as by establishing nurseries for native plants, building green belts, and raising public awareness about land restoration. This combination of local action, national direction, and international cooperation delivers the kind of robust, lasting results that are needed to build true climate resilience. And it should serve as a model for the rest of the world.</p><p>The climate crisis is advancing fast, but so are solutions - thanks not least to those on the frontline. The most climate-vulnerable countries are acting as role models, innovators, pioneers, and leaders. What Saudi Arabia is doing today will shape what California, southern Europe, and the Sahel do tomorrow. Fortunately, the lessons are likely to be as plentiful as they are constructive.</p><p>Nizar Haddad, program director of the Food and Agriculture Organization in Saudi Arabia, is a former director general of Jordan\u2019s National Agricultural Research Center.

The bloc has already positioned itself as a climate leader, setting an ambitious 2030 emissions-reduction goal that it is on track to meet. But with its new focus on regaining economic competitiveness and military might, the EU has been grappling with a practical and moral question: Will it continue to set the global standard for climate action?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be sure, the EU stands to benefit from adopting the proposed 2040 target. Increasing its use of renewables would bolster energy security, reduce geopolitical risk, and stabilize its economy, owing to lower and more predictable power costs.</p><p>But the bloc\u2019s commitment to decarbonization also has global implications. The clean-energy transition offers the best chance of achieving broad-based prosperity, and the world cannot afford for the EU to reverse course. Such leadership is especially important as countries finalize their updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - climate-action plans for the next five years - ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Bel?m, Brazil.</p><p>What may seem like a technocratic exercise in emissions accounting affects countless lives and livelihoods, particularly in the Global South countries that have borne the brunt of a crisis largely created by the Global North. Communities across Africa are already suffering the devastating effects of climate change, including heat waves, crop failures, and coastal erosion. Last year, flash floods affected more than one million people in Nigeria. In Uganda, where I live, families are losing their homes and land to landslides triggered by heavy rains. Despite contributing the least to global warming, we are facing its most severe consequences, and falling deeper into poverty as a result.</p><p>Moreover, many Global South governments are caught in a debt trap, with high interest payments limiting their ability to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation. Their inability to manage worsening climate conditions could result in up to 216 million people being internally displaced by 2050, including nearly 86?million internal climate-change migrants in Sub-Saharan Africa. With cross-border climate-induced migration also likely to increase, EU leaders must decide whether to confront the root causes of displacement or treat its symptoms by fortifying the bloc\u2019s borders - an undertaking that could prove more challenging and costly than decarbonization.</p><p>Failure to adopt the proposed 2040 target would be a betrayal of the people and countries with the least influence and the most to lose. But I do not expect the bloc to choose between its own interests and those of the Global South, because this target benefits everyone. Cutting emissions by 90 percent by 2040 would save the EU more than \u20ac850 billion in fossil-fuel imports, eliminate its dependence on foreign gas supplies, and create two million new jobs in green industries. This is why many European businesses and investors support the target. It would also substantially reduce household energy bills and toxic air pollution, improving financial and human health across the continent.</p><p>Maintaining an ambitious climate policy would also offer the EU an opportunity to rebuild trust with Global South governments, many of which have grown disillusioned with the Western liberal order after broken climate-finance promises, foreign-aid cuts, vaccine hoarding during the COVID-19 pandemic, and limited support for the newly operationalized loss and damage fund. African countries, in particular, are closely following the EU\u2019s actions, wondering whether years of lofty rhetoric about climate justice will finally translate into decisive action.</p><p>The signs are not promising. France, despite playing a crucial role in the ratification of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is now leading efforts to weaken the 2040 target. Instead of displaying climate vision and leadership when they are needed most, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has argued for \u201coutsourcing\u201d up to 7 percent of the emissions reduction to non-EU countries by incorporating carbon credits into the target proposal.</p><p>Such indifference has a high cost. If the EU fails to submit an ambitious NDC, it risks undermining the global fight against climate change. Other countries may follow the bloc\u2019s example and water down their own commitments. The chance to set bold collective goals ahead of COP30 will be lost, and Europe\u2019s credibility, especially among climate-vulnerable countries, will take another hit.</p><p>Climate justice cannot be postponed any longer. The EU\u2019s decision on the 2040 target will shape the outcome of COP30 and, by extension, the crucial next phase of climate action. The world is watching to see if Europe will take responsibility for its historic role in the climate crisis and invest in a safe and dignified future for everyone. Given a chance to draw a clear line between past and future - between cowardice and courage - the EU must make the right choice.</p><p>Vanessa Nakate is a Ugandan climate-justice activist and the author of \u201cA Bigger Picture\u201d (Pan Macmillan, 2022).

Trump immediately signed an executive order withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, and his administration then canceled funding for clean-energy projects under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Against this backdrop, some companies are quietly downplaying or abandoning their previously announced environmental and climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But no amount of shock-and-awe policy disruption in one country compares to the disruption caused by climate change. Already, the financial costs from disrupted global supply chains - owing to water stress, biodiversity loss, and land degradation - are projected to reach up to $25 trillion by 2060.</p><p>Businesses that fail to manage these risks will face higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, and reputational damage. For example, automakers that are slow-playing the transition to electric vehicles may find themselves scrambling to catch up as more governments enact legislation to phase out internal combustion engines in the coming years. In time, legacy auto brands are likely to face the same kind of scrutiny and reputational fallout that oil and gas producers have.</p><p>By contrast, companies that proactively build greater resilience throughout their businesses and supply chains will benefit from greater investor confidence, and thus lower capital costs. For example, the champagne brand Taittinger has opened a vineyard in Kent to manage the risk that climate change poses to production in France.</p><p>But with the climate-finance industry focused mostly on the net-zero agenda (reducing emissions), physical risks and climate-adaptation needs have not received the attention they merit. As a result, banks, asset managers, and (especially) insurers are sitting on a time bomb of potential liabilities. Adapting to a world characterized by biodiversity loss, water stress, and other risks is now crucial to maintaining corporate profitability over the long term.</p><p>Far-sighted countries and companies will recognize that this upheaval represents an opportunity. In separate studies, McKinsey Sustainability and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) estimated the economic opportunity represented by the sustainable transition at $12 trillion per year by 2030.</p><p>Similarly, Kantar BrandZ assessments show that perceptions of sustainability enhance brand equity (value in the eyes of customers), drive sales, and allow brands to command a premium. Yet even as sustainability perceptions add as much as 10% to the value of the top 100 brands, these companies are still leaving an estimated $600 billion on the table. The next decade of business will be defined by companies that recognize sustainability as an economic imperative, rather than just a regulatory requirement.</p><p>Economic power is shifting fast with the impending generational transfer of wealth. In the U.S. alone, the transfer of wealth from baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) to millennials (1981-96) and Gen Z (1997-2012) could amount to $84.4 trillion over the next 20 years.</p><p>As millennial and Gen Z consumers become more dominant in the marketplace, they are seeking brands that reflect their values, and chief among these is a preference for mutualism over individualism: a sense of community and shared responsibility for collective gain in the face of anticipated uncertainty and adversity. In this context, businesses like Airbnb, Vinted, and IKEA are stealing a march with brand communications that focus on cooperation, community, and a sense of belonging. Airbnb\u2019s stated purpose, for example, is to \u201ccreate a world where anyone can belong anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Most of the business community understands what it at stake. In Kantar\u2019s work with the Climate Governance Initiative, 88% of board directors told us that climate change requires new thinking and new forms of leadership from top executives to the workforce, and 84% viewed climate-related challenges as opportunities for business innovation.</p><p>As global business leaders increasingly recognize the need for a new mindset, one finds more and more brands exploring circular business models - such as reuse, repair, and rental - that allow them to differentiate themselves, strengthen customer loyalty, and unlock new revenue streams. IKEA\u2019s CIRKUL?R initiative, for example, uses financial rewards, humor, and green imagery to encourage customers to buy and sell used IKEA items, decoupling growth from the production of new items.</p><p>As global markets increasingly focus on business resilience and respond to the rise of industrial policy and longer-term investment strategies, companies that adapt to generational change will be best positioned to lead the next industrial revolution. We are experiencing much more than the shock of U.S. policy shifts. To remain credible in the eyes of consumers and investors, brands and businesses will have to get serious about building climate resilience into their operations - whether by addressing single points of failure in their supply chains or by implementing robust crisis and recovery plans.</p><p>For businesses, the need to adapt to climate change isn\u2019t going away, and neither is consumer demand for sustainable solutions. Globally, 85 percent of people surveyed still want to make \u201cgreener\u201d choices in their purchases. Companies that shun, renounce, or postpone climate-attuned strategies do so at their own peril.</p><p>Jonathan Hall, managing partner of the Sustainable Transformation Practice at Kantar, is a non-executive director at Water Unite and a member of the Executive Council for the Oxford Future of Marketing Initiative.

Growth is decelerating, climate-related volatility is rising, and debt distress is deepening, but the available policy tools remain too cumbersome, fragmented, and inefficient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Africa has long borne the brunt of these failures. But rather than merely calling for reform, African governments are increasingly advancing solutions, building institutions, and introducing innovations to help create an international financial system that allocates capital more efficiently and is equipped to handle escalating shocks and widening inequalities.</p><p>While calls for reform are often framed as a matter of fairness, the more pressing issue is efficacy. The global financial system fails to provide sufficient liquidity during crises, invest in climate adaptation, channel capital to high-return yet underfinanced green-sector opportunities, and resolve sovereign-debt disputes quickly enough to preserve development gains. It is economically dysfunctional and ultimately destabilizing.</p><p>That is why African countries have championed international debt reform and local-currency financing in recent years, urging multilateral development banks (MDBs) to take on a more active role. These proposals reflect a growing recognition that structural failures raise risk premiums, deter investment, and leave national economies increasingly exposed to external shocks.</p><p>Debt distress is the most urgent and systemic threat to global development. More than 30 African countries currently spend more on servicing external debts than on health and education. While the IMF\u2019s Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable Playbook encourages creditors and borrowers to come to the table sooner and emphasizes the need for transparency, its impact remains limited by a lack of enforceability.</p><p>African governments have responded by calling for a debt resolution framework that is predictable, rules-based, and responsive to development needs. Today\u2019s system - plagued by delays, elevated risk premiums, and poor creditor coordination - fails to align incentives, contain spillovers, and mobilize private investment. Fortunately, South Africa\u2019s G20 presidency provides a unique opportunity for the continent to push for bold reforms that reframe debt not as a liability but as a growth catalyst.</p><p>One notable example of African efforts to redesign the global financial system is the proposal to repurpose special drawing rights (SDRs, the IMF\u2019s reserve asset) as hybrid capital for MDBs. This idea, advanced by the African Development Bank and the G24, would allow SDRs to be leveraged while retaining their reserve-asset status, thereby creating more space for concessional lending. Several MDBs are now considering the proposal as a way to strengthen their balance sheets and expand lending capacity.</p><p>Similarly, regional institutions like the Trade and Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) are advancing pooled credit enhancements, South-South financing platforms, and climate-finance mechanisms tailored to fragile contexts. These are not just innovations - they are viable templates that global policymakers should adopt and scale.</p><p>To be clear, public financing alone cannot mobilize the volume of investment needed to boost growth, build resilience, and accelerate the climate transition. But private capital flows continue to bypass many African economies, deterred by perceptions of high risk, rising borrowing costs, limited financial instruments, and weak project pipelines.</p><p>Instruments like credit guarantees, blended finance, and first-loss capital could help rebalance risk-return profiles and attract private investment. But to be effective, they must be deployed at scale, not confined to pilot projects. Equally critical are upstream reforms that strengthen legal frameworks and institutional capacity in order to develop a strong pipeline of investable projects.</p><p>Africa\u2019s experience shows that MDBs must support both downstream and upstream investment. A persistent blind spot is the failure to promote local-currency finance and domestic capital market development. Over-reliance on foreign-currency borrowing exposes African countries to market volatility and raises debt-service costs. Yet MDBs and development partners continue to treat local-currency instruments as fringe or experimental.</p><p>They shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Brazil\u2019s Tesouro RendA+ and Educa+ programs can serve as a useful model, demonstrating the potential of inflation-adjusted, retail-accessible savings instruments. These tools, delivered through mobile apps and gift cards in increments as low as $1, have successfully mobilized long-term domestic capital while fostering financial inclusion. Likewise, the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) - now operational across multiple central banks - is enabling cross-border trade in local currencies, addressing market frictions, and providing a blueprint for building a more resilient financial system.</p><p>To respond effectively to climate-related shocks, Africa needs a comprehensive toolkit that includes debt-for-climate swaps, green bonds, and concessional financing facilities capable of attracting private investment in adaptation measures. While the IMF\u2019s Resilience and Sustainability Trust is a step in the right direction, it must be scaled up significantly. More importantly, it must mobilize greater private-sector investment and climate finance.</p><p>The challenge is not only to create new instruments, but also to improve implementation. MDBs and donors must simplify access, enhance coordination, and incorporate climate resilience into national investment strategies.</p><p>Africa\u2019s priorities - timely debt resolution, upstream-investment readiness, local-currency borrowing, and large-scale climate finance - are not merely regional demands. They are systemic solutions that would make the global financial system more responsive and better prepared to withstand future crises.</p><p>In a world increasingly plagued by compounding shocks and capital scarcity, African governments are advancing actionable, forward-looking solutions that address the financial system\u2019s most persistent blind spots. South Africa\u2019s G20 presidency is elevating this agenda, sending a clear signal that Africa is not asking to join the global debate - it is helping to shape it.</p><p>Hanan Morsy, deputy executive secretary and chief economist at the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, is a member of the G20 Africa Expert Panel established under South Africa\u2019s G20 presidency.

Construction is scheduled to begin next year, with the first fabrication plant expected to become operational by 2030.</p><p>Adding to this, a 122 trillion won project led by SK hynix, the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster, is also progressing rapidly. In 2023, the city completed regulatory adjustments to its industrial zoning, thereby expediting the construction timeline for the cluster and related infrastructure projects by over three years. The city announced that construction of the cluster's first fabrication plant will begin in March.</p><p>Recognizing the city's strategic importance, global semiconductor giants including ASML, Lam Research and Tokyo Electron are currently in discussions with the city to establish branches in Yongin.</p><p>Plans are also underway to integrate these clusters with nearby residential and cultural facilities, further enhancing the city's appeal as a comprehensive and dynamic industrial ecosystem.</p><p>As part of these efforts, Yongin is prioritizing infrastructure upgrades, including development of an L-shaped three-axis road network to strengthen connectivity and streamline transportation between its semiconductor clusters.</p><p>The Gyeongbu Underground Expressway, which passed a preliminary feasibility study in 2024, will link the Giheung Interchange and the Yangjae Interchange, easing congestion on existing highways. National Route 45, a critical artery for the region, is set to be expanded from four to eight lanes by 2030. Plans are also underway to develop the Dongbaek Interchange on the Yeongdong Expressway, further improving logistics and transportation efficiency.</p><p>Yongin has also prioritized sustainability as part of its semiconductor-focused growth.</p><p>The Carbon Neutrality Support Center, established in 2024, is overseeing 69 carbon-neutral projects and 39 climate adaptation measures. These initiatives aim to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 556,000 tons and improve water quality in key reservoirs, such as Giheung and Idong.</p><p>In line with its focus on sustainable growth, the city's urban development initiatives align closely with its industrial ambitions.</p><p>The 2040 Yongin Urban Master Plan, designed to accommodate a population of 1.5 million, focuses on optimizing land use, modernizing housing, and creating sustainable public spaces. The plan also includes provisions for new residential complexes, such as the Idong New Town, which will accommodate 16,000 households, primarily workers in the semiconductor industry.</p><p>The city is also investing in cultural and historical projects, including a 1,983-square-meter exhibition hall in the Yongin Semiconductor Cluster to preserve artifacts unearthed during its construction.</p><p>In addition to its industrial projects, Yongin is working to improve its welfare and public services.</p><p>The city launched the 2024 Community Service Investment Project, allocating 2.6 billion won to provide welfare services, including psychological support and rehabilitation programs. Autonomous delivery robots will also begin operating in parts of the city this April, offering book delivery services to residents with limited mobility.</p><p>The city earned its status as a special city in 2022 thanks to its population of over 1.1 million. Yongin is one of only four special cities in Korea, alongside Suwon, Goyang and Changwon. This status grants the city greater administrative powers compared to other local governments, allowing it to pursue large-scale projects with more autonomy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYB-GJJ3-RS9S-Y24Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 22, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0004OLY</classCode><className>SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0002934</classCode><className>LAM RESEARCH CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS334310 AUDIO &amp;

Additionally, leading overseas semiconductor companies are in discussions with the city to establish branches there.</p><p>Recognizing that robust infrastructure is vital for its growth, Yongin is undertaking key projects to enhance connectivity and support its burgeoning semiconductor clusters.</p><p>In 2024, the South Korean government approved the expansion of National Route 45, bypassing the usual feasibility study to fast-track the project by three years. Construction will begin in 2026, transforming the road into an eight-lane artery connecting the semiconductor cluster.</p><p>Yongin's connectivity with other cities is further set to grow through the extension of GTX Line A and the development of the expressway connecting Hwaseong's Yanggam-myeon, Yongin's Namsa-eup and Idong-eup, and Anseong's Iljuk-myeon.</p><p>\"We aim to establish Yongin as the southern Gyeonggi Province transportation hub by efficiently integrating major transit networks,\" Lee said.</p><p>Yongin's ambitions go beyond infrastructure and industrial development, extending to global partnerships and sustainability.</p><p>The city has strengthened its international presence by forming strategic ties with municipalities in other parts of the world, such as Williamson County in the US state of Texas, with which it officially twinned in September 2024. Plans are underway for similar agreements with Fairfax County, Virginia, US, and Seville, Spain, to bolster Yongin's global profile and foster economic and cultural collaboration.</p><p>At the same time, sustainability remains at the forefront of Yongin's agenda. The Carbon Neutrality Support Center, established in 2024, is leading efforts to mitigate environmental impacts through 69 carbon-neutral initiatives and 39 climate adaptation projects planned for 2025.</p><p>These measures aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 556,000 tons while enhancing the water quality of key reservoirs near Giheung-gu and Idong-eup.</p><p>In addition to its environmental goals, Yongin is prioritizing investments in education and welfare. The city's plan to establish Yongin Semiconductor Meister High School, a specialized institution for semiconductor-related education, was approved in April last year and is slated to open by March 2026.</p><p>Further, Yongin has secured additional government funding to improve local public schools, while its public libraries are undergoing extensive renovations.

ParkThis year is projected to witness a rebound in mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) deals, marking an end to the sluggish market conditions experienced over the last two years, according to a Samil PwC report on Wednesday.</p><p>The report says that a general recovery in investor sentiment, coupled with the market's increased adaptability to factors such as inflation, high interest rates and geopolitical tensions, is expected to generate more M&amp;A opportunities throughout this year. Additionally, the accumulation of assets eyed for sale during the market downturn over the past couple of years is anticipated to contribute significantly to the abundance of M&amp;A opportunities.</p><p>By industry, the energy, utility and material sectors are anticipated to witness active M&amp;A transactions this year. This surge in activity is attributed to these sectors' pursuit of portfolio transformation aimed at achieving carbon neutrality and ensuring a stable supply chain network.</p><p>Consumer goods, health care, industrial materials and automotive sectors are also expected to undergo major portfolio transitions through the sales of non-core assets.</p><p>However, the report forecasts that M&amp;A activity in the financial sector is expected to be less pronounced than in other industries. This is due to the anticipated strengthening of risk management concerning non-performing assets, particularly as authorities focus on ensuring the capital soundness of financial institutions.</p><p>The report adds that M&amp;A activities will continue for a while as companies strive to innovate and respond more effectively to global megatrends. These include digitalization, climate adaptation and demographic shifts.</p><p>Furthermore, the report notes a record-high amount of dry powder held by private equity funds, estimated at around $4 trillion last year. Dry powder is a term referring to marketable securities that are highly liquid and considered cash-like. This substantial capital reserve is expected to catalyze further M&amp;A opportunities in the market.</p><p>Copyright\u24d2 The Korea Times(<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.koreatimes.co.kr\">www.koreatimes.co.kr</url>) All rights reserved.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://newsimg.koreatimes.co.kr/2024/02/28/0c159c96-97d4-47cb-8fe1-f32884d6b639.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>gettyimagesbank</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-369696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BF7-65R1-JCBN-54YR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 28, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Nation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Copyright Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzM3NEE0Qjk0NzRCNDhFM0E0NjM2RTE4M0QzNTczMTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEY1RDgwMkIwQzVBNEM5NDk1QUVGQzczRUM0MzJDMDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0JDNEVDMUI1RkYxNEI4M0JBRkI5RDZBQ0NFRTY1RDk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRNR</classCode><className>CARBON NEUTRAL ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0EC</classCode><className>MERGERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000231</classCode><className>BUSINESS FORECASTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001975</classCode><className>EQUITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001951</classCode><className>MONEY, CURRENCIES &amp;

urgent action to address water challenges at the Third Dushanbe Water Action Decade Conference held in Tajikistan's capital of Dushanbe last week.Held June 10-13, the conference was part of a biennial series co-organized by the government of Tajikistan, the United Nations and the European Union to support the International Decade for Action under the theme, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWater for Sustainable Development, 2018-2028,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd and to implement voluntary commitments from the UN 2023 Water Conference.The Dushanbe Water Process is a critical component in accelerating action towards the water-related goals of the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, according to the organizers.Opening the conference, Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon urged global cooperation on water issues caused by climate change and highlighted his country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds initiatives to put water at the center of global development negotiations to unite the international community around water action.Dushanbe Water Process provides a vital platform for comprehensive preparation for the United Nations Water Conference in 2026 and 2028, said Rahmon, outlining Tajikistan\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ambitious goal to become a 'green country' by 2037 by developing a \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdgreen economy.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdTajikistan aims to generate 100 percent of its electricity from hydropower, reinforcing its position as a leader in sustainable energy by 2032.The country's 'Natural Greening Program until 2040\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd aims to plant over two billion seedlings, furthering Tajikistan\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds green initiatives.But Rahmon stressed the need to ramp up efforts, seeing the risks and rising threats caused by the rapid melting of glaciers in Tajikistan.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdOver the past few decades, 1,000 of the 13,000 glaciers in our country, which are the main source of formation for up to 60 percent of Central Asia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds water resources, have completely melted,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Rahmon.Experts warn that by 2050, the figure may drop by a third, increasing the risk of flash floods from bursting ice lakes.Tajik climatologists say that since 1930, Tajikistan's glaciers have shrunk by about 30 percent and if it continues, many small glaciers will disappear in the next 30-40 years, impacting river flows of Central Asian river systems such as the Amu Darya, Zeravshan, Kafarnigan, Karatag and Obihingou.The Amu Darya and Zeravshan river systems are seen as crucial for downstream countries like Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan that rely on Tajikistan's glaciers.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAs Tajikistan is not an industrialized country, its share in the total amount of greenhouse waste is insignificant,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd he said, citing this as the reason for Tajikistan's initiative to declare 2025 as the International Year of Glacier Preservation.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIn accordance with the relevant resolution of the General Assembly, starting next year, March 21st will be celebrated annually as the 'World Day of Glaciers,'' said the president.Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs at the United Nations Li Junhua co-chaired the conference and underscored the United Nations' role in advancing the Water Action Decade.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThe Dushanbe Water Process is a key driver for water action and closely linked to United Nations Water Conferences,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Li, noting the conference's focus on implementing the Water Action Agenda commitments.He called for increased efforts to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 6 on water and sanitation. </p><p>Sustainable Development Goal 6, set by the United Nations General Assembly, seeks to ensure 'clean water and sanitation for all.' The goal is one of 17 designed to build on the progress of the former Millennium Development Goals.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdFuture Dushanbe Water Conferences will also contribute to the UN Conference on the Final Review of Water Action Edge Decade in 2028, which will be held again in this great country, in this beautiful city,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Li.The conference concluded with a declaration underlining five critical areas for action: improving water management for human health, establishing policies for universal water and sanitation access, preparing national climate adaptation plans, strengthening integrated water resource management, and increasing public and private financing.The attendees emphasized that the conference will aid the international community in preparing for the 2026 Water Conference, with future conferences in Dushanbe in 2026 and 2028 continuing to support the Water Action Decade and Agenda.They stressed that successful implementation of the UN's water-related goals requires linking water action to climate action, with a focus on ground-level awareness, financing, policy reforms, grassroots engagement and continuous monitoring.Tajikistan not only seems dedicated to addressing water issues within its own development plans but also aspires to emerge as a leading force in water diplomacy.The country aims to facilitate global water action and serve as a hub for international dialogue on climate action. However, the country's water supply sector faces substantial challenges stemming from years of underinvestment and insufficient maintenance.A 2023 World Bank estimate suggests that a minimum investment of $800 million is required to ensure safe water supply services for the country's entire population by 2030.The Tajik government has been collaborating with international organizations like the United Nations, the World Bank, the UN Development Program and UNESCO to enhance the nation's energy and water infrastructure. However, stakeholders are also seeking investment and technology support from private entities to further these efforts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C8N-FCR1-JCF4-M006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 17, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp;

Today, Africa stands ready to propel itself into a green revolution, capitalizing on its many opportunities and resources, and driven by unwavering determination to steer the continent towards a sustainable, resilient future. This commitment is exemplified through innovation, collaboration, and by forging partnerships with key players, partners, and stakeholders, both in Africa and beyond.While climate change is the greatest challenge of our generation, Africa is ready to face it head-on, striving to implement innovative measures to yield long-term sustainable change. Africa is a continent of immense diversity and vibrancy, home to over 1.3 billion people across 55 countries, who speak thousands of languages contributing to a rich cultural heritage, dynamic economies, and a spirit of resilience and innovation that drives continuous progress and development. </p><p>In addition, Africa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds youth population is growing rapidly and is expected to reach 850 million youth by 2050, and by 2063, young people will constitute half of the 2 billion working-age population.But amidst the increasing and devastating impacts of climate change, Africa continues to pay a heavy price. Seven out of the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ten most vulnerable countries to climate are in Africa even though the continent only accounts for less than 4 percent of global carbon emissions - an indication of how vulnerable the continent is. Yet, in its pursuit of a sustainable, inclusive and resilient future, Africa faces one huge challenge: access to adequate green and climate finance.Despite many financial commitments and pledges, and existing climate financing mechanisms, Africa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds climate agenda and actions remain mostly unfunded ambitions. It is heartbreaking to realize that even today, Africa receives less than 12 percent of the over $250 billion it needs each year to finance its climate actions and adapt to the devastating impacts of climate change. As a result, Africa struggles to finance its long-term plans, often implementing initiatives focused on quick wins to demonstrate the achievement of immediate objectives.In order to support the member states, GGGI introduces the groundbreaking \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAfrica and Middle East SAFE Initiative.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd This landmark initiative endeavors to 'Scale-up Agriculture and Food systems for Economic' development in Africa and the Middle East and aims to benefit millions of people whose livelihoods are threatened by the climate crisis. The Africa and Middle East SAFE Initiative, a groundbreaking $10 billion public-private partnership, represents collaborative efforts to tackle the urgent issues of food security, climate change and rural livelihood vulnerability. Emphasizing the centrality of food security in COP28 discussions, the initiative demonstrates a dedicated commitment to advancing sustainable development and resilience in Africa and the Middle East through comprehensive and holistic strategies.Agriculture, which remains the leading source of income and employment for more than two-thirds of the continent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds population, is the sector most heavily impacted by climate change. This industry accounts for approximately 30 to 40 percent of the continent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds gross domestic product. The increased erratic weather patterns, including extreme heatwaves and heavy precipitation, are causing major crop and livestock loss, and negatively affecting yields - further exacerbating food insecurity on the continent.From droughts to floods to cyclones, Africa is experiencing some of the most devastating weather events in recent history. It is estimated that since 1971, Africa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds agricultural productivity has dropped by 34 percent due to climate change. Yet, fifty years onwards, African farmers still lack the tools and means to adapt to the fluctuating agricultural environment. Many businesses operating in the agricultural sector are micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs), that lack ample resources to innovate and adequately adapt to today\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds climate reality. Coupled with the enlarging climate adaptation and development needs, is the debt burden of the continent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds public sector. According to the International Monetary Fund, in 2023, public debt in sub-Saharan Africa amounted to over 44 percent of the continent\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds GDP. These compounding effects illustrate the pervasive threat of climate change; it is disruptive to all aspects of life, harming the environment, economies and social structures.Pivoting the discourse and action on climate issues will require African and international leaders to adopt a multifaceted approach that incorporates innovative financial tools, expands the role of the private sector, promotes cutting-edge technologies and encourages the larger carbon emission contributors to devote significant financial resources towards combating climate change. The inaugural 2024 Korea-Africa summit is one such avenue that provides a platform to amplify collaboration and champion unity through a shared vision: to amplify Africa\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds climate aspirations and introduce critical financing channels and investments to drive sustainable economic growth.A step in the right direction entails global collective action, strong international climate finance mechanisms and a robust enabling environment to attract investment and bolster transparency and governance. Central to this redefined approach to climate action is the nurturing of local expertise to develop innovative solutions tailored to the specific needs and context of the African socio-economic ecosystems. In parallel, capitalizing on the use of Domestic Resource Mobilization can attract international climate financing, showcasing countries\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd commitment to climate action.While climate change poses a risk to our economies, it also presents an opportunity for boldness and innovative financing structures, such as the issuance of green bonds, green loans, climate-focused private investments, carbon markets and debt-for-climate swaps, to convert climate ambitions and plans into reality.By overcoming the challenges of climate change and climate finance, and seizing the opportunities that lie before us, we can build a greener, more prosperous and resilient Africa for present and future generations. We must all rise, united in purpose and resolve, with the support of the international community, to forge a sustainable future for all.

They can conveniently review the top 10 pledges on the National Election Commission's homepage, as officially submitted by the three parties, to gauge their prioritization.</p><p>The ruling PPP positioned its climate and energy pledge as the last among its top 10 promises, contrasting with the opposition DPK, which placed it third, and the GJP, which prioritized it as the first pledge. The PPP's foremost pledge focused on addressing the low birthrate, while the DPK's primary commitment centered on enhancing people's livelihood.</p><p>For climate mitigation, the PPP focuses on the roles of carbon-free nuclear and renewable energy. The ruling party especially stresses small modular reactors, offshore wind energy, CCUS, or carbon capture, utilization and storage, technology and hydrogen.</p><p>The DPK promises to increase renewables' share of the country's power production to 40 percent, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 52 percent by 2035 and phase out coal-fired power plants by 2040. The main opposition party especially emphasizes RE100, or renewable electricity 100 percent, as it is critical to the global competitiveness of Korean corporations.</p><p>The GJP says it will increase the share of renewable energy in electricity generation to up to 50 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050. The coalition of the Justice Party and the Green Party Korea especially focuses on deploying renewable energy on public land, supporting one solar PV for one household and increasing offshore wind power.</p><p>Both the PPP and the DPK promise to strengthen the Korea Emissions Trading Scheme (K-ETS) by increasing the paid allocation. While the PPP doesn't specify how much it will increase, the DPK proposes increasing the paid allocation ratio up to 100 percent by 2030 for the power sector.</p><p>The GJP emphasizes the implementation of a carbon tax as a key aspect of its climate policy. The DPK also advocates for introducing a carbon tax. However, the GJP goes further by suggesting the implementation of a climate dividend alongside the carbon tax. Notably, legislation regarding carbon tax and dividends was previously introduced in the 21st National Assembly but did not undergo a thorough discussion.</p><p>Both the ruling PPP and the opposition DPK have put forward proposals to introduce a carbon contract for difference (CCfD) system. This mechanism involves a contract between the government and a company, aiming to incentivize businesses to decrease carbon emissions. The CCfD establishes a fixed carbon price over a specified period, thereby reducing investment risks for companies and sharing the cost burden between public and private entities.</p><p>Since the K-ETS has not been successful in reducing domestic industrial carbon emissions, the pledges of the three parties provide a positive signal that there will be more active discussions on how to reduce industrial GHG emissions by not only regulating but also incentivizing the industry.</p><p>For climate adaptation, all the three parties propose a variety of pledges. The PPP promises to increase the adaptation infrastructure and strengthen the system to respond to the extreme weather events.</p><p>The DPK suggests establishing a climate disaster contingency scenario for large-scale multi-disaster response and introducing a national liability system for agricultural disasters in response to extreme weather events.</p><p>The GJP promises to investigate all rooftop and semi-basement homes and to prepare support measures for heavy rainfall and extreme temperatures.</p><p>Needless to say, it's important that pledges don't just remain pledges but are fulfilled. Regardless of the outcome of the election, political parties should continue to implement the policies they promised to address the climate crisis in the 22nd National Assembly.</p><p>This should start with the establishment of a permanent Special Committee on Climate Crisis in the parliament, which all the three parties have promised.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG2103202400010077</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BM3-SR61-F00C-61G1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 21, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Business &amp;

Even GFC itself conceded in an internal review that the convoluted process puts its reputation at stake.</p><p>\"Despite the ever-increasing volumes, process improvements and increasing quality, partners continue to perceive the project appraisal and approval cycle as bureaucratic, lengthy, inconsistent and non-transparent,\" the review said.</p><p>Operational since 2015, the U.N.-backed GCF is the world's most prominent climate fund  with US$18 billion in capital currently  to fund climate adaptation and mitigation projects.</p><p>Housed inside the iconic G-Tower in Incheon City's wealthy neighborhood of Songdo, GCF has disbursed $3.7 billion so far. However, it has approved projects worth $12.8 billion, with less than a third in 83 Asia-Pacific projects.</p><p>On Thursday, GCF is set to hold its second pledging conference in Bonn, Germany, asking rich countries to prove their climate commitments and raise funds for the next four years to disburse $50 billion by 2030.</p><p>Climate frontline countries feel cash pain</p><p>In his lifetime, Palau's President Surangel Whipps Jr. says he has seen the top of docks that were never covered with seawater now regularly submerged.</p><p>\"One particular island I visited in 1980 and went back in 2020 shrunk in size by two-thirds,\" he told Radio Free Asia earlier this year, adding the sea turtles laying eggs on the beach would not now survive.</p><p>Eight of the 10 inhabited islands risk submersion. Palau's stingless jellyfish disappeared last year due to extreme heat. Rising sea temperatures could deplete 40% of the tuna stock by 2050.</p><p>However, the access to climate financing to tackle these issues \"has just been difficult - almost impossible,\" the president said.</p><p>The Pacific Island country received a $9 million project approval only in July after more than two-and-a-half years of waiting.</p><p>Seve Paeniu, Tuvalu's finance minister, shared a similar experience.</p><p>\"We first tried to access the Green Climate Fund six to seven years ago. It took us two to three years from conceiving the idea to GCF approving the funding,\" Paeniu said at a May event in Bangkok.</p><p>\"And then it took us another four or five years to reach implementation, and we just started the civil works for the coastal adaptation program in the last several months.\"</p><p>Experts believe GCF's accreditation and approval processes are biased against smaller or developing nations, as they often cannot meet the strict financial standards and usually suggest smaller projects incompatible with high transaction costs.</p><p>Neang Vanny from Cambodia's climate change and development department mentioned it took three years for Phnom Penh to draft a $36 million grant application, and another four years for approval.</p><p>Laksmi Dhewanthi, head of Indonesia's climate change department, noted Jakarta secured GCF funding in October 2021 after a three-year process.</p><p>Country needs, fund priorities are different</p><p>ccording to the country's action plan, Vietnam needs some $20 billion to tackle climate change.</p><p>\"There is a tremendous gap between what we need, what is required, and what is available in financing at the moment,\" said Lan Thanh Ha, an official at Vietnam's agriculture and rural development ministry.</p><p>He said most funding comes for mitigation. \"There's still high demand for adaptation projects  we do have difficulties in assessing those funding sources.\"</p><p>Mitigation reduces greenhouse gas emissions, like using solar power, while adaptation adjusts to climate changes, such as building coastal sea walls.</p><p>ccording to GCF, the proportion of approved adaptation finance was much less compared to mitigation, at 17% to 50%. The rest was cross-cutting, both adaptation and mitigation.</p><p> climate expert criticized GCF and similar funds for making the procedure \"very, very complicated.\"</p><p>\"You need an expert, a Ph.D. consultant in the subject of writing such proposals, to be able to write,\" said Saleemul Huq, a lead author of the U.N.-backed IPCC climate reports.</p><p>\"It takes ages for the proposals to be approved, as they come back with many questions, and you answer those questions and they come back with more questions. It takes years before a project gets approved.\"</p><p>t the last board meeting, Bangladesh had two projects approved. \"One took seven years and hundreds of questions to be approved,\" Huq said.</p><p>Many countries have \"bitter\" experiences because they make \"a lot of effort for tiny outcomes, and many of them are just giving up,\" he added.</p><p>Huq said that while renewable energy projects earn money and can repay loans, adaptation doesn't generate income.</p><p>CF's April report said more than 50% of the allocated funding was in the form of loans and equity, while the use of grants has decreased from 53% in 2017 to 37% last year.</p><p>Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown said small countries need financing \"in the form of grant funding\" since they have limited revenue.</p><p>\"It's quite insulting that we're being asked to borrow money from the major polluters of the environment to protect ourselves against the impacts,\" he told RFA. \"I think that's morally wrong.\"</p><p>n environmentalist at the Songdo conference likened climate financing to \"borrowing a friend's car, breaking it, and then asking the friend to borrow money from you to fix it if they're creditworthy.\"</p><p>Sitting in Songdo, deciding on Suva</p><p>t a recent Asia-Pacific dialogue hosted by GCF in South Korea, a participant from a Pacific Island questioned why GCF requires 30 years of climate data for project ideas, given the IPCC's urgent warnings about their existential threat.</p><p>\"They sit here in Songdo and make rules on how any country can apply for funding. And the rules are extremely complicated,\" Huq said. \"Only big countries can do that with a lot of capacity.\"</p><p>Sindra Sharma of the Pacific Island Climate Action Network highlighted that due to intricate funding structures, nations are increasingly seeking climate support from China and to some extent, India. China's swift financing, while beneficial for prompt action in smaller states, might make tracking and accountability challenging outside the established climate finance framework.</p><p>Separately, a UN official stated that GCF operates more like a bank, focusing on profits rather than the pressing needs of vulnerable countries like Timor-Leste and Tuvalu. The official added that GCF often requires climate data, which some nations, despite their genuine needs, cannot furnish.</p><p>\"The GCF's bank-like approach lacks flexibility and empathy,\" said the official who was not authorized to speak to media on the matter and requested anonymity. \"Many countries hire consultants who may not truly understand their real challenges and capabilities.\"</p><p>Rabab Fatima, a high-ranking U.N. official for vulnerable countries, told RFA of the need for streamlined, simplified access to climate finance for frontline nations, as \"the inequity in access to climate finance has further widened.\"</p><p>\"It is also to be noted that roughly two-thirds of the money comes in the form of loans, not grants. This exacerbates their debt servicing problem, which can sometimes reach 15% of government revenues,\" she said.</p><p>Pacific Island countries are responsible for 0.03% of global emissions but are among the most vulnerable countries facing climate change impacts.</p><p>CF streamlining its process</p><p>CF did not respond to RFA's request for an interview.</p><p>Timothy Breitbarth, an investment operations manager at GCF, said the access to their funding is a \"work in progress.\"</p><p>\"We still have an issue sometimes with the quality of received proposals. We also have an issue of a very large proposal in the pipeline,\" he told a panel discussion in Songdo.</p><p>CF currently receives more proposals than funding available, many without a solid climate impact angle.</p><p>\"And so, we have to prioritize according to our strategic plan,\" he said, adding that the GCF is looking for ways to decrease time over reviews.</p><p>nother senior climate specialist at GCF said the organization \"needs to reprioritize things.\"</p><p>\"The difference in capacity between nations like India and Fiji is stark, and it's unfair for smaller countries to undergo the same lengthy process despite applying for much less funds,\" he said, speaking to RFA on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak.</p><p>He also pointed out the discrepancy in proposal quality, stressing that urgency does not always equate to feasibility.</p><p>\"Often, countries don't understand exactly what kind of projects GCF funds. There is a knowledge gap in how funding works. This is a collective failure,\" he added.</p><p>CF previously faced issues of a toxic culture, power misuse, harassment, political bias, and favoritism towards rich nations.</p><p>In August, Portuguese expert Mafalda Duarte took charge, promising GCF reforms. She emphasized the fund's pivotal role, stating that 50% of its resources are dedicated to adaptation objectives during a Songdo panel discussion.</p><p>Mafalda also vowed to simplify and streamline procedures.</p><p>\"It shouldn't be burdening those that are most vulnerable with heavy processes to access finance, when they are the ones under great stress from climate and other crises.\"</p><p>Source: Radio Free Asia</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG04102023027324</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69B3-CBW1-F00C-600C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 4, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DS5V</classCode><className>OCEAN HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001959</classCode><className>PUBLIC FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

As part of UN-system wide efforts, UNHCR is supporting the government-led response to scale up humanitarian assistance for refugee and host communities affected by the monsoon rains. UNHCR  as the protection sector lead  is coordinating with other partners to mainstream protection, ensure gender sensitive approaches and promote refugee inclusion. UNHCR is also actively engaged in the inter-sectoral coordination of the shelter, WASH, education, health, food and nutrition, and livelihoods response.</p><p>While the priority has been to provide relief items to the worst flood-hit areas to address immediate needs, reprioritizing activities for early recovery and rehabilitation is also well underway. In early October, UNHCR released a Supplementary Appeal asking for some $65.8 million to cover the immediate and mid-term needs of floodaffected communities from September 2022 to December 2023. A revised 2022 Floods Response Plan (September 2022  May 2023) consolidated by UN OCHA on behalf of the Humanitarian Country Team and its partners was launched during the same period appealing for $816 million.</p><p>From 26 to 30 October, Ms Dominique Hyde, UNHCR Director of External Relations and Deputy Director Regional Bureau of Asia and the Pacific, Ms Ellen Hansen, visited Pakistan.

When climate-related extreme events like cyclones, flooding and drought affect soil quality and crop yields, they also affect the food security of the whole nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">iving Vanuatu's farmers access to new tools with the ability to accurately assess how local weather and climate conditions may affect their crops is a crucial way of addressing this situation.</p><p>The Vanuatu Klaemet Infomesen blong Redy, Adapt mo Protekt (VanKIRAP) is doing just that by partnering with the APEC Climate Center (APCC) based in Busan, South Korea to expand the range of 'agro-climate' services available to Vanuatu's farmers.</p><p>Over the coming year, new tools such as OSCAR  a crop yield simulator and a decision support tool for selecting crops and varieties to plant, and for choosing irrigation and pest control methods and fertilizer amounts will be released.</p><p>PCC is also developing an early warning system for extreme events likely to affect agriculture, based on the Vanuatu Meteorological and Geohazards Department (VMGD)'s early extreme weather warnings.</p><p>To make accessible to all, these tools will be released as web and mobile phone apps and information from them will also be available in other formats.</p><p>In support of this work, a delegation from APCC is currently visiting Vanuatu, led by APCC Executive Director Mr Do-Shick Shin, to see APCC and VanKIRAP's joint agricultural climate risk management initiatives in the field, and to discuss further cooperation between APCC and the Vanuatu Government in the area of agro-climate services.</p><p>Executive Director Shin held a high-level meeting Wednesday at the Grand Hotel in Port Vila with the Minister for Agriculture, Livestock, Forestry, Fisheries and Biosecurity (MALFFB) the Honourable Nako Natuman and a delegation that included the Directors of the Department of Livestock and the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD).</p><p>The objective of the meeting was to discuss the visions and goals of MALFFB for agricultural climate adaptation, and how APCC can contribute to Vanuatu's vision.</p><p>In his opening remarks, Executive Director Shin stressed the importance of developing agricultural climate information services for improving Vanuatu's economic growth and food security, pointing out that \"accurate, reliable and timely climate information\" is key to improving the resilience of Vanuatu's agriculture sector to extreme climate events.</p><p>In his official remarks, Minister Natuman thanked the APCC for their ongoing support to DARD and VMGD. He noted that APCC's partnership with VanKIRAP is \"highly relevant to Vanuatu's priorities\", and aligns with Vanuatu's National Sustainable Development Plan, Agriculture Sector Policy, and Framework for Climate Services.</p><p>Moreover, he says, better agro-climate services \"benefit all communities and citizens\" of Vanuatu.</p><p>Minister Natuman also underlined that APCC's support was pertinent not just because of Vanuatu's vulnerability to climate-related weather events and disasters, but also because Vanuatu is the \"first small island state in the world to declare a climate emergency\".</p><p>The APCC delegation's visit continues this week with high-level talks with the Ministry of Climate Change, and a hands-on training session with some of APCC's agro-climate tools later in the week. The delegation then travels to Santo next week to visit experimental agricultural field stations, visit APCC farmer 'champions' near Luganville, and continues the agro-climate tool training with Santo farmers. The APCC delegation will conclude their mission with a visit to USP Emalus campus to discuss a collaboration with alumni on soil sampling.</p><p>Source: Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG15122022019053</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:673M-2HR1-F00C-6259-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"640\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 15, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

Through this intervention, WFP is supporting the establishment, expansion, and rehabilitation of 32km of irrigation schemes supplying 2,610 acres of land while engaging impacted communities (1,500 participants) in asset-creation activities. The schemes will support 26,000 vulnerable people in accessing irrigation water for agricultural and horticultural activities and livestock farming. WFP is also establishing water distribution points across the irrigation canals to facilitate safe access to water. To ensure sustainability, WFP is equipping participants and targeted communities with the skills required for water and crop management as well as mitigating climate shocks, including land and soil degradation. Participants receive cash transfers to meet their food needs during the implementation period.</p><p>WFP started the implementation of the Water Provision Resilience Project in Dodoma, Singida, and Mwanza. The project will improve access to water for drinking, sanitation, and domestic use as well as livelihoods including livestock farming and small-scale kitchen gardens. WFP will be extracting underground water using the borehole method. Communities will have access to water through a solar-powered pump supplying storage tanks at established water collection points. The intervention will serve thousands of people with a specific focus on women and youth engaged in kitchen gardens and small-scale livestock farming. In addition to improving access to water and building community climate-shock resilience, the comprehensive package will also reduce protection risks associated with water collection, including gender-based violence, by reducing travel distance  from 8 km to less than 1 km  as the water points will be established inside their communities.</p><p>Nutrition: WFP signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Tanzania Agricultural Research Institute to establish school gardens in 50 primary schools in Kigoma region with the objective of promoting school feeding as a social protection system for addressing malnutrition, especially micronutrient deficiencies among school-aged children and adolescents. The activity will promote the production and consumption of biofortified maize and beans, fruits, and vegetables during school days while also contributing to improved education outcomes among targeted schools and promoting the supply and demand for biofortified varieties among community members. The intervention will also complement other activities currently implemented by WFP in Kigoma in support of host communities. This initiative is part of the comprehensive technical and financial support provided to the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology for the roll-out of the National School Feeding Programme.</p><p>Under its technical support to the government, WFP supported the Ministry of Health and Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre in facilitating the first Inter-ministerial meeting on the Cost of Malnutrition in Africa study. The study, which will start next year, will provide evidence of the social and economic impacts of malnutrition on health, education, and productivity. Results will serve as an advocacy tool to catalyse and increase investment in nutrition as a key pillar for human capital development. By conducting this study, Tanzania will join a list of 21 countries that have conducted similar studies and as a result, improved their policies and investment in nutrition.</p><p>Disaster Risk Reduction: WFP, in collaboration with the Disaster Management Commission in Zanzibar, organized a stakeholders' workshop to validate the Emergency Preparedness and Response Plans developed for Magharibi A and Magharibi B districts. The stakeholders also reviewed and validated the developed guidelines for mainstreaming Disaster Risk Reduction in district development plans to ensure preparedness and response activities are integrated and costed systematically. Similar workshops were also held in Mtwara region.</p><p>Refugee Response: WFP provided in-kind food assistance to 200,782 Burundian and Congolese refugees hosted in Nduta and Nyarugusu camps in Kigoma. The ration provided covered 80 percent of the daily kilocalorie requirement. This went hand in hand with the distribution of supplementary food to 64,586 nutritionally vulnerable groups including pregnant and lactating women, children aged below five years, and chronically ill individuals including malnourished, HIV, and TB cases. WFP also supported in-hospital patients and refugees repatriating to Burundi through the provision of hot meals.</p><p>Partnerships: WFP signed a contribution agreement of USD 6 million with the Republic of Korea to boost smallholder farmers and enhance food and nutrition security among refugees and hosting communities in Kigoma for the next four years. The funding, which has been provided through the Korea International Cooperation Agency, will support over 200,000 beneficiaries, and contribute to the triple nexus of humanitarian assistance, development, and peacebuilding in Kigoma region.

Developing countries regard climate change as a crisis caused largely by the rich countries, which they also view as shirking their historical and ongoing responsibility for the crisis. Worried that they will be left paying the bills, many key developing countries, such as India, don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt much care to negotiate or strategize.They have a point -- indeed, several points. The shoddy behavior of the United States over three decades is not lost on them. </p><p>Despite the worthy pleas for action by President Joe Biden and Climate Envoy John Kerry, Biden has been unable to push the US Congress to adopt a clean-energy standard. Biden can complain all he wants about China, but after 29 years of congressional inaction since the Senate ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the rest of the world sees the truth: America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds broken and corrupt Congress remains in the pocket of Big Oil and Big Coal.Financing is at the heart of the geopolitical rupture on climate change. Developing countries are already reeling under countless pressures: the COVID-19 pandemic, weak domestic economies, increasingly frequent and severe climate-related disasters, the multiple disruptions of the digital age, US-China tensions and high borrowing costs on international loans. They watch the rich countries borrow trillions of dollars on capital markets at near-zero interest rates, while they must pay 5-10 percent, if they can borrow at all. In short, they see their societies falling even further behind a few high-income countries.Against this background of high economic anxiety, developing countries see the rich countries refusing to discuss forthrightly the financing crisis developing countries face when it comes to climate-change mitigation and adaptation or other urgent needs. They see rich countries spending an extra $20 trillion or so on their own economies in response to COVID-19, but then failing to honor their promise -- dating from COP15 in 2009 -- to mobilize a meager $100 billion per year for climate action in developing countries.Of course, Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds reticence on climate financing for developing countries is understandable. He would be lambasted in the nationalistic US media if he called for more US help for the developing countries, and would gain nothing for it in Congress. With US global influence waning, America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nationalists have turned even more aggressively against the rest of the world. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAmerica Firsters\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in Congress would block any new appropriations.Many governments in Europe are in roughly the same position, perched precariously between nationalist and internationalist parties. And with budget deficits in European countries generally high in the wake of COVID-19, many parliaments have little taste to do more -- especially given that the European Union already devotes a far higher share of gross national income (roughly 0.5 percent) to official development assistance than does the US (just 0.17 percent).That leaves us stuck between the reality of a devastating global climate crisis and rich countries\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd nationalist politics, with climate finance based on voluntary contributions by the rich. The result is the chronic deep underfinancing of global public goods such as a safe climate, the Sustainable Development Goals, and COVID-19 vaccines. Leaders like Biden may plead with their legislatures to be responsible, but the legislators find it more politically expedient to rail against \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdundeserving\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd foreigners.The financial failures at COP26 are both tragic and absurd, going beyond the overarching failure to mobilize the promised $100 billion per year. Consider that the much-vaunted Climate Adaptation Fund, established to help developing countries to meet their adaptation needs, collected all of $356 million in pledges at COP26, or roughly 5 cents per person in the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds developing countries. Financing for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlosses and damages,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that is, to recover and rebuild from climate disasters, fared even worse, with rich countries agreeing only to hold \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddialogue\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd on the issue.This financial voluntarism needs to end. We need a global formula that assigns responsibility to each rich country. At least in that case, the global community would have a benchmark to demand action from laggard countries like the US.Here is one straightforward and workable approach. To help fund the clean-energy transition (mitigation) and climate resilience (adaptation) in developing countries, each high-income country would be levied $5 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Upper-middle-income countries would be levied $2.50 per ton. These CO2 levies would start as soon as possible and rise gradually, doubling in five years.Countries could easily pay such modest sums from the proceeds of carbon taxes and auctions of emissions permits, both of which will have much a higher price per ton of CO2 than the levy.COP26 showed definitively that asking national politicians to vote for voluntary funds for global public goods is a dead end. The rich-country politicians had a dozen years to get the promised climate financing in place, but they failed. A rules-based system, with fair and transparent burden sharing, is the way to secure the financing we need for planetary safety and fairness.Jeffrey D. SachsJeffrey D.

To that end, the leaders welcomed the World Local Production Forum in 2022 hosted by the Netherlands aimed at strengthening production capacity in different regional hubs.10. Leaders discussed the possibilities of strengthening cooperation in the fields of security, defense and veterans' affairs. President Moon also took the opportunity to thank the Dutch Government and people for their contributions and sacrifices during the Korean War.

Its priority midterm target -- the 2030 Agenda -- is to decrease the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day to no more than 3 percent and to foster the income growth of the bottom 40 percent for every country by 2030.The WBG\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds devotion to sustainable growth remains unchanged but due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been drastic changes in the interrelated economics, political science and social psychology, the senior official pointed out.Addressing the newly posed dilemma, the WBG adopted a two-way approach, advising policymakers to take into account both short-term and long-term considerations. </p><p>\u00e3\u20ac\u20acWhile providing a sustainability checklist with shorter-term considerations -- such as job creation, economic impact, resilience and decarbonization -- the WBG is increasingly making efforts to ensure that financing for COVID-19 recovery is in line with climate adaptation in a longer perspective, Kwakwa said.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdDue to its high vulnerability to climate change and fast economic growth, the East Asia and Pacific region has a strong role to play in both adaptation and mitigation responses to global warming,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she added.In China and Indonesia, two of the region\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds largest countries, WB has directed $3.9 billion toward climate change mitigation over the past four years, including significant investments in battery storage and renewable energy.When it comes to carbon pricing, Asia\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds fourth-largest economy is an early mover, not only within the region but across the world, with its Emissions Trading Scheme being the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds second-largest in scale, next to that of the European Union, the WB official explained.The country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds relatively flexible labor market is another forte that may enable the market reforms and supportive policies needed to foster a green industrial ecosystem.But to add full momentum to its green drive, Korea needs to further engage the private sector through strategic policy incentives, Kwakwa said.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAn example from neighboring China shows that a combination of investments and policy incentives has successfully encouraged major advances in the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds development of both wind and solar power,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she said.Seoul joined the World Bank Group as a member in 1955 and established a regional office in Songdo in 2014. Assisting the partnership was the Korea Green Growth Trust Fund, a Korean government-financed trust fund that has since 2011 funded 144 green growth programs with some $14 billion in WB lending.The World Bank Group, a multilateral financial body headquartered in Washington, consists of five organizations -- the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes.

If it had to be held at all, it should have been conducted online, saving time, logistical costs, and airplane emissions. But, more fundamentally, G-7 summits are an anachronism. Political leaders need to stop devoting their energy to an exercise that is unrepresentative of today\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds global economy and results in a near-complete disconnect between stated aims and the means adopted to achieve them.There was absolutely nothing at the G-7 summit that could not have been accomplished much more cheaply, easily, and routinely by Zoom. </p><p>The most useful diplomatic meeting this year was President Joe Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds online meeting with 40 world leaders in April to discuss climate change. Routine online international meetings by politicians, parliamentarians, scientists, and activists are important. They normalize international discussions.But why should those discussions occur within the G-7, which has been superseded by the G-20? When the G-7 countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) began their annual summit meetings in the 1970s, they still dominated the world economy. In 1980, they constituted 51 percent of world GDP (measured at international prices), whereas the developing countries of Asia accounted for just 8.8 percent. In 2021, the G-7 countries produce a mere 31 percent of world GDP, while the same Asian countries produce 32.9 percent.The G-20, by including China, India, Indonesia, and other large developing countries, represents around 81 percent of world output, and balances the interests of its high-income and developing economies. It is not perfect, as it leaves out smaller and poorer countries and should add the African Union as a member, but at least the G-20 offers a fruitful format for discussing global topics covering most of the world economy. The annual EU-US Summit can accomplish much that the G-7 originally aimed to cover.The G-7 is particularly irrelevant because its leaders don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt deliver on their promises. They like making symbolic statements, not solving problems. Worse, they give the appearance of solving global problems, while really leaving them to fester. This year\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds summit was no different.Consider COVID-19 vaccines. The G-7 leaders set the goal of vaccinating at least 60 percent of the global population. They also pledged to share 870 million doses directly over the next year, presumably meaning enough for 435 million fully immunized individuals (with two doses per person). But 60 percent of the global population comes to 4.7 billion people, or roughly 10 times that number.The G-7 leaders offered no plan for achieving their stated aim of global coverage, and in fact, have not developed one, even though it would not be hard to do. Estimating the monthly production of every COVID-19 vaccine is straightforward, and allocating those doses fairly and efficiently to all countries is entirely feasible.One reason such a plan has not yet been developed is that the US government so far refuses to sit down with Russian and Chinese leaders to devise such a global allocation. Another reason is that the G-7 governments let the vaccine manufacturers negotiate privately and secretly, rather than as part of a global plan. Perhaps a third reason is that the G-7 looked at global targets without thinking hard enough about the needs of each recipient country.Yet another example of the G-7\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds false promises is climate change. At the latest summit, G-7 leaders rightly embraced the goal of global decarbonization by 2050, and called on developing countries to do so as well. Yet, rather than laying out a financing plan to enable developing countries to achieve that target, they reiterated a financial pledge first made in 2009 and never fulfilled. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe reaffirm the collective developed country goal,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd they averred, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdto jointly mobilize $100 billion per year from public and private sources, through to 2025 in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIt is hard to overstate the cynicism of this oft-repeated pledge. The rich countries missed their own deadline of 2020 for providing the long-promised $100 billion per year -- a mere 0.2 percent of rich countries\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd annual GDP. And the promised $100 billion is itself a small fraction of what developing countries need for decarbonization and climate adaptation.The disconnect between the G-7\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds soaring aims and meager means is apparent on education as well. Hundreds of millions of children in poor countries lack access to primary and secondary education because their governments don\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt have the financial means to provide teachers, classrooms, and supplies. In 2020, UNESCO estimated that the low- and lower-middle-income countries need around $504 billion per year up to 2030 to ensure that all kids complete a secondary education, but have only around $356 billion of their own domestic resources, leaving a financing gap of around $148 billion per year.So, what does the G-7 propose in this year\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds communique? The leaders propose \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bda target to get 40 million more girls into education and with at least $2.75 billion for the Global Partnership for Education.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd These are not serious numbers. They are pulled out of thin air and would leave hundreds of millions of children out of school, despite the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds firm commitment (enshrined in Sustainable Development Goal 4) to universal secondary education. Large-scale solutions are available -- such as mobilizing low-interest financing from multilateral development banks - but the G-7 leaders didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt propose such solutions.The world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds problems are far too urgent to leave to empty posturing and to measures that are a mere token of what is needed to achieve stated ends. If politics were a mere spectator sport, to be judged by which politicians mugged best the cameras, the G-7 summit would perhaps have a role to play. Yet we have urgent global needs to meet: ending a pandemic, decarbonizing the energy system, getting kids in school, and achieving the SDGs.My recommendations: Fewer face-to-face meetings, more serious homework to link means and ends, more routine Zoom meetings to discuss what really needs to be done, and greater reliance on the G-20 (plus the AU) as the group that can actually follow through. We need Asia, Africa, and Latin America at the table for any true global problem solving.Jeffrey D. Sachs Jeffrey D.

Following the Turkish invasion in 1974, numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions describe Cyprus as a single sovereign nation with two communities and zones. Yet Turkiye President Erdoan insists that there are two distinct States and two distinct peoples on the island today. For peace to prevail, Member States must unwaveringly adhere to international law and the Organization's Charter.Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of Palestine, said more than 5 million of his people have been living under the Israeli military occupation for over 54 years. Israel ignores the resolutions of international legitimacy and imposes a status quo by force and aggression, destroying the two-State solution. </p><p>Who is protecting Israel from being accountable, he asked, stressing that it is \"the United Nations. And on top of the United Nations, the most powerful of the United Nations.\" He emphasized that \"We have had enough resolutions and enough words,\" urging the Israeli Government to return to the negotiation table immediately.Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Prime Minister of Pakistan, said sustainable peace and stability in South Asia remains contingent upon a just and lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute -- which began in 1947. \"India's illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 to change the internationally recognized 'disputed' status of Jammu and Kashmir and to alter the demographic structure of the occupied territory further undermined the prospects of peace and inflamed regional tensions.\" He urged India to take credible steps to create an enabling environment for constructive engagement.Echoing delegations' concerns about change-induced threats to territorial integrity, he described first-hand the catastrophe that has pushed one third of his country under water after a 40-day flood. \"Pakistan has never seen a more stark and devastating example of the impact of global warming,\" he stressed. Hotspots like his country are on the list of the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries yet emit less than 1 per cent of the greenhouse gases that are burning the planet. \"What happened in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan,\" he stressed, warning that unless world leaders act now \"there will no earth to fight wars over\".Throughout the day, a large number of small island developing States echoed the alarm on the issue, calling for urgent action before it is too late for them and the entire international community.Siaosi 'Ofakivahafolau Sovaleni, Prime Minister of Tonga, underscored that climate change continues to be the single greatest existential threat facing the Blue Pacific, noting that the adverse impacts of climate change make his country the third most vulnerable in the world. Calling for the issue to be a permanent item on the Security Council's agenda, he said that the consequences of climate change, whether it is sea-level rise, loss of territory, or mass migration, is a trigger for violence and a threat to peace and security.Kausea Natano, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, warned that at current global warming trends, the international community is destined to miss the Paris Agreement target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C. \"This clearly means that Tuvalu will be totally submerged within this century\", he stressed -- but the country may well become uninhabitable in the next two to three decades. While other Pacific islands may have a few decades longer, they all face \"the near certainty of terminal inundation\", though their carbon emissions combined amount to less than 0.03 per cent of the world's total. \"Tuvalu is an acid test of leadership; because if the international community allow an entire country to disappear from climate change, what hope will be possible for anyone else?\" he asked.Small countries \"have talked ourselves hoarse since the 1980s\", stressed Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda -- yet while promises were repeated year after year, on the evidence, they were meant to \"placate and divert, but not to perform and deliver\" on climate change. The stage now seems set for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt to fail, as the Group of 20 (G20) did not produce a joint statement on the issue. This sends an ominous signal that, yet again, the Conference will be \"long on words, but very short on deeds\". He underscored, however, that small States would attend the Conference and argue strenuously to establish a new fund for loss and damage response. He stressed that, even if industrialized nations remained reluctant to curb emissions for the sake of the most-vulnerable globally, \"they should be motivated by the perils for their own people\".Abdulla Shahid, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Maldives, warned that for his small island developing State \"the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is death.\" Recalling Maldives' work on Human Rights Council resolution 7/23 of 2008, he reaffirmed his country's continued advocacy for and leadership on a rights-based approach to climate action. His delegation also supports the global initiative to protect 30 per cent of the world's oceans by 2030. Reminding partners of their pledges during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen and the agreements of the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact, he urged them to redouble adaptation finance and make financing assessments fairer by utilizing alternative measures to gross domestic product (GDP).Turning to another scourge -- terrorism -- Mustafa Al-Kadhimi, Prime Minister of Iraq, stated that despite the difficult circumstances, his country employed the \"spirit of hope\" embodied by its people to fight that threat and defeat it on behalf of the world. His people have made enormous sacrifices to liberate their land from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Da'esh (ISIL) and its ideology. Renewing his call to continue confronting international terrorism, he reiterated that the country must not be used \"under the pretext of combating terrorism or protecting the national security of other countries in a manner that endangers our security and stability.\"Simeon Oyono Esono Angue, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea, cited the Central African concern over maritime piracy activities in the Gulf of Guinea -- whose perpetrators are increasingly acquiring more sophisticated methods that allow them greater autonomy in the open sea, threatening the entire subregion. Welcoming the recent resolution adopted by the Council urging the countries of the Gulf of Guinea to criminalize piracy and armed robbery at sea according to their national laws, he further called on them to investigate, prosecute or extradite the perpetrators of such crimes and those who incite, finance or facilitate them.Also speaking today were Heads of State and Government, as well as Ministers, of Timor-Leste, Burkina Faso, Vanuatu, Fiji, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Solomon Islands, New Zealand, Cambodia, Saint Lucia, Belgium, Andorra, Mauritius, Greece, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Croatia, Samoa, Montenegro, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Belize, Australia, Liechtenstein, Togo and Chad.The President of the European Council of the European Union also spoke.The representatives of India, Turkiye and Pakistan spoke in exercise of the right of reply.The General Assembly will reconvene at 9 a.m. on Saturday, 24 September, to continue its general debate.StatementsJOSE RAMOS-HORTA, President of Timor-Leste, said that while his country only faced a minimal direct impact of the COVID 19 pandemic in terms of hospitalizations and fatalities, it suffered from policies undertaken to prevent the spread of the virus. He expressed his gratitude to COVAX for the initial shipment of vaccines and commended New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, Japan, China, the European Union, Portugal and the United States for their generous support -- in kind and in cash.He further said that Australia proved to be a true sisterly neighbour, promptly delivering every assistance \"our fragile health system\" required. He went on to say that in a world plagued by conflicts and human-made catastrophes, from Myanmar to Afghanistan, Yemen and Ukraine, Timor-Leste is an oasis of tranquillity. \"We do not have organized crime,\" he stated. All faiths -- Catholics, Protestants and Muslims -- live side by side in harmony. \"Timor-Leste does not have a single case of ethnic or religious-based tension and conflict,\" he said.Touching upon what he called matters of profound concern, he cited a number of issues, including the serious food crisis affecting millions of people in Africa and Asia, as well as floods in Pakistan that were causing widespread destruction and inflicting suffering on more than 30 million people, with more than 7 million displaced. It is \"crisis on top of crisis\", he said, emphasizing that aid to poorer countries of the South should not be cancelled out by being reallocated to address the refugee crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. \"We must ensure that the Ukrainians are supported, but not at the expense of unity with the many struggling people in other nations,\" he said. He noted that it is difficult to receive the same level of compassion and wisdom towards the poorer South, since \"some seem to feel that we are not really equal.\"Speaking about the war in Ukraine, he noted that Western countries started off \"on high moral ground in confronting Russia's invasion of Ukraine\", however they may end up losing the support of the developing world, which accounts for 80 per cent of the global population. \"They should pause for a moment to reflect on the glaring contrast in their response to the wars elsewhere,\" he said, referring to double standards. \"Our public opinion does not see the Ukraine war the same way it is seen in the North,\" he stated. Rising costs of living for the poor resulted in riots in Sri Lanka, Peru, Kenya and, most recently, Haiti. Low-income countries could only spend a fraction of the amounts spent by high-income countries on COVID 19 stimulus packages, which caused their debt to increase. \"The number of developing countries in debt distress or at high risk has doubled since 2015, to 60 per cent,\" he said.Turning to Myanmar, he said that the people there \"feel abandoned, betrayed, by the so-called international community\". He went on to say that \"extremely generous support for Ukraine's resistance\" is contrasted with a \"muted reaction to the war waged against the people of Myanmar\", who are still fighting and dying every day. Noting that escalation of the Myanmar conflict would impact the security and stability of neighbouring countries, he called for dialogue by all parties involved in the conflicts in Ukraine and Myanmar, as well as in other crises around the world. \"In the Ukraine conflict, Russia and Ukraine should clear their ports and sea routes and allow normal resumption of permitted international shipping activities,\" he said.PAUL HENRI SANDAOGO DAMIBA, President of Burkina Faso, Head of State and President of the Council of Ministers of Burkina Faso, pointed out that for some time now there has been a resurgence of nationalism and an inward-looking approach across the globe, a reversal of liberty and democracy, and a will on the part of some countries to impose their vision of the world. \"Members of the international community are talking about their great vision of a unipolar, single coloured world, in line with their ideology and their interests,\" he stressed, urging the international community to stand up to this and ensure the spirit of solidarity. Member States must move beyond individual interests, which often lead to crises, he added, calling on all in the international community, no matter their political, economic or military power, to join in that movement. To resolve the questions that have been returning to the Assembly's agenda for several years -- the questions of Palestine, Western Sahara, debt, climate change, the embargo against Cuba, and Security Council reform, as well as the war in Ukraine -- Member States must ensure the pre-eminence of the rule of law, justice and equity, and the triumph of common sense.Turning to the situation in his country, he said that on 24 January, a group of \"young patriots had to assume their responsibilities in the public management of State affairs [] by setting up a democratically elected but chaotic regime\". He underscored that: \"While the movement of 24 January is illegal in absolute terms, and perhaps reprehensible in terms of the principles held dear to the United Nations and the international community, we do believe that this interruption of the constitutional order, given the prevailing situation, was necessary and indispensable.\" \"It was above all an issue of survival for our nation,\" he stressed, pointing out that the movement was met with enthusiasm and public support, which still prevails for the transitional authorities that he has been leading for eight months. The recent events that have caused upheaval in its democratic process are due to a lack of response to the security crisis and \"disastrous\" political governance.He went on to say that such lack of response has led to 1,520,012 displaced people by 31 August -- the greatest number of internally displaced persons in the political history of the country and the subregion. It has also led to a humanitarian and food crisis unprecedented in its history; the closure of several thousand schools and half a million students deprived of education; and an economic abyss caused by the slowdown or halting of several economic activities, such as mining, tourism, agriculture and transport, he added. Those difficulties are part of a subregional security context that is affected by attacks by numerous terrorist groups operating in the Sahel, particularly in the Central Sahel, which includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. To tackle this problem, the Transitional Government has established a plan of action based on four strategic objectives: combating terrorism and restoring the integrity of the territory; responding to the humanitarian crisis; restructuring of the State and improving governance; and national reconciliation and social cohesion.However, his country needs the international community's support to produce lasting effects in the fight against terrorism, especially because Burkina Faso's geographic position makes it a linchpin for the expansion of terrorism towards coastal countries such as Benin, Ca'te d'Ivoire, Ghana and Togo, he continued. The stability, security and peace of the Sahel are not just a matter for the countries of this region, but a problem which imperils international peace and security, given the migration of the phenomenon of terrorism from the north to the south of the continent. Given the reality on the ground, efforts made so far fall below expectations, he said, welcoming the joint strategic evaluation mission between the African Union and the United Nations on security in the Sahel. He called on partners to support the transitional action plan adopted on 6 May, to close the gap of approximately $4.5 billion out of a total budget of just over $18 billion. The transitional authorities in his country will not evade their responsibilities to the Burkinabe people and their duties to the international community, he stressed.In that regard, he said that the transitional authorities reached a commitment with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) regarding a timeline for the transition, set at 24 months beginning from 1 July and the need to set up a monitoring and evaluation mechanism for the transition based on security indicators, as well as the return of State services to occupied areas and the return of displaced persons. Significant progress in those areas will allow for favourable conditions for holding credible and transparent elections with a view to return to normal constitutional order. He thanked all partners for their support and called on others who have not yet done so to support his country's reconstruction. Turning back to the Sahel, he warned that: \"If nothing is done to come to the aid of the countries of this region decisively and urgently, we run the risk of a resurgence of terrorism in the countries of the Gulf of Guinea and then in the rest of the world, starting in Europe, the continent closest to Africa.\" He called for solidarity, as well as assistance, which allows them to move away from aid, and that is in line with their convictions and respects their dignity.NICOS ANASTASIADES, President of Cyprus, decried the \"dismal lack of effectiveness\" of the United Nations. If, in fact the Organization had been able to implement its decisions and resolutions, threats to the sovereignty to Member States, long-standing unresolved conflicts, the number of refugees from conflict or poverty, the challenges to the Sustainable Development Goals' and devastating climate change could have been addressed. Describing his address as \"outside the bounds of diplomatic etiquette\", he stressed the need to speak plainly about the factors leading to the Organization's loss of credibility. Some of those factors include how international law is preceded by financial or other interests of powerful Member States, cold war-era alliances and resurgence of some States' aspirations of empire-building, as well as a lack of consequences when resolutions are violated. These problems not only embolden offending States, but also create \"new precedents outside the framework of legality\", he said.He went on to propose that the root causes that lead to unnecessary rivalries and conflicts be identified. The called-for reform to modernize the United Nations into an efficient multilateral governance system is all the more urgent in light of the imminent new world war, following the Russian Federation's illegal invasion of Ukraine. Further, he spotlighted the division that continues today in Cyprus following the Turkish invasion in 1974, referring specifically to Turkiye President Recep Tayyip Erdoan's refusal to implement or respect numerous General Assembly and Security Council resolutions. Detailing those texts, he said the documents describe Cyprus as a single sovereignty nation with two communities and zones. Instead, President Erdoan has chosen to insist that there are two distinct States and two distinct peoples on the island today.He pointed out that 37 per cent of the territory of Cyprus, a European Union member State, remains under military occupation. As well, after the Turkish invasion in 1974, Greek Cypriots were displaced by \"implanted\" Turkish nationals. Thus, Turkiye established an illegal entity in Cyprus and violated the relevant resolutions. He also stressed that Ankara adopted an arbitrary interpretation of international law that reduced the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus by 44 per cent. This was to the detriment of Greek and Turkish Cypriots and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. When resolutions and decisions of international law are neither implemented nor enforced, it allows for such violations to continue -- even \"rewarding\" the offending States.Despite compromises by the GreekCypriot side, all efforts on reaching a settlement failed as a result of the intransigent stance and irrational demands of Turkiye, he stressed. He recalled a productive conference at Crans-Montana in 2017 where the two sides had essentially solved the key issue of effective participation. However, Turkiye restarted negotiations at a Geneva meeting in 2021 where another agreement, this time to appoint an Envoy, was not upheld. Giving an overview of the continuous negotiations on the matter, he spotlighted the letter sent to the TurkishCypriot leader in May conveying constructive proposals for the adoption of win-win confidence-building measures. Those measures were immediately rejected by the TurkishCypriot side, which, in turn, submitted counterproposals in line with their aim for a two-State solution.Reflecting on his decade-long presidency, he emphasized that the only way forward in resolving conflicts and for peace to prevail is none other than the unwavering adherence to international law and the Charter of the United Nations, not as arbitrarily interpreted by those who seek to disguise their revisionist aspirations. Though he was not able to witness a united Cyprus with Greek and Turkish Cypriots living in peace and stability during his tenure, he expressed hope that he will see a better and more stable future for humanity in his lifetime.NIKENIKE VUROBARAVU, President of Vanuatu, said that as the world recovers from the pandemic, it faces a profusion of mounting challenges, such as rising debt levels and looming inflation caused by supply chain disruptions and the rise of fuel and food prices resulting from the Russian Federation-Ukraine crisis. These challenges are supplemented by existential climate crises that require more ambitious action. \"The time is up -- action is required now,\" he stated, adding that the nations of the Blue Pacific continent are leading a global initiative to bring climate change to the International Court of Justice. \"We believe that legal clarity from the world's highest court will help to spur even greater climate action and strengthen the Paris Agreement,\" he said. As the leaders of the Pacific islands community continue to demonstrate higher levels of climate ambition and collective action, he called on all States to join the group of nations that propose to include the crime of ecocide in the Rome Statute. \"The future of tomorrow -- we are the guardians of that future,\" he said. He further called for the development of a fossil fuel non-proliferation treaty to phase down coal, oil and gas production in line with the goal of limiting warming to no more than 1.5C. \"It is critical that the States must revise and enhance their nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement, as Vanuatu has completed last month,\" he said.Recognizing that nuclear risk is increasing because of the ongoing war in Ukraine and the other geopolitical tensions rapidly evolving, he underscored that lack of consensus on the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review makes it difficult to achieve nuclear disarmament. \"This division reveals that the Non-Proliferation Treaty as a central pillar of international rules-based order is not seen as a priority by certain nuclear Powers,\" he said.He noted that, like most countries in the world, Vanuatu was affected by the pandemic, which triggered a decline in its economic activity and severely affected the livelihoods of its people. He underscored that labour mobility programmes supported by Australia and New Zealand helped to keep his country's economy afloat. Having accumulated budget surpluses over the years, the Government managed to implement several stimulus packages and provide financial support to the business sector to avert economic decline and social hardships.On lessons learned during the pandemic, he underscored the importance of prioritizing digital inclusion. He noted that during the pandemic, many students in Vanuatu and other developing countries had difficulties accessing online education due to a lack of connectivity. \"This is why I believe digitalization requires a concerted global response and action,\" he said. As Vanuatu is gradually recovering from COVID 19 and Tropical Cyclone Harold, its economic growth is expected to constitute 3 per cent in 2022. However, the recovery remains undermined by growing inflation caused by soaring fuel and food prices and climate change. He underscored that fragile economic recovery is common for most small island developing States and developing countries, and called for complementary international support on this path. \"One way to do this is to ensure that small island developing States can have access to concessional financing,\" he said.Referring to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific continent, he stated that the document sets out a long-term vision for the region and describes its aspirations. \"At this juncture,\" he said, \"one issue that remains gratuitously complex since the birth of our nation is the unjustifiable and continuous colonial claim over our traditional sovereign waters.\" He stressed that the rights of indigenous people and their entire territorial waters within the region must be regained to enable solutions to numerous ever-rising complexities. He also recalled that his country still faces a major security and political issue with the illegal claim of the Matthew and Hunter islands.MAHMOUD ABBAS, President of the State of Palestine, said more than 5 million of his people have been living under the Israeli military occupation for more than 54 years. Israel, ignoring the resolutions of the international legitimacy, has decided against partnership in the peace process: from undermining the Oslo accords to its current premeditated and deliberate policies, Israel is destroying the two-State solution. Imposing a status quo by force and aggression, Israel is not in contractual relations with Palestine, he asserted, pointing to Israel's frantic campaign to confiscate Palestinian lands, build settlements and dilute his State's resources \"as if this land is empty and has no owners\".He warned that Israel is giving total freedom to the army and to the terrorist settlers who are killing the Palestinian people in broad daylight, looting their land and their water, burning and demolishing their homes, compelling them to pay for the demolition or forcing them to destroy their homes with their own hands. Furthermore, the Israeli Government has authorized the establishment of Jewish racist terrorist organizations exercising terrorism against the Palestinian people, he cautioned, urging the international community to list these terrorist organizations on the international terrorist list. \"Israel did not leave us any land on which we can establish our independent State,\" he stressed, noting that the settlements constitute 25 per cent of the total population in the West Bank.Spotlighting other violations, he said Israel is killing Palestinian people with impunity, as it did with the Palestinian-American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh who was deliberately killed by a sniper. In this context, he called on the United States to prosecute those who killed her. Israel is targeting Palestinian sacred sites, especially in Jerusalem, he recalled, showing photos of the Muslim and Christian holy sites that are being targeted daily by Israel without any justification. Israel is also imposing falsified curricula in Palestinian schools in occupied Jerusalem, changing the content and subsequently imposing the curricula on Palestinian children, he said. Moreover, Israel is disrupting the presidential and legislative Palestinian elections by forbidding Palestinian citizens in Jerusalem to take part in the process, he said, adding that this practice took place in 1996, 2005 and 2006. Israel -- enacting racist laws -- is an \"apartheid regime\", he exclaimed, asking why it is not held accountable for violating international law. \"Who is protecting Israel from being accountable?\" he continued. \"The United Nations. And on top of the United Nations, the most powerful of the United Nations.\" On double standards, highlighting that Palestine is not treated equally, he said Israel has recently closed the headquarters of six Palestinian human rights groups that it considers terrorist organizations.He went on to underline that Israel has committed more than 50 massacres since 1948; during the most recent one -- against Gaza, targeted with missiles -- 67 children were killed, according to the New York Times. He urged Israel to recognize its responsibility, apologize for committing these massacres and displacing the Palestinian citizens, and bear legal, political, moral and material responsibility. \"We are the only people on this planet still living under occupation. Why?\" he asked, stressing that the United Nations has adopted hundreds of resolutions on Palestine -- 754 General Assembly resolutions, 97 Security Council resolutions, 96 resolutions from the Human Rights Council -- while none were implemented.Expressing disappointment that the international community was unable to end the occupation and Israeli heinous aggression, he asserted: \"We will not resort to weapons, we will not resort to violence, we will not resort to terrorism, we will fight terrorism with you.\" He warned against protecting Israel from accountability as Israel would not be able to pursue its hostile policies without the support of other States. He concluded by reiterating his request for full-fledged membership for Palestine in the United Nations. \"We have had enough resolutions and enough words,\" he asserted, urging the Israeli Government to go back to the negotiation table immediately.CHARLES MICHEL, President of the European Council of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, called choosing hope in a time of horror the promise of the United Nations, the foundation of the Union and what those on his continent want for the whole world. Every war, he said, is a denial of humanity and all suffering deserves the same involvement -- whether it is in Yemen, Ethiopia, Sahel, Myanmar or Ukraine. The Kremlin has started a war against the Ukrainian people and hundreds of millions all over the world are threatened with famine, left without heat or crushed by energy prices. \"It is a hybrid war. It combines the violence of weapons with the poison of lies,\" he continued. The lie that the Russian Federation's security was threatened by \"the West\". The lie that the war aims to prevent a genocide of Russian speakers in Ukraine and aims to \"de-nazify\" the area. The lie to call the aggression against Ukraine a 'special operation' and not a war. The lie is that sanctions cause food and fertilizer shortages. In fact, even before the war, the Russian Federation unilaterally reduced exports that led to price volatility. The Russian militarily blocked the Black Sea ports and European Union opened Solidarity Lines. The Secretary General's agreement opened the navel corridor, but the Kremlin threatens not to extend it. And once again, he emphasized, the most vulnerable countries were main victims.The foundation of this war of colonization is imperialism and revisionism, which tramples international law and the Charter to the point of threats of nuclear weapon use and the actual use of Europe's largest nuclear plant as a military base. In that regard, he supports the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to restore security around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. While the European Union asks no one to choose between the East or the West or the North or the South, there is a choice to make between an order based on rules and one based on the rule of the strongest, he said. Today, the Kremlin is a blackmailer, bringing war to Europe. The European Union, he said, while detailing the levels of cooperation with different regions in the world, extends its hand to the world to jointly tackle challenges like the pandemic, natural hazards and protecting human rights -- \"multilateralism is the DNA of the European Union\". Moreover, he promised never to close his eyes for human rights abuses, especially in Xinjiang or Hong Kong. Besides that, he proposed that if a permanent member of the Security Council starts an unprovoked and unjustifiable war, that their membership be automatically suspended. He also spoke about the European Union's commitment to the Group of Five for the Sahel joint force, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, women's rights worldwide, a ceasefire in Yemen, a two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and peace in the Southern Caucasus.On climate change and energy, he said that the bloc will campaign for the implementation of the Paris Agreement and going beyond that at the upcoming twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to ensure a fair and equitable transition. More is needed, he emphasized, more coordination, more money, more sovereignty, including food sovereignty in Africa. In coordination with the World Health Organization (WTO), the idea of a treaty on pandemics was launched to strengthen global health security. Lastly, he reiterated that the Union, just like the United Nations, was founded on a project of hope and on the horrors of two world wars. He called upon world leaders to live up to their responsibility and give hope and stop horror.JOSAIA VOREQE BAINIMARAMA, Prime Minister and Minister for iTaukei Affairs, Sugar Industry, Foreign Affairs and Forestry of Fiji, said that in this year of challenge, he condemns not one, but three great global conflicts. First, he said was the Russian Federation's war of aggression on Ukraine, \"a scourge that reflects a brutal mentality of conquest and empire\". Spotlighting the Pacific people's experience with the horror of nuclear fallout, he wholly denounced Russian Federation President Vladimir V. Putin's threatened use of nuclear weapons and appealed to him to bring the war to a speedy close. Second, he spoke of the climate war that humanity is waging on itself, ecosystems and oceans. \"This war is not fought with bullets and bombs, but apathy, denial and a lack of courage,\" he said, calling upon the world, including multilateral banks, to answer the calls of the small, least responsible States that stand to lose the most. Third, he condemned \"the cold war of difference against citizens of small islands and States\" who bear the brunt of global shocks most.Next, he drew attention to the lives, progress and aspirations of those threatened as a result of the inaction of world leaders. In Fiji, a new constitution was adopted that echoes the spirit of the Charter's promise to uphold equal rights for all peoples, regardless of their background, religion, ethnicity, gender, age, physical ability or province, he said. Equal identity and citizenship are guaranteed; strong institutions established; the right to a clean and healthy environment and indigenous land ownership protected. Economic progress, investments in infrastructure and an education revolution. Primary and secondary education is free and accessible to all, and today Fijian women outnumber men in universities. Explaining how the pandemic negatively impacted the country's economy, he stressed that exactly in times of crisis its constitutional commitments to every Fijian have served and protected them best -- not slashing a cent of pensions and payments to the elderly and disabled and achieving a near universal vaccination rate. He expressed optimism over the period ahead, pointing to predictions of double-digit growth that finds its basis in good policy that prepared the country for the post-pandemic recovery. The Government is now able to help the most vulnerable meet the globally rising cost of food, fuel and other essentials.Pointing to the future, he called the period until 2030 the most defining ever for his country's people and the planet's future. The crisis of a warming planet will imperil every gain that every nation has made, and if the world's leaders fail to halt global temperature rise, they will crush any hope of improving citizens quality of life. Since 2014, 14 cyclones hit Fiji, stealing lives, levelling homes, destroying schools and traumatizing many, particularly the young. He challenged leaders from high-emitting nations to name a greater global injustice than the price that young Pacific islanders pay for climate change. While building back better to the standards demanded by a warming world requires borrowing millions, the archaic architecture of multilateral development banks and global financial services give little access to grants or concessional climate and climate adaptation financing. Where Fiji legislated a net-zero commitment by 2050, the world's collective commitments remain trifling, he said, urging developed nations to deliver on their three-year overdue $100 billion climate finance commitment at the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties in Egypt. He warned them to only come if they arrive true to their current climate finance commitments and ready to agree to a $750 billion loss and damage mechanism, with 10 per cent dedicated for small island States. The Fijian story is that of David versus Goliath, he said -- a small State against nations, corporations and interests far bigger than it. He called upon the world to join them as \"this is not the time for words, this is the time for will and a time for courage\".XAVIER BETTEL, Prime Minister of Luxembourg, recalling the theme of this year's General Assembly, underscored that the world is indeed at a watershed moment. He condemned the Russian Federation's large-scale aggression in Ukraine and the role of Belarus in it, adding that the war is unprovoked, unjustified, and that it resurrects the spectre of world war. Spotlighting the Secretary-General's condemnation of the Russian Federation, as well as the Assembly's three resolutions condemning the war, he hailed the Member States' unity despite the Russian Federation's use of veto and the Security Council's paralysis. He also expressed disappointment that, after his efforts to negotiate with Russian representatives at the United Nations, the Russian Federation declared new measures. Recounting his visit to Ukraine and his witnessing of horrific war crimes, he said: \"Nobody can condemn a country or a generation or kill innocent people.\"Luxembourg has taken in more than 1,000 Ukrainian students, he said, also expressing admiration for the resilient women and men of Ukraine who have started to rebuild their liberated cities. He also saluted the courage of Russian citizens who are saying \"no to war\" despite repression. The Russian Federation will not know impunity for their war crimes or crimes against humanity, nor for the crimes of genocide and aggression, he stressed. Further, the war began just as the world was starting to recover from the crisis brought on by COVID 19, and has exacerbated food insecurity affecting Africa and the Middle East. Citing blocked grain shipments in Ukraine and the spreading of false narratives in Africa that European sanctions were making the food crisis worse, he placed blame squarely on the Russian Federation and hailed the negotiations of the Secretary-General and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoan on the Black Sea Initiative.Highlighting his country's support for the World Food Program (WFP), the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), he said Luxembourg will continue to allocate 20 per cent of its humanitarian budget to that end. Also detailing its financial allocation strategies, he noted that Luxembourg will dedicate 1 per cent of its annual gross revenue to official development assistance (ODA). \"We can all hold meetings about commitments, but we need to fulfil our commitments,\" he emphasized, adding that the Government increased its climate financing to, 220 million between 2021 and 2023. This is in addition to its yearly budget, half of which goes to climate change adaptation in developing countries. Luxembourg will also offer material resources to African countries for renewable energy, as it has done in Cabo Verde, he said.Redoubling efforts to tackle the climate emergency, the Government has also established a citizen council to create a platform of exchange on the subject, as citizens' ambitions often surpass those of Governments, he said. He reiterated that States agreed upon a 1.5C cap, underscoring that small island nations are the first threatened by sea-level rise. Turning to his Government's commitment to gender equality, he evoked the death of Mahsa Amini in Iran and questioned why -- depending on where someone is born, their sexuality, gender or religion -- that their rights differ. It is for this reason that \"we must continue to hold independent international conventions of inquiry with regard to the violation of human rights\", he said.Responding to those that criticize the United Nations as weak, he said: \"The United Nations is whatever we make of it.\" He highlighted successful negotiations such as those with Bangladesh that produced the first declaration of progress on the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, as well as Liechtenstein's adopted initiative on the Security Council veto, which establishes a mandate for the General Assembly to hold a debate if there is a veto in the Council. This is why Luxembourg is a candidate for the Security Council 2030-2032. Urging humanitarian aid for the Sahel region, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan, he voiced his wish that this time next year, the current atrocities in Ukraine would be a part of history.MARK RUTTE, Prime Minister of the Netherlands, said that growing up in Europe as a child of the cold war, he remembered vividly when the first breaches in the Iron Curtain began to appear. Referring to Mikhail Gorbachev who, although coming from a dogmatic, undemocratic and oppressive system, had the courage to choose freedom and humanity, he pointed out that people always have a choice. He said that his message today was that working together under the laws of justice is and will remain the only path to a safe and prosperous world. In that regard, the Russian Federation's aggression must be stopped: \"Russia is not the victim here, it is the aggressor. And the whole world knows it.\" Moreover, the war is bigger than Ukraine, it's about a sovereign people's right to choose its own path and thus about the freedom of everyone, he added. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union are more united than ever -- as should all Member States be in condemning this unprovoked war, this assault on the Charter, the international rules-based order, security and the very foundations of United Nations partnership. President Putin's speech this week shows that he is losing his own ill-thought war and clutches to his delusionary narrative full of lies and deceit. The nuclear threats are meant to show division, but instead there is growing unity.Appealing to all Member States to stand firm until peace, freedom and territorial integrity are fully restored in Ukraine, he also pointed to the period that would follow that, namely the rebuilding and achieving of justice. He recalled his visit to Bucha and the evidence of atrocities in Izium, saying that the crimes of sexual violence, deportation, torture, random killing and others must not go unpunished. On that point, he said that the Netherlands and the The Hague -- the legal capital of the world -- feel a special responsibility in that regard. Dutch forensic experts were sent to Ukraine in fact-finding missions and in July the Ukraine Accountability Conference was hosted in The Hague in close cooperation with the International Criminal Court where 45 countries agreed on key priorities in guaranteeing justice for Ukraine. Preparing Ukraine for a long and painstaking process and pledging the Netherland's support during that process, he explained how it for the last eight years has worked on holding the Russians responsible for the downing of flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine.Worldwide cooperation on the other great global issue -- climate change -- is an absolute must, he said. Explaining that the Kingdom of the Netherlands is made up of four different countries and experiences heavier rainfall and drought on the European side as well as severe hurricanes and rising sea levels on the Caribbean part, he stressed that small island developing States are at the forefront of the world's climate adaptation strategies. Continuing, he said that 90 per cent of all natural hazards manifest themselves through water, via flooding, drought or pollution, showing that water is at the heart of many global problems. To address this issue, the Netherlands, together with Tajikistan, will host the 2023 United Nations Water Conference. Besides that, he stated that European Union member States remain fully committed to a 55 per cent reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and a swift transition to clean energy, and that the Netherlands combats deforestation and helps the world meet the $100 billion climate finance pledge. Currently, 50 per cent of all money the Netherlands spends on international climate action already goes to climate adaptation and resilience. Calling cooperation the only way forward with the United Nations as a vital tool, he urged the global community to come together to address the major issues faced today. \"Now is the time to speak out. Now is the time to be on the right side of history,\" he concluded.MANASSEH SOGAVARE, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, recalled that the right to establish diplomatic relations between sovereign nations is a universal principle shared by all members of the United Nations. He expressed his concern over \"a barrage of unwarranted and misplaced criticisms, misinformation and intimidation\" that his country was subject to as it formalized diplomatic relations with China. \"Our decision to establish relationship with the People's Republic of China is consistent with United Nations 1971 Resolution 2758\", he said, reiterating a call for respect of his country's sovereignty and democracy. \"We will not align ourselves with any external Power or security architecture that targets ours or any other sovereign country or threatens regional and international peace,\" he underscored.Furthermore, he noted that his country joins others in the Blue Pacific continent, who signed the Rarotonga Treaty, to maintain a nuclear-free Pacific. He then encouraged nuclear power States, signatories of the Treaty, to ratify it, reiterating a call for the total elimination of nuclear material, nuclear weapons and atomic-powered military assets in the Blue Pacific. He echoed concerns expressed by other Pacific countries on the proposal of Japan to discharge nuclear water treated by the Advanced Liquid Processing System from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant into the ocean, stressing on potential transboundary and intergenerational implications of such action.Speaking about maritime boundaries and the United Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), he informed the Assembly that his country has legally formalized the delimitation of all five of its maritime boundaries with Australia, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, France, and Fiji. \"With the completion of all five maritime boundaries, our rights and obligations are protected under UNCLOS in perpetuity,\" he said. He went on speaking about his country embarking on the 'digital transformation journey' to enhance and modernize its telecommunication infrastructure. \"Together with Australia and Papua New Guinea, the Solomon Islands commissioned its first submarine cable in 2019,\" he underscored. The geographical reach of the cable will be expanded with the installation of about 170 telecommunication towers under a Belt and Road Initiative. This will link 80 per cent of the country and provide its rural population with access to reliable, accessible and affordable telecommunication services.\"For least developing countries like the Solomon Islands, vulnerability is a key hindrance to sustainable development,\" he said, referring to inadequacy of indicators to measure vulnerability. He thus called on all States and partners to support the development and adoption of a multidimensional vulnerability index. \"Pacific Island countries including the Solomon Islands are in a constant mode of recovery from disasters,\" he said, calling on the establishment of global financial mechanisms for disaster recovery to provide support to the most vulnerable countries. Considering these challenges, the Pacific region has declared a 'state of climate emergency'. \"Sadly, we are seeing more resources spent on wars than in combating climate change,\" he lamented.JACINDA ARDERN, Prime Minister of New Zealand, highlighting the devastating impact of COVID 19, said that while the world is entering a period where the crisis is subsiding, the lessons cannot. Those lessons are in many ways the same as the lessons of climate change, she stressed, pointing out that climate action will only ever be as successful as the least committed country, as such countries pull down the ambitions of the collective. On pandemic preparedness, she added her support for efforts to develop a new global health legal instrument and to strengthen international health regulations. Whether it is climate, trade, health crisis or seeking peaceful solutions to war and conflict, New Zealand has always been a believer in multilateral tools, she said.She then referred to Moscow's illegal war, asking: \"What country, who claims to be a liberator, threatens to annihilate the very civilians they claim to liberate?\" The people of Ukraine need the global community to ask one simple question: \"What if it was us?\" Yet the ability of the global community to answer that question swiftly, collectively and with confidence has been severely undermined. In March, when the world most needed the Security Council to act in the defence of international peace and security, it could not. It did not fulfil its mandate because of one permanent member who was willing to abuse its privileged position. In this context, she championed the veto initiative, which provides an opportunity to scrutinize the actions of a permanent member who casts a veto. For the United Nations to maintain its relevancy, the veto must be abolished and permanent members of the Security Council must exercise their responsibility for the benefit of international peace and security, rather than the pursuit of national interest, she asserted.Calling for a global response to the use of nuclear weapons, she pointed to her country's history of championing not just non-proliferation, but a prohibition on nuclear weapons. \"It was in our region that these weapons of war were tested,\" she noted, adding that those tests have left a mark on the people, lands and waters. The only way to guarantee people safety from the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons is for such weapons not to exist. \"Nuclear weapons do not make us safer,\" she added, rejecting the wisdom of mutually assured destruction. Calling nuclear disarmament an enormous challenge, she advocated for meaningful progress on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The face of war has changed and with it the weapons used, with traditional combat, espionage and the threat of nuclear weapons now accompanied by cyberattacks, prolific disinformation, and manipulation of whole communities and societies.Turning to terrorism and extremism, she recalled the horrific terrorist attack on her country's Muslim community on 15 March 2019. During the attack -- which was livestreamed on a popular social media platform in an effort to spread hate -- more than 50 people were killed as they prayed. In response to the attack, the Government created the Christchurch Call to Action; the Call community has worked together to address terrorism and violent extremist content online. \"We've improved crisis reactions, stymieing the ability to livestream attacks. We have crisis protocols that kick in to prevent proliferation,\" she noted. She went on to stress the importance of prevention and understanding the interactions between the online environment and the real world, which can lead to radicalization.MUHAMMAD SHEHBAZ SHARIF, Prime Minister of Pakistan, describing first-hand the scale and magnitude of the climate catastrophe that has pushed one third of his country under water in a super storm no one has seen in living memory, said: \"For 40 days and 40 nights, a biblical flood poured down on us, smashing centuries of weather records, challenging everything we knew about disaster, and how to manage it.\" Today, huge swathes of the country are still underwater. In this ground zero of climate change, 33 million people, including women and children are now at high risk from health hazards, with 650,000 women giving birth in makeshift tarpaulins, he added. More than 1,500 people have perished in the great flood, including over 400 children and far more were in peril from disease and malnutrition. Millions of migrants continue to look for dry land with heart-breaking losses to their families, futures and their livelihoods. A million homes have been destroyed and another million damaged, he said, detailing other estimates on damage.\"Pakistan has never seen a more stark and devastating example of the impact of global warming. Life in Pakistan has changed forever,\" he said, noting that people in Pakistan ask why this has happened to them, especially when the calamity had not been triggered by anything they had done. \"Our glaciers are melting fast, our forests are burning and our heat waves have crossed 53C, making us the hottest place on the planet,\" he reported, warning that \"what happened in Pakistan will not stay in Pakistan\". Hotspots like his country fall in the list of ten most climate-vulnerable countries yet emit less than one per cent of the greenhouse gases that are burning the planet. He expressed gratitude for the Secretary-General's visit to his country and his assurance of support and assistance and thanked every country that has sent help in Pakistan's \"most trying hour\". Pakistan has mobilized all available resources towards national relief efforts and repurposed all budget priorities to the rescue and first order needs of millions, among other efforts. The dual costs of global inaction and climate injustice are crippling both its treasury and its people. Unless world leaders act now, \"there will no earth to fight wars over\".His country's urgent priority is to ensure rapid economic growth and lift millions out of destitution and hunger, he continued. For that, Pakistan needs a stable external environment. Sustainable peace and stability in South Asia remain contingent upon a just and lasting solution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute. \"India's illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 to change the internationally recognized 'disputed' status of Jammu and Kashmir and to alter the demographic structure of the occupied territory further undermined the prospects of peace and inflamed regional tensions,\" he said. Detailing India's other actions in that regard, he urged that country to take credible steps to create an enabling environment for constructive engagement. he also said his country has led the humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan, and he urged the international community to respond to the Secretary-General's appeal for $4.2 billion in humanitarian and economic assistance and release Afghanistan's financial reserves.Pakistan over the last two decades has suffered more than 80,000 casualties and over $150 billion in economic losses due to terrorist attacks, he noted. While its armed forces, with the support of its people, have \"broken the back of terrorism\" within Pakistan, it continues to suffer terrorist attacks from across its borders, sponsored and financed by its regional adversary. Further, the officially sponsored campaign of oppression against India's over 200 million Muslims is the worst manifestation of Islamophobia. He voiced hope that the Assembly's adoption earlier this year of the landmark resolution designating 15 March as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia will lead to concreate measures to combat that and promote interfaith harmony. Also expressing concern about the numerous conflicts across the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen, he called on Israel to put an immediate end to the blatant use of force against the Palestinian people. Regarding Security Council reform, he urged the addition of 11 new non-permanent members to make it more representative of the international community.SAMDECH AKKA MOHA SENA PADEI TECHO HUN SEN, Prime Minister of Cambodia, said that the world has been destabilized by armed conflicts, an arms race, and technology and trade wars. Further, the mounting threats to multilateralism and the war in Ukraine have complicated things worldwide. He brought attention to the impending nuclear test on the Korean Peninsula as well as United States-China tension over Taiwan. Describing Cambodia's current peacetime as \"hard-earned\", he expressed the importance of cooperation with the United Nations in upholding international peace and security.Recounting lessons learned from the pandemic, he advocated for improved vaccine distribution and shared responsibility to prevent future outbreaks. Turning to climate change, he called for States to honour their commitment to limiting temperature rise to below 1.5C, allocate appropriate financing and provide technology transfer. He further expressed concern that the mounting rivalry between the United States and China could hinder economic growth and urged the World Trade Organization (WTO) be strengthened to reduce trade barriers and ensure value chains.Expressing pride that Cambodia will chair the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2022, he hoped that Timor-Leste would soon become its newest member. Recognizing that the crisis in Myanmar is complex and deep-rooted, he said \"Cambodia is fully committed to helping Myanmar resolve the crisis and all our efforts are aimed at seeking for the cessation of violence, the delivery of humanitarian assistance to those in need, and the pursuit of building trust among all parties concerned to enable an inclusive political dialogue, as mandated by the ASEAN 5-Point Consensus.\"Reporting on successes of his country, he said that Cambodia is one of the countries with the highest rates of COVID-19 vaccination globally. In this context the country has resumed all previously paused socioeconomic activities. He thanked countries that provided vaccines through bilateral and multilateral frameworks. Next, he spoke of how his Government worked with development partners to scale up a cash-for-work programme to improve community infrastructure and employment and a cash-transfer-programme to alleviate poverty. The Government also implemented several new economic laws and trade agreements with China and the Republic of Korea, and signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership treaty. He added that his country held free and transparent elections in June. Speaking about cooperation with the United Nations, he noted that Cambodia upheld the life-sentence of the former Khmer Rouge Head of State, charged with the crime of genocide and crimes against humanity. Justice was made possible through cooperation between Cambodia and the United Nations, he said, and thanked all actors who provided financial resources during the difficult national reconciliation process.PHILIP JOSEPH PIERRE, Prime Minister, Minister for Finance, Economic Development and Youth Economy of Saint Lucia, emphasized that developing countries, already saddled with debt, must be provided with the means to tackle climate change. \"We must act together to save our people and our planet,\" he said. He lamented that 'recent political differences' between two of the biggest polluting countries led to halting their cooperation on climate issues. \"For decades we have called on global financial institutions to carve out a special regime that takes into account the 'smallness' and our vulnerabilities to climate change,\" he said. \"A single hurricane, which destroys our entire agricultural crop or destroys our tourism plant and infrastructure\", he said, can set the country back by decades. As such, he requested that these vulnerabilities be considered when financial obligations for development assistance of countries are being negotiated. He called for inclusion of vulnerabilities of small States while calculating the value of their economies. \"This is a matter of survival for our people\", he added.Turning to ocean governance, he expressed disappointment that negotiations to adopt the first ever multilateral maritime biodiversity treaty delayed acting \"because the developed countries of the North were once again unwilling to accommodate the needs of the developing world of the South\", he said. The protection of oceans is imperative, and an agreement on sharing and sustainable use of the marine resources beyond national jurisdiction is essential. Bearing in mind, that these areas do not belong to one country but constitute a heritage of all mankind, he urged for a resumption of the fifth session of the Intergovernmental Conference on conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction to consider the special circumstances of small island developing States.While his country and the rest of the Caribbean are not manufacturers of conventional weapons, they have been plagued by a proliferation of illegal small arms and light weapons. This resulted in a surge in criminal activity and gun violence. \"Saint Lucia has always been a strong advocate of the international frameworks, such as the United Nations Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects and the Arms Trade Treaty,\" he said. Therefore, he called on the major manufacturers, exporters and importers of conventional weapons in his hemisphere to live up to their commitments: to lend the necessary expertise and technical assistance and cooperate in good faith to stem the tide of unregulated conventional arms and ammunition.ALEXANDER DE CROO, Prime Minister of Belgium, said that people are living in one of the darkest moments since the birth of the United Nations. The mission was never again war in Europe, but today gross violations of everything the United Nations stands for are taking place in Ukraine, with the mass graves and torture chambers in Izium as the latest signs of utter brutality in this unnecessary and illegal war, he added. Calling upon the United Nations to fulfil its calling in the face of aggression and war crimes, he stated that there is no room for neutrality. Moreover, making peace requires the global community to place the principles of the Charter, now trampled upon by a founding Member, at the forefront again, particularly the principles of territorial integrity and national sovereignty. Declaring that the war will have consequences for those that waged it and that \"there will never be peace without accountability\", he voiced his country's continued support for the International Criminal Court. Specifically, he called attention to the fight against sexual violence, calling it one of the most destructive weapons of war, and said that all victims deserve truth, justice and reparation.This war is not only affecting Ukraine, but it endangers the lives of hundreds of millions in Africa, Asia and Latin America through food insecurity. He thanked the Secretary General, Turkiye and the African Union in making the Black Sea Grain Initiative possible and shared that Belgium has increased its humanitarian budget to meet the most urgent needs. This food crisis, he continued, forces the world to address structural weaknesses in agrifood systems and to focus on sustainable and resilient systems through research and development. Besides food, the Russian Federation's war is also causing a deep energy crisis. In this wartime, Belgium is helping its citizens and businesses, calling on their solidarity and strengthening energy independence, particularly by focusing on nuclear and green, renewable energy, he said. Bringing innovative solutions and expertise to the table with world-leading universities and research centres to the Conference of the Parties in November, he said Belgium will help the world change and adapt, because climate change is the biggest challenge of our time.In the fight for human rights and democracy, on the eve of the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Universal Declaration for Human Rights, he announced that Belgium is running for a seat on the Human Rights Council for 2023-2025. This reflects his country's commitment to multilateralism, support for the international order and rule of law and respect for human rights without distinction, he emphasized. Promising to not back down on democratic principles or individual rights, outlining the challenges ahead, like the war in Ukraine and the energy and food crisis, he called upon other Member States to respond to the call of millions of people and act.XAVIER ESPOT ZAMORA, Prime Minister of Andorra, said that the world is experiencing an \"accumulation of crises\" made worse by an economy that uses raw material excessively. \"The planet is exhausted,\" he said, describing the triple crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution. Further, the war in Ukraine threatens the world order as well as that country's civilian population, causing one of the worst refugee crises in Europe since the Second World War. The current war has also resulted in a food and energy crisis. Though the situation is not hopeful, he stressed the need for multilateralism to prevail over unilateralism.Despite its small size, Andorra can act as a role model on a global scale. It is active in numerous multilateral organizations and understands that recovery and positive change can only occur through collaboration and dialogue. In fact, in 2023, Andorra will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary of joining both the United Nations and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The Government will use the occasion to introduce multilateralism and its importance to its citizens.Turning to climate change, he said that Andorra submitted its national contribution to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015 and that his country's Parliament unanimously approved to declare a state of climate emergency as well as the Law on Promoting Energy Transition and on Climate Change. Further actions include establishing an ecotax that taxes industries that have the greatest impact on the environment. The tax proceeds have been used to fund ecological transition as well as provide free public transportation to the country's citizens. The Government also passed a law aimed at putting the country on track to a circular economy by 2035.He said that this General Assembly should serve as a moment \"to renew solidarity among peoples\" and \"renew a social contract on human rights\". Warning that \"we cannot afford to look back and see how our inaction led to catastrophic and irreversible damage to our planet and to humanity,\" he expressed Andorra's will to be a part of the global solution.PRAVIND KUMAR JUGNAUTH, Prime Minister of Mauritius, underscored that the pandemic has brought to light the role of information and communications technology (ICT) as a crucial enabler of economic and social development. The socioeconomic vision of his country and its multicultural and societal values take into account and encourage the pursuit of a secure and safe digital world for all \"as we strive to undermine disinformation with accurate information,\" he said. In this vein, he reiterated support for the elaboration of a comprehensive international convention on countering the use of ICT for criminal purposes. In addition, despite insularity and limited means, his country is striving to increase opportunities for young people. \"Providing social protection and promoting social justice remain a key priority for our Government,\" he pointed out. The empowerment of women, promoting gender equality and ensuring fair and equal treatment for all is at the heart of various policies adapted by his country.In regard to the Chagos Archipelago, he noted that despite the United Nations resolution which required the colonial administration to withdraw within six months of the date of its adoption, a part of the territory remained occupied. This situation further delays the implementation of his country's resettlement programme, in particular for those Mauritians of Chagossian origin who were forcibly removed from there in the 1960s. \"It ill behoves to the U.K. to call on Mauritius and other African countries to respond to other allegations of illegal occupation when it illegally occupies a part of Africa,\" he said. The new Government of the United Kingdom has an opportunity to place itself on the right side of history and end this dark chapter of history involving the last colony in Africa and the last it ever created as well as the forcible displacement of people. He urged the new Prime Minister of the United Kingdom to work collectively to implement General Assembly resolution 73/295 and support the decolonization of Mauritius, including the resettlement of the former inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago.Furthermore, he expressed concern over the decision of the North Indian Ocean Hydrographic Commission, that violated its legal obligations by failing to recognize the legal entitlement of Mauritius which satisfies all the criteria for full membership of that organization. In this regard, he detailed his country's decision to suspend its participation in future activities of the Commission until its legal entitlement to full membership of that regional organization is fully recognized. Regarding, Tromelin, which also makes an integral part of the territory of Mauritius, he expressed hope for an early dispute resolution with France \"in the spirit of friendship\".SIAOSI 'OFAKIVAHAFOLAU SOVALENI, Prime Minister of Tonga, called for urgent action to overcome the severe economic, financial and social impacts of the COVID 19 pandemic, as well as accelerate action on climate change, ocean health, energy transformation, and the sustainable use of natural resources, among others. Calling for a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Ukraine, he said despite being far away from the conflict, Tonga feels its ripple effects through higher costs of fuel, food, and basic supplies. Inflation is double-digit, he cautioned, noting that his country has not experienced such inflation rates in decades. The existential threats from climate change, pandemics, and conflict have increased, he warned, adding that the international community must keep its promises to small island developing States.Already three decades have elapsed since small island developing States called for an index recognizing their special circumstances and vulnerabilities, he continued. However, the international financial system has used measures not necessarily adapted to those islands' special challenges, and their ecological and economic vulnerabilities. \"This has limited our access to appropriate financing, debt relief and aid,\" he asserted, pointing out that Tonga -- like many of its Pacific neighbours -- has faced natural disasters of unprecedented severity and frequency. All Tongans will forever recall 15 January 2022 when the Hunga-Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted.The explosion was of an intensity so great that some research compares it to the impact of a nuclear explosion, he continued. Plumes of hot gas, ash, and water vapour were projected into the atmosphere, reaching a height of 36 miles. The ensuing tsunami devastated Tonga's economy. Several islands were completely or severely destroyed; people were displaced and then evacuated to neighbouring islands. The volcanic eruption and tsunami cut access to basics for people and cut its communications -- a lifeline for an island nation. The widespread socioeconomic damage and loss of lives is estimated by the World Bank at 36.4 per cent of Tonga's gross domestic product (GDP). In this context, he reiterated his commitment to reduce the risks and the harmful effects of natural disasters, particularly through risk-informed development efforts and enhancing disaster preparedness for effective response.Highlighting that Tonga has one of the world's highest rates of non-communicable diseases, he noted that cardiovascular disease, cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases account for approximately 80 per cent of deaths in Tonga. In that regard, he drew attention to his Government's goal of reducing such deaths by one third by the year 2030. More so, climate change continues to be the single greatest existential threat facing the Blue Pacific. The adverse impacts of climate change make Tonga the third most vulnerable country in the world, he stressed, spotlighting threats to his country's territorial integrity, land, water, health, infrastructure, food security, biological diversity, livelihoods, and ecosystems. Calling for this issue to be a permanent item on the Security Council's agenda, he said that whether it is sea-level rise, loss of territory, or mass migration, this is a trigger for violence and a threat to peace and security.On ocean protection, he underscored the importance of the conservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its resources, as 99 per cent of Tonga's sovereign territory is the ocean. Highlighting his Government's aspiration to fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, he spotlighted the Tonga Ocean Management Plan 2021. Underscoring the threat posed by sea-level rise to the Blue Pacific, he stressed that climate change-induced sea-level rise must not challenge the maritime zones delineated under 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as reflected in the 2021 Declaration on Preserving Maritime Zones in the face of Climate Change-Related Sea-Level Rise.KYRIAKOS MITSOTAKIS, Prime Minister of Greece, said Europeans have stood by Ukraine, equipping it with means to defend itself against the aggressor and imposing punitive sanctions that are beginning to take a toll on the Russian economy. \"It is imperative to send a clear message to other authoritarian leaders that open acts of aggression which violate international law shall not be tolerated by the global community of democratic States,\" he underscored. Noting that the Russian Federation has weaponized its natural resources to cause pain on European societies and destabilize democratically elected European Governments, he said: \"We will support our citizens to cope with high energy prices. We will pool European resources to promote energy efficiency and rapidly diversify away from Russian oil and natural gas. And we will further accelerate the push towards renewable energy.\"Ukraine is not the only country in post-war Europe to have been brutally attacked, he continued, noting that for nearly 50 years, Cypriots have lived on a divided island as the result of an illegal invasion and a military occupation. Ankara and the Turkish-Cypriot leadership continue to insist upon unacceptable demands for a two-State solution and refuse to resume negotiations for an agreed settlement based on successive Security Council resolutions. Voicing support for the Secretary General's efforts to resume negotiations for a mutually acceptable settlement, and the confidence-building measures proposed by Cyprus President Nicos Anastasiades, he said the international community must not ignore illegal Turkish attempts to impose a new fait-accompli on Cyprus, in particular in the fenced area of Varosha, as well as new and repeated violations of Cyprus' maritime zones and airspace. He reaffirmed his openness to dialogue and to the settling of differences in an open, respectful manner, and in accordance with international law.Turkiye has great capacity to play a constructive role, he said, noting its recent efforts that led to a successful brokering of a grain exports deal between Ukraine and the Russian Federation. At the same time, however, Turkiye continues to play a destabilizing role in the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East and the Caucasus, he pointed out, highlighting that it is the only country in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) that is not implementing sanctions against the Russian Federation. Describing the growing intensity of Turkiye's threats against his country, he said Turkish claims over the sovereignty of Greece's islands are baseless and unacceptable. Addressing the Turkish leadership and Turkish people and urging them to move forward in a spirit of cooperation, he said: \"Greece poses no threat to your country. We are not your enemy. We are neighbours. We value the many friendships between ordinary Greeks and Turks.\" Noting that Turkiye has been instrumentalizing migrants since March 2020, he stressed that Greece will continue to protect its borders, with full respect to fundamental rights.Turning to climate change, he said the green transformation sits at the heart of his Government's reform programme and its national climate law aims to mobilize all sectors of the economy for a transition to net zero by 2050. The conversion of a number of Greek islands into green innovation hubs is up and running. Noting its battle to protect cultural heritage, he said that his country, in partnership with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), has launched \"Addressing Climate Change Impacts on Cultural and Natural Heritage\". As the world's leading shipping nation, his country understands the paramount importance of the marine environment's sustainability. For this reason, Greece in 2024 will be hosting the ninth International \"Our Ocean Conference\", building on its ambitious plans to promote sustainable fishing and protect 30 per cent of land and sea by 2030. His country is also taking the lead in making sure that European countries cooperate more effectively in the field of civil protection through the RescEU program.GASTON ALPHONSO BROWNE, Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, recalled that the five victorious nations of the Second World War assigned to themselves permanent Security Council membership, assuming the responsibility to implement the Charter of the United Nations -- both for their own interests and those of the nations that had no option but to trust them. \"The state of today's world does not readily inspire such trust,\" he said, asking on behalf of small countries like his own what happened to the commitments chiselled on the Charter as binding obligations on all. The nations of the world are now gripped with economic instability, the worry of expanded warfare, escalating inflation, food shortages, high prices and increasing debt. However, pointing out that the worst effects are being suffered by \"the poor and powerless, the small and exposed\", he stressed that small nations now felt unprotected by a weakening international legal order that was their first, last and only defence against aggression. Concerted Council action is necessary to prevent major human-rights violations, stop ongoing breaches and address global conflicts and, if this fails to happen urgently, the General Assembly may have to initiate and implement its own global actions.Underscoring that \"peace in the world is not a commodity to be traded\", he said that this observation was also pertinent to the issue of climate change, which poses an existential threat to small island States and countries with low-lying coastlines. Although global warming is universal, its burden falls mostly on the poor in small developing nations, such as Antigua and Barbuda. Urging the General Assembly to act on behalf of the small and powerless in the interest of global justice, he spotlighted a resolution that will be proposed by Vanuatu in the coming months. It will request the International Court of Justice to provide an advisory opinion clarifying the legal obligations of States to protect human rights and environments from climate change, and nations concerned about the ravages of climate change should support the text. He also noted his own country's initiative -- together with Tuvalu and Palau -- to launch the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law, which will seek an opinion from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea regarding State obligations to mitigate the effects of their greenhouse gas emissions.He went on to note that, while small countries \"have talked ourselves hoarse since the 1980s\", promises were repeated year after year that, on the evidence, were meant to \"placate and divert, but not to perform and deliver\". The stage now seems set for the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt to fail, he noted, as the Group of 20 (G20) failed to produce a joint statement on climate change. This sends an ominous signal that, yet again, the Conference will be \"long on words, but very short on deeds\". He underscored, however, that small States would attend the Conference and argue strenuously to establish a new fund for loss and damage response. Further, he insisted that those States most responsible for this dire situation respect their obligations to halt global warming and provide compensation to its victims. Also detailing the devastating effects of climate change on industrialized nations in 2022, he stressed that, even if those Governments remained reluctant to curb emissions for the sake of the most-vulnerable globally, \"they should be motivated by the perils for their own people\".Turning to other international conditions that have unfairly delayed economic development and social progress in small island developing States, he said that the United States' unjust embargo on Cuba is undermining that country's efforts to eliminate poverty and improve living standards. Urging the United States to immediately lift the same, he also said that his country looks forward to normalized relations between the United States and Venezuela. He also pointed out that his country has been denied access to concessional financing due to a single criterion, applied by international financial institutions, that classifies some small island developing States -- like Antigua and Barbuda -- in the same category as the United States, Japan and Germany. This criterion -- per-capita income -- fails to take into account structural limitations such as limited natural resources or the reality that small island developing States are forced to import a large percentage of goods for consumption.He therefore called on the General Assembly to stop penalizing small island developing States for good performance, noting that climate disasters and inability to obtain concessional financing have resulted in high, unsustainable debt for many such States. Underscoring that the international community must change the way in which it responds to small island developing States, he spotlighted the fourth International Conference on Small Island Developing States that his country will host in 2024 and called on all Member States to begin the process of recommitting to small island States to offer lasting solutions to their needs. Adding that the world is now dominated by a conflict in the developed world -- not the developing one -- he called on the parties to the war in Ukraine to end the globally debilitating conflict. Interconnected challenges demanded meaningful international cooperation, he stressed, urging those present to \"turn words into collective action\".MUSTAFA AL-KADHIMI, Prime Minister of Iraq, stated that despite the difficult circumstances, his country employed the \"spirit of hope\" embodied by its people to fight terrorism and defeat it on behalf of the world, adding that his people made enormous sacrifices to liberate their land from Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant/Da'esh (ISIL) and its ideology. He renewed his country's call to continue confronting international terrorism, expressing hope that Iraq will receive further support from the United Nations. He further reiterated its calls for its territories to not be used \"under the pretext of combating terrorism or protecting the national security of other countries in a manner that endangers our security and stability,\" also stressing the need to respect the sovereignty of States.On domestic issues, he stated that despite the success of its past elections supported by the Organization, \"the political forces could not agree on the Government's formation, leading to a political impasse.\" Stressing that his Government is working to build the State and maintain its stature based on coexistence among all its people, he also noted that his country is keen to be a source of stability -- regionally and internationally. For instance, he continued, the Baghdad Conference on Partnership and Cooperation held in August last year witnessed \"remarkable\" participation by its neighbouring countries and resulted in important recommendations.Underscoring that his country is the \"fifth most vulnerable country to climate change,\" he highlighted that it was grappling with a scarcity of water resources due to a change of course of rivers that it shared with neighbouring countries. He called on the countries in the region to enter a dialogue to solve water issues in accordance with international law and treaties. He highlighted Iraq's efforts, as an oil-producing country, to promote clean energy and other areas related to the green economy. Further on domestic issues, he stressed that education and culture remained his country's top priorities and outlined its strategy to upgrade the standards of public and higher education, as well as an initiative to reduce the illiteracy rate in his country.Turning to the situation in the Middle East, he asserted its stance on the \"Palestinian cause and the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,\" continuing to stress the need to preserve the historical status of Jerusalem and its holy sites. On Syria, he expressed support for the political talks between all Syrian parties as well as the efforts by the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General in accordance with relevant Security Council resolutions. \"Iraq believes that regional crises and wars have consequences for all countries of the world, and that that ordinary people always pay the price for these wars,\" he said.ISMAIL SABRI YAAKOB, Prime Minister of Malaysia, expressing concern over the number of worsening and unaddressed challenges, urged the United Nations to establish an international monetary cooperation mechanism to build a more effective and just system for global development. Cooperation and coordination among countries needed to be \"stepped up,\" he elaborated, to achieve economic well-being for all. As policies affect other countries, domestic monetary decisions must adjust for developing countries' realities and needs. He also called for the guarantee of sufficient food resources for all.Reiterating Malaysia's opposition to violations of international law, sovereignty and territorial integrity, he stressed that \"when a conflict erupts, all parties hold the responsibility of easing tension and giving priority to the safety and lives civilians. At the same time, the conflicting parties need to return to the negotiating table to stop the conflict as soon as possible.\" He then registered his disapproval over the isolation of countries from international organizations as a hinderance to multilateralism and dialogue.On the situation in Ukraine, he welcomed the creation of the sea route corridor and warned against the creation of isolation blocks, stressing: \"that will only push the world towards a cold war.\" On the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, he expressed disappointment over the denial of basic rights for the Palestinian people and the violation of international law and Security Council resolution 2334 (2016), saying \"the major powers need to be honest in resolving the issue of cruelty faced by the Palestinian people\". The United Nations should quickly remedy the crisis with the same speed with which the international community responded to the situation in Ukraine, he said, and called upon Israel to stop its apartheid.As a multiracial, multicultural and multi-religious country, Malaysia always supports and strives for peaceful coexistence. Turning to Malaysia's proactive role in remedying crises and conflicts in Southeast Asia, he expressed continued disappointment over the situation in Myanmar and the junta's lack of progress in implementing ASEAN's Five Point Consensus. Commenting that \"some even see the Security Council as having washed its hands of and handing the matter over to ASEAN,\" he underscored the need for a new, redefined framework with a clear timeframe and goal which fulfils the aspirations of the Myanmar people. As Malaysia has accepted nearly 200,000 Rohingya refugees on humanitarian grounds, he called upon parties to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol to accept more refugees. The world must also address the root cause of the crisis. He attributed the lack of progress in resolving conflicts and crises to the Security Council as \"the debility of the global governance system and the [United Nations].\" Advocating for the abolition of the veto, he explained that it \"is most often misused to favour the world powers that have it. It is not democratic and violates the principles of democracy.\"Pointing to Malaysia's losses from climate change in 2021, he reminded countries that climate is a universal problem which affects all. Developed countries must fulfil their annual commitments to provide $100 billion unconditionally. He then called for developing countries to have new, fair, inclusive and affordable technology which facilitates their greener and more sustainable socioeconomic development. Referencing the national measures implemented by Malaysia, he renewed his country's commitment to environmental conservation and sustainability and welcomed the 2023 High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.SHEIKH HASINA, Prime Minister of Bangladesh, said that the Russian Federation-Ukraine conflict has plunged the world further into a grave uncertainty, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities. \"Antagonism like war or economic sanctions, counter-sanctions can never bring good to any nation,\" she added, pointing to mutual dialogue as the means to solve crises and stressing her participation in the United Nations Global Crisis Response Group. Citing Bangladesh's founding father's dictum on foreign policy of \"friendship to all, malice towards none\", she affirmed that her country has been pursuing this principle of non-alignment since its independence and stressed the impact of war on women, children and refugees.Touching on national strategies to counter the effects of the COVID 19 pandemic, she highlighted that Bangladesh is one of the five fastest-growing economies in the world, ranking forty-first in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), and tracked progress in terms of poverty reduction and economy's expansion. However, the Russian Federation-Ukraine war, economic sanctions and counter-sanctions have disrupted the supply chain and led to an exorbitant price hike of fuel, food and consumer goods, causing \"tremendous pressure\" on the economy and inflation, she added. Noting that in 2026, Bangladesh will graduate from the least developed countries category to a developing country, she highlighted goals for 2041 and 2100. She also pointed to significant progress made in areas ranging from education to infant and maternal mortality reduction and the social safety net. The Padma Multi-purpose Bridge, a self-funded asset to road communications system, will facilitate Bangladesh's local and international trade and regional connectivity, foreseeing at least 1.23 per cent growth in national income.During its Presidency of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, Bangladesh launched the Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan to foster climate change resilience, while making policies on natural disaster gender responsive. Further, she reiterated support to other vulnerable countries to develop their own prosperity plans and called on States to promote inclusive climate actions. Noting that migrants continue to face precarious situations in their journeys and are denied their rights, she said the Global Compact on Migration and its Progress Declaration are excellent roadmaps to overcome this situation. Many developing countries need targeted support to tackle the impacts of global crises and bridging the digital divide is a priority. She urged development partners to provide enhanced and tailored support and welcomed the Doha Programme of Action in that regard.After the peaceful settlement of maritime boundaries with the neighbouring countries, Bangladesh is committed to working with global partners for the sustainable use, conservation and management of its marine resources to accelerate its socioeconomic development, including on the basis of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. She also called on Member States to conclude a treaty on marine biodiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Noting Bangladesh's full commitment to complete disarmament and peacekeeping operations, she pointed out it contributes to the highest number of troops and police to United Nations peacekeeping missions. Bangladesh has a zero-tolerance policy on terrorism and violent extremism, \"we do not allow our territory to be used by any party to incite or cause terrorist acts or harm to others\", she said, also pointing to cybercrimes and actions to promote human rights.She reiterated Bangladesh's unequivocal support for a two-State solution based on pre-1967 borders and the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital. She underscored that despite her country's bilateral engagements with Myanmar, \"not a single Rohingya was repatriated to their ancestral homes\" and hoped that the United Nations will play an effective role in this regard. Prolonged presence of the Rohingyas in Bangladesh has caused serious ramifications in her country. \"Cross-border organized crimes including human and drug trafficking are on the rise. This situation can potentially fuel radicalization\" and affect the stability of the entire region, and beyond, she said. Calling for an end to the Russian Federation-Ukraine war, she noted that it puts the lives and livelihoods of the people of all nations in greater risk and infringes their human rights.ANDREJ PLENKOVI, Prime Minister of Croatia, citing the Russian Federation's aggression against Ukraine -- with partial mobilization in effect and sham referenda -- noted that three decades ago, his country was war-ravaged and in jeopardy, facing armed aggression with almost a third of its territory occupied. The Croatian people know what it means to be under attack and what it takes to defend their homeland. Today, it is an exporter of peace and stability, a humanitarian donor worldwide, a popular tourist destination, and produces the fastest electric car in the world. Success was possible, he affirmed, if one was determined and had a vision of the future. Croatia immediately and unequivocally extended support and solidarity to Ukraine -- political, humanitarian, economic and military -- as to do otherwise would be a betrayal of the principles and values its people hold dear. This time around, he noted, Europe and its partners came together to stand up to aggression.While democratic systems are challenged by the fallacious and dangerous thesis that autocracy is ultimately a more efficient and pragmatic way to govern -- and national dialogues are distorted by disinformation, fake news and hybrid attacks -- \"on the cross-road between democracy and autocracy, our choice should remain clear,\" he stressed. The international community must stand united and step up efforts in reorganizing energy supply lines. \"We cannot accept extortion, and we cannot be held hostage over food and energy,\" he stated.Croatia is contributing by its liquefied natural gas terminal on the Adriatic island of Krk -- and beyond ensuring its own needs, is now able to supply its neighbours and other countries in Central Europe. Almost half of the country's electricity production is already coming from renewables. Citing the intolerable imbalance in greenhouse gas emissions -- the richest 1 per cent in the world are responsible for 15 per cent -- he noted his Government was working to alleviate the burden of the energy crisis for households and businesses, schools and hospitals, implementing a national package worth more than 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP).Ahead of the twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Egypt, the international community must strengthen cooperation to find mechanisms and financial resources to fight climate change on national, regional and global levels. He further stated that in the coming months, Croatia would join a group of only 15 other countries that are members of the European Union, NATO, the Eurozone and the Schengen area. Croatia also pays special attention to Southeast Europe, a region still not fully integrated into the European Union.He voiced support for a prosperous and functional Bosnia and Herzegovina, progressing firmly on the path to membership. However, as Bosniak political leaders have publicly admitted they had no true intention to come to a deal over electoral reform in line with the Constitutional Court verdict, the only way forward remains for High Representative Christian Schmidt to use his powers to ensure legitimate representation and equality of Bosnian Croats in the country's institutions. As the least numerous among the constituent peoples, he stated the Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina demand no favours, only equality. On the international scene, \"we must build, protect and defend, and stand up to those who destroy, lie and loot,\" he stressed. As the world witnesses aggression and atrocities on European soil again, and the rule of power threatens to bring the world order down, \"we owe it to future generations to be on the right side of history.\" The international community must foster unity and stand with Ukraine in the fight for its own existence.FIAM NAOMI MATA'AFA, Prime Minister of Samoa, referring to crises such as the war in Ukraine and climate change, stressed that though distanced from the \"centres of conflict\", the escalation in fuel and food prices as well as threats of nuclear weapons have reached her country. \"No one empathizes with the war. Climate is waging a toll on islanders watching their maritime boundaries disappear fast with sea level rise,\" she stated. She further noted that small island developing States face a unique set of vulnerabilities exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, also noting that both the global financial and governance systems are \"desperately in need of reform.\" The multidimensional vulnerability index for small island developing States will allow for the inclusion of more than just income-based criteria to assess eligibility for concessional finance, she stated.Noting that for Pacific communities the main challenge concerning climate change is \"securing action for survival\", she called on all parties to commit to more ambitious nationally determined contributions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Referring to the upcoming twenty-seventh Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, she stressed that the achievement of a 50 50 split between mitigation and adaptation funding was of \"paramount importance\" to Samoa and its neighbouring countries. Describing Goal 14 [Life Under Water] of the Sustainable Development Goals as the \"most underfunded,\" she stressed the need to attract and retain sustainable investment toward it.On peace and security, she noted with concern the \"ongoing geopolitical posturing in our region\" and urged for its national and collective interests to be placed at the forefront. She also expressed concern over the \"serious shortfalls\" in the implementation of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, noting that States with nuclear weapons have spent billions of dollars on modernizing and maintaining their nuclear arsenals, rather than spending on helping victims of past use and testing of nuclear weapons and focusing on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Noting that the proposed monitoring framework for the SAMOA Pathway was a necessary tool for an effective resource allocation and accountability regarding the Goals, she added that outstanding issues relating to the framework must be resolved with urgency.The pandemic and the ensuing lockdowns emphasized the importance of digitalization for small island developing States, she said, adding that investment in digital technologies was key to stimulating business opportunities and increasing productivity and growth in traditional sectors such as agriculture and tourism. She further stressed that the international community should not lose sight of the fact that digitization may end up \"creating disparity between those who can and cannot access and afford these solutions.\"DRITAN ABAZOVI, Prime Minister of Montenegro, pointing out that the world \"walks from one crisis to another\"  from the COVID-19 pandemic to another war -- underscored that his country's position on Russian aggression against Ukraine is simple: \"We stand with the people of Ukraine\". He recalled that his country -- along with others in the region -- knows much about humanitarian and refugee crises, ethnic conflict and the use of military force. However, he stressed that, in the twenty-first century, \"humanity should be smarter\", and that war should not be used to solve political problems. For its part, Montenegro will continue to support Ukraine and follow European Union policy in this regard in its entirety, including sanctions against the Russian Federation. Underlining that this is not a question of economics -- but of principles -- he said that, while today witnesses aggression in Ukraine, tomorrow it could be some other State that is attacked. Montenegro has received 10,000 refugees from Ukraine -- which, given its size, is equal to around 2 per cent of its population -- and it will continue to open its doors to those in trouble. \"They are welcome,\" he said.Turning to another crisis -- that of energy -- he said that, while today this crisis was one of economics, tomorrow it could be one of security. While the war in Ukraine has destabilized the energy market and caused prices to soar, climate change is also stoking this problem. He emphasized the need to solve this issue for future generations, pointing out that his country is the only one that, by its Constitution, is a \"dedicated ecological State\". It seeks to be a green destination -- the water from the river in northern Montenegro is still potable -- and the international community must similarly protect nature, promote green projects and address pollution. This is not just a question for one country and, without international solidarity in this regard, a bigger problem lies ahead.He went on to highlight the importance of transitional justice, recalling past conflict and ethnic strife in the Western Balkans. While Montenegro is trying to build a modern European society, this is impossible without transitional justice. \"There are two types of peace,\" he continued -- negative and positive -- noting that the former is represented by a lack of conflict, but the existence of weak, politicized institutions. Montenegro desires more positive peace in the region, which means establishing independent institutions and combatting organized crime and nationalism. Noting his country's efforts to fight organized crime  which, being transnational in nature, is not only a problem for Montenegro  he detailed Government actions against the smuggling of cigarettes and cocaine. Corruption lies behind the nationalism in the Western Balkans, and fighting it will lead to less tension and more economic progress.On Montenegro's foreign policy, he noted that his country made a good decision to join NATO in 2017, given the crisis currently unfolding. However, he stated that his country's desire to join the European Union was even greater -- emphasizing that Montenegro \"wants to be a part of the big European family\" -- and that it would do everything to achieve this as soon as possible. \"The Western Balkans should not be the black hole of Europe,\" he said, also spotlighting his country's efforts to build bridges in the region. Montenegro desires Serbia and Kosovo to find common agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina to find internal agreement and for all States in the region to be productive. It does not, however, want to be successful while its neighbours are not; rather, the States of the Western Balkans should be successful together.\"Deglobalization is not sustainable,\" he stressed, and the problem of one country can easily become the problem of another. As such, solutions must be found together and, for its part, Montenegro will always be a partner in initiatives to create peace, progress and stability. The international community must work to promote more ethics in global politics and less populism; more concrete action and less rhetoric; and more justice and less support for authoritarian regimes around the world, he said. Also underscoring the need to preserve democracy, he stressed that no one could say \"it's not important for me\", as every voice is needed to advocate for democracy and universal values.TERRENCE DREW, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis, pledged his country's \"unswerving support\" while speaking of the shifting tectonic plates of geopolitics and global stability particularly the pandemic, fragility and vulnerability of global supply chains, reform of the United Nations, advancements in technology, and rise in nationalism. Echoing the words of former Secretary-General Kofi Annan that \"no nation can defend itself against the threats to development entirely on its own,\" he asked the international community: \"do we want to be the body that abdicated our responsibility to protect the planet? Or the body that debates and postures as the world around us submerges beneath cascading crises?\"For small island developing States and vulnerable peoples, he noted there is no international security without climate security and pressed the international community to foster true resilience and risk mitigation by providing tailored responses. He humbly urged countries to honour their financial commitments by doubling their contributions to adaptation financing by 2025, adding that \"a delayed response to these commitments would further imperil our developing nations.\" Climate financing, resiliency and environmental conservation must be integrated into national development policies and must be at the forefront of our global development agenda.\" He joined the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) in calling for the development and adoption of a multi-dimensional vulnerability index which provides special consideration for small island developing States, allows for redistributed development assistance and enables access to concessional financing.In speaking about education as a great equalizer, he welcomed the Transforming Education Summit and reaffirmed his country's commitment to education as a human right and the foundation of sustainable development and thriving societies. Saint Kitts will reform its education system on the basis of equality, access and inclusion and has already decided to introduce free tertiary education for all. It will also incorporate science, technology, engineering, the arts and mathematics specialist spaces in all schools, reintroduce the i-Literacy one-to-one laptop programme and strengthen technical and vocational education through alternative programming and scholarships.Reaffirming that women and youth would continue to be at the forefront of social development, he pledged support for the Declaration of Future Generations and the Summit of the Future. As its leader, he reiterated his country's active commitment to meeting Sustainable Development Goal 5 and surpassing the goals of the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women.Global solidarity, international cooperation and strong and meaningful partnerships continued to be necessary he said, noting \"we are stronger therefore in the company of our friends, particularly those which share our democratic principles and values!\" Recalling the friendship and partnership of Taiwan and Cuba, he re-emphasized his country's support for Taiwan's meaningful participation in the United Nations system and called for the end to the embargo against Cuba.JOHN A. BRICEaO, Prime Minister of Belize, said that while the Russian Federation's illegal, unprovoked attack on Ukraine has \"shaken the foundations of the multilateral system\", the consequential crises the international community faces are not confined to the battlefield in Europe. Democratic norms and human rights are being rolled back, poverty is increasing, climate change is destroying the planet, and international cooperation has been supplanted by nationalism and unilateralism. Further, global food and petroleum prices have reached historic highs, and the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and persistent supply-chain disruptions have contributed to skyrocketing inflation. These realities are exacerbating an already acute social situation in Belize, he said, where poverty has risen an estimated 10 per cent between 2018 and 2021 and an estimated 45 per cent of Belizeans are food insecure.These realities also heighten climate risk, he said, underscoring that his country is \"but one hurricane away from catastrophe\". Spotlighting woefully inadequate climate financing and crisis-level global debt, he called for a bold reimagining of the global financial architecture, rather than a \"tinkering at the edges to conceive of additional programmes that are based on the same false logic\". The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is largely devoid of ways to quantify climate impacts on public debt and countries' capacity to pay, and its obstinate focus on primary balances and debt-to-GDP ratios \"ignores the empirical evidence that nature is in revolt\", he said. The world needs a new financial architecture that is willing and capable to identify systemic threats like debt and climate risk and then devise tools commensurate to the challenge.While noting that Belize reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio from 133 per cent to 108 per cent last year through an innovative debt-for-nature swap -- resulting in over $250 million in debt-service savings -- he said that global forces are nevertheless determined to diminish his country's aspirations for economic rebound. Over the last seven years, financial flows to small island developing States have declined and, paradoxically, those countries most vulnerable to climate change -- and least able to fiscally adapt -- do not qualify for concessionary financing. He therefore called on international financial institutions, multilateral development banks and development partners to use the multidimensional vulnerability index after it is finalized later this year. This will unlock financing for vulnerable countries, supporting their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, adapt to climate change and build resilience. Vulnerable countries also need debt relief, he stressed.Recalling that colonialism transported trillions in plundered wealth to the oppressors, he asked how much longer this new \"climate colonialism\" would punish the victims while sparing the victimizers. In this vein, he also called for the immediate lifting of the embargo on Cuba. Turning to Haiti, he called on the international community to advance a robust, comprehensive programme of support for the people of that country. Also calling for Taiwan to take its rightful place among the community of nations, he stressed that the outdated policy imposed on Taiwan to promote its exclusion must \"yield to the greater good\". Additionally, Belize supports the realization of an independent Palestinian State. Recalling that Belize and Guatemala have been pursuing final resolution of the latter country's claim to Belizean territory before the International Court of Justice, he said that his country continues to count on the international community's support as the judicial process proceeds and, when it concludes, for the demarcation exercise that will be conducted.Small island developing States, he observed, had great expectations for the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. However, rather than world leaders meeting their commitments to deliver $100 billion annually, such States left Glasgow with a finance roadmap. \"Another paper promise,\" he pointed out. Instead of delivering a loss-and-damage mechanism, such States left with more words. \"Let's try this again,\" he urged, calling for less talk and more decisions at the upcoming United Nations Biodiversity Conference in Montreal and the 2022 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Egypt. These must include agreeing on a framework that accounts for the economic costs of biodiversity, along with commitments to close the emissions gap, provide adaptation financing and establish a financing facility to substantively address loss and damage. \"Anything less is a failure,\" he stressed, and small island developing States do not have that option.KAUSEA NATANO, Prime Minister of Tuvalu, said that it was regrettable that the Republic of China (Taiwan), with its notable partnerships on a wide range of development issues, continued to be kept out of the United Nations system, and supported its readmission into the Organization, asking not to sideline the country. He also defined regrettable the ongoing economic blockade of Cuba. Further, he expressed the region's strong concerns of the potential threat of nuclear contamination to the health and security of the Blue Pacific and emphasized that the United Nations decolonization process is critical to the protection of human rights.\"Climate change and its consequential sea level rise, remains the single greatest existential threat my country faces,\" he affirmed, underscoring the urgency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Citing the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report issued last year and its warning that at current global warming trends the international community is destined to miss the Paris Agreement target of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5C, he added: \"This clearly means that Tuvalu will be totally submerged within this century\". Tuvalu could become uninhabitable in the next two to three decades. While other Pacific islands may have a few decades longer, they all face \"the near certainty of terminal inundation\", though their carbon emissions combined amount to less than 0.03 per cent of the world's total. \"The existential threat we face is not of our making, but it will remake us,\" he stressed. \"Tuvalu is an acid test of leadership; because if the international community allow an entire country to disappear from climate change, what hope will be possible for anyone else?\"In many places, water security is severely compromised, he said, pointing out that a rising ocean brings increasing storm frequency, intensity and devastation, and it compromises food security. As the ocean warms and acidifies, the precious coral that supports the region's tourism and nurtures its fish-stock perish and the cost of eking out an existence increases, pushing citizens to leave and the nation becomes increasingly inchoate. \"This is how a Pacific atoll dies. This is how our islands will cease to exist. This is not about some future scenario. It is what we are living with now,\" he said, stressing that there was still space for intervention and that collective inaction would make these sovereign countries uninhabitable.Current international instruments such as the Convention on Statelessness, the United Nations efforts to address climate change, including the twenty-sixth session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \"say nothing\" on the looming uninhabitability of these States. On 22 September, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands launched the Rising Nations Initiative to foster awareness, legal framework and political commitment. Stressing that \"this is about sovereignty, dignity, and integrity\", he underlined the need for a global settlement to guarantee the permanent existence of island States, which must co-create and enact it together.Such a settlement includes the protection of the island States' rights to their land and ocean, safeguards their heritage and the relocation of its people. \"We do not seek to move out of our homeland. We seek fair and amicable treatment of displaced people so we do not become a burden,\" he added, asking they be not \"fobbed off with a wasteland\". While Tuvalu can continue to support itself economically, \"a situation globally caused must also have a globally just and equitable solution\", he concluded, stressing that through no fault of their own, the Pacific peoples would soon have to abandon the oceans and urging for generosity of spirit, support, and justice that recognized their reality and grave concern on the potential eradication of their atoll nations.ABDULLA SHAHID, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Maldives, in pressing the Assembly to reflect on a more just, resilient world, called for countries to address the climate. For small island developing States, he explained, \"the difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is death.\" Recalling Maldives' work on Human Rights Council resolution 7/23 of 2008, he reaffirmed his country's continued advocacy for and leadership on a rights-based approach to climate action and announced Maldives' candidacy for a Human Rights Council seat from 2023 to 2025. If elected, Maldives will prioritize addressing climate change as an integral part of global human rights discourse. At the national level, Maldives launched the Glasgow-Sharm el-Sheikh work programme on the global goal on adaptation this year and will continue to pursue net-zero by 2030. It also supports the global initiative to protect 30 per cent of the world's oceans by 2030. For countries to address the climate crisis, there must be sustainable, reliable financing. Reminding partners of their pledges during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen and the agreements of the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact, he urged partners to redouble adaptation finance, make access easier for all and make financing assessments fairer by utilizing alternative measures to GDP. Maldives looks forward to the swift implementation of the Multidimensional Vulnerability Index.Gender equality, he continued, must be at the forefront of the global agenda and stated \"this injustice cannot continue. We cannot solve the challenges facing all of humanity while half of humanity is denied their full potential.\" As women deserve an equal seat at the table, Maldives has allocated 33 per cent of its local council seats to women, appointed women as Supreme Court Justices and has half of its ambassadors as women. In calling upon the international community to work harder in stopping conflicts and flagrant violations of international norms, he pleaded \"the people of Ukraine, Afghanistan, Myanmar, among other countries plunged into conflict and bloodshed, deserve peace. They deserve an end to the ongoing tragedies upending their lives. As do the people of Palestine.\" He reiterated Maldives' position of a two-State solution based on pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine as the only meaningful solution for peace. In advocating for addressing terrorism as a priority, he condemned terrorism in all its forms and confirmed Maldives' commitment to combatting terrorism and violent ideologies.Pointing out that \"[the world] cannot apply old solutions to new challenges\", he called for a reform of the multilateral system to better equip the United Nations in meeting contemporary and future challenges. He welcomed the resolution to establish the United Nations Youth Office and committed to constructive follow up on the Secretary-General's Our Common Agenda report. The Security Council, he continued, must increase the number of permanent and non-permanent seats and ensure equitable geographic representation. In welcoming the recent adoption of the veto initiative, he then expressed support for increasing the substantial role and moral authority of the General Assembly.PENELOPE WONG, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Australia, noted her country is home to people from over 300 different ancestries and to the oldest continuous culture on the planet. The Parliament she serves in is enriched by diversity, with a Government determined to make real progress on the national journey of healing with Indigenous Australians, the First Peoples of that continent. She cited Senator Patrick Dodson, the \"Father of Reconciliation\", a Yawuru man from the remote north-west, tasked with responding to a call from First Nations people for a constitutionally enshrined voice to the Australian Parliament, as well as treaty and truth-telling. She further noted the ambition of an Australian who helped shape the United Nations Charter, former foreign minister and the third President of the Assembly, Herbert Evatt. At the 1945 San Francisco Conference, Mr. Evatt challenged the great powers who wanted a strong Security Council that had control over the Assembly. He did not succeed in his fight against the great powers' veto within the Council, but he did ensure that the Assembly has the ability to decide its own course -- understanding that small- and medium-sized countries must be able to maintain their sovereign choices, protected by a stable framework of rules.She expressed alarm that for the first time, the United Nations Human Development Index had declined for two consecutive years, in 2020 and 2021, with nearly half a billion women and girls now living in extreme poverty. Further, over 800 million people go to bed hungry every night, 345 million people face acute food insecurity and 50 million people across 45 countries are on the brink of famine -- a growing scale of human suffering that threatens untold global instability. Australia is therefore increasing its contribution to development assistance by over $1 billion. Turning to the environment, she noted that the world has experienced disasters and conflict in the past, but the intensity and confluence of today's challenges are without precedent. Within this decade, 83 per cent of Australia's energy supply will be renewable and \"Australia will be a renewable energy superpower,\" she said. The country is increasing its official development assistance (ODA) to the Pacific by over half a billion dollars, and an additional $470 million in development assistance in the Indo-Pacific.The world cannot accept a situation where large countries determine the fate of smaller countries, she affirmed -- which is why the Russian Federation's illegal, immoral invasion of Ukraine cannot be normalized or minimized. It is an assertion that a larger country is entitled to subjugate a smaller neighbour, to decide whether another country can even exist. Council veto power was never intended to be used to enable unchecked abuse of the Charter -- by the very countries that were given that veto. Aside from terrible damage and loss of life in Ukraine, the invasion is propelling the global crisis in food and energy security, she said \"small- and medium-sized nations like my own: we are more than just supporting players in a grand drama of global geopolitics, on a stage dominated by great powers.\" Her delegation therefore seeks Council reform, with greater permanent representation for Africa, Latin America, and Asia, including India and Japan. History teaches that \"the alternative to what we have built here is conflict and chaos,\" she stated. Humanity has benefited from the multilateral system -- from the rules that have underpinned an unequalled period of human development. \"Humanity will pay the price if we allow it to flounder,\" she stressed.SIMEa\\x93N OYONO ESONO ANGUE, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Equatorial Guinea, speaking on behalf of the country's President Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, noted that traditional conflicts and emerging challenges such as transnational crime, cybersecurity, biosecurity, climate change and piracy are increasingly prominent, urging countries immersed in current conflicts and all Governments that are directly or indirectly involved to prioritize dialogue and inclusive negotiations in a realistic, pragmatic way. The African continent must remain a priority, he stressed, with financial commitments for Sustainable Development, along with financial support for peacekeeping to deal with terrorism, emigration, human trafficking, piracy and mercenaries. The Heads of State and Government of the African Union held an extraordinary summit last May and a donors' roundtable to provide the support necessary to face the current humanitarian challenges facing Africa, exacerbated by the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic and disasters across the continent. In that context, he welcomed the initiative for global security presented by China.His country is committed to promoting human rights with a wide range of national strategies and regulations. Reiterating the need to reform the United Nations system, he specified the Council, whose structure represents one of the great injustices within Organization. For more than 15 years, Africa has demanded that reform, assigning two permanent seats and two additional non-permanent seats in the Council. He further called for the commercial, economic and financial embargo imposed against Cuba six decades ago to be lifted once and for all, as the country \"deserves the opportunity to play its part on the world stage as a sovereign country\".Central Africa remains deeply concerned by the persistent crisis caused by maritime piracy activities in the Gulf of Guinea, whose perpetrators are increasingly acquiring more sophisticated methods that allow them greater autonomy in the open sea, threatening the subregion. Welcoming the recent resolution adopted by the Council urging the countries of the Gulf of Guinea to criminalize piracy and armed robbery at sea according to their national laws, he further called on them to investigate, prosecute or extradite the perpetrators of such crimes and those who incite, finance or facilitate them. He called for a summit on the Gulf of Guinea, as has been done with the Gulf of Aden, to devise a strategy to stop all terrorist activities and attempts to threaten regional and international peace and security.DOMINIQUE HASLER, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Liechtenstein, stressed that the act of aggression against Ukraine, which has been carried out with \"complete disregard for the most basic rules of international law\", is a test to the international community's resolve to stand up for the international order. Underscoring the importance of holding the political and military leaders that initiated the aggression criminally accountable, she noted that addressing the crime of aggression is a powerful deterrent which helps defend the international order reflected in the Charter of the United Nations.While affirming that the Organization has played a critical role in the current global challenges in humanitarian assistance, global public health, nuclear safety or food security, she said it \"continues to disappoint,\" especially in the maintenance of peace and security. Recalling the veto initiative, which her country put forward to the Assembly and was adopted earlier this year, she underscored her country's commitment to being part of the change required to have the Organization at the centre of this cause. \"The veto, indeed, is no longer the last word,\" she said. Highlighting that the international community had witnessed how impunity has led to even more serious atrocities and to crimes against humanity in countries such as Myanmar and Syria, she stressed that the war in Ukraine was the most recent illustration of this pattern. She emphasized that this was an opportunity to support an International Criminal Court that does its work independently, across the globe, and fully in line with its founding treaty -- the Rome Statute.Turning to climate change, while stating that progress in the negotiations on this issue has been insufficient, she stressed that collective action through the framework of the Conference of the Parties remains instrumental. She said her country is open to working with States that are also contemplating legal avenues to fight climate change. \"Protecting the planet and saving the livelihoods of future generations are the biggest challenges of our time, and the ultimate test of our ability to be truly 'United Nations',\" she added.ROBERT DUSSEY, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Regional Integration and Togolese Abroad for Togo, said that Africa has become the sanctuary of terrorist groups, as threats long confined to the Sahel spilled over into the western part of the continent. That is why his country's President continues to invest and mediate for peace, especially to end the crisis between Ca'te d'Ivoire and Mali. Pointing to the recent terrorist attacks in the north of Togo, he added that the use of sophisticated means by the jihadists was a great concern to his delegation, welcoming the consensual adoption of the annual progress report of the Working Group on Digitalization in the context on international and national security and reaffirming its determination to drive criminals out of Togo's borders. Highlighting his country's commitment to address cyberthreats, he welcomed efforts by the ad hoc committee for elaborating a comprehensive convention on countering the use of information and communications technology for criminal purposes and encouraged all stakeholders to establish this legal instrument. Also on security, he affirmed the \"important need to fully revise our Organization and spare no effort to achieve reform of the Security Council\".Turning to the environment, he said: \"It is all the more concerning that climate change indiscriminately affects all countries, including non-polluting countries like Togo\". He pointed to a series of programmes and commitments undertaken by his Government to build resilience, the sustainable management of his country's resources, protect the ecosystem, combat desertification, and promote reforestation and clean energy. Other mechanisms have been established to address other challenges, ranging from social protection to end's discrimination against women and gender-based violence, including by fostering empowerment.On Security Council reform, he asked States to work to make the body more reflective of present-day realities, which have changed profoundly since 1945. Reiterating the need for the continent to secure two permanent seats in addition to two non-permanent seats for African States, he noted the reluctance of certain permanent Council members, indicating that some countries see Africa as \"a purely instrumental entity for the services of their causes\". When a resolution is under discussion, then Africa is \"subject to pressure by both sides\". As the continent increasingly speaks in a single voice, he emphasized that many African countries were no longer bound by colonial history and were keen to work with new partners, which should shift their approach. \"Africa expects more equality, respect, equity and justice in its relations and partnerships with other powers, regardless of who they may be,\" he stressed.AWATIF ALTIDJANI AHMED KOIBORO, Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Chad, while stating that humankind is experiencing numerous unprecedented challenges, emphasized that the international community needed to continue to promote and strengthen multilateralism, which has real impact on peoples' lives -- particularly in poor countries -- and not a \"sham multilateralism\" that boils down to hollow statements. She underscored that any trend toward reducing ODA or other economic and financial initiatives is counterproductive, because it would risk further worsening the crises around the world. Noting that debt continues to be too heavy a burden for developing countries, she reiterated her country's support for appeals and initiatives to cancel or restructure debt for such countries.On domestic issues, emphasizing that Chad's political transition process since April 2021 is making satisfactory headway, she added that its Inclusive and Sovereign National Dialogue should lead to democratic, free and transparent elections. All of Chad and its society was being represented in the Dialogue, she said, calling it a historic opportunity for Chadians to make decisions on reforms with full sovereignty. The security situation in the Sahel is \"just as worrisome as ever,\" and continues to worsen due to institutional changes, climate change, a breakdown in military arrangements to tackle terrorist threats, unchecked illegal migration, and uncurbed forms of illegal trafficking. She further stressed that terrorist activities in the Sahel are spreading to neighbouring regions such as West Africa and the Horn of Africa. In this regard, while welcoming the initiative of the United Nations and the African Union to conduct a joint strategic assessment in partnership with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and the Group of Five for the Sahel (G5 Sahel), she expressed regret over Mali's recent withdrawal from G5 Sahel. \"We will not be able to defeat terrorism without a common fight and without pooling our resources,\" she added.Concerning the situation in Libya, while noting that she is worried about that country's political deadlock which led to the confrontations in Tripoli in August, she urged its political actors to favour dialogue to save the peace process and to implement the electoral calendar to which they had agreed. She encouraged the international community, particularly the United Nations and the African Union, to foster political dialogue conducted by people in Libya. On Cuba, she called for lifting of sanctions imposed by the United States, which continues to weigh heavily on its population. Turning to the Security Council reform, she urged Member States to move from rhetoric to action, in order to make this reform a reality and correct the historical injustice toward the African continent.Right of ReplyThe representative of India, speaking in exercise of the right of reply to \"the false accusations\" by Pakistan, expressed regret over the misuse of the United Nations platform to obfuscate misdeeds in Pakistan and justify unacceptable actions against India. A polity claiming peace, he noted, would never sponsor cross-border terrorism, shelter planners of the Mumbai terrorist attack, make unjustified territorial claims, covet their lands and seek illegal integration.Adding that the false claims also concern human rights, minority rights and basic decencies, he questioned the mindset underlying the abduction of young women from minority communities. While the desire for peace, security and progress on the Indian subcontinent is real and widely shared, he continued, it can only be realized when cross-border terrorism ceases, Governments \"come clean with the international community and with their own people\", minorities are not persecuted and these realities are recognized before the Assembly.The representative of Turkiye, responding to the statement made by Greece's representative, said that the same was yet another example of distorted facts and a hostile narrative against his country. Turkiye supports sanctions mandated by the Security Council, and it is a double standard for Greece to make accusations while it circumvents other sanctions through the practice of tanker-to-tanker oil-transfer operations. Stressing that his country does not challenge Greece's territorial integrity, he called on that country to participate in meaningful dialogue to address all legal disputes concerning the Aegean Sea. Current negative bilateral relations between the two countries results from Greece's deliberate choice of provocative action and escalatory rhetoric over cooperation and good neighbourliness. He went on to note that Greece's degrading treatment of migrants in the Aegean Sea is well-documented, urging that country to cease its inhumane pushback practices. He added that Turkiye would continue to support the Cypriot people in their inherent right to sovereign equality and equal international status.The representative of Pakistan, responding to the statement made by India's delegate, drew attention to the reality of state-sponsored terrorism experienced by the people in Jammu and Kashmir. India was a sponsor and perpetrator of terrorism and aggression, she said, citing unilateral, illegal and oppressive actions which include extrajudicial killings, artificial demographic change, gerrymandered elections and curtailed religious freedom, media and Internet. Last year presented concrete evidence of massive human rights violations, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide being perpetrated by Indian occupation forces with impunity, she said, expressing fear that the discoveries since 1989 were only \"but the tip of the iceberg.\"She referenced two reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and the description by several special procedures and mandate holders of the human rights situation as a \"freefall.\" Noting India's \"witch hunt\" against those who report crimes, she called upon that country to grant human rights mechanisms access to the occupied territories, accept a United Nations inquiry commission and implement the relevant Security Council resolutions on the right to self-determination for the people of Kashmir. The pandemic of Islamophobia, she said, has \"penetrated into the very foundation of the Indian state\" and pointed to the persecution of other minorities including Christians, Sikhs and Dalits. Emphasizing that the will and courage of the Kashmiri people cannot be broken, she urged India to \"reflect upon the deeply troubling trajectory their state has embarked upon rather than deploying weapons of mass disinformation against Pakistan.\"</p><p>Source: UN General Assembly</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG25092022017351</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66G9-FS31-F00C-619J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"23298\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 25, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

We believe that if the G7 Summit this year can produce actions and commitments in these two areas, it will send a very powerful signal to the world that the G7 is back.</p><p>On health, we have one immediate task and one medium- to long-term task. The immediate task is to address the serious gap in the distribution of vaccines between developed and developing countries. It is understandable that each government wants to take care of its own citizens first, but we must also keep in mind that nobody is safe until everyone is safe. So, we first have to make sure that we can substantially increase the supply of vaccines and then help developing countries acquire them.</p><p>In the medium- to long-term, we have to find ways to strengthen international health systems so that we can better prepare for and respond to future pandemics. We will have to strengthen the World Health Organization. We will also have to establish effective partnerships among governments, international organizations, private businesses and academia so that we can develop critical strategies to manage and prepare for future pandemics.</p><p>On climate change, I don't have to stress enough the importance of this issue. And the hosting country of this year's G7 Summit, the U.K., has set out ambitious goals on climate change, including securing the commitment for net zero emissions by 2050 and substantially increasing climate finance. We welcome this ambitious goals.</p><p>At the Leaders Summit on Climate in April, President Moon made a pledge to submit an updated plan for substantial greenhouse gas reduction before the end of this year. And he also pledged that we will stop public financing for overseas coal power plant projects.</p><p>With regard to the potential difficulties achieving the net zero goal by 2050, there are some experts who are not very optimistic about the prospects, but there are other groups of experts who believe that with the development of technology, it is not entirely impossible. Let's remind ourselves that only a few years back, automated driving without human driver and 100 percent electric-powered vehicle was seen as a dream for distant future. Now, they are very close to our everyday life. We cannot rule out the possibility that we will have very rapid development in technology that can help us achieve the goal of net zero emissions by 2050. The pace of technological development in many areas indeed encouraged us to think optimistically.</p><p>The government is now developing a couple of detailed scenarios, in which we can achieve our net zero commitment by 2050. And these scenarios will be finalized before the end of this year.</p><p>We also welcome the U.K.'s plans to discuss ways to cope with threats to democracy at the June summit. We agreed that it is important for leading democracies to issue a unified message supporting human rights, fundamental freedoms and economic openness as well as the rules-based multilateral system. With political commitment and close cooperation, we will be able to have a very productive G7 Summit. And if we can do that, it will represent a turning point for multilateralism.</p><p>Threats to open societies and democracy do not just come from a certain area or country. They come from across the globe and by focusing too much on a specific area, we may risk losing sight of threats coming from other parts of the world. We also have threats to democracy coming from within our own societies such as rising inequality, racism, extremism and decreasing tolerance toward differences.</p><p>The G7 is a group of leading economies and it does not intend to reach an agreement among themselves that they will impose on other countries and it cannot. But what it can do is set ambitious goals for themselves and hope that the other countries to follow suit.</p><p>India calls for developed countries to take more responsibilities</p><p>Indian Ambassador to Korea Sripriya Ranganathan / Korea Times photo by Choi Won-sukWe are pleased to get the invitation from the U.K. in the upcoming G7-plus Summit and it is a great pleasure to have this opportunity to share what we see of this upcoming Summit and to also hear other guest countries' perspectives on what they are perceiving as the likely outcomes and the takeaways from this gathering.</p><p>I think that there are some very fundamental challenges that you face today and some of these have been identified by the U.K. presidency as top priority in terms of what could be the agenda for the G7 meeting. These are climate change, handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and what do we need to do, as fellow open societies, to advance the cause of democracy across the world.</p><p>What can we do to address this COVID-19 challenge? None of us is safe until all of us are safe, and I think this is a very clear perspective we have in India. We would be very keen to see what we can do to forge cooperation, bring genuine solidarity and bring about science-based approaches in dealing with this pandemic.</p><p>Vaccine development is one such area where I think we all need to join and genome sequencing is one area where there is a lot of scope for us to work together. We welcome the U.K.'s spotlight on the theme of protecting people's health and strengthening resilience during its presidency.</p><p>We are seeking the support of all G7 countries to the proposal that India and South Africa have together advanced to the WTO for a waiver from certain provisions of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPs) agreement, so that we will be able to enable COVID-19 vaccine access to countries around the world. This will be one of goals from the conversations at the summit.</p><p>We believe that the G7 countries are after all the richest and the most technologically and scientifically advanced countries of the world and they must demonstrate leadership in this issue and resist the tendency of vaccine nationalism, cornering the supply of vaccines for their own nationals which they must share with countries and peoples around the world.</p><p>We support the U.K.'s efforts to steer the agenda on climate change and climate action, in which we have a lot of interest and desire to contribute to. As many other things, including climate change, cannot be tackled in silos. We need to join hands and work together to achieve our goals.</p><p>Developed countries need to contain their emissions and provide that carbon space to developing countries so that they are able to bring about the sustainable development of their economies and bring up the people to a more acceptable level of development so that the equitable justice can be brought about.</p><p>In this context, we wholeheartedly welcome the U.K.'s call to the G7 and other developed countries to meet the legally binding commitments under the Paris Agreement and to meet the target of $100 million annually for climate financing. I think the G7 consensus on fresh commitments on climate finance and technology transfer, consistent with common but differentiated responsibilities, will be a big step forward.</p><p>As to what we have done in India, we are the only G20 country that is on track to achieve our Paris Agreement commitments and we have achieved a critical percentage reduction in emission intensity over the period between 2005 and 2016.</p><p>Another agenda that has been identified by the U.K. presidency is inclusive economic recovery. We would welcome the efforts of the G7 and its outreach partners to defend and promote economic openness that is anchored around a free and open trading system governed by international rules and standards.</p><p>The U.K. presidency has also come up with an open society statement in which India is very actively engaged. We have shared values of democracy, protection of human rights, freedom of expression, belief in a strong, inclusive, pluralist way of life. And we see the value of dialogue with like-minded countries to check the rate of threats that has been posed to all of us by rising vandalism, terrorism, violent extremism and economic coercion. We will be working with our partners to defend and promote our shared values. A strong and visionary statement emanating from the G7-plus Summit in this context, we believe, would be a very powerful message.</p><p>Australia shows effort in gender equality, women's empowerment</p><p>Australian Ambassador to Korea Catherine Raper / Korea Times photo by Choi Won-sukAustralia is honored to be a guest at the 2021 G7 Summit in Cornwall, alongside India, the Republic of Korea and South Africa. We appreciate the U.K.'s invitation and with our fellow outreach partners, look forward to bringing our Indo-Pacific perspective to these very important discussions because we feel that is a contribution that Australia can make.</p><p>We do see that Australia and the G7 share a great deal of common ground on issues like our approach to the COVID-19 crisis, the need for equitable distribution of vaccines, gender equality and women's empowerment, and defending the rules-based international order from which we have all benefitted.</p><p>The response to a pandemic that does not respect borders has underlined, most profoundly, that institutions and forums like the G7 alongside those such as the G20, the WHO, the WTO and the OECD really do matter. And the Cornwall summit is an opportunity for the G7 and outreach partners to reaffirm our shared values as open democratic societies, and identify ways that we can strengthen cooperation in many areas of shared interest.</p><p>As liberal democracies, our collective leadership truly can guide the global economic recovery and drive genuine progress on the defining strategic issues of our time. So we're looking forward to capitalizing on these opportunities to promote and defend our shared interests and values, and to continue to shape international rules and norms for the benefit of all.</p><p>With our partners in the G7, and more broadly, we are working to ensure that our collective strategic interests are protected against those that seek to do us harm. This includes maintaining an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific, underpinned by the rule of law and respect for sovereignty.</p><p>In regards to Australia's support for an open, inclusive and prosperous Indo-Pacific, we're very much about bringing that discussion to the G7. We see that our environment and the regional environment has become increasingly challenging and the geostrategic challenges have grown much in recent years.</p><p>Alongside fellow guest countries, also from this region, we came to have a discussion about what we can do to support the type of region that we want. That's based on freedom of choice and sovereignty, based on international law and respect for rules and norms, and ensuring countries can pursue their own interests and choices.</p><p>We see many opportunities for other like-minded countries in the region to work on issues of common interest. For example, we see a lot of synergy between the approaches that Australia takes to the region and Korea's New Southern Policy. So we are exploring the synergy of common elements so that they can be pulling in the same direction to achieve good outcomes for the region.</p><p>Turning to gender issues, Australia will be a clear voice in Cornwall on the need to address gender equality and women's empowerment issues. We want to see real progress, including addressing the disproportionate effects of the pandemic on women.</p><p>Australia led the way at the G20 Summit in Brisbane a few years ago to secure a commitment to reduce the gap between women's and men's workforce participation by 2025 and will continue to push for its achievement in the G20 context as well as the G7 context.</p><p>Turning to climate, Australia will also continue to advocate a productive outcome at COP26 and an ambitious climate agenda that puts technological solutions and R&amp;D at the heart of our pathway to reach net zero emissions.</p><p>Reducing emissions, while maintaining economic growth, is one of the defining challenges of our time. Getting low-emissions technologies to technical and commercial parity will make achieving net zero practically possible.</p><p>The G7's focus on climate adaptation and resilience is important to us as well, especially following the devastating bushfires, cyclones and floods Australians have endured in recent years.</p><p>We look forward to working with the G7 and fellow outreach partners to identify opportunities for coordinated, practical action to deliver results that advance our ambitious global agenda.</p><p>It is all about collaboration and coordinated action. We can make a huge impact working together.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62VY-THS1-JCBN-52DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2176\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 7, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>International Trade Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Trade Agreements</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkMzNkQyQzU0NEIxNDQ2MUE1MTlEQTA4MjFEQ0UyQzA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTRDNDkyQ0UwRkRGNEQ0MjgwNzM2NzI3NjlGODE0ODk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Many agreed that, like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change consequences are disproportionately affecting women and girls. Round table discussions continued from the session's opening day on 14 March on the same themes: climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes -- advancing gender equality through holistic and integrated actions from global to local; and on women's voice and agency -- good practices towards achieving women's full, equal and meaningful participation and decision-making in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes. (For details, see Press Release WOM/2213.)</p><p>During the general discussion in the afternoon, Rosy Akbar, Fiji's Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said climate finance often fails to take account of gender equality and women's empowerment. To remedy this, she called on the international community to increase gender-responsive climate, environmental and disaster risk finance. She also called for efforts to promote women's full participation and leadership in climate, environment, ocean, biodiversity and disaster-risk-reduction action, and to strengthen their capacities through accessible training and gender-responsive policies and programmes.</p><p>In the same vein, Vindhya Persaud, Guyana's Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co-operative Republic, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), reiterated disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met. Stressing that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States, she said its impact represents a \"code red for humanity\". Moving forward, a gender perspective must be part of building climate resilience and designing and implementing disaster-risk-reduction strategies and recovery plans. In addition, climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities must include measures that support women-owned enterprises in the green and blue economies, she said, also calling for investment in gathering gender specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate.</p><p>On behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Patricia Kaliati, Malawi's Minister for Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, agreed that the current situation calls for action, as women make up the poorest and most vulnerable groups in her region. Reasons stem from their general subordinate legal status and limited access to such critical resources as land, technology, credit, education and housing, she said, pointing to several ongoing efforts to help to address these challenges. For its part, SADC integrated gender and climate change into its Protocol on Gender and Development in 2016. This means State parties should, by 2030, develop policies, strategies, and programmes to address the gender issues in climate change, conduct research to assess the differential gendered impacts of climate change and adopt effective mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>Youth representative Antonette Ncube, from the European Union delegation, in its capacity as an observer, spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls when she presented several recommendations. Underscoring a need to improve data and strengthen capacity building, she encouraged stakeholders to pursue the ethical collection and dissemination of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and gender statistics on all dimensions of environmental, disaster risk reduction and climate change issues, and sexual and gender-based violence. She also recommended that stakeholders ensure the gender-responsive implementation of international commitments made in such instruments as the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Calling for concerted efforts to address gender-based violence and the disproportionate impact of climate crises and disasters on women and girls, she expected the Commission to adopt strong and action-oriented conclusions.</p><p>Some speakers shone a spotlight on the importance of remembering the most vulnerable groups of women when aiming at inclusive responses. The representative of Chile, speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Older Persons, said those often overlooked must urgently be considered. Older persons -- and even more so older women -- remain largely invisible and disregarded in the development of policies and programmes. To change this, he urged United Nations agencies, and particularly the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), to systematically collect and disaggregate data by age and gender, particularly of women beyond their reproductive years.</p><p>Marta Lucia Ramirez, Vice President of Colombia, declared that, when women arrive in positions of power, they must remember to open more spaces for others \"just as those who came before did for us\". Half the world's population has historically been excluded from power, but gender equality is essential for generating sustainable economic growth, she said, highlighting Colombia's five point national policy to support women's inclusion -- from the business sector to peace and security. Colombia also launched the world's first sovereign gender bond to help women-owned businesses recover from the widespread economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing attention to the situation of women in conflict affected zones in Afghanistan to Ukraine, she said the international community must always call for the dignity and rights of women and must remember that these and other conflicts are a result of wars \"always declared by men\".</p><p>lso delivering statements during the general discussion were Iran, Iceland, Uzbekistan, Serbia, Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, Republic of Korea, Austria, Sweden, Liechtenstein, Finland, New Zealand, France, Kazakhstan, Germany, Jordan, Ireland, Oman, Portugal, Israel, Trinidad and Tobago, and Luxembourg.</p><p>The representative of the Russian Federation spoke in exercise of the right of reply.</p><p>The Commission on the Status of Women will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 March, to continue its work.</p><p>Ministerial Round Table III</p><p>In the morning, the Commission held a ministerial round table discussion on the theme \"Climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes: advancing gender equality through holistic and integrated actions from global to local\".</p><p>Ministers and senior officials of Member States exchanged views on how Governments are working towards advancing gender perspectives into national policies and programmes. Discussing concerns about such pressing challenges as drought and gender inclusion in related mitigation efforts, delegates presented a broad range of national examples, from cash grants to training for women in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. They also highlighted gender-responsive policies and needs for improvement in such areas as financing.</p><p>HYE RYOUNG SONG (Republic of Korea), Vice-Chair designate (Asia and Pacific States Group), opened the round table, sharing some of her country's actions. Among them are targeted initiatives that led various ministries to draft recommendations related to the gender aspects of climate change. Emphasizing the importance for partners to respond to the climate crisis in a sustainable, inclusive manner, she encouraged delegates to have a fruitful round table.</p><p>VINDHYA PERSAUD, Minister for Human Services and Social Security of Guyana, cited several national achievements, including the Low Carbon Development Strategy. Launched in 2009, the Strategy seeks to transform the economy while combating climate change and promoting the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in key economic sectors through micro-, small enterprise and entrepreneurial projects and job opportunities. Women were awarded 62 per cent of low-carbon cash grants and were trained in climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forestry and business development. With the second highest percentage of forest cover in the world, Guyana secured climate financing for the Amerindian Development Fund, which benefitted 180 communities and strengthened village economies, providing hundreds of jobs for indigenous women. Climate financing is currently bridging the ICT divide for hinterland women and girls with the provision of laptops and the creation of hubs powered by solar-energy systems, transforming the way in which they access Government and social services. In addition, Guyanese women are leading in climate action and advocacy and have pioneered solutions to protect the country's valuable ecosystem.</p><p>ROSY AKBAR, Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation of Fiji, highlighted significant strides in developing coherent legislative and policy frameworks in the context of gender, environment and disaster risk reduction. The National Climate Change Policy (20182030) and the 2021 Climate Change Act endorse the principles of gender equality and women's empowerment while recognizing women as agents of change. Gender mainstreaming mandates extend to all programmes of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2020-2024) while the Green Growth Framework identifies gender equality as key indicators of social development. The National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy establishes \"human rights and gender-based approaches\" as one of its eight guiding principles, in line with Fiji's commitment to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the gender action plan of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Initiatives related to combating gender based violence in times of disaster responses are among other ongoing efforts to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable groups, including women and girls in all diversity, are met, she said.</p><p>NAREK MKRTCHYAN, Minister for Labour and Social Affairs of Armenia, presented several ongoing initiatives in line with his country's commitments to such global efforts as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Armenia's disaster management strategy outlines a series of sector-targeted actions for preparedness, response and risk reduction from national to local levels while also recognizing the need to increase women's representation in such activities. The Government prioritizes mainstreaming gender equality in all its projects dedicated to environmental sustainability, resilience-building, climate change adaptation and crisis mitigation. The Gender Policy Implementation Strategy sets the Government's priorities for women's equal participation in all spheres of public life, including: preventing the feminization of poverty in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; involving rural women in combating climate change problems; strengthening cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organizations in the field of environmental and disaster risk management; and reducing of the impact of pandemics, in particular COVID-19.</p><p>NDEYE SALY DIOP DIENG, Minister for Women, Family and Gender of Senegal, said climate change is the biggest challenge, leading to land degradation, drought and other major problems. Indeed, decreases in soil fertility and other side effects have a negative impact on women while also triggering an estimated economic loss of 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the agriculture sector. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that more than 3 million people live in areas that are extremely vulnerable to climate change, alongside expert projections that envision 1 billion people facing climate change threats by 2050. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects that Africa will lose two thirds of its arable land by 2025. These challenges have a human cost, she said, emphasizing that women in rural communities are being affected. Local production, from fishing to forestry, has also felt the impact. Senegal's analysis and assessments demonstrate the scope of these climate consequences, which could possibly limit women's access to arable land. Efforts include strengthening initiatives from the global to local levels, including promoting a green economy transition, which Senegal supports, she said, adding that funding must be increased for such endeavours.</p><p>MATEJA RIBIC, State Secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities of Slovenia, said her \"green\" country has a wealth of natural resources and rich biodiversity, yet recognizes the immediate need to address paramount climate change and sustainable development challenges. Slovenia's new climate change strategy aims at fostering a society adapted and resilient to climate change impacts and is characterized by a high quality of life and a high degree of safety. Fully aware of strong links among biodiversity, climate change, food security and water, she also noted the well-established interlinkages among human rights, environmental degradation and climate change, which affect millions of people, especially women and girls across the world. Welcoming the Human Rights Council's recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, she said Slovenia strongly supports women's empowerment in the context of foreign policy priorities, with gender equality and environmental protection being a cross-cutting issue for development cooperation and humanitarian aid, including ongoing support for projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls must be at the centre of building back a better, greener, more resilient and more equal world, she said, highlighting the need for strong commitments to achieving gender equality at the highest political level.</p><p>NALIZA REBUELTA-TEH, Under-Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, said her country -- located in the tropical cyclone belt -- ranks fourth among nations most affected by extreme weather events in the 2021 long-term Global Climate Risk Index. It experienced 317 exceptionally devastating events from 2000 to 2019. In December 2021, Super Typhoon Rai ravaged more than 2 million families and left $650 million in damages to housing, agriculture and infrastructure. Citing projections from the Philippine Climate Extremes 2020 Report, she said warming temperatures and decreasing rainfall are expected to threaten many communities. Coastlines and coastal resources are also highly vulnerable to climate change and disasters, with low-lying islands facing permanent inundation. The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change -- among other gender-responsive adaption and mitigation efforts -- addresses the different impacts that individual catastrophes and the slow-onset effects of climate change have across gender, age, socioeconomic class, indigenous status, migration status and disability. Women are ensured equal benefits and participation in Government programmes and policies, she said, adding that, in 2021, over $50 million was allocated to advance women's technical knowledge and overall capacity to implement mitigation measures in resource-based communities. The Government's gender mainstreaming efforts are institutionalized in focal point systems, annual appropriation for related budgets and a planning and reporting system monitored by the Philippine Commission on Women. Organized and systematic gender mainstreaming has produced national benefits for over two decades, she said, noting the Philippines' commitment to continue this holistic, integrated effort through sex aggregated data, social inclusion and measuring long-term strategic impacts.</p><p>HALA MAZYAD ALTUWAIGRI, Secretary-General of the Family Affairs Council of Saudi Arabia, said climate change impacts women and girls disproportionately and is an added stressor that will set back their advancement. Noting that 43 per cent of the global agricultural labour force is in developing countries, she said United Nations research shows that women make up 80 per cent of those displaced by climate change, which requires a serious effort from Governments and the active participation of all community members. Citing several national achievements, she pointed to the launch of a set of environmental protection policies and initiatives that address local to global climate change effects and also consider women's inclusion in decision-making and policymaking. The national environment strategy includes 64 initiatives aimed at restructuring the sector alongside such emission reduction programmes and policies as the adoption of an e Government project and renewable energy efforts. Contributions were allocated to the non-profit sector for providing solutions and innovation through advanced programmes and mechanisms, with women supervising the implementation of most of these efforts. The launch in 2021 of the Saudi Green Initiative aims to reduce the impact of climate change, achieve sustainability and create job opportunities for women and youth.</p><p>MOHAMMED SAHIB MARZOOQ, Head of Human Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iraq, delivering a statement on behalf of Yossra Mohsen, Director General and Head of Women's Empowerment in his country, said climate change consequences -- from the reduction of arable land to the loss of waterways -- has led to displacement and a loss of revenue, disproportionately affecting women and girls. As such, a historic role must be played to mitigate climate change effects. This shared responsibility should be based on circumstances and national capabilities, as solidarity and international cooperation have proven to be the only way forward. Highlighting several key achievements, he said Iraq has developed a series of projects and action programmes to tackle these and related challenges and has adopted laws and policies aimed at protecting women and increasing their participation at various levels. Noting that 95 women were elected in recent elections, he pointed to other gains, including the Government's launch of its second National Plan for Women's Economic Empowerment (2021-2022). Efforts included opening centres to protect women from domestic violence, creating a high-level committee to assist rural women, and a Ministry of Agriculture initiative to implement several targeted projects. In addition, 1 million trees have been planted as part of a mitigation project. Going forward, Iraq is working on revising its laws related to women's rights and on implementing a national strategy for Iraqi women that also focuses on climate change.</p><p>In closing remarks, MAMI MIZUTORI, Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, said that, while disasters affect everyone, they disproportionately affect women and girls. Summarizing several threads of the discussion, she said structural inequality is a driver of risk, noting also that women must be involved in efforts to address this. Policies must also be embedded with gender perspectives. At the same time, investing in all these policies and efforts is also critical, she said. Highlighting several other issues, she said more science and knowledge must be shared with women and girls. Attention must also be paid to the issue of increased violence against women amid disasters and the vulnerable situation of women in rural areas, she said, commending the participants for sharing their encouraging efforts at national to local levels.</p><p>lso participating were ministers and other high-level representatives from Kenya, France, Indonesia, United Republic of Tanzania, Saint Lucia, Spain, Bangladesh, Angola, United Kingdom, Maldives, El Salvador, Azerbaijan and Chad.</p><p>Ministerial Round Table IV</p><p>The Commission then held a ministerial roundtable discussion on the theme \"Women's voice and agency: good practices towards achieving women's full, equal and meaningful participation and decision-making in the context of climate-change, environmental and disaster-risk-reduction policies and programmes\".</p><p>Ministers and senior officials of Member States detailed national strategies to increase women's participation in decision-making and address the disproportionate effects of climate change and natural disaster on women and girls. Stressing that such effects, along with widening inequality, necessitates including these individuals in policymaking, they also pointed out that women and girls possess unique knowledge and experience that can be harnessed to inform risk-reduction and resilience strategies. Further, they pointed to the link between climate change and gender-based violence, stressing the need to mainstream gender perspectives in national policy to ensure that women and girls have both voice and agency in addressing a phenomenon that affects them in specific ways.</p><p>ELIZABETH GOMEZ ALCORTA, Minister for Women, Genders and Diversity of Argentina, chairing the round table, said that women and girls -- who hold deep knowledge of the needs and priorities of their communities -- are key to combating climate change and environmental degradation. However, women are far from achieving full gender parity and lack the critical mass necessary to influence policy, decisions and strategies. Further, women's civil society organizations face barriers to participation and leadership due to diminishing funds and threats to physical security. Pointing out that, while climate change is a global challenge, not all countries share the same responsibility, she said that the richest countries produce the most greenhouse gases while those with the fewest emissions are most exposed to the negative effects of the same. This reflects the hegemonic model of development, which is harmful to the environment and increases inequality. For its part, she said that Argentina works towards gender mainstreaming by training public officials and providing more resources to community organizations, especially those affected by climate change.</p><p>SILVERIA ELFRIEDA JACOBS, Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, speaking on behalf of the Netherlands and its constituent countries of Sint Maarten, Curacao and Aruba, said that the latter three small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The climate crisis magnifies inequalities and vulnerabilities -- especially for women and girls -- which are further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, in the global discussion regarding climate action, the voices of women and girls are underrepresented, and the international community cannot expect to solve this crisis by leaving these individuals behind. Member States must work towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality by ensuring women's full access to equal opportunities, knowledge and pay. Emphasizing that \"women must be part of the solution\", she said that, by working together to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 5, the world can progress towards achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>RIUNZAYA AYUSH, Minister for Labour and Social Protection of Mongolia, noted that her country has ratified 12 United Nations conventions relating to climate change, and to ensure implementation of these international treaties at the national level, has adopted several laws and policies to protect the environment. Further, the Government has implemented a number of projects to combat desertification and reduce air pollution, as the negative effects of climate change continue to pose a risk to both women and the national economy. Air pollution -- caused by densely populated urban areas -- has particularly negative effects on the health of the population. She emphasized that this problem especially affects infants and pregnant women, and has also led to respiratory diseases, premature birth and developmental disorders.</p><p>YANNA WEBSTER-ROY, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, outlined Government efforts to ensure that women have voice and agency by incorporating gender considerations in strategies and projects to enhance environmental and climate resilience. Socially constructed roles and inequality disproportionately affect women -- especially in rural areas  and she highlighted the need to incorporate the United Nations principle of \"leaving no one behind\" in developing disaster-risk-reduction policies and programmes. Gender issues and priorities specific to women must be integrated into the same, and the Government has worked to include women in stakeholder groups such as environmentally focused cabinets. She went on to stress the need to ensure that no barriers prevent the participation of women and girls in efforts to address climate change.</p><p>NASSENEBA TOURE, Minister for Women, Family and Children of Ca'te d'Ivoire, pointed out that women comprise 70 per cent of agricultural workers in her country, producing 90 per cent of foodstuffs. As such, they suffer disproportionately from the consequences of drought, high precipitation and natural disaster. Against that backdrop, the Government has implemented a national programme to fight climate change by empowering women and girls. Institutional and legislative support measures have been passed, multiple support funds for women working in agriculture have been established and women's participation in elected assemblies has increased. She also said that the Government is committed to implementing three projects for producing solar energy in the country's north -- 12 solar plants and 1 biomass project using residue from cotton and cocoa will create thousands of jobs for women and girls.</p><p>HELENA DALLI, European Commissioner for Equality of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed the need to address the lack of women's participation in decision-making as \"no crisis is gender-neutral\". Climate change and environmental degradation take a disproportionate toll on women due to such individuals' reduced access to resources, and therefore, the European Union's climate-adaptation strategy aims to increase women's leadership and gender balance. Further, the bloc supports programmes worldwide that promote women's participation in climate governance -- once such instance is its partnership with Bhutan to help local governments include women in the process to improve disaster resilience. Spotlighting the link between climate change and gender-based violence, she said that the European Union works to prevent such violence through targeted action, such as strengthening institutional capacities to address violence against women and girls following natural disaster.</p><p>NINO TANDILASHVILI, Deputy Minister for Environmental Protection and Agricultural Affairs of Georgia, joined other speakers in expressing solidarity with Ukraine and its people, condemning the Russian Federation's invasion and use of force against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in contravention of international law. Turning to climate change, she said the phenomenon has had -- and will continue to have -- severe, lasting impact on the environment and social development. The resilience and adaptive capacity of women and girls must be supported, and for its part, the Government is working to mainstream gender perspectives in its environmental and climate change policy. These efforts include enhancing women's role as agents of change and reducing the impact of natural disaster on population and infrastructure by providing early warning systems and locally informed risk management. \"Without gender equality today, a sustainable, equitable future remains beyond our reach,\" she added.</p><p>NNA MARIA MOKGETHI, Minister for Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs of Botswana, highlighted the lessons learned from the COVID-19, HIV/AIDS and Ebola pandemics, in which women were not only affected, but also at the forefront of the response. As countries hold national and international dialogues on climate-change mitigation, women and girls must be at the negotiating table to ensure their voices are heard. Noting that women and girls in her country are negatively affected by aridity, persistent drought and erratic rainfall, she said that the Government pursues inclusive development policies that focus on the particular needs of women and children. Further, it engages women and girls in rural areas in the management of rural community resources, as their wealth of indigenous knowledge is essential for resilience. She went on to stress that these indigenous practices must be preserved, and that the women employing them must be empowered to fully participate in the supply chain.</p><p>In closing remarks, PREETI SINHA, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Capital Development Fund, highlighted the link between women's economic empowerment and the climate agenda. Offering an example of the Fund's work in Uganda, she said that the informal settlements of Mbali suffer from frequent water-supply outages, flooding and contamination. As such, only 20 per cent of households have access to clean, piped water, and this lack of access forces women and youth to travel long distances to collect water, which renders them susceptible to gender-based violence. The Fund is working to improve this water access situation, and this scenario demonstrates the effects that climate adaptation measures can have on women's security. The relationship between climate finance and women's economic empowerment has the potential to be one of the most powerful, virtuous cycles in development finance for least developed countries and beyond. \"Let us unite to have capital serve humanity, and not the other way around,\" she added.</p><p>lso participating were ministers and other high-level representatives from Estonia, Sierra Leone, Liechtenstein, Denmark, Gambia, Portugal, Ethiopia, Croatia, Greece, Mexico, Paraguay, Romania, Czech Republic, Cuba, Switzerland and Mali.</p><p>eneral Discussion</p><p>MILENKO ESTEBAN SKOKNIC TAPIA (Chile), speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Older Persons, said that it is undeniable that all older women make a significant contribution, as agents of change, to the social, economic and sustainable development of societies. Not only do women account for the majority of older persons, but the proportion of older women in the global female population will also increase in the coming years. Therefore, policies and programmes must address women's needs throughout their lives, particularly when they are older. Calling for a change in the way of thinking about ageing, he said there is a need to challenge narratives regarding the role older women can play in the economy, society and households.</p><p>It is hard to conceive that considering that older populations will outgrow younger populations by 2020, older persons -- and even more so older women -- remain largely invisible and disregarded in the development of policies and programmes. Such invisibility is evident in this year's Secretary-General's report on the priority theme, which hardly addressed the complex realities of older women facing climate change and natural disasters, despite the compounded vulnerabilities they are more likely to experience. Such lack of visibility can and must be addressed urgently. The Group therefore urges the United Nations agencies, and particularly United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to systematically collect and disaggregate data by age and gender, particularly of women beyond their reproductive years.</p><p>Ms. AKBAR, Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation of Fiji, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said that the science is non-negotiable and urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical. Equal and full participation of all women and girls must be central to global action. The recent volcanic eruption in Tonga caused tephra ash to fall, a tsunami and severe damage to submarine telecommunications cables. Pacific women and girls, in all their diversity, continue to play a critical role in building resilient communities. Recognizing women's and girls' knowledge, capabilities and skills, and empowering them, is vital to the safety and security of all Pacific families. The Pacific has one of the highest rates of violence globally; on average, two out of every three women experience some form of violence throughout their lifetime. Global evidence indicates a link between disasters, climate change and gender-based violence, she said, noting that in the Pacific, reports of domestic violence cases have increased. During disasters, women are subject to increased workloads and care responsibilities and must travel further to look for water and food. This is exacerbated by the increasing levels of non-communicable diseases in rural and remote areas.</p><p> lack of adequate sexual reproductive health and outreach services are worsened by climate change and related disasters, she said. Climate finance also often fails to take account of gender equality and women's empowerment. She called on the international community to increase gender-responsive climate, environmental and disaster risk finance, promote women's full participation and leadership in climate, environment, ocean, biodiversity and disaster risk reduction action, and strengthen the capacities of women through accessible training and gender-responsive policies and programmes. It is also vital to ensure women have access to essential services during crisis situations. She also called for increased investment in national gender statistics which ensures gender-disability-geographical disaggregated data in the gender-environment nexus. \"COVID-19 recovery and recovery from recurring natural disasters is an opportunity to reset our global development agenda to one that is climate-resilient, gender-inclusive and leaves no one behind,\" she said.</p><p>VINDHYA PERSAUD, Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co operative Republic of Guyana, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), noted that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States and that its impacts represent a \"code red for humanity\". Reiterating disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met, he noted that women and girls are often disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. There must be a gender perspective when building climate resilience, as well as in the design and implementation of disaster-risk-reduction strategies and recovery plans, he said, calling also for investment to enable the production of gender-specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate. Poverty eradication is central to reducing women's vulnerability to climate change, he added, stressing that climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities should include measures supporting women owned micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the green and blue economies.</p><p>Turning to action to address sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence, he noted that CARICOM nations are encouraging the equal sharing of responsibilities in parenting and household work; engaging community leaders to address discriminatory social norms and gender stereotypes; and adopting robust legislative regimes. Women in the region are also leaders advocating for protection of the environment and implementing home-grown solutions. Highlighting progress in Guyana, he pointed to its low-carbon development strategy, noting that 62 per cent of the jobs it has created are held by women. While women and girls are disproportionately impacted by climate events, they have also been creating innovative solutions to protect the country's valuable ecosystem, including by using drones to monitor environmental activities to ascertain what threats have emerged to the mangroves ecosystem and how responses should be tailored. To promote women's economic empowerment, free, non-traditional technical vocational programmes, with no pre-admission requirements, have been created to provide the necessary training and skills for thousands of women across Guyana.</p><p>PATRICIA KALIATI, Minister for Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare of Malawi, speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), said that at a meeting in February, African Union ministers responsible for gender and promotion of women resolved that the current situation -- marked by a regression of the gains made to advance women's rights and gender equality due to the devastating effects of climate change and environmental disasters coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic -- necessitates taking action. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of all SADC member States. Environmental degradation threatens economic development and directly affects peoples' livelihoods. SADC has established three main environmental policy goals: protect and improve the health, environment and livelihoods of the people of Southern Africa with priority for poor; preserve the region's natural heritage, biodiversity and life supporting ecosystems; and support regional economic development on an equitable, sustainable basis for the benefit of present and future generations.</p><p>When unexpectedly heavy floods displaced more than a million people in Southern Africa in 2007, SADC began to meet annually to prepare for future occurrences, she said. It established a Disaster Risk Reduction Unit responsible for coordinating regional preparedness and response programmes for trans-boundary hazards and disaster. The SADC Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction was inaugurated in 2011. The newly developed SADC Regional Resilience Framework 2020 2030 will guide SADC member States and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of a broad range of resilience programmes. Women in the region account for most of the poorest and most vulnerable due to their general subordinate legal status; limited access to productive resources such as land, technology, credit, education and training, formal employment; as well as their susceptibility to HIV and AIDS. The SADC Protocol on Gender and Development was revised in 2016 to include gender and climate change. She stressed that State parties should, by 2030, develop policies, strategies and programmes to address the gender aspects of climate change, conduct research to assess its differential gendered impacts and put in place effective mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>NTONETTE NCUBE, a youth representative from the European Union delegation, in its capacity as an observer, also spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls. Stressing that climate change, disasters, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss disproportionately affect women and girls, and that crises and disasters exacerbate pre-existing gender inequalities and discrimination, she said women and girls frequently face increased sexual and gender-based violence. They are subjected to harmful practices such as early and forced marriage due to the impact of climate change, disproportionate burden of care work, and restricted access to essential health services. The Group calls for concerted efforts to address these issues and expects the Commission to adopt strong and action-oriented conclusions.</p><p>More specifically, she said, the Group recommends that all stakeholders ensure the gender-responsive implementation of international obligations and commitments, including the Paris Agreement, Lima Work Programme on Gender, Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In that regard, the Group stresses the importance of enhancing women's full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and leadership, she said, underscoring a concrete need to improve data and resources and strengthen coordination and capacity-building. The Group encourages all stakeholders to use comprehensive indicators and pursue the ethical collection and dissemination of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and gender statistics on all dimensions of environmental, disaster risk reduction and climate change issues and sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>MARTA LUCa\\x8DA RAMa\\x8DREZ, Vice President of Colombia, spotlighting the threats to global peace and stability seen over the last two weeks, said that the future will depend on including women's voices. Fifty per cent of the world's population has historically been excluded from power, but gender equality is essential for generating sustainable economic growth. For its part, Colombia has implemented a national policy with five objectives: to provide economic empowerment for women entrepreneurs; to include more women in politics; to involve women in peace and security; to ensure that women can live free from violence; and to establish more gender-based institutions. Noting her status as her country's first female Vice President, she stressed that, when women arrive in positions of power, they must remember to open more spaces for other women \"just as those who came before did for us\".</p><p>She went on to detail Colombia's establishment of a sovereign gender bond to help women-owned businesses recover from COVID-19 -- the first of its type in the world -- and stressed that economic autonomy is essential for women to decide their own futures and live free from violence. The international community must also remember the situation of women living in Ukraine, Afghanistan and other conflict zones as a result of wars \"always declared by men\". It must recall the voices of Afghan women, \"no longer heard in the halls of the United Nations\", which reflects the current multilateral system. And it must always call for the dignity and rights of all women, she urged, highlighting the legal and moral obligation to allow women around the world to rise up with all their creative and transformative might.</p><p>ENSIEH KHAZALI, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs of Iran, said that, during the pandemic, some 12,000 women-headed households have been trained and introduced to the traditional and cybermarkets. Also, more than 1 million women-headed households are covered by the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee. They have benefited from special social protection services including funding and insurance services. Ten million rials in cash subsidies were allocated to 17 million households to reduce economic constraints on families. Supported by the Vice-Presidency for Women and Family Affairs, the women-headed households were prioritized for receiving aid packages, and with the approval of the Cabinet, the amount of loans granted to those households were doubled. Also to protect the environment, 6,000 rural and nomadic women have become members of 2,000 rural and nomadic cooperatives, some of whom have been granted plots of land over the past five years. Iranian women are fighting the effects of unilateral coercive measures, she said, adding that their heroic achievements in various areas have proven that they can withstand various unjust and unilateral sanctions.</p><p>KATRIN JAKOBSDa\\x93TTIR, Prime Minister of Iceland, said that climate change has not spared her island country, with sea levels rising and glaciers melting. \"No country is an island when it comes to climate change,\" she said, stressing that similarly gender inequality plagues all parts of the world. Climate change causes poverty, disproportionally affecting women economically and socially. Climate change also causes instability and creates conditions for gender-based violence. Citing the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, she expressed concern that the conflict will produce mass displacement, which, in turn, creates more cases of gender-based violence. This \"shadow pandemic\" had occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak, she said, calling for attention to gender-based violence caused by the Russian Federation's aggression. There is a need to include young people in social justice and health, as they are the best advocate for their own future. There are many remarkable women activists and human rights defenders in the forefront. \"The world will be a better place with women in the lead,\" she said.</p><p>TANZILA NARBAEVA, Chairperson and Speaker of the Senate of Parliament of Uzbekistan, said the Commission is a catalyst for incorporating gender into all aspects of United Nations work. Expanding the rights of women and girls is a key priority of Uzbekistan State policy, she noted, with a new development plan for 2022-2026 and a national programme to bolster the role of women and girls in the country's future. Addressing climate change, she noted Uzbekistan is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, including the drying of the Aral Sea, which threatens the sustainable development of Central Asia. Reports have further suggested that, between 2030 and 2050, the average air temperature in the region may increase by 1.5C to 3C. Uzbekistan has adopted the broad use of renewable energy, and is working to develop the Aral Sea region, including through women-focused training courses to manage resources and regenerate salinated areas. During the third Central Asian Summit, Uzbekistan advanced the regional programme \"Green Agenda for Central Asia\", and is planting 200 million saplings.</p><p>ZORANA MIHAJLOVIC, Deputy Prime Minister and the President of the Coordination Body of the Government of the Republic of Serbia for Gender Equality of Serbia, said that UN-Women has been a partner of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality for years. They have worked together on gender mainstreaming of climate policies and practices in Serbia, and on ensuring that the normative framework related to energy is gender-sensitive and that climate change finance always includes women's perspective. A new national energy strategy, as well as the National Energy and Climate Action Plan are under way, both of which will be gender-sensitive, because without gender mainstreaming of public policies, the existing gender gap cannot be closed. The Government established the National Coalition on Energy Poverty whose goal is to underline gender gaps in energy poverty. \"The gender-just transition is our chance not only to change our energy sources and to have a cleaner environment, but also to change the perception of the energy sector as a men-dominated sector,\" she said.</p><p>EVELYN WEVER-CROES, Prime Minister of Aruba, speaking on behalf of the Netherlands and its constituent countries of Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten, said that these four countries have been battling the elements for centuries -- \"from North Sea floods to Caribbean hurricanes\" -- and are united in tackling the climate crisis, which is \"the greatest challenge of our time\". The world is unequal, and this crisis is amplifying that inequality. In the Caribbean, the greatest burden of care falls on women and girls when communities are in crisis; however, these individuals remain underrepresented in decision-making at all levels, including at the United Nations. Against that backdrop, she urged full, equal, meaningful and effective participation and leadership for women in adaptation and mitigation processes, along with granting the same equal access to the knowledge and resources necessary to respond to climate change.</p><p>ROBBERT DIJKGRAAF, Minister for Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands, underscored the importance of knowledge in combating climate change, as it is \"the only resource that grows as you use it\". However, the voices, knowledge and experience of women and girls are unheard, as these individuals are underrepresented at all levels, including technical areas crucial to making the necessary energy transition. The world needs the contribution of women and girls, in all their diversity, to ensure a liveable future for humanity. Noting that today's meeting occurs in extraordinary times, he expressed full solidarity with all women and girls living in conflict -- including those in Ukraine -- and condemned the Russian Federation's illegal invasion of that country.</p><p>DERYA YANIK, Minister for Family and Social Services of Turkey, said that a civilization teaches: \"Plant a tree, even if it is your last deed.\" Her country puts great emphasis on environmental protection. Since 2002, it has witnessed remarkable progress as a result. Thanks to the \"Zero Waste\" project, a new era has begun in terms of environmental protection. Women play a major role in the success of this project. In adapting to the Paris Agreement on climate change, Turkey has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2053. An effective fight against climate change requires a political and social atmosphere in which women are resilient, empowered and their rights are ensured. Her country has made significant progress in eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women, adopted priority goals to increase the education level of women and girls, and taken crucial steps in terms of empowering and increasing the participation of women in the labour market. With the \"Gender-Responsive Planning and Budgeting in Turkey\" project, the Government is determined to ensure that women are not ignored and their needs and problems are always visible in budget programmes.</p><p>MAYA MORSY, Minister for Women and President of the National Council for Women of Egypt, said that her country is among those most affected by climate change, despite its very limited contribution to the phenomenon's existence, as Egypt accounts for only 0.6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In light of the impact of climate change on women -- particularly on their health, food security and living standards -- the Government works to implement a sustainable development model and has adopted many initiatives, programmes and projects to promote adaptation and mitigate the effects of climate change, while also promoting women's empowerment. These efforts include: raising women's awareness of rural initiatives and eco-friendly agricultural methods; organizing environmental camps to train women in eco-friendly industries; and raising awareness of sustainable flood-management. She also detailed Egypt's perspective for women, the environment and climate change, affirming the Government's commitment to address climate change and empower Egyptian women in various fields.</p><p>AWATIF HAYAR, Minister for Solidarity, Social Integration and Family of Morocco, outlining her country's efforts on the priority theme, said that national priority focuses on integrating women into environmental policy. This session coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a huge impact on women. Her country is including women in all areas of policy implementation. The 2011 Constitution bases itself on the principle of equality of men and women. Morocco is also working to implement all its international commitments in eliminating discrimination, advancing gender equality and addressing climate change. It has established the 2020-2030 Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation, with a view to archiving gender equality. The Government is undertaking projects with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in the field of green technology. The Government has set a goal of increasing women's economic activity by 2026, she said, also noting that more women candidates won during the 2021 elections than in past elections.</p><p>CHUNG YOUNG-AI, Minister for Gender Equality and Family of the Republic of Korea, voiced concern about the impact of violence on women and girls, many of whom have been displaced or forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. She affirmed that only when the perspectives of women -- who account for half the world's population -- are incorporated into policies and programmes will the world be able to prudently respond to the crisis facing the international community. Her Government formulates a Basic Plan for Gender Equality Policies every five years, and has enforced gender-responsive budgeting since fiscal year 2010. It is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, a designated officer system has been established to support women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The country is also responding to deepening gender inequality in the labour market brought on by the pandemic with a COVID-19 Women's Job Recovery Plan launched in 2021, expanding jobs for women in the public and private sectors. With the help of her ministry, UN-Women has established the United Nations Women Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality in Seoul.</p><p>SUSANNE RAAB, Federal Minister for Women, Family, Integration and Media in the Federal Chancellery of Austria, aligning herself with the European Union, noted that women and men are affected differently by climate and environmental crises and States have to think differently and come up with new solutions. Highlighting measures taken by her country in that regard, she stressed a special focus on the empowerment of women and girls in technology and innovation, to ensure that they equally benefit from job opportunities and increase diversity in those sectors, including through \"Lets Empower Austria\", an initiative which aims to increase the participation of women and girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Turning to the Russian's Federation's invasion of Ukraine, she noted that war leads to an unbelievable suffering for civilians, in particular women and girls. In that regard, she expressed her country's full solidarity with women and girls in Ukraine and those who fled.</p><p>EVA NORDMARK, Minister for Gender Equality, Ministry of Employment of Sweden, associating herself with the European Union, expressed solidarity with those living in conflict situations and other emergencies, including Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia and Ukraine. The unprovoked, illegal and indefensible Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine is having an immense impact on the civilian population there, with a huge number of people, including women and children, forced to flee their homes. \"We all have an obligation to strongly condemn this invasion,\" she said. As a member of the Swedish feminist Government, she noted women's economic empowerment is key to achieving gender equality. \"When you make your own money, you can choose your own life,\" she said, citing political reforms such as parental leave for both mothers and fathers, affordable childcare and individual taxation to help close the gender pay gap. Addressing the urgency of stopping fossil fuel emissions to accelerate a just climate transition, she noted Sweden is producing batteries and the world's first fossil-free steel, creating thousands of new green jobs. As the COVID-19 pandemic has globally increased the risk of women being subjected to men's violence, prostitution and trafficking, the Government has adopted a 99-point Action Programme for preventing and combating violence against women. The blame must be put where it belongs: on the perpetrators. Stressing the importance of sexual and reproductive rights, she said: \"We must continue promoting access to safe and legal abortions, contraceptives and comprehensive sexuality education.\"</p><p>DOMINIQUE HASLER, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein, noted the meeting unfortunately falls under the shadow of a terrible war, condemning the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine. She stressed that all armed conflicts have devastating consequences for civilians, and are a setback for the rights of women and girls, who disproportionately suffer violence, marginalization and exclusion, but show amazing resilience. Their role is key in supporting the international rules-based order; it is not a question of political correctness but a prerequisite for successful and peaceful political processes. Climate change also disproportionately burdens women and girls, and generations to come will note the action -- or inaction -- of the international community on the issue. Addressing the interlinkage between climate change and rights, she noted women lack access to land ownership. Modern slavery and human trafficking increase during and after natural disasters, she stressed, pointing to a blueprint the Government has developed for financial institutions to prevent such crimes through financial inclusion. Liechtenstein has also partnered with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Climate and Environment Transition Fund. Quoting the Secretary-General, she noted that humanitarian emergencies move the clock backwards on women's rights.</p><p>THOMAS BLOMQVIST, Minister for Nordic Cooperation and Equality of Finland, aligning himself with the European Union, condemned Moscow's aggression against Ukraine in the strongest terms, stressing that the war is also a violation of women's rights. \"We must hear the voices of Ukrainian women. As in every conflict, women are critical to achieving sustainable peace,\" he said. Noting the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls, he stressed that climate change is also a gender issue, calling for increased efforts to ensure a gender perspective in all climate, environment and disaster management policies. Highlighting the intersection between climate issues and sexual and reproductive health and rights, he spotlighted the essential importance of universal access to quality comprehensive sexuality education, bodily autonomy, access to clean water and sanitation, and women's economic empowerment, in order to achieve gender equality. To that end, his Government has introduced family leave reform and is also introducing national legislation on pay transparency, he noted. Expressing concern about the increasing sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and hate speech, both offline and online, he emphasized the need to bridge the gender digital divide and eliminate harmful gender stereotypes, including gender bias in artificial intelligence.</p><p>HO JAN TINETTI, Minister for Women of New Zealand, emphasized that women who experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including indigenous women, are among those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and disasters, but also powerful agents of action, change and resilience. As such, the Government of New Zealand is increasingly applying gender and intersectional analysis to all its actions and decision-making, including by promoting the use of an online tool, she said. Noting the data-collection gaps and shortcomings exposed in that process, she stressed the vital importance of gender-disaggregated data to ensuring visibility for the gendered impacts of climate change and natural hazards, and of tailoring responses accordingly. She went on to state that New Zealand is also focusing on enabling an equitable climate transition to a low carbon economy, which entails consideration of the outcomes for different groups in the way climate change policies and programmes are funded and financed.</p><p>LISABETH MORENO, Minister Delegate for Gender Equality, Diversity and Equal Opportunities of France, expressed concern over the fate of women and girls in Ukraine following the Russian Federation's military aggression and underscored the need to preserve the rights and dignity of Ukrainians. Turning to climate change, she pointed out that women are the primary victims of it, and quite often, they are not heard despite \"having something to say\". Gender equality is at the forefront of France's efforts in the European Union, and the Government also works to combat sexual and gender-based violence. National legislation addresses domestic abuse, street harassment and new forms of violence on the Internet, and an ombudsman for public enterprises was established to combat harassment in the workplace. She also emphasized the importance of women's economic independence, noting that the pandemic has revealed the inequality women face in the public and professional spaces. Despite women playing a key role, their contributions are often not seen or valued, and she expressed hope that, post-pandemic, \"parity will be the rule, not the exception\".</p><p>LYAZZAT RAMAZANOVA, Minister for the National Commission for Women, Family and Demographic Policy under the President of Kazakhstan, said her country is committed to all issues on gender equality as women are the main beneficiaries of a clean environment. Kazakhstan is addressing climate change challenges head-on. A transition to the green economy requires significant investment in line with commitments made under the Paris Agreement and the subsequent agreement in Glasgow. Kazakhstan seeks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The Government does not represent the whole picture in this effort, she said, stressing that civil society and businesses are doing their parts. Noting that her landlocked country is far from the ocean and two thirds of its land is desert, she said Central Asian economies like hers must adapt to climate change. Kazakhstan will plant 2 billion trees, with civil society participating in that endeavour. About 80 per cent of civil-society organizations are headed by women. She noted the establishment of a green technology centre in Kazakhstan.</p><p>NNALENA BAERBOCK, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, said an estimated 800,000 women will give birth in Ukraine in the next few months, many without shelter or access to proper care. \"This illustrates clearly that conflicts and crises are not gender-blind,\" she said, stressing that conflicts disproportionately impact women from Afghanistan to the Sahel. The same is true for the climate crisis, she said, urging the Commission to compel States to put women's rights at the heart of climate action. She noted that, during droughts, it is girls who are sent to school less frequently because gender norms dictate that fetching water falls to them. For such reasons, Germany supported the Human Rights Council in recognizing a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right, and it supports efforts to give women and other marginalized groups an equal say in decision-making processes.</p><p>MUSA MAAYTAH, Minister for Political and Parliamentary Affairs and Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for the Empowerment of Women, and Minister of Political and Parliamentary Affairs of Jordan, said the international community must take into account the most vulnerable people to ensure civil society features the participation of women in decision-making processes. Jordan has pioneered mainstreaming gender into State policy on climate change, stressing the importance of measures addressing the root causes of inequality and discrimination and acknowledging the different circumstances of men and women. He also affirmed the Government will work to provide better services to women in humanitarian crises, either through prevention or recovery, and is further taking into account lessons learned from the pandemic, involving women in decision-making related to economic empowerment. He noted that the labour law was amended to provide nursery care for female staff, equal pay and paternity leave, as well as equal pay for equal work.</p><p>RODERIC O'GORMAN, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of Ireland, aligning himself with the European Union, expressed solidarity with women and girls in situations of conflict or other emergencies and pointed out that these individuals are particularly impacted by the same, including in Ukraine. Ireland prioritizes women's empowerment, demonstrated by its international development programming that focuses on social protection, food systems, climate action and the women, peace and security agenda. Spotlighting the link between climate and security, he said that instability and fragility have a disproportionate impact on women. Women's role in addressing the climate crisis is too often overlooked and undervalued, and States must ensure that women's voices are heard at all levels. He went on to say that Ireland, for its part, has pioneered citizens' assemblies as exercises in participatory democracy, and the assembly for gender equality recently submitted its report containing 45 recommendations in this area to the Government for implementation.</p><p>LAILA AL NAJAR, Minister for Social Development of Oman, emphasized the importance of a prominent role for women in national development, noting that they instil the value of tolerance. Noting that his country's Constitution guarantees the rights of women, he said their economic participation is an important goal for Oman. A high percentage of women are now joining the labour market, he added. Pointing out that more women occupy leadership positions in political and public life, he said they are holding decision-making positions in private companies, as well. Oman provides assistance to women entrepreneurs and small business owners engaged in e-commerce, he said, adding that the Government also supports victims of domestic violence. Women volunteer to help those affected in crisis situations, he noted, stressing that their participation is crucial both during normal times and in emergencies.</p><p>MARIANA VIEIRA DA SILVA, Minister of State for the Presidency of Portugal, said that it is fundamental to invest in the production of data disaggregated by sex, on the impacts of phenomena and policies. Environment and energy, agriculture, mobility or urban planning are important sectors in this approach. Since 2021, Portugal has monitored gender equality indicators in its State budget report, including in the field of climate change, with all data produced by the Central Administration to be disaggregated by sex. In the labour market, the Government is integrating more women in key areas of climate transition, whether through training activities in maritime economy, in the management of rural fires, or through the training of women working in the agricultural sector. In the fight against energy poverty, it is reducing the costs of energy and other consumptions, supporting the more vulnerable households, namely single parent families. Legislative measures set minimum thresholds for participation in decision-making positions. Since 2017, the average proportion of women on the boards of publicly listed companies increased from 12 to 29 per cent. In public administration, since 2015, the rate of women senior managers jumped from 32 to 43 per cent. In the Portuguese Parliament, women account for more than a third of representation.</p><p>MEIRAV COHEN, Minister for Social Equality of Israel, spotlighted all the young girls, mothers, sick or wounded women, pregnant women and senior citizens in Ukraine who thought they would never have to experience war atrocities again. Those women must be kept in mind when discussing policy. The gap between the privilege of discussing gender issues and the need to stay alive and protect one's children must be pondered by all. On a national level, she pointed to the presence of many different communities, which presents challenges to promoting women's rights in a \"complex sphere\" where every group lives according to its traditions and customs. Nearly 56 per cent of Israeli women are employed, most of them working mothers. Together with a high birth rate in Israel, Israeli women are burdened by their households much more than their Western counterparts. As a result, her Government's attempt to reduce environmental hazards by restricting the use of disposable housewares was met with strong opposition from Orthodox communities that consist of multi-child families. An attempt to limit disposables with extensive taxing was considered an attack on women in the more traditional household. The women, as sole housekeepers, had to choose between spending more money or having to do more housework. To that end, her country has the complex task of finding the right balances between promoting women's rights while preserving the environment and addressing climate change.</p><p>YANNA WEBSTER-ROY, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister responsible for Gender and Child Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, said the country's National Vision 2030 Development Plan and the National Policy on Gender and Development recognize the importance of holistic, interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches to conserving, developing and safeguarding natural resources. The Policy aims to encourage women and men to play diverse and complementary roles in approaches to climate change and environmental protection. She noted that Trinidad and Tobago ratified the Paris Agreement, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent in the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors by 2030 -- a 103 million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. On gender, she cited the Ministry of Planning and Development, the political head of which is a woman, and the Multilateral Environmental Agreements Network, with women accounting for 58 per cent of the groups and playing a lead role in decision making. The country's Comprehensive Disaster Management Policy further recognizes that disasters and hazards affect women, girls, men and boys differently. Because of their reproductive responsibilities, women are particularly valuable \"change agents\" in the transition to a sustainable economy, and should be trained and supported in adopting new environmentally friendly practices and technologies.</p><p>TAINA BOFFERDING, Minister for Equality between Women and Men of Luxembourg, said that crises -- whatever their nature -- affect each individual differently. In the conflict situation in Ukraine, women and girls must demonstrate resilience and courage while facing unprovoked Russian aggression. In a three-week period, millions have been forced to flee their homes, the majority of whom are women and girls. Also expressing shock over reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by Russian armed forces, she demanded that the Russian Federation \"cease this stupid war\". Turning to women and climate change, she stressed the need to improve the collection of reliable, disaggregated gender data; to place gender equality at the centre of resilience policies and disaster-risk-reduction programmes; and to increase the number of women in decision-making and leadership roles. She added that, for its part, the Government has adopted a feminist foreign policy and its development-cooperation efforts -- to which 1 per cent of Luxembourg's GDP is allocated -- are focusing on new gender strategies, such as increasing financing for projects bolstering women's empowerment throughout the world.</p><p>Right of Reply</p><p>Speaking in the exercise of the right of reply, the representative of the Russian Federation said that many delegates made baseless allegations against his country in their statements today. They ignore the fact that the Ukrainian army has stricken the heart of Donetsk, killing civilians. Since the coup d'etat in 2014, the Ukrainian regime has taken a decision to destroy the Russian-speaking populations in the country's east, where they are being shelled and killed. He wondered why Western countries ignore this situation created by the criminal regime in Kyiv, and instead provide lethal weapons to Kyiv. He reminded the Commission that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) used inhumane weapons in the former Yugoslavia, killing civilians, including women and children, also citing similar actions by the so-called \"peacekeeping\" forces in Afghanistan and Libya.</p><p>Source: United Nations</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG16032022012886</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6515-RVB1-JCH9-G4WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"12098\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29735\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>March 16, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Business &amp;

Until recently, the country remained a closed, centrally-planned economy, with growth largely driven by commodity export revenues that financed import-substitution industrialization. This was achieved through import barriers and restrictions to capital outflows, significant directed lending, as well as on- and off-budget subsidies, which supported a wide network of state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and a few private-sector participants.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The economy was sustained by the commodities super-cycle, but with a deteriorating external environment, it became increasingly evident that the economic growth was not accompanied by productivity growth or sufficient high-quality job creation, leading to substantial outward labor migration. Following the commodity price shock in 2014, the lack of price flexibility (in exchange rates and domestic prices) led to the widening relative price distortions, and it became evident that existing economic policies were incapable of providing sustained productivity growth and good job creation to meet the needs of a growing and young population.</p><p>In 2017, the country launched an ambitious program of market-oriented reforms that are unprecedented in its modern history. With the drivers of the old growth model exhausted, the new leadership embarked on a strong program of market reforms. Going forward, the Government of Uzbekistan still needs to address a number of key challenges to achieve sustainable development and growth.</p><p>The current challenges include removing market distortions that undermine allocative efficiency and competition; eliminating regulatory barriers to business operations; promoting the reallocation of land toward more productive uses; mitigating geographic inequities in access to social services; promoting the sustainable use and management of natural resources; making public administration more transparent and accountable; widening access to preprimary and tertiary education and improving the quality of these services; ensuring access to quality health care; and addressing the inefficiencies in social protection programs.</p><p>Approach</p><p>Since 2017 the Government's reform program has grown in scope and ambition by significantly increasing demand for the WBG financing and global knowledge services. The WBG program realigned in June 2018 now responds to the Government's broadened reform agenda by focusing on projects and activities that support private sector growth and the creation of markets, promote institution and capacity building to support the reform process, and enable the economic and social transformation.</p><p>The World Bank program is shifting from pure bricks-and-mortar infrastructure projects to policy support and market institution building, horticulture development, social protection, early childhood development, regional development, and connectivity. Current and future infrastructure investments supported by the World Bank financing will help pave the way for sector reforms. Development Policy Operations will be used to support the Government's efforts to develop a solid foundation for a market economy by first identifying and then building its key components.</p><p>Results</p><p>As of April 2019, the Bank funded 51 projects focusing on infrastructure investments in the agriculture, water, energy, transport, health, and education sectors and sponsored more than 50 technical assistance programs by providing the required linkage between policy and investment.</p><p>Recent results achieved in 2016-2018 under selected Bank-supported and administered projects include:</p><p>In the horticulture sector, farmers and agri-businesses across the country received over 380 subloans totaling US$282 million to finance the launch of cold storage facilities, greenhouses, vegetable production, orchards, and vineyards; the packaging and processing of agricultural products; and the purchase of agriculture machinery and laboratory equipment.</p><p>In the preschool system, over 55,000 children aged 3-6 were enrolled in half-day groups in preschools across the country; more than 70,000 children are benefiting from better equipped preschools; more than 500,000 children aged 3-6 not in preschool are benefiting from an early reading program; more than 4,000 preschool teachers were trained to run the half-day classes; and more than 2,400 rural preschools were equipped with high-quality furniture, indoor and outdoor recreation equipment, teaching and learning materials, and libraries.</p><p>IDA results</p><p>Between 2012 and 2018, with IDA support:</p><p>In rural settlements across the Syrdarya region, 180,000 residents received 24-hour access to safe and reliable water supply services.</p><p>In the health sector, over 500 medical facilities were supplied with modern equipment; medical service quality was improved through 22 new treatment standards for noncommunicable diseases; and over 3,000 doctors, 11,600 general practitioners, and 28,500 nurses received training as part of their continuing professional development.</p><p>In Karakalpakstan, agriculture productivity increased by 10-12 percent in degraded lands due to rehabilitated drainage and irrigation systems that improved water resource management; 27 water users associations were established in the pilot area covering 65,000 hectares to improve management of inter-farm irrigation systems; roughly 2,250 hectares of sustainable wetlands were developed along rehabilitated drain collectors, also providing a habitat for birds and wildlife; and about 700 local farmers were trained on new agronomic and water savings technologies.</p><p>Over 30 large industrial enterprises improved their energy efficiency thanks to investments in energy-efficient technologies and equipment. Energy savings reached 360 million kilowatt hours (kWh), enough to satisfy the electricity needs of over 176,000 households annually.</p><p>In the Bukhara, Navoi, and Khorezm regions and Karakalpakstan, around 6,000 farmers, entrepreneurs, and local officials received training on climate adaptation and mitigation, with tools and techniques disseminated under the Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Program for Aral Sea Basin Project.</p><p>World Bank Group Contribution</p><p>As of March 2019, the World Bank portfolio in Uzbekistan consisted of 19 investment projects with net commitments totaling US$3.32 billion (including IBRD commitments of US$1.14 billion, IDA commitments of US$2.18 billion, and a Global Partnership for Education grant of US$49.9 million) designed to support macroeconomic reforms, regional development, and improvements in agriculture, water supply, transport, energy, education, and health services.</p><p>The active Trust Fund portfolio has 36 activities, including 32 Bank-executed and four recipient-executed tasks totaling US$93.17 million. Most are funded from Multi-Donor Trust Funds (the major ones are financed by the European Union, Switzerland, the United States, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Federation) in support of an analytical and technical assistance program, the preparation of new lending operations, and complementary financing to ongoing projects.</p><p>The Bank's analytical and technical assistance program consists of 24 tasks in different areas and includes the first-ever Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) agreement, signed by the Bank and the Government in August 2018, to support civil aviation reform in Uzbekistan.</p><p>The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is currently managing a US$61 million investment portfolio in Uzbekistan, including projects in the financial and textile sectors. IFC's advisory services provided investments under seven projects that are designed to assist in privatizing SOEs, transforming the cotton sector, developing and diversifying the financial market, and piloting public-private partnerships in the renewable energy and health sectors.</p><p>Partners</p><p>The WBG is closely coordinating its country program with other multilateral and bilateral development institutions operating in Uzbekistan and has established close partnerships with the Asian Development Bank, European Union, Islamic Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the governments of Switzerland, Korea, Japan, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Hungary.</p><p>Work is being carried out through coordinated technical assistance and joint or parallel financing of investment operations in agriculture, energy, transport, water supply and sanitation, and water resource management. Namely, the European Union co-financing exceeds pound 45 million and supports the Bank's interventions in agriculture and irrigation.</p><p>In addition, the WBG closely collaborates with the European Union, the United States, and Switzerland through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund to support activities related to the prevention of forced labor in Uzbekistan. The Bank is exploring opportunities to engage with new partners, such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the European Investment Bank.</p><p>The Bank also coordinates its activities with the United Nations through the UN Country Team, on which the Bank participates. The Uzbek Government and UN agencies recently signed a UN Development Assistance Framework for 2016-2020 that has the WBG leading several key thematic groups.</p><p>Moving Forward</p><p>The World Bank will continue to support Uzbekistan in the implementation of its ambitious, comprehensive, and fully homegrown reform program to transform the country into a competitive market-oriented economy. In January 2019, the Government adopted a 2019-2021 'Reform Roadmap,' developed with WBG support, that clarifies how Uzbekistan will achieve its economic development strategy in the medium-term period.</p><p>The Roadmap's objective is to further implement-and accelerate progress on-the strategic plans outlined in the 2017-2021 Development Strategy of Uzbekistan. The Government intends to achieve these goals through a comprehensive program of reforms, supported by the World Bank and other development partners, covering five focus areas: (i) maintaining macroeconomic stability; (ii) accelerating the transition to a market economy; (iii) strengthening social protection and citizen services; (iv) transforming the Government's role in the market economy; and (v) preserving environmental sustainability.</p><p>The Roadmap also includes measures to strengthen human capital, increase the participation of women in the economy, conserve environmental and natural resources, and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the social safety net system. The World Bank will respond to Uzbekistan's emerging needs by maintaining the breadth and scope of its current investment and technical assistance program in the country.</p><p>The WBG is discussing a potential RAS to help improve the business and investment climate and a follow-up RAS in the civil aviation sector to assist in ongoing sector restructuring.</p><p>Beneficiaries</p><p>Investing in the Development of Uzbekistan's Preschool System</p><p>Over 55,000 children aged 3-6 were enrolled in a half-day program in preschools across the country under the Improving Pre-Primary and General Secondary Education Project.</p><p>'Many parents, especially from low-income families, choose half-day groups in kindergartens because of their affordability,' says Mavluda Nishanova, an official from the Ministry of Public Education. 'A monthly fee per child in a rural area is around UZS15,000 (less than US$2). In fact, it just covers the cost of daily breakfast, while children receive all services and educational supplies free of charge. The four-hour schedule is also convenient for parents working part-time and women dealing with housekeeping.'</p><p>Helping Uzbek Farmers Sell More of 'the Best Fruits and Vegetables in the World'</p><p>Thanks to a Horticulture Development Project (HDP), a farmer in the Samarkand region received a loan to complete construction of a cold storage facility that can accommodate up to 1,700 tons of horticultural products. Ten permanent jobs were created after the facility became operational.</p><p>'In this facility, we will be able to save our own fruits, vegetables, and grapes, as well as crops produced by local farmers,' says Vohid Abdushukurov, a manager of the cold storage facility. 'Nowadays, this service is in high demand among local farmers and agro-firms as their export capacity is rapidly growing. Our potential clients are interested in preserving the quality of their products before they reach foreign customers. And we are happy to respond to their needs.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG120420190007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VW7-FNF1-JCH9-G1WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 12, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Banking Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjQyMUFCOUJBNURBNEFDREE3MTNCNDk5QkQ4NUM3RjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDMzNzcyNTFFOUZENEFCNTk5Nzk0RTYyOUYyNTgwQkQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MDJDQjg1RTk0N0RFNEQ3MkJGRTk2OUZDMEZBN0QzOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000895</classCode><className>IMPORT TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

Even with the doors and windows shut, we had to constantly sweep layers of fine dust,' he said.</p><p>That dust storm was one of many that followed a severe drought in 2007-2009 and years of land degradation. The wind carried away topsoil and pushed sand up against the farm-gates, fences and bush. Two-thirds of Hipolito's cows died of hunger and the price paid to breeders for livestock crashed.</p><p>'A cow cost as little as a pair of shoes,' remembered Hipolito. The family fell into debt to purchase feed for their remaining animals. 'We wanted to leave everything behind but after more than 30 years here we couldn't do it.'</p><p>Ten years later, Argentina experienced a new dry spell in the first half of 2018, threatening agricultural production and key exports. The world possibly recorded its fourth hottest year on record. And agricultural weather experts forecast a likely new wave of El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, wreaking havoc from Latin America, to Asia and Eastern Africa. (In most of Argentina, El Ni\u00f1o tends to cause flooding while La Ni\u00f1a signals drought. But impacts of the recurring change in Pacific Ocean temperatures vary from country to country and even within countries.)</p><p>To help countries prepare for climate risks and deal with resulting food price volatility, the World Bank-managed Food Price Crisis Response Trust Fund, launched a program of technical assistance focused on strengthening the resilience of agriculture to ENSO events and climate change more broadly. Over 2015-2018, 27 grants of technical assistance were completed in more than 30 countries, yielding policy recommendations and knowledge-sharing across regions. The trust fund was supported by Australia, Canada, Korea and Spain.</p><p>In Argentina, a World Bank policy note financed by the trust fund provided a timely conceptual framework for the preparation of a $150 million project focused on Integrated Risk Management in the Rural Agroindustrial System (known by its Spanish acronym GIRSAR). Finalized in June 2016, 'the policy note put the mitigation of risks at the center of government preoccupations, not just disaster response,' said Juan Buchter, who was part of the project preparation team.</p><p>The fact that the World Bank project loan was approved in May 2018 in a difficult financial environment is a sign of the government's strong commitment to this agenda.</p><p>Federal and provincial accounts rely on agribusiness and will continue to rely on this sector for many years,' explained Hugo Rossi, Undersecretary of Political Coordination in the Secretary of Agroindustry. Agriculture primary goods and processed products represent about 60% of Argentina's exports, and the food system is a major contributor to the national economy and jobs. 'The agenda of minding climate risks in this sector is the agenda of the fiscal health of Argentina and the agenda of the fight against poverty,' said Rossi.</p><p>The GIRSAR project aims to strengthen and better integrate information and early warning weather systems, while also supporting investment in long-term adaptation tools such as climate-resilient roads, efficient irrigation systems and sustainable land and forest management at the provincial level. Ten to 12 provinces are expected to propose priority investment plans, including the province of Buenos Aires which encompasses Patagones.</p><p>The weather in Patagones, a semi-arid area at the door of Patagonia, is reliably unreliable. According to measurements taken on Hipolito's farm since 1981, rainfall has averaged 450 mm per year but has oscillated dramatically between 300 mm and 600 mm, and particularly dry years (under 300 mm of rain) have recurred as frequently as exceptionally wet ones (over 600 mm).</p><p>That uncertainty has encouraged in the past a 'casino mentality', in which farmers take their chances on rainfed cereals at the risk of depleting soils. It also makes Patagones an ideal testing ground for climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>Hipolito's extensive farmland is one of several production areas selected to pilot more resilient land and water management practices under a World Bank project financed by the United Nation's Adaptation Fund and implemented by Argentina's Secretary of Environment and Sustainable Development.</p><p>In the past few years, parts of the land have been returned to natural pasture that propagates when seeds are carried by the wind and digested by animals and is more resilient to climate extremes. Other areas have been seeded with perennial wheatgrass known locally as agropiro and interspersed with vicia, a nitrogen-fixing leguminous plant, to remedy soil degradation and erosion associated with annual crops such as wheat and oats. The whole ranch is now under a system of rotation in which metal fencing moves ruminants around so that they eat pasture in short bursts, enhance its soil composition with manure, and then leave it alone to regenerate.</p><p>Hipolito also began raising sheep in addition to cows in 2014, to take advantage of high export prices for merino wool. Three Pyrenean sheepdogs patrol the flock at night to deter pumas and keep sheep losses in check. Finally, Hipolito hires occasional labor to clear thorny bush from fence lines and create barriers of vegetation-free ground to manage the impact of fires.</p><p>Given the constant struggle against natural, climate and market risks, it's no wonder Hipolito's brothers want nothing to do with agriculture and livestock. Hipolito manages a 2,500-hectare property alone with his elderly parents.</p><p>Hipolito however is optimistic about the future. 'I have no fear because I'm young,' he says with a cowboy's swagger. A cow today is worth five pairs of shoes. More importantly, he feels better prepared to handle the next drought: 'I have financial reserves, feed reserves, and I'm confident that I can enrich the land over time with more sustainable management.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KORNGA-KOREANEWSG0401201900001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KORNGA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V4B-FW91-JCH9-G33F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434143</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1037\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Korea News Gazette All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea News Gazette</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 4, 2019 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPKR</classCode><className>DUST &amp;

Joel Lee / The Korea Herald</p><p>Denmark and Korea have stepped up collaboration in green growth in recent years, as both countries are leaders in green technology and information technology. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon visited Copenhagen last year to bolster cooperation in public transportation and observe its bicycle infrastructure.</p><p>As Copenhagen aims to be the world's first carbon-neutral city by 2025, it has promoted collaboration and open communication between diverse players for transparent and effective city development and management.</p><p>The combined efforts of municipalities, businesses and society have turned the dilapidated industrial city into a vibrant green city since 2000.</p><p>Denmark's master plans target public transportation, mixed area use, social housing, energy-efficient buildings, and big data monitoring, helping to attract business with a long-term and stable investment climate.</p><p>Like most other cities around the world, Copenhagen's growth in the latter half of the 20th century entailed severe traffic congestion and air pollution. To relieve the situation, the municipal government invested heavily in uninterrupted cycle lanes and public transportation, which continue to be key aspects of urban governance.</p><p>According to the State of Green \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a Danish green technology promotional agency \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 half of all work and school trips in Copenhagen involve cycling. This has reduced travel time, noise, air pollution and carbon dioxide emissions, improving citizens' health while reducing health care costs. Cycling-related injuries decreased by over 70 percent since 2005, thanks to bicycle-friendly infrastructure and a safe driving culture.</p><p>Copenhagen's integrated city governance is based on a holistic partnership between planners, city councilors, architects, engineers, investors, contractors, builders and citizens.</p><p>Since the early 2000s, the city government transformed the polluted harbor into a clean recreational waterfront by modernizing the sewage system, initiating a cleaning program and constructing harbor baths. Citizens now swim, sail and fish in the Copenhagen Harbor year round. Adjacent property prices increased by nearly 60 percent and flooding risks have decreased.</p><p>As a prime example of waterfront renovation, the Nordhavnen industrial harbor, comprised of islets and canals on Copenhagen's eastern shore, is being turned into a dense city district accommodating 40,000 residents and 40,000 work spaces.</p><p>A \"smart city\" prototype, it will use CO2-neutral energy solutions, smart grids, district heating and cooling, and public transit systems integrating bike paths, pedestrian walkways and subways.</p><p>All buildings in Copenhagen were required to join the district heating scheme as part of an integrated municipal energy control system since 1993. District heating is one of the most carbon-efficient ways to produce and supply energy locally, and lowers CO2 emissions by 40 percent compared to gas and 50 percent compared to oil boilers.</p><p>To combat the rising inner-city temperature from global warming, Copenhagen built two district cooling networks, which produce and distribute cooled water to buildings through underground pipelines. It reduces dependence on air-conditioning, saving 14,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year.

It eliminates 99 percent of duties on both sides within five years and covers non-tariff barriers. More than 35 bilateral consultation channels run throughout the year to enhance cooperation in multiple areas.</p><p>As Strategic Partners since 2010, the EU and Korea have three key agreements: the FTA, the Framework Agreement and the agreement on Crisis Management Operation. The Framework Agreement addresses international issues, such as nuclear nonproliferation, human rights, terrorism, climate change, energy security and development assistance, as well as science and technology, innovation, environment and education.</p><p>Speaking in front of journalists on Tuesday, EU Ambassador to Korea Gerhard Sabathil stressed, \"There is a certain gap in information and knowledge about each other.\" He added that the delegation coordinates the functions of the 22 EU embassies in Korea over political dialogue, the FTA, cultural promotion and educational exchange through the Erasmus Plus program.</p><p>\"In Europe, Korean conglomerates \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 Samsung, Hyundai and Kia \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 are very well known, but many Europeans don't know these companies are Korean,\" he said. \"At the same time, Koreans know well about France, Germany and Italy, but not enough about new EU members such as Poland, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Cyprus and the Czech Republic.\"</p><p>EU Ambassador to Korea Gerhard Sabathil at a luncheon meeting with reporters last Tuesday. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)</p><p>The delegation cooperates closely with all embassies to promote their culture, policies and products, Sabathil added, noting that Europe's integration experience could be applied to help the two Koreas' reunification.</p><p>Regarding North Korea's nuclear threats, Sabathil underlined that the EU had engaged in a \"critical dialogue\" with Pyongyang for more than 15 years. The EU has asked China to take \"bolder actions\" on Pyongyang's denuclearization and to stop sending refugees back to North Korea, where they face harsh punishment.</p><p>During his four-day trip to the North in June for the 14th EU-DPRK Political Dialogue, the diplomat said he addressed the \"extreme lack\" of human rights and humanitarian provisions, alongside denuclearization, exchanging separated family visits and peninsular reunification.</p><p>He said he strongly urged the Pyongyang leadership to separate politics from humanitarian issues, including that of the families separated by the Korean War.</p><p>\"I have a lot of empathy and compassion regarding the situation here,\" he said, mentioning his youth in West Germany during the Cold War. Sabathil, who has German and Hungarian nationalities, said he had experience of the situation across the Berlin Wall, and visited his grandmother who lived there.</p><p>\"We had nuclear threats and humanitarian problems across the communist bloc, but the overall situation was much better than North Korea,\" the envoy underscored. \"We had family reunions immediately after the Berlin Wall was erected. The Easterners couldn't go to the West, but the West Germans could go to the East.\"</p><p>The U.K., Germany, Sweden, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania and the Czech Republic have embassies in Pyongyang, which are under \"very harsh\" conditions: the European diplomats receive severe restrictions on movement, poor heating and frequent electricity cuts, according to media reports.</p><p>On climate adaptation, the ambassador claimed that green growth presented significant opportunities for new technologies, research and investment.</p><p>\"Europe has been a world leader in climate policies, and the Paris climate agreement was a great success,\" he said. \"As Korea has a large industrial economy, it can contribute much more to reducing greenhouse gas through the Emissions Trading Scheme.\"</p><p>As a major pillar of climate policy, the EU operates its greenhouse Emission Trading Scheme \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the world's first and largest \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 which taxes electricity producers for carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>Using the \"cap and trade\" principle, a limit is set on the total amount of greenhouse gases that can be released by all participating power stations; then \"allowances\" for emissions are sold, allocated for free, or subsequently traded, which ensures cost-effective emissions reductions.</p><p>Noting that Korea is \"far behind\" the OECD average in its response to global warming, where it is ranked 54th out of 58 countries on the 2016 Climate Change Performance Index, Sabathil argued that increasing the share of renewable energies would cut down carbon footprint and dependence on oil and gas imports, while boosting economic growth.</p><p>Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.c</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5HXP-V431-DYX6-B07V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>January 24, 2016 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>Business &amp;

There has been some action, with organizations such as ASEAN and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperationworking on areas such as harmonizing food control and safety,and good agricultural practice. However, the region still lacks clear and enforceable standards for food quality.National food safety policies are often weakly enforced, and need updating to international standards.</p><p>The upshot is a rising number of people sickened and killed by bad food, and correspondingly high public health bills. Data on Asia's food quality is scarce, as this is an emerging problem. However, bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals in food can cause over 200 diseases, including cancer.</p><p>The World Health Organization says that as many as 700,000 children die of diarrhea each year in its South East Asia region, many of them after eating unsafe food. Disturbingly, 40% of all people sickened by food-borne illnesses are children.</p><p>Why is so much of our food unsafe to eat? Pressure to grow enough food for urban consumers is one factor. To meet demand, Asia's low-tech, labor-intensive farms are using more chemical fertilizers and pesticides, contaminating soil and waterways with toxins such as lead and arsenic, which find their way into food. In South Asia - which has the region's largest number of malnourished children - around 43% of agricultural land is degraded, much of it due to inappropriate farming and processing practices such as the unregulated use of chemicals, hormones and preservatives.</p><p>Another issue is the journey from farm to table. Farmers often live a long way - perhaps even in different countries - from city consumers. Asia's frequently humid weather compounds the problem. Poor storage, handling and transport logistics - many countries lack adequate cold-storage and transport facilities - cause half the vegetables produced in developing Asia to spoil before reaching market.</p><p>Some of this rotten food makes it to market, where it can be bought and eaten. The unspoiled food may have had its shelf life extended by preservatives such as formaldehyde, also used as a medical disinfectant or an embalming agent.Climate change compounds the risks, as fluctuating temperatures make it harder to maintain quality along the production chain.Moreover, Asia now appears to be in the grip of El Nino, which could bring drought that threatens agriculture, which needs water for irrigation.</p><p>Fixing Asia's food safety problem won't be easy. The good news is that measures to deliver enough food for Asia's millionswould also lift the quality of their food.</p><p>To tackle food safety at source, greater efforts are needed to reduce environmental degradation, particularly of waterways and agricultural land. Asia's smallholder farms - 87% of the world's 500 million smallholdings - desperately need modernizing. Part of this is introducing enforceable regulations on the use of chemicals in pesticides and fertilizer. Farmers also need more support for climate adaptation measures including drought-resistant and salt-tolerant seed varieties.</p><p>Post-harvest, vast investments are needed to improve the storage and transport of food at each stage of the production chain. Investment by both public and private sectors in infrastructure such as storage and cold chains will lift safety standards, while helping millions of smallholders find dependable markets for their produce.</p><p>This could spur the creation of well-organized wholesale markets - like Frischezentrum Frankfurt, Rungis in Paris and Mercasa in Madrid - which provide safe and nutritious food for consumers through seamless linkages with millions of producers and suppliers.</p><p>Asia's increasingly complex production chains demand regional action to improve food safety. Greater Mekong Subregion countries are addressing this by cooperatingon betterfood handling and inspection systems.</p><p>But more work is needed to harmonize food standards regionally, given the expanding cross-border trade in food. Governments should partner with private firms on certification systems for farms and retailers that provide safe food.</p><p>Private testing facilities could play a role, as happens in developed marketslike Australia, Europe, and the United States where firms helpthe food industry achieve compliance with a range of safety standards. This typically does not happen in developing Asia where the priority is too often crop quantity rather than quality.</p><p>Consumers will pay a premium for safe food, so in the long-term everyone benefits. To achieve this win-win, we need to take action now.</p><p>Bambang Susantono is vice president for Knowledge Management and Sustainable Development, Asian Development Bank.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H58-SVK1-DYTP-W0MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 14, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000CP72</classCode><className>FOOD SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D0FD</classCode><className>FOOD SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C3XM</classCode><className>PRODUCT SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000156</classCode><className>BACTERIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp;

Nonprofit organizations such as State of Green promote Danish green technologies internationally.</p><p>\"The point of departure came in 2011 when a sudden downpour caused damage to Copenhagen costing in the billions (of dollars),\" said urban renewal project manager Rene Sommer Lindsay. \"The event transformed the city's political climate, ironically being 'the best disaster ever' in arousing consciousness about climate adaptation.\"</p><p>In Copenhagen's neighborhood of Sankt Kjelds Kvarter, town renewal combines citizen participation and city government assistance. Creative design solutions \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 rain gardens, green roofs, water towers, walkways and bike paths \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 were incorporated into landscape architecture.</p><p>Using detailed hydrological maps, 300 projects costing $1.5 billion were also launched, increasing roads, pipelines, retention areas and green spaces to deal with cloudbursts and floods.</p><p>Wastewater is a valuable resource in Denmark, a country known for energy efficiency. Rather than relying on the city's centralized system, wastewater is treated locally across rural villages and small-town production facilities.</p><p>In Denmark's second-largest city of Aarhus, a wastewater plant functions as a power plant.</p><p>\"The Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant is Denmark's leading bio-refinery generating excess electricity and heat,\" operations manager Flemming Husum said whil introducing the plant's outdoor purification tanks.</p><p>\"We use the newest sludge tanks made by Danfoss Power Electronics for fine bubble aeration. It reduces energy consumption and creates a surplus 3,000 kilowatts of 'green electricity' per day.\"</p><p>Grundfos engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares (right) speaks to reporters at the Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen, where wastewater is treated directly on the hospital premises. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)</p><p>The phosphorous in the wastewater is used as fertilizer, while the biogas is used to heat water that is pumped to municipal companies for a fee, along with 40 percent of the electricity generated.</p><p>The Aarhus Water company covers all aspects of the city's water services: supply, pipeline logistics, storm water management and wastewater treatment.</p><p>After nitrogen, phosphorous and other organic matters are removed, the purified water is released into streams, he explained.</p><p>In the small town of Kolt-Hasselager southwest of Aarhus, new residential and industrial buildings have sprouted up in recent years, increasing demand for water. Several new waterworks were built using cutting edge valves made by water equipment company AVK Group.</p><p>\"We remove iron, manganese, ammonium, nitrites and nitrates from water and use automatic sand filters to prevent bacterial growth,\" operations manager Allan Jensen said. \"Protecting waterworks from burglary and vandalism are our top priorities, and we use video surveillance, safety checks and alarms.\"</p><p>Currently, 15,000 townspeople drink water supplied by AVK, and about 100 attend annual meetings for budget and planning.</p><p>Denmark has decided to stop hospitals releasing pharmaceutical waste into local watercourses. Recognizing conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove the materials, one company developed a decentralized solution.</p><p>The Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen uses a $7 million Grundfos Biobooster, which treats wastewater directly on the premises with only five hours of weekly maintenance.</p><p>Engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares said the Biobooster treated 90 percent of chemical components, filtering out 99 percent of each one.</p><p>\"Our practice will set a benchmark for European Union and other countries,\" he added.</p><p>At the end of the 15-day process, a charcoal-like waste is created and incinerated.

Nonprofit organizations such as State of Green promote Danish green technologies internationally.</p><p>\"The point of departure came in 2011 when a sudden downpour caused damage to Copenhagen costing in the billions (of dollars),\" said urban renewal project manager Rene Sommer Lindsay. \"The event transformed the city's political climate, ironically being 'the best disaster ever' in arousing consciousness about climate adaptation.\"</p><p>In Copenhagen's neighborhood of Sankt Kjelds Kvarter, town renewal combines citizen participation and city government assistance. Creative design solutions \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 rain gardens, green roofs, water towers, walkways and bike paths \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 were incorporated into landscape architecture.</p><p>Using detailed hydrological maps, 300 projects costing $1.5 billion were also launched, increasing roads, pipelines, retention areas and green spaces to deal with cloudbursts and floods.</p><p>Wastewater is a valuable resource in Denmark, a country known for energy efficiency. Rather than relying on the city's centralized system, wastewater is treated locally across rural villages and small-town production facilities.</p><p>In Denmark's second-largest city of Aarhus, a wastewater plant functions as a power plant.</p><p>\"The Marselisborg Wastewater Treatment Plant is Denmark's leading bio-refinery generating excess electricity and heat,\" operations manager Flemming Husum said while introducing the plant's outdoor purification tanks.</p><p>\"We use the newest sludge tanks made by Danfoss Power Electronics for fine bubble aeration. It reduces energy consumption and creates a surplus 3,000 kilowatts of 'green electricity' per day.\"</p><p>Grundfos engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares (right) speaks to reporters at the Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen, where wastewater is treated directly on the hospital premises. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)</p><p>The phosphorous in the wastewater is used as fertilizer, while the biogas is used to heat water that is pumped to municipal companies for a fee, along with 40 percent of the electricity generated.</p><p>The Aarhus Water company covers all aspects of the city's water services: supply, pipeline logistics, storm water management and wastewater treatment.</p><p>After nitrogen, phosphorous and other organic matters are removed, the purified water is released into streams, he explained.</p><p>In the small town of Kolt-Hasselager southwest of Aarhus, new residential and industrial buildings have sprouted up in recent years, increasing demand for water. Several new waterworks were built using cutting edge valves made by water equipment company AVK Group.</p><p>\"We remove iron, manganese, ammonium, nitrites and nitrates from water and use automatic sand filters to prevent bacterial growth,\" operations manager Allan Jensen said. \"Protecting waterworks from burglary and vandalism are our top priorities, and we use video surveillance, safety checks and alarms.\"</p><p>Currently, 15,000 townspeople drink water supplied by AVK, and about 100 attend annual meetings for budget and planning.</p><p>Denmark has decided to stop hospitals releasing pharmaceutical waste into local watercourses. Recognizing conventional wastewater treatment cannot remove the materials, one company developed a decentralized solution.</p><p>The Herlev Hospital near Copenhagen uses a $7 million Grundfos Biobooster, which treats wastewater directly on the premises with only five hours of weekly maintenance.</p><p>Engineer Jose Antonio Gil Linares said the Biobooster treated 90 percent of chemical components, filtering out 99 percent of each one.</p><p>\"Our practice will set a benchmark for European Union and other countries,\" he added.</p><p>At the end of the 15-day process, a charcoal-like waste is created and incinerated. The bacteria-free water is discharged into surrounding watercourses.</p><p>At the Technical University of Denmark in the city of Kongens Lyngby, north of Copenhagen, researchers are investigating sustainable ways of managing urban water cycles.</p><p>\"We are not only 'forecasting' climate change, but 'nowcasting' its impact using real-time monitoring,\" said professor Barth Smets, head of international research relations. \"We combine education, innovation and consultancy in our research agenda to create value for society.\"</p><p>Hwang Yu-hoon, a postdoctoral fellow in DTU's environmental engineering department, has researched purifying contaminated groundwater using nanoparticles. He received his undergraduate and graduate degrees from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.</p><p>\"The school enables total concentration on research with its horizontal atmosphere,\" Hwang said. \"Open discussions encourage students to lead initiatives.\"</p><p>Another asset is flexible and family-centered work hours allowing early departure for picking up children from child care centers and telecommuting.</p><p>In contrast to American engineering schools, which focus on developing new technologies, DTU optimizes solutions for existing technologies, according to Hwang. \"We provide solutions wanted by the industries and collaborate with them. Students gain valuable experience.\"</p><p>Studying in Denmark is convenient for Korean students, he said, as most Danes speak English. \"But if you don't speak Danish, making close friends with locals might be difficult.\"</p><p>By Joel Lee, Korea Herald correspondent (joel@heraldcorp.c</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FMR-K111-JCF4-M00R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-03-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"935\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 30, 2015 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0004G2M</classCode><className>CREATIVE DESIGN SOLUTIONS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC7372 PREPACKAGED SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSB8</classCode><className>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp;

People drink water from the tap, swim in city harbors and ride bicycles everywhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world's happiest nation is also one of the greenest, not accidentally, and aims to create a \"fully green economy\" by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a lecture on July 11, Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann said Denmark and Korea should invigorate their partnership for a shared sustainable future by turning the threat of climate change into resourceful opportunities.</p><p>\"Our experience shows that through persistent and active policies prioritizing renewable energy, it is possible to sustain high economic growth,\" Lehmann told students of the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership FoundationKorea at Kyung Hee University.</p><p>\"It is critical for the young generation to lead the future of green growth by setting the direction of development.\"</p><p>Students of the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership FoundationKorea listen to a lecture by Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehmann at Kyung Hee University on July 11. Joel Lee/The Korea Herald</p><p>Green growth does not have to come at a cost to business, asserted Lehmann, adding that jobs could be created by promoting green technologies and protecting the environment.</p><p>Since signing the \"Energy 2020\" agreement in 2012, which aims for a 100 percent green economy, 4,700 jobs were created in Denmark by the end of 2013. By 2020, the archipelago nation would produce half its electricity from renewable sources through additional 6,000 to 8,000 \"green jobs.\"</p><p>\"The transition required a broad consensus and political will,\" the ambassador stressed. \"Public opinion has been very important, with our nongovernmental organizations engaging in debates, setting agendas and shaping policies.\"</p><p>The role of cities has been equally essential. As more than 70 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions come from cities, Copenhagen has committed to be the world's first CO2-neutral capital by 2025.</p><p>The Kingdom of Denmark -- which consists of Denmark, The Faroe Islands and Greenland -- has a long tradition of investing in and developing resource-efficient solutions for energy, environment and climate.</p><p>As a market leader in green technologies, Danish companies have exported their innovations worldwide, spearheading the global sustainable effort. Denmark aims for over $15 billion in exports of green technologies by 2020.</p><p>The country's transformation followed the 1973 global oil crisis, which doubled the price of oil and raised alarm bells about national energy security.</p><p>The first national energy plan was formulated in 1976 with a focus on reducing energy consumption and oil dependence, and after the second oil crisis in 1979, an energy ministry was inaugurated.</p><p>Denmark set a plan to \"decouple\" energy consumption and economic growth in 1981. Since then, the country's economy has grown by 80 percent, while energy consumption has remained the same and carbon dioxide emissions have decreased.</p><p>The Nordic nation now has one of the lowest levels of per capita energy consumption in the developed world, with the highest efficiency. Wind power produces 20 percent of total energy, and is expected to generate half of its electricity by 2020.</p><p>\"Where Denmark has been a 'first mover' in the green transition, Korea has proven to be a 'fast mover,'\" Lehmann noted, referring to the Korean-Danish Green Growth Alliance established in 2011 for increased cooperation in government, research and trade. \"Our alliance shows that we can share our experiences and draw upon each other's strengths.\"</p><p>On the \"green transition index,\" Denmark outperforms Korea in energy, environment, diplomacy, commercialization, investment, innovation, agriculture, tourism, biodiversity and climate adaptation; and Korea tops Denmark in fisheries, forestry, transport and construction.</p><p>The fifth meeting of the KDGGA will be held this fall in Denmark, and the Global Green Growth Forum will host a summit in Copenhagen next year.</p><p>Denmark has taken a nonnuclear path since the 1980s following a parliamentary decision. Sweden's nuclear plant across the sea from Copenhagen triggered public debates about the safety and security of nuclear power.</p><p>\"Looking directly at a nuclear plant across the sea raised doubts about having the technology at home,\" the ambassador explained, adding that civilian resistance had been forceful.</p><p>\"Nuclear energy will always pose challenges in safety and cost, as its wastes must be contained for over 100,000 years.\"</p><p>Lehmann claimed that the nuclear debate was related to the price of electricity, which he argued was a \"political matter\" as much as an \"economic matter.\"</p><p>\"The price of electricity was determined socially and politically in Denmark,\" he emphasized. \"This is where public debate can happen. Despite opposition, we set in motion priorities and incentives for change.\"</p><p>Raising the price of electricity would incentivize companies and people to save energy, the ambassador argued, while pointing out that electricity in Korea was cheaper than in many other countries.</p><p>\"The question is how cheap should it be? This is a political question for Korea,\" he said. \"In Denmark, there was much skepticism in the beginning, but people stuck to their visions and policies, because they believed it was the right thing to do.\"</p><p>The Scandinavian country is currently a global leader in the \"circular economy,\" which runs on recycled biological nutrients. The Kalundborg Symbiosis in Denmark trades residual industrial products -- steam, dust, gas, heat and slurry -- through public-private partnerships.</p><p>Danish company Grundfos is a world-leading pump manufacturer in heating, air-conditioning and sewage. It provides circulator pumps to 90 percent of Korea's skyscrapers.</p><p>Wind power generator Vesta supplies over 48,000 turbines in more than 70 countries, covering 70 percent of plants in Korea.</p><p>In the ocean industry, the Maersk Group, the world's largest containership and supply vessel operator, has strong cooperation with Korean companies. Daewoo Shipbuilding &amp; Marine Engineering ordered 20 Maersk Triple-E Vessels in 2011, which emit half the carbon dioxide of competitors.</p><p>By Joel Lee (joel@heraldcorp.c</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5GGD-BBR1-DYX6-B501-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>July 19, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

By 2020, the archipelago nation would produce half its electricity from renewable sources through additional 6,000 to 8,000 \"green jobs.\"</p><p>\"The transition required a broad consensus and political will,\" the ambassador stressed. \"Public opinion has been very important, with our nongovernmental organizations engaging in debates, setting agendas and shaping policies.\"</p><p>The role of cities has been equally essential. As more than 70 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions come from cities, Copenhagen has committed to be the world's first CO2-neutral capital by 2025.</p><p>The Kingdom of Denmark \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 which consists of Denmark, The Faroe Islands and Greenland \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 has a long tradition of investing in and developing resource-efficient solutions for energy, environment and climate.</p><p>As a market leader in green technologies, Danish companies have exported their innovations worldwide, spearheading the global sustainable effort. Denmark aims for over $15 billion in exports of green technologies by 2020.</p><p>The country's transformation followed the 1973 global oil crisis, which doubled the price of oil and raised alarm bells about national energy security.</p><p>The first national energy plan was formulated in 1976 with a focus on reducing energy consumption and oil dependence, and after the second oil crisis in 1979, an energy ministry was inaugurated.</p><p>Denmark set a plan to \"decouple\" energy consumption and economic growth in 1981. Since then, the country's economy has grown by 80 percent, while energy consumption has remained the same and carbon dioxide emissions have decreased.</p><p>Students of the Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership FoundationKorea listen to a lecture by Danish Ambassador Thomas Lehman at Kyung Hee University on July 11. (Joel Lee/The Korea Herald)</p><p>The Nordic nation now has one of the lowest levels of per capita energy consumption in the developed world, with the highest efficiency. Wind power produces 20 percent of total energy, and is expected to generate half of its electricity by 2020.</p><p>\"Where Denmark has been a 'first mover' in the green transition, Korea has proven to be a 'fast mover,'\" Lehmann noted, referring to the Korean-Danish Green Growth Alliance established in 2011 for increased cooperation in government, research and trade. \"Our alliance shows that we can share our experiences and draw upon each other's strengths.\"</p><p>On the \"green transition index,\" Denmark outperforms Korea in energy, environment, diplomacy, commercialization, investment, innovation, agriculture, tourism, biodiversity and climate adaptation; and Korea tops Denmark in fisheries, forestry, transport and construction.</p><p>The fifth meeting of the KDGGA will be held this fall in Denmark, and the Global Green Growth Forum will host a summit in Copenhagen next year.</p><p>Denmark has taken a nonnuclear path since the 1980s following a parliamentary decision. Sweden's nuclear plant across the sea from Copenhagen triggered public debates about the safety and security of nuclear power.</p><p>\"Looking directly at a nuclear plant across the sea raised doubts about having the technology at home,\" the ambassador explained, adding that civilian resistance had been forceful.</p><p>\"Nuclear energy will always pose challenges in safety and cost, as its wastes must be contained for over 100,000 years.\"</p><p>Lehmann claimed that the nuclear debate was related to the price of electricity, which he argued was a \"political matter\" as much as an \"economic matter.\"</p><p>\"The price of electricity was determined socially and politically in Denmark,\" he emphasized. \"This is where public debate can happen. Despite opposition, we set in motion priorities and incentives for change.\"</p><p>Raising the price of electricity would incentivize companies and people to save energy, the ambassador argued, while pointing out that electricity in Korea was cheaper than in many other countries.</p><p>\"The question is how cheap should it be? This is a political question for Korea,\" he said. \"In Denmark, there was much skepticism in the beginning, but people stuck to their visions and policies, because they believed it was the right thing to do.\"</p><p>The Scandinavian country is currently a global leader in the \"circular economy,\" which runs on recycled biological nutrients. The Kalundborg Symbiosis in Denmark trades residual industrial products \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 steam, dust, gas, heat and slurry \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 through public-private partnerships.</p><p>Danish company Grundfos is a world-leading pump manufacturer in heating, air-conditioning and sewage.

The level and scale of enthusiasm it generated augurs well for global climate action and for future generations. This new momentum must now translate into real action in Asia and the Pacific.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leaders at the summit offered commitments that will feed into the U.N. Climate Change Conference to be held in Paris next year. Some categorically committed to cut emissions, and called for greater action to limit the rise in global temperaturesto less than 2 degrees Celsius. Initial commitments at the summit for the capitalization of the Green Climate Fund amounted to more than $2.3 billion, with new multi-stakeholder partnerships registered for low carbon and climate resilient development finance, amounting to almost $200 billion. It s a good start, but much more is needed. To support the public commitments, calls have been made for greater engagement by financial institutions, the insurance sector and institutional investors, who hold enormous global and regional savings which can service the risk and long-term capital requirements of climate adaptation and mitigation projects.</p><p>The summit also overwhelmingly supported carbon pricing as a tool to reduce emissions and to improve sustainability, as well as economic growth prospects. Equally heartening were the cross-sectoral, multi-stakeholder coalitions which emerged, from the Global Agricultural Alliance to secure food for rapidly growing populations, to the dozens of governments, businesses, civil society groups and indigenous peoples who pledged to end deforestation by 2030.</p><p>The clearest and most pertinent message from the summit was that climate change is a global threat and must be tackled by global partnerships for a more sustainable future.</p><p>The U.N. secretary-general reminded us that the human, environmental and financial cost of climate change is fast becoming unbearable. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>emphasized that the cost of inaction is far greater than the cost of action. No region of the world knows this better than Asia and the Pacific, where there is a compelling case for urgent climate action.</p><p>Between 1980 and 2009 the people of Asia and the Pacific shouldered the burden of 85 percent of global deaths and 38 percent of global economic losses due to natural disasters. Just weeks ago, heavy monsoon rains and floods across Pakistan caused more than 300 deaths and impacted more than 1.8 million people. Typhoon Haiyan caused the death of more than 8,000 people in the central Philippines last year, with an estimated $15 billion in damages. We are witnessing some of the worst disasters in recorded history, and they are destroying the lives and livelihoods of millions across our region.</p><p>Resource and carbon-intensive economies are also economically vulnerable. The Asia-Pacific region uses three times more resources to produce one unit of GDP than the rest of the world. We are not only the region most vulnerable to climate-related disasters, but also to resource-price volatility. As resource costs rise, the economic impacts are most severe on the poorest and vulnerable in our region. More than 42 million people in Asia and the Pacific were pushed back into poverty due to rising energy and food prices in 2011 alone.</p><p>Innovative climate action to improve our region s energy and resource efficiency not only reduces emissions, but will also drive sustainable economic growth in the face of rising resource prices, generating jobs and reducing poverty while increasing long-term resilience to natural disasters and the impacts of rising resource costs.</p><p>Turning resource constraints and the climate crisis into opportunities for economic growth and poverty reduction, Asia-Pacific countries have adopted pioneering strategies to promote green growth and environmentally sustainable approaches, while strengthening regional integration and cooperation to address risks and vulnerabilities, which include disasters, climate change and resource constraints, alongside improving trade, finance and investments, as well as physical infrastructure connectivity.</p><p>At the summit, China affirmed its aim to reduce carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 45 percent compared to 2005. Fiji spoke of their green growth strategy, already in place, and ambitions to generate all electricity from renewable resources by 2030. Malaysia and Indonesia are reforming fossil fuel subsidies to encourage a shift to cleaner energy. Mongolia plans to reach 20-25 percent of total energy production from renewables by 2020. These are but some examples of the already strong regional climate actions taking place.</p><p>But change is not happening fast enough. We need to massively scale up these actions, not only to match the magnitude and urgency of climate impacts, but also to harness the economic growth and opportunities which climate action entails.</p><p>The U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific will continue to urge leaders in the region to seize the opportunity to intensify national climate actions and commitments, and to work even more closely together to make our vision of the sustainable, prosperous and resilient future we want a reality. Moving the climate frontier from negotiations and commitment to real action is not only urgent but also opens a new window of sustainable development opportunity for all in Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>Dr. Shamshad Akhtar is an under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

The region has demonstrated great resilience during the economic and financial crisis, contributing about 70 percent of world growth between 2008 and 2011.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet the region's growth is now in a challenging phase. The 2014 Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific, the flagship publication of the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), forecasts for a third successive year that growth will be below 6 percent in the region's developing economies. However, this figure conceals wide variations: The 2014 growth forecasts for major developing economies range from 7.5 percent for China to just 0.3 percent for the Russian Federation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The anaemic recovery in the developed world is influencing regional growth dynamics, given the weak implementation of policy responses. Yet overcoming domestic structural impediments is also vital. Widespread poverty, rising inequality, social inequity and environmental degradation are hurdles to be cleared before the region can set itself on the fast track to genuine growth that is stable and inclusive.</p><p>ESCAP's research highlights new evidence about the nature of these challenges:</p><p>- On the external front, the ongoing normalization of monetary policy by the U.S. Federal Reserve poses continuing challenges for the development of the Asia-Pacific region. But these challenges can be mitigated with stronger macroprudential policies and flexible exchange rate management. Financial volatility is of concern to India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Russian Federation, Thailand and Turkey, where annual growth could decline by between 0.7 and 0.9 percent.</p><p>- If the G20 continues to delay implementation of standstill commitments on trade protectionism, Asia-Pacific export growth will be affected. Trade restrictions have already deprived the region of an estimated $255 billion in export opportunities between 2009 and 2013 (counting goods only and not services), representing more than 1.6 percent of regional GDP.</p><p>- On the domestic side, negative growth will lead to joblessness if countries do not implement labor-market programs that effectively align and strengthen education, training and skills with the requirements of employers. Between 2009 and 2013, employment grew only 1.3 percent, compared with the average GDP growth of 6.4 percent in developing Asia-Pacific economies.</p><p>- Without adequate social protection systems, quality education, better access to credit and land, and stronger labor-market institutions, developing countries will be unable to tackle rising inequality. Since the 1990s, regional inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient has risen from 29.9 to 36.8. The wealth of 0.001 percent of the Asia-Pacific population is 17 times greater than the combined GDP of the 12 least developed countries in the region.</p><p>Fast-tracking the closure of physical infrastructure gaps and social development deficits will augment the region's growth potential. About $800 billion to $900 billion in annual investments are needed for national and cross-border infrastructure for transportation, telecommunications, energy, water and sanitation.</p><p>Needs for stronger social protection remain unmet. Almost half the countries in the region spend less than 2 percent of their GDP on social protection programs, but this is enough for only about 40 percent of the population.</p><p>Environmental degradation is already taking a toll on growth, as evidenced by the estimated environmental costs to India of almost 6 percent of the country's annual GDP. Another priority to ensure sustainable growth is to better address climate change. For this it is necessary to implement climate adaptation and mitigation measures in a more active way.</p><p>Enhancing productive and countercyclical spending is critical to offer a short-term stimulus and to remove domestic structural constraints. It is also vital to make growth more inclusive and environmentally friendly.</p><p>To unlock fiscal space, countries also have to increase tax revenues. In several countries in the region, tax-to-GDP ratios approach the single digits. By way of comparison, this ratio ranges from 25 to 35 percent or more in developed countries.</p><p>The good news is that tax-to-GDP ratios can be raised. In many Asia-Pacific countries, the gap between potential and actual tax collection is more than 5 percent of GDP. Closing existing tax gaps in 16 developing Asia-Pacific economies could increase revenues by more than $300 billion - this would boost tax revenues more than 70 percent in some countries. Key among measures to strengthen tax revenues are broadening the tax base, rationalizing tax rates, and careful sequencing of tax reforms.</p><p>As domestic tax revenues are also affected by policies in other countries, greater regional cooperation and stronger national tax administration can curb tax avoidance and evasion, among other problems. Developing Asia-Pacific countries accounted for more than 60 per cent of the $5.9 trillion in global illicit capital outflows between 2001 and 2010.</p><p>An Asia-Pacific tax forum to coordinate regional action on these concerns is therefore an idea whose time has come. As the largest and most inclusive intergovernmental forum for Asia-Pacific countries, ESCAP is well-positioned to host such a body.</p><p>Creating the fiscal space for productive and countercyclical spending can help developing countries in the region move toward implementing the G20 global growth compact that the international community adopted last year. This is needed to accelerate progress toward the United Nations Millennium Development Goals and set developing countries on course not only to meeting those goals, but moving beyond them by implementing the post-2015 development agenda.</p><p>The author is an under-secretary-general of the United Nations and executive secretary of the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP).

I could see a lot right beside the sea. The area has been converted into a theme park and a great variety of dinosaur models were on display.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It made me think of the time when they wandered around freely and ruled the planet. They were giant, numerous, invincible and were present on almost all continents. All this made me think about the great corporations of our time and specifically General Motors.</p><p>There is a great deal of similarity between GM and dinosaurs. Just like dinosaurs, GM was once a mighty corporation. It had operations around the world and was able to snuff out competition wherever it went because of its financial strength.</p><p>It produced various models that were quickly embraced by people. It was ahead of its time and various automobile innovations can be attributed to the research conducted by GM. But somewhere down the road that innovative and enterprising spirit changed to arrogance.</p><p>GM found out that instead of building modern, fuel-efficient and environment-friendly cars, it could influence the environment policy. Its executives dictated the standards set in Washington so that GM could sell more of its gas-guzzlers.</p><p>It was all going well until the time that Toyota in Japan and Hyundai in Korea started to think differently. They started making better and fuel-efficient cars. And soon efficient and durable cars from Toyota and Hyundai replaced the gas-guzzling, chrome-laden \"Detroit iron.\"</p><p>GM on the other hand continued to be arrogant. They took pride in their financial strength and were sheltered by the protectionist policies of the American government. However, consumers all over the world started to shift toward the Japanese and Korean cars.</p><p>Although consumers are brand-conscious, they are usually very careful with their money. When they buy any automobile they seek efficiency and seek to minimize running costs. GM could not offer a better deal compared to Toyota or Hyundai. It could not read the pulse of its customers.</p><p>The dinosaurs were no different, they simply could not adapt when the external environment changed. As long as it was favourable they ruled the planet. But there was a problem.</p><p>The dinosaurs were cold-blooded, which meant that they could not regulate their body temperature. So as the external environment changed they could not survive. In the present day the only descendants of the dinosaurs can be found in the sky.</p><p>Only a few of the species developed wings and could migrate to a favorable climate. Adaptation is the key to survival, be it the biological world or the corporate world.</p><p>As we can see with GM and dinosaurs, that size does not guarantee success - it is efficiency and the ability to change that increases the probability of success. I remember Rick Wagoner, the ex-CEO of GM, appearing in an interview on TV few years ago.</p><p>He was asked the reason as to why GM is not building fuel-efficient cars. He simply replied that his research team had done a consumer survey and they build cars according to needs of the consumers. And according to them, consumers were willing to spend on fuel. They required bigger and apparently safer cars.</p><p>I think he saw safety in size. If size were so important then dinosaurs would definitely have outlived cockroaches. This statement clearly suggests a lack of vision on the part of the leader of such a behemoth. I welcome the decision by the American government to show him the door.</p><p>Although it is my belief that governments should not interfere in the matters of private corporations, in this case the government intervened as the majority shareholder and had every right to take such a decision.</p><p>The problem with all automakers is one of overcapacity. The projections predicting the strong growth in demand went haywire as a result of turmoil in the financial sector. As an automobile is a discretionary item, people stopped buying new cars.</p><p>The only way to overcome this demand destruction is either a reduction in production or finding new markets. This means immediate layoffs and selling unproductive assets. The best way forward for GM might be Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Then it can probably re-emerge from it leaner and more efficient.</p><p>Even the dinosaurs re-emerged as birds. They were small but efficient and could survive till today. So whenever someone tells me that this corporation is so big that it is completely insulated from any crisis, I ask them if they remember the dinosaurs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VMJ-4ND0-Y9NY-R0NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"745\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 28, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001WKB</classCode><className>HYUNDAI CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0001W5P</classCode><className>HYUNDAI MOTOR CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC3711 MOTOR VEHICLES &amp;

In other cases, ESG issues were viewed as compliance requirements, or perhaps good public relations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But more often than not, these issues were managed as secondary activities with an indirect connection to the core business and bottom line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All of that is changing. The market today is undergoing a significant shift, with companies increasingly expected to address ESG issues head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the same time, many are recognizing both the tangible and intangible value of integrating these issues into core business activities. Commitment of human and financial capital to this area continues to grow, especially among companies that see clear impacts on their value chain.</p><p>In a recent Deloitte survey ('ESG survey') of 250 business executives about these issues, three drivers of ESG imperatives were identified: a need to bolster the corporate reputation and brand, increased regulatory scrutiny, and higher expectations from consumers and the broader community.</p><p>Most of the surveyed executives expect ESG issues to have a growing impact on their strategies, products and services, and operations over the next two years.</p><p>Not surprisingly, large companies (with more than $10 billion in revenue) foresee the greatest impact. These companies tend to operate across industries and geographies where the social and environmental issues are most acutely visible.</p><p>Another Deloitte survey found that two thirds of global CFOs expect their role in ESG-related strategies to increase over the next two years. This suggests that the ESG imperative is becoming a C-Suite issue and is expected to have a material impact on the bottom line.</p><p>What's driving this trend?</p><p>Five factors account for the accelerating growth of corporate interest in ESG issues ? none of which shows any sign of letup. A new era of the responsible enterprise appears to be here to stay.</p><p>\u00a2\u00b4y Loss of trust: According to the 2012 Edelman Trust Barometer, public trust in business continues to decline, dropping to 45 percent in the United States, compared to 51 percent in 2010. Trust in government is even lower. These findings indicate a growing perception that large institutions are not serving the public interest well.</p><p>\u00a2\u00b4y Stakeholder pressures: Pressure from consumers and investors is an important motivator for businesses to take action on ESG issues. Globally, this pressure is increasing, especially as the ranks of the middle class expand in emerging markets such as China and India. A wealthier and more educated middle class tends to have higher expectations for corporate ESG performance, as illustrated by growing protests against new factories in China. In addition, today's investors are increasingly concerned about short-term ESG risks and tend to reward companies that disclose more ESG information. The number of S&amp;P 500 companies that issued sustainability reports jumped from 19 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2011 ? and is expected to continue rising.</p><p>\u00a2\u00b4yNatural resources pressures: Growing global demand and supply constraints are generally pushing up prices for energy, agricultural products, and raw materials ? an upward trajectory punctuated by periods of extreme volatility. For example, precious metal prices have increased fourfold since 2005. Also, the recent U.S. drought, which affected nearly two-thirds of the contiguous states, was the worst in 60 years and drove up cereal prices by 17 percent. Such resource trends are increasingly top of mind for business leaders and managers. More than 70 percent of Deloitte's ESG survey respondents said their organizations were making a significant commitment to improved resource efficiency.</p><p>\u00a2\u00b4y Supply chain pressures: Executives surveyed by Deloitte see a multitude of supply chain risks that directly affect their businesses, including climate adaptation, regulatory pressures, and the unethical practices of certain business partners. Companies rely on global supply chain networks that are largely beyond their immediate control, but those same companies are being held publicly accountable for the actions of those suppliers. Also, the strong emphasis that many companies have placed on supply chain efficiency often reduces the margin for error and makes supply chains more vulnerable to all forms of risk, including ESG risks. In recent years, companies have been hit by a number of major disruptions, including floods in Thailand, the tsunami in Japan, and labor unrest in China and South Africa. Disruptions such as these help explain why ESG survey respondents expect to commit more resources to mitigating environmental and social risks over the next two years. The increasing frequency and financial impact of these types of supply chain risks are not going unnoticed.</p><p>\u00a2\u00b4y Social and mobile enablement: A Deloitte risk management survey of 192 U.S. executives found that social media ranks among the top five most important sources of risk. With social and mobile technologies becoming globally pervasive, questionable business practices have no place to hide.</p><p>Problems that in the past might have remained behind closed doors can now be exposed to the world in a few minutes without a lot of advanced technology ? then scrutinized in detail ? long after traditional media sources would have lost interest.</p><p>Lessons learned: What works and what doesn't</p><p>Many companies today are transforming their cultures to more strongly reflect ESG values and align them with their core mission and strategies.</p><p>They are actively measuring and mitigating ESG-related risks and improving transparency, using advanced analytics to improve reporting, perceptions, and management of environmental and social risks.</p><p>These companies are also aligning their business models with their environmental and social goals, and their performance management systems with desired outcomes.</p><p>Among the senior leaders we surveyed who work at companies that recognize the importance of environmental and social issues, 63 percent said they support changing compensation plans to reflect their ESG commitments.</p><p>Looking ahead, survey participants expect to commit more human and financial resources to ESG, not only to mitigate risk and improve transparency but also to change the organizational culture.</p><p>According to the executives surveyed, this commitment will require three crucial actions that are closely linked to the core business: clear articulation of the company's ESG goals and values to all stakeholders; improved alignment of the ESG strategy with the overall company mission; and a demonstrated business case for investment in ESG initiatives.</p><p>These actions can boost a company's competitiveness by making it more attractive to investment capital and top talent in a global marketplace that is increasingly conscious of ESG issues and risks.</p><p>Looking ahead</p><p>Aligning ESG issues and corporate citizenship with commerce can help companies create shareholder value in three measurable ways: pinch, push, and shift.</p><p>Pinch. Downside risks should be reduced or 'pinched', especially in a global marketplace that is increasingly volatile, resource-constrained, and socially engaged.</p><p>One way to do this is by integrating ESG and financial reporting, which can increase transparency, improve understanding of ESG risks, and help drive targeted mitigation strategies.</p><p>Improved transparency can also help build trust with customers, investors, and employees, creating a halo effect that makes it easier for a company to earn forgiveness when things go wrong, while getting more credit for things it is doing right.</p><p>Companies can also leverage social and environmental issues to create new product and service innovations that drive revenue and reduce operating costs.</p><p>Deloitte's research on innovation shows that leaders on ESG issues are over 400 percent more likely to be considered innovation leaders.</p><p>For example, Nike's Considered Design initiative has enabled the company to recycle 82 million plastic bottles into high-performance sportswear, reduce waste by 19 percent in its footwear business, increase the use of environmentally preferred materials by 20 percent, and achieve a 95 percent reduction in volatile organic compounds.</p><p>In addition, our ESG survey shows that 32 percent of senior executives expect more than 5 percent of future annual revenue growth to come from products and services that reduce environmental and social impacts, while another 32 percent expect 1 to 5 percent of future annual revenue growth to come from those same kinds of sources.</p><p>Shift. Weaving ESG factors into the fabric of a company can improve shareholder value over time by permanently shifting the expected share price to a higher level, creating a valuation premium. Part of this shift comes from pinch and push, which strengthen a company's brand, reduce risk, and fuel innovation.</p><p>Another part comes from improved operating efficiency and reduced waste, which can significantly reduce costs and increase profitability.</p><p>In addition, a strategic approach to ESG issues can boost a company's value by helping to attract financial and human capital.</p><p>Responsible enterprises attract more funding and enjoy a lower cost of equity capital than their less responsible counterparts.</p><p>They also have an easier time attracting talent, especially younger workers, who tend to be particularly conscious of social and environmental issues. These effects can help create a lasting competitive advantage.</p><p>The increasing focus on ESG issues is a long-term trend, driven by rising public awareness and concerns about adaptation to a changing business environment, income disparity, and quality of life around the world.</p><p>Companies that are further along the journey toward effective integration of ESG issues into risk management approaches, business operations, and strategy will likely be in a stronger position to compete in the future.</p><p>In particular, they will likely have the benefit of being able to take a strategic and measured approach when responding to stakeholder pressures and environmental crises.</p><p>On the other hand, companies that continue to treat ESG issues merely as compliance could be missing an opportunity to be rewarded for the good work they do, making it harder to attract the customers, talent, and capital that are crucial to value creation.</p><p>This report was provided by Deloitte.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KTIMES-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KTIMES2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5BB8-R171-JCBN-51BB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174045</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-08-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1747\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 The Korea Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Korea Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 19, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0005UOA</classCode><className>DELOITTE LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

The series will also introduce the increasing efforts of major advanced countries to promote a green economy. - Ed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world's climate is changing for the worse due to human activities. If world temperatures reach a certain threshold, an irreversible climate shift may occur, with grave consequences for world biodiversity and ecological balance. Precise consequences are unknown but could be catastrophic for much of humanity. And just to be clear, no insurance program exists to bail the world out should the worst case scenario materialize.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Options for facing climate change include curbs on the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, adjustment to climate change, and hoping for the best until uncertainties abate. Most scientists believe the best option today is to curb new accumulation of greenhouse gases, and proactively reduce their concentrations \"to make up for lost time.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adjusting to climate change - with our current understanding of its dangers - may not be feasible in many places on the planet. Hoping for the best, again with our understanding of potential consequences and their irreversibility, would be irresponsible.</p><p>Much of recent debate on climate change has involved strategies for emission reduction, or active removal of greenhouse gases. Scientists search for the most cost-effective techniques to achieve these goals. Costs of the currently available techniques are fairly well known. They represent a setback to economic growth, but relative to the potential dangers of climate change the costs are bearable. But who should pay?</p><p>Governments in many industrialized countries have stepped up to the plate with various public efforts and market stimuli under the \"green growth\" header. They have pledged to jointly spend hundreds of billions of dollars annually on promoting energy efficiency, clean energy sources and sustainable management of resources. Coordinated efforts and information-sharing programs among industrialized and developing countries have sprung up.</p><p>Unfortunately, these voluntary efforts have not been sufficient, and have been hampered by disagreements regarding how emission reduction and its costs should be distributed across industries and countries.</p><p>Disagreements stem from considerations for equity, as well as for the competitiveness of businesses that undertake emission reductions compared to unregulated businesses, in the same or other industries. Furthermore, options for mitigation of climate change are numerous, and their viability differs across industries and countries.</p><p>To ensure that emission reductions take place at cost effective sites, all countries should coordinate their efforts. Furthermore, when environmental initiatives are undertaken, their funding crowds out other public or private programs dealing with other societal ills. These opportunity costs of environmental efforts are not fully certain, and vary significantly across countries. Again, coordination among all countries is warranted to ensure that emission reduction takes place at cost effective sites.</p><p>Finally, if future scientific evidence shows that CO2 is not exactly uniformly diffused - so that damages from CO2 would depend on its source - location of emission abatement may matter.</p><p>Regardless of efficiency considerations, determining how the global bill should be split is imperative from the viewpoint of fairness. Even in this respect there is much disagreement. The differential responsibility for climate change mitigation could be assigned based on a number of criteria.</p><p>The following are just a few criteria that may be applied:</p><p>Historic contribution to the cumulative GHG concentrations in the atmosphere - this most commonly quoted criterion is meaningful to the extent that people should be held accountable for actions of their forefathers.</p><p>Contribution of past emissions to the countries' stage of development - to the extent that the current generation in some countries has benefitted from pollution more than the current generation in other countries, the former should compensate the latter.</p><p>Countries' current ability to pay, in terms of aggregate or per capita income - richer countries can more easily afford to provide funds to environmental initiatives.</p><p>The above criteria are in line with the \"stock\" notions of equity, as they consider the cumulative effect of past evolution and the up-to-date state of affairs. They may or may not be based on the volume of countries' pillaging of the environment in the past.</p><p>Other criteria, based on \"flow\" notions of equity, could be based on countries' current and future behavior:</p><p>The country's current emissions - since we have recognized the danger of GHG emissions only recently, only new emissions should be tallied, as they are made in disregard of the known environmental impacts.</p><p>Similarly, countries' emissions per unit of national output may be a criterion - to the extent that some nations are more wasteful of environmental resources in their production processes, they may be asked to pay for their excesses.</p><p>Finally, the country's anticipated damages incurred from climate change - to the extent that some countries stand to lose more from rising oceans, extreme fluctuations in weather and precipitation, and diminished biodiversity, they may be expected to shoulder more costs of mitigation. Incidentally, developing nations tend to be located at lower latitudes, facing higher risks and damages under climate change. Under the cynical principle that those affected most should pay, developing nations may be expected to contribute more.</p><p>Existing differences across nations</p><p>Countries around the world differ in the stock of available technologies, and size and composition of their industrial base. Countries rely on various industries for economic sustenance, and have different energy portfolios (Refer to Figure 1). Globalization has allowed industries to distribute themselves across world regions, and as a result, economic activity and energy intensity of production vary significantly by geography (Figure 2). For these reasons, countries are predisposed to certain CO2 emission patterns, and their costs of emission abatement vary.</p><p>Countries around the world differ in the rate of population and economic growth (Figure 3). Demographic trends and the process of economic catch up are responsible for a large amount of variation in countries' emission patterns (Figure 4). In 2008, China became the top emitter of CO2 from electricity generation, followed by the United States and Europe. China emits over a fifth of all GHG emissions in the world. Nevertheless, per capita emissions in Australia, the United States and Canada (10 tons per person per year) are still nearly four times those in China (2.4 tons), and three times those in Europe (3.3 tons).</p><p>Current pledges on climate change mitigation</p><p>In light of the present and past differences across countries, and both the efficiency and equity considerations, most countries are moving toward a consensus on a coordinated global plan. Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, industrialized nations are obliged to meet their GHG limitations by reducing emissions, purchasing carbon credits, or arranging for emission reductions in other countries. Industrialized nations also pledge to support emissions abatement in developing nations through financial and technical assistance.</p><p>Environmental initiatives have also sprung up among developing countries. The Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is a pact among seven Asia-Pacific nations (jointly responsible for over 50 percent of global CO2 emissions), both industrialized and developing, to cooperate on the issues of energy demand, green technologies and pollution.</p><p>In Korea, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy has pledged over 130 trillion won over the next two decades on cleaner energy sources, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency. China plans to spend over $200 billion on energy efficiency, renewables, public transport, upgrading of the energy grid and other pollution-related programs over the next five years.</p><p>At the same time, developing countries do not want to forsake economic growth or their competitiveness. Russia, fearing an economic slowdown, has so far not committed to emission abatement, and is evaluating climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>Other developing countries have lobbied for greater financial and technology transfers from rich countries. Gao Guangsheng, the director general of China's Office of National Coordination on Climate Change, has asked rich countries for 1 percent of their gross domestic product annually to build scientific and regulatory capacity, adopt energy-efficient technologies and conserve resources in developing nations.</p><p>This 1 percent should be in addition to the industrialized countries' own emission abatement obligations. China's position is that industrialized countries have an \"unshirkable\" responsibility to \"provide new, additional, adequate, and predictable resources\" for emission reduction programs in developing nations, while protecting poorer countries' right to development. China also insists on maintaining the designation of developed and developing countries from the Kyoto protocol regardless of future development, and regardless of the composition and energy-intensity of their industries.</p><p>Green policy v. green bills</p><p>From the perspective of efficiency, emission abatement in developing countries may cost less than in industrialized countries, because making the construction of new cities and industries more environmentally friendly may be cheaper than retrofitting existing stock in the developed world. Industrialized nations can also better afford to clean up pollution, and can afford to pay developing nations to do the same - now.</p><p>Economist Nicholas Stern reported to the British prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer that if action was taken today, the cost of avoiding serious climate change may be around 1-2 percent of world GDP. That is affordable for industrialized nations, particularly compared to the cost of more drastic reductions down the road if business-as-usual emissions continue for the next 20-40 years (4-5 percent of world GDP).</p><p>Politically, showing a bit of goodwill could be beneficial for industrialized nations in the sphere of political, economic and scientific cooperation. Finally, from the perspective of fairness, the motive is perhaps strongest. Industrialized nations have been decimating the environment for nearly 200 years, and are responsible for 70 percent of the existing stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Developing nations, on the other hand, started to contribute to climate change only about 40 years ago. Industrialized nations have seized most benefits from their pillage of the environment, while the dangers of climate change now accrue to all nations indiscriminately.</p><p>However, from the efficiency point of view, benefits to industrialized nations of spending money in developing nations is lower than spending domestically. Domestic spending spurs job creation, investment and consumption, spilling over to other sectors and propping up the entire domestic economy. These direct and multiplier effects of spending domestically exceed the would-be direct benefits of spending in developing countries.</p><p>Politically, giving money to other countries may be unpopular with voters, particularly during an economic slump. For one, offering companies in developing nations subsidies to up their compliance with environmental standards may give them advantage over more regulated businesses in rich countries. In China, a quarter of emissions come from production for exports to developed nations.</p><p>Even when money is given to domestic companies to improve environmental conditions in the developing world - such as through cleaning up operations of their supply chains in offshore locations - this would not be a cost-effective contribution to the \"Green New Deal\" as long as regulators do not oversee the environmental compliance of all contractors in the developing world.</p><p>Pollution may also be viewed as an \"internal issue\" that developing countries could combat themselves. According to some estimates, pollution costs China 8-12 percent of its $1.4 trillion GDP in direct damages (to health, agriculture, forests and buildings). One could expect developing nations to deal with such \"uneconomic growth\" on their own.</p><p>Furthermore, concurring with the request for assistance may set a dangerous precedent for the organization and funding of many environmental initiatives in developing countries. Developing countries may stall their initiatives, and their capacity for self-organization and own financing may vanish.</p><p>China insists that assistance under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change should be treated separately from other financial and technology transfers. This refusal to deal with the West in good faith forebodes future disputes regarding rich countries' responsibilities and China's rights under the deal. The country may face a moral hazard motive to limit its achievements under the present deal to procure additional funding for stricter environmental targets in the future.</p><p>Finally, philosophically speaking, the compensation of developing countries may be beside the point, because developing countries have themselves benefitted from the early development in industrialized nations. For one, they benefitted through trade, foreign direct investment, outsourcing, humanitarian aid etc. Two, they enjoy technologies that came about through decades of exploration in the industrialized world.</p><p>Distinguishing nations that have benefitted from the long, environmentally-detrimental development from countries that have not is less than straightforward. Furthermore, some developing countries have also had their jab at unfettered industrialization, and should perhaps be held responsible.</p><p>Energy-intensive metallurgy was used in China nearly a millennium before it took off in the West. This commerce led to extensive deforestation, and burning of charcoal and coal. For centuries, China's level of development was above that in Europe. Whether global environmental degradation has its origin only in the 19th century, and whether the current stage of development is the only one that matters are philosophical questions.</p><p>Time to act</p><p>Dealing with climate change presents great challenges to theoretical economists and policy makers alike. Important economic factors differ across countries; the past and present are characterized by utter inequality; and the future is veiled in uncertainty. Effective policy is paralyzed by stakeholders' \"what if\" musings about the past as well as about the future. The debate on what should be done and by whom has business-sense, ethical, as well as philosophical facets.</p><p>Attempting to point fingers is tricky given how technologies and our understanding of the environmental dangers have evolved over time. Even from the simple principle of efficiency, uncertainty about future innovations, CO2 abatement costs, and damages from climate change make it difficult to find solutions. Existing institutions, regulations, and barriers on international flows of resources add to the complexity.</p><p>Ultimately, countries must bridge their differences, even if it calls for big compromises. In spite of all the issues, a broad consensus among the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases and a decisive action are urgently needed.</p><p>All countries must reduce CO2 emissions by 15-20 percent from the 1990 level by year 2020 and at least by 50 percent by 2050 to eschew major changes in global climate. Industrialized as well as developing countries must start cooperating in good faith right away.</p><p>The good news is that cross-country variation in the opportunity costs of cleaning up allows countries to exploit comparative advantages. Acting today will also avoid greater costs later.</p><p>Finally, countries that fear they will share too high a cost today may be reassured by goodwill that exists among countries. The 20th century has seen a good record of voluntary assistance programs around the world and remembrance of good deeds.</p><p>By Vladimir Hlasny</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VV5-KMX1-2R9C-G029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2715\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>June 3, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

The series will also introduce the increasing efforts of major advanced countries to promote a green economy. - Ed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world's climate is changing for the worse due to human activities. If world temperatures reach a certain threshold, an irreversible climate shift may occur, with grave consequences for world biodiversity and ecological balance. Precise consequences are unknown but could be catastrophic for much of humanity. And just to be clear, no insurance program exists to bail the world out should the worst case scenario materialize.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Options for facing climate change include curbs on the accumulation of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, adjustment to climate change, and hoping for the best until uncertainties abate. Most scientists believe the best option today is to curb new accumulation of greenhouse gases, and proactively reduce their concentrations \"to make up for lost time.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Adjusting to climate change - with our current understanding of its dangers - may not be feasible in many places on the planet. Hoping for the best, again with our understanding of potential consequences and their irreversibility, would be irresponsible.</p><p>Much of recent debate on climate change has involved strategies for emission reduction, or active removal of greenhouse gases. Scientists search for the most cost-effective techniques to achieve these goals. Costs of the currently available techniques are fairly well known. They represent a setback to economic growth, but relative to the potential dangers of climate change the costs are bearable. But who should pay?</p><p>Governments in many industrialized countries have stepped up to the plate with various public efforts and market stimuli under the \"green growth\" header. They have pledged to jointly spend hundreds of billions of dollars annually on promoting energy efficiency, clean energy sources and sustainable management of resources. Coordinated efforts and information-sharing programs among industrialized and developing countries have sprung up.</p><p>Unfortunately, these voluntary efforts have not been sufficient, and have been hampered by disagreements regarding how emission reduction and its costs should be distributed across industries and countries.</p><p>Disagreements stem from considerations for equity, as well as for the competitiveness of businesses that undertake emission reductions compared to unregulated businesses, in the same or other industries. Furthermore, options for mitigation of climate change are numerous, and their viability differs across industries and countries.</p><p>To ensure that emission reductions take place at cost effective sites, all countries should coordinate their efforts. Furthermore, when environmental initiatives are undertaken, their funding crowds out other public or private programs dealing with other societal ills. These opportunity costs of environmental efforts are not fully certain, and vary significantly across countries. Again, coordination among all countries is warranted to ensure that emission reduction takes place at cost effective sites.</p><p>Finally, if future scientific evidence shows that CO2 is not exactly uniformly diffused - so that damages from CO2 would depend on its source - location of emission abatement may matter.</p><p>Regardless of efficiency considerations, determining how the global bill should be split is imperative from the viewpoint of fairness. Even in this respect there is much disagreement. The differential responsibility for climate change mitigation could be assigned based on a number of criteria.</p><p>The following are just a few criteria that may be applied:</p><p>Historic contribution to the cumulative GHG concentrations in the atmosphere - this most commonly quoted criterion is meaningful to the extent that people should be held accountable for actions of their forefathers.</p><p>Contribution of past emissions to the countries' stage of development - to the extent that the current generation in some countries has benefitted from pollution more than the current generation in other countries, the former should compensate the latter.</p><p>Countries' current ability to pay, in terms of aggregate or per capita income - richer countries can more easily afford to provide funds to environmental initiatives.</p><p>The above criteria are in line with the \"stock\" notions of equity, as they consider the cumulative effect of past evolution and the up-to-date state of affairs. They may or may not be based on the volume of countries' pillaging of the environment in the past.</p><p>Other criteria, based on \"flow\" notions of equity, could be based on countries' current and future behavior:</p><p>The country's current emissions - since we have recognized the danger of GHG emissions only recently, only new emissions should be tallied, as they are made in disregard of the known environmental impacts.</p><p>Similarly, countries' emissions per unit of national output may be a criterion - to the extent that some nations are more wasteful of environmental resources in their production processes, they may be asked to pay for their excesses.</p><p>Finally, the country's anticipated damages incurred from climate change - to the extent that some countries stand to lose more from rising oceans, extreme fluctuations in weather and precipitation, and diminished biodiversity, they may be expected to shoulder more costs of mitigation. Incidentally, developing nations tend to be located at lower latitudes, facing higher risks and damages under climate change. Under the cynical principle that those affected most should pay, developing nations may be expected to contribute more.</p><p>Existing differences across nations</p><p>Countries around the world differ in the stock of available technologies, and size and composition of their industrial base. Countries rely on various industries for economic sustenance, and have different energy portfolios (Refer to Figure 1). Globalization has allowed industries to distribute themselves across world regions, and as a result, economic activity and energy intensity of production vary significantly by geography (Figure 2). For these reasons, countries are predisposed to certain CO2 emission patterns, and their costs of emission abatement vary.</p><p>Countries around the world differ in the rate of population and economic growth (Figure 3). Demographic trends and the process of economic catch up are responsible for a large amount of variation in countries' emission patterns (Figure 4). In 2008, China became the top emitter of CO2 from electricity generation, followed by the United States and Europe. China emits over a fifth of all GHG emissions in the world. Nevertheless, per capita emissions in Australia, the United States and Canada (10 tons per person per year) are still nearly four times those in China (2.4 tons), and three times those in Europe (3.3 tons).</p><p>Current pledges on climate change mitigation</p><p>In light of the present and past differences across countries, and both the efficiency and equity considerations, most countries are moving toward a consensus on a coordinated global plan. Under the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, industrialized nations are obliged to meet their GHG limitations by reducing emissions, purchasing carbon credits, or arranging for emission reductions in other countries. Industrialized nations also pledge to support emissions abatement in developing nations through financial and technical assistance.</p><p>Environmental initiatives have also sprung up among developing countries. The Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate is a pact among seven Asia-Pacific nations (jointly responsible for over 50 percent of global CO2 emissions), both industrialized and developing, to cooperate on the issues of energy demand, green technologies and pollution.</p><p>In Korea, the Ministry of Knowledge Economy has pledged over 130 trillion won over the next two decades on cleaner energy sources, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency. China plans to spend over $200 billion on energy efficiency, renewables, public transport, upgrading of the energy grid and other pollution-related programs over the next five years.</p><p>At the same time, developing countries do not want to forsake economic growth or their competitiveness. Russia, fearing an economic slowdown, has so far not committed to emission abatement, and is evaluating climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>Other developing countries have lobbied for greater financial and technology transfers from rich countries. Gao Guangsheng, the director general of China's Office of National Coordination on Climate Change, has asked rich countries for 1 percent of their gross domestic product annually to build scientific and regulatory capacity, adopt energy-efficient technologies and conserve resources in developing nations.</p><p>This 1 percent should be in addition to the industrialized countries' own emission abatement obligations. China's position is that industrialized countries have an \"unshirkable\" responsibility to \"provide new, additional, adequate, and predictable resources\" for emission reduction programs in developing nations, while protecting poorer countries' right to development. China also insists on maintaining the designation of developed and developing countries from the Kyoto protocol regardless of future development, and regardless of the composition and energy-intensity of their industries.</p><p>Green policy v. green bills</p><p>From the perspective of efficiency, emission abatement in developing countries may cost less than in industrialized countries, because making the construction of new cities and industries more environmentally friendly may be cheaper than retrofitting existing stock in the developed world. Industrialized nations can also better afford to clean up pollution, and can afford to pay developing nations to do the same - now.</p><p>Economist Nicholas Stern reported to the British prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer that if action was taken today, the cost of avoiding serious climate change may be around 1-2 percent of world GDP. That is affordable for industrialized nations, particularly compared to the cost of more drastic reductions down the road if business-as-usual emissions continue for the next 20-40 years (4-5 percent of world GDP).</p><p>Politically, showing a bit of goodwill could be beneficial for industrialized nations in the sphere of political, economic and scientific cooperation. Finally, from the perspective of fairness, the motive is perhaps strongest. Industrialized nations have been decimating the environment for nearly 200 years, and are responsible for 70 percent of the existing stock of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Developing nations, on the other hand, started to contribute to climate change only about 40 years ago. Industrialized nations have seized most benefits from their pillage of the environment, while the dangers of climate change now accrue to all nations indiscriminately.</p><p>However, from the efficiency point of view, benefits to industrialized nations of spending money in developing nations is lower than spending domestically. Domestic spending spurs job creation, investment and consumption, spilling over to other sectors and propping up the entire domestic economy. These direct and multiplier effects of spending domestically exceed the would-be direct benefits of spending in developing countries.</p><p>Politically, giving money to other countries may be unpopular with voters, particularly during an economic slump. For one, offering companies in developing nations subsidies to up their compliance with environmental standards may give them advantage over more regulated businesses in rich countries. In China, a quarter of emissions come from production for exports to developed nations.</p><p>Even when money is given to domestic companies to improve environmental conditions in the developing world - such as through cleaning up operations of their supply chains in offshore locations - this would not be a cost-effective contribution to the \"Green New Deal\" as long as regulators do not oversee the environmental compliance of all contractors in the developing world.</p><p>Pollution may also be viewed as an \"internal issue\" that developing countries could combat themselves. According to some estimates, pollution costs China 8-12 percent of its $1.4 trillion GDP in direct damages (to health, agriculture, forests and buildings). One could expect developing nations to deal with such \"uneconomic growth\" on their own.</p><p>Furthermore, concurring with the request for assistance may set a dangerous precedent for the organization and funding of many environmental initiatives in developing countries. Developing countries may stall their initiatives, and their capacity for self-organization and own financing may vanish.</p><p>China insists that assistance under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change should be treated separately from other financial and technology transfers. This refusal to deal with the West in good faith forebodes future disputes regarding rich countries' responsibilities and China's rights under the deal. The country may face a moral hazard motive to limit its achievements under the present deal to procure additional funding for stricter environmental targets in the future.</p><p>Finally, philosophically speaking, the compensation of developing countries may be beside the point, because developing countries have themselves benefitted from the early development in industrialized nations. For one, they benefitted through trade, foreign direct investment, outsourcing, humanitarian aid etc. Two, they enjoy technologies that came about through decades of exploration in the industrialized world.</p><p>Distinguishing nations that have benefitted from the long, environmentally-detrimental development from countries that have not is less than straightforward. Furthermore, some developing countries have also had their jab at unfettered industrialization, and should perhaps be held responsible.</p><p>Energy-intensive metallurgy was used in China nearly a millennium before it took off in the West. This commerce led to extensive deforestation, and burning of charcoal and coal. For centuries, China's level of development was above that in Europe. Whether global environmental degradation has its origin only in the 19th century, and whether the current stage of development is the only one that matters are philosophical questions.</p><p>Time to act</p><p>Dealing with climate change presents great challenges to theoretical economists and policy makers alike. Important economic factors differ across countries; the past and present are characterized by utter inequality; and the future is veiled in uncertainty. Effective policy is paralyzed by stakeholders' \"what if\" musings about the past as well as about the future. The debate on what should be done and by whom has business-sense, ethical, as well as philosophical facets.</p><p>Attempting to point fingers is tricky given how technologies and our understanding of the environmental dangers have evolved over time. Even from the simple principle of efficiency, uncertainty about future innovations, CO2 abatement costs, and damages from climate change make it difficult to find solutions. Existing institutions, regulations, and barriers on international flows of resources add to the complexity.</p><p>Ultimately, countries must bridge their differences, even if it calls for big compromises. In spite of all the issues, a broad consensus among the world's top emitters of greenhouse gases and a decisive action are urgently needed.</p><p>All countries must reduce CO2 emissions by 15-20 percent from the 1990 level by year 2020 and at least by 50 percent by 2050 to eschew major changes in global climate. Industrialized as well as developing countries must start cooperating in good faith right away.</p><p>The good news is that cross-country variation in the opportunity costs of cleaning up allows countries to exploit comparative advantages. Acting today will also avoid greater costs later.</p><p>Finally, countries that fear they will share too high a cost today may be reassured by goodwill that exists among countries. The 20th century has seen a good record of voluntary assistance programs around the world and remembrance of good deeds.</p><p>By Vladimir Hlasny</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KHERLD-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KHERLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VVM-7JY0-Y9SF-6029-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">158208</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2715\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Korea Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE KOREA HERALD</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"06\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>June 3, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

In 2024, it topped Shandong in both overall ambient air quality and improvement rate, with key indicators, such as PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, and excellent air quality days, all showing strong performance.  Water quality indicators were equally impressive. All 13 key rivers and 12 urban centralized drinking water sources met required standards.  Soil remediation efforts also yielded consistent results. The city also maintained a 100 percent safe utilization rate for contaminated farmland and key construction land for five straight years.  Weihai continues to deepen its pollution control efforts through comprehensive initiatives targeting blue skies, clean waters, and coastal ecosystems.  As a national pilot city for advancing climate adaptation, Weihai established a dedicated working group and actively advancing the modernization of its climate governance, said Wang Xihai, a researcher at the Weihai Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau.  Currently, the city's four Eco-environment Oriented Development (EOD) projects, with a total investment of 6.4 billion yuan, have been included in the provincial green finance project pool.  Looking ahead, Weihai plans to roll out additional EOD projects, aiming to further align high-level environmental protection with high-quality economic growth.

Accelerated climate change and increasing variability is one of the greatest challenges we face. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has determined that there is clear evidence that human actions are exacerbating the natural variability of the climate system; we are responsible for producing changes. Though there is general agreement that there is an urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there is also recognition that we will have to adapt to the changes that will be driven by the emissions already loaded into the atmosphere. There seems little likelihood of an international agreement to reduce emissions before 2020, meaning that climate change could be further accelerated. There is a possibility that we will enter an era of dangerous climate change where extreme events could severely threaten communities and livelihoods throughout the world or even cause irreversible damage to ecosystems. Adaptation is an urgent need. Climate change risks Broadly speaking accelerated climate change risks are meteorological in nature, for example temperatures will rise and droughts and floods are likely to be more severe and less predictable. Table 1 highlights some of the possible risks that we will face. The lack of an international agreement to limit emissions means that many of the impacts listed in Table 1 are likely to be exacerbated. This will make adaptation even more challenging. It is very probable that we will have to adapt to significant changes. We may have already reached tipping points that could lead to irreversible change. A tipping point is where warming, for example, of the tundra releases methane into the atmosphere. Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas and this would further accelerate the warming trend. It is clear that adaptation is needed urgently. Adaptation is a process of adjustment to disruptive events. It is not a new concept. Societies have adjusted continually throughout history. From a climate change perspective, adaptation is precautionary or anticipatory adjustment(s) to shifts already happening or likely to happen in the near future. It is defined by IPCC in its Third Assessment Report as: 'Adjustment in natural or human systems is in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities. Various types of adaptation can be distinguished, including anticipatory and reactive adaptation, private and public adaptation, and autonomous and planned adaptation.' (IPCC, 2001) Adaptation is not just adjustment to an average climate condition but is a response to reduce vulnerability to extremes, variability, and rates of change at all scales. Though the aim of adaptation is to reduce or mitigate vulnerability, its focus is on adaptive capacity, which is the ability of our societies to adjust to climate disruptions. Vulnerability is the degree to which societies are unable to cope with the adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes. Adaptive capacity refers to the potential or ability of communities to adapt to the effects or impacts of climate change and is the ability of societies to adjust to actual or expected climate stresses, or to cope with the consequences. The determinants of adaptive capacity comprise factors such as wealth, technology, education, information, skills, infrastructure, access to resources, government and stability and management capabilities. Wealthier nations have greater adaptive capacity than poorer nations. A term increasingly used in adaptation is resilience, which is the ability of communities to respond and cope with disruptive events. This means building up the capacity of communities to be more self-reliant. Resilience is a function of learning from experience and using the determinants of adaptive capacity to better prepare for future. In this sense resilience is an on-going process. This is an important aspect of adaptation to climate change as we will have constantly assess climate hazards and make judgements about the risks that they will produce. Adaptation strategies Adaptation strategies will differ from place to place. There is no single solution. Adaptation strategies should aim at reducing risks to communities, promoting food and water security, protecting critical infrastructure and ensuring that people are prepared. The types of measures that can be used can be characterized in two ways. The first are structural measures which comprise any physical construction to reduce or avoid possible impacts of hazards, or application of engineering techniques to achieve hazard-resistance and resilience in structures or systems such as flood levies, ocean wave barriers and evacuation shelters. The second are non-structural measures which comprise any measure that does not involve physical construction but uses knowledge, practice or agreement to reduce risks and impacts, in particular through policies and laws, public awareness raising, training and education. Common non-structural measures include building codes, land-use planning laws and their enforcement, research and assessment, information resources, and public awareness programs. Local knowledge, climate science Short measures can range from the building of flood defences through to the introduction of drought resistant crops. It is important that adaptation measures should build on local knowledge as well as good climate science. There needs to be an interchange of information of what works best and why. It will be through learning that adaptation measures will build resilience. But there are likely to be some very difficult decisions to make. Many of our cities and critical infrastructure are in coastal areas and highly vulnerable to sea level rise and storms. New Orleans is a graphic example of what may happen. Even today there is discussion of whether some of the low-lying areas of the city should be re-developed. In the future we will have to consider whether or not to abandon some areas, as the costs of defending are likely to be prohibitive. In Asia there are many cities that will be threatened by rising sea levels and extreme storms. Countries such as Bangladesh will lose land and many will be displaced. This raises the prospect of climate refugees. How will we deal with such problems? Costs of Adaptation This is a contentious area. A study by Stern in 2006 on the economics of climate change concluded that it would more cost effective to act now as opposed to dealing the consequences. Stern suggests that a spending of roughly 3-5 percent of GDP would avoid the some 15-20 percent of GDP if we did nothing (Stern, 2006). Studies in 2007 from UNDP (UN Development Programme) and Oxfam estimated costs between $50 and $109 billion per annum (Oxfam, 2007; UNDP, 2007). The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) estimated that total funding need for adaptation by 2030 could amount to between $49 and $171 billion per annum globally, of which $27 and $66 billion would accrue in developing countries (UNFCCC, 2007). More recent analysis suggests that these figures underestimate the costs. Adaptation is complex and studies need to include a number of sectors, such as agriculture, water, ecosystems, coastal systems, human health and infrastructure. An analysis by Parry et al (2009) of the UNFCCC study, suggest that in some sectors estimates may need to be 2 or 3 times higher.A 2010 study by the World Bank into the infrastructure costs alone suggests an annual spend between $75 and $100 billion (World Bank 2010). One of the problems is deciding on what areas and sectors to protect. This implies that a concerted effort is likely to be much higher that current published estimates. Given that the recent World Bank study only focuses on infrastructure then it is not unreasonable to assume that a comprehensive approach is likely to exceed $100 billion per annum. Cost and lives According to The Global Humanitarian Forum (2010) the costs of climate related losses amount to $125 billion per annum and some 300,000 lives are lost every year along with countless numbers of lives that have been degraded because of climate change. It is impossible to put a value on such losses and suffering. But whatever the costs we should note that the IMF estimates that the costs of the global credit crunch are some $10 trillion. Through UNFCCC the global community has established the Green Climate Fund which has identified that developed countries should commit to providing $30 billion in fast-start finance for developing countries in 2010-12 and to mobilize $100 billion a year in public and private finance by 2020 for adaptation and low carbon initiatives. Don't hold your breath as the global economic slowdown may mean that this commitment will not be fully met. Climate adaptation is urgent. However there does seem to be a lack of action. This is odd as adaptation is about protecting people and the assets we need. Many of the measure will require innovation, a move to a greener economy. This will have benefits as new products will be needed. This can have long term benefits, particularly if we decide to adapt the global energy system to new and alternative energy resources. What is clear is that many of the options are realisable. The question remains: do we have the political will? It seems that many of our leaders are transfixed Giddens Paradox (2009); they will not act until something goes wrong.
