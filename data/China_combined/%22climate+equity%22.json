Led by the SEMI Sustainability Initiative Environmental Risk Mitigation and Reporting (ERMR) working group, the study identifies strengths, gaps and challenges faced by the industry in implementing recommendations of the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The report also offers recommendations on industry best practices to enhance climate disclosure maturity. Download the report.<br/><br/>The report leveraged Nasdaq Sustainable Lens(TM), an AI-powered ESG intelligence platform, to analyze and assess the maturity level of each segment of the semiconductor value chain based on publicly available sustainability and climate information of 100 leading semiconductor companies against TCFD recommendations. Nasdaq Sustainable Lens(TM) reviewed over 2,200 corporate annual financial reports, sustainability reports, low-carbon transition and climate action plans and other sustainability and climate information released between 2021 and 2023. The platform uncovered five key takeaways:<br/><br/>1. Maturity of semiconductor industry-level climate disclosures are in the Established phase as defined by Nasdaq. The semiconductor companies included in the assessment showed 40% higher TCFD alignment than the market average, represented by over 9,000 global companies across all industries beyond semiconductors.</p><p>2. Corporate climate reporting varies by semiconductor value chain segment largely due to different stakeholder expectations, jurisdiction-level reporting requirements, the level of resources dedicated to corporate climate work, as well as board- and executive-level engagement in climate initiatives.</p><p>3. Companies prioritize near-term climate targets, though only some have set long-term net zero goals. On average, value chain segments demonstrated the most comprehensive TCFD alignment with the Metrics &amp; Targets pillar, particularly as it relates to near-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction targets.</p><p>4. Addressing organizational resilience to climate change appears to be the biggest industry-level challenge. The most underreported categories included climate scenario analysis, quantitative physical and transition climate risk assessments, and setting an internal carbon price. This indicates that the core question of how a company's business strategy will perform under various climate scenarios remains a major gap across all semiconductor value chain segments.</p><p>5. Ensuring climate resilience of the value chain is a business imperative for semiconductor companies. Industry-level recognition of the vulnerability of the semiconductor value chain to existing and potential climate-related risks and proactively building a path towards climate resilience are crucial for long-term business continuity.<br/><br/>\"Our study aims to raise awareness of climate risk as a key business risk and demonstrate an important role that climate resilience plays in ensuring business continuity and long-term resilience of the semiconductor value chain,\" said Alua Suleimenova, Senior Sustainability Program Manager at Marvell and leader of the ERMR working group. \"This analysis will inform business leaders' decisions around measuring and reporting on corporate climate action. Further, this study can help SEMI members enhance transparency of their climate disclosures in alignment with emerging reporting requirements, including the TCFD recommendations, which are now housed within the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB).\"<br/><br/>\"The analysis made possible by Nasdaq Sustainable Lens(TM) is a key step forward in understanding and improving sustainability risk assessment and reporting across the semiconductor value chain,\" said Dr. Mousumi Bhat, Vice President of Global Sustainability Programs at SEMI. \"Marvell's leadership and the companies that provided case studies were crucial to delivering these important insights.\"<br/><br/>Webinar on Report<br/><br/>SEMI and Nasdaq will host a webinar titled Climate Risk as a Business Risk on May 23, 2024, at 9:00am PT that will highlight key takeaways from the A Rising Tide: Building a Climate-Resilient Semiconductor Value Chain report.

The small-house policy was introduced in 1972 as an administrative accommodation to cater to social tradition. However, the actual situation in the New Territiories villages shows that this tradition of \"families living closely together\" is no longer a given, and this policy has been blatantly abused. </p><p>Many small houses have been sold or rented to outsiders including expatriates. Many of the sons claiming their so-called \"right\" live not just outside the New Territories but overseas. and many of these \"rights\" are sold on directly to non-indigenous developers. </p><p>This privilege is now not about traditional customs but about the opportunity to make vast amounts of money on assets that have not been purchased. The policy should be implemented strictly to address indigenous housing needs. </p><p>If a villager sells or rents the property to a non-indigenous party the profits should go to the public purse. And if a villager sells on his \"right\" or his property then his bloodline should no longer hold any entitlement to a small house as the villager has shown he no longer wishes to maintain his close connection to his native village. </p><p>The government must address the fundamental housing issue and not be intimidated by the New Territories money politics that the Heung Yee Kuk is so adept at playing. </p><p>P.

According to Rating and Valuation statistics only some 2 per cent of our private housing stock exceeds 1,700 sq ft in area. </p><p>Why should an indigenous male expect as of right 2,100 sq ft for his family when the vast majority of Hong Kong people exist in something less than one third of that area.

Also, when the British colonial government introduced this policy the aim was for it to be short-or medium-term. The intention was that at some point it would be wound up. </p><p>Villagers complain about this and say it is unjust because they have vested interests. </p><p>The small-house policy has been distorted and is now mostly about making profits. Limiting the purpose of the small-house policy might be one option. </p><p>The cancellation of the small-house policy is in the public interest and I believe it will lead to greater social harmony, at least in urban areas of Hong Kong. </p><p>Jack Tam, Sham Tseng</p><p>Blatant abuse of village house policy</p><p>I refer to the report. (\"End small-house policy, says Lam\", June 14). Development Secretary Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor deserves credit for wanting to get to grips with this long-standing thorny issue. </p><p> This matter has been allowed to fester for far too long, and officials have appeared weak-kneed in the face of the belligerent rural chiefs of the Heung Yee Kuk. </p><p>The 76-year old indigenous villager's comments that \"we have lived in the village for countless generations\" and \"people want to live near their parents in the same village\" (\"Lam 'asking for fight on small houses'\", June 15), indicate a traditional custom, but not a legal right. The small-house policy was introduced in 1972 as an administrative accommodation to cater to social tradition. However, the actual situation in the New Territiories villages shows that this tradition of \"families living closely together\" is no longer a given, and this policy has been blatantly abused. </p><p>Many small houses have been sold or rented to outsiders including expatriates. Many of the sons claiming their so-called \"right\" live not just outside the New Territories but overseas. and many of these \"rights\" are sold on directly to non-indigenous developers. </p><p>This privilege is now not about traditional customs but about the opportunity to make vast amounts of money on assets that have not been purchased. The policy should be implemented strictly to address indigenous housing needs. </p><p>If a villager sells or rents the property to a non-indigenous party the profits should go to the public purse. And if a villager sells on his \"right\" or his property then his bloodline should no longer hold any entitlement to a small house as the villager has shown he no longer wishes to maintain his close connection to his native village. </p><p>The government must address the fundamental housing issue and not be intimidated by the New Territories money politics that the Heung Yee Kuk is so adept at playing. </p><p>P. C. Law, Quarry Bay </p><p>Protection from Basic Law a myth</p><p> The so-called small-house policy is a complete misnomer.</p><p> When 80 per cent of our private housing stock and close to 100 per cent of our public housing stock is below 750 sq ft in area, it puts the indigenous expectation of 2,100 sq ft per household in startling perspective. According to Rating and Valuation statistics only some 2 per cent of our private housing stock exceeds 1,700 sq ft in area. </p><p>Why should an indigenous male expect as of right 2,100 sq ft for his family when the vast majority of Hong Kong people exist in something less than one third of that area. Let us call it for what it is - a \"big house\" policy.</p><p>The indigenous claims that the \"big house\" policy is enshrined in the Basic Law hardly stands scrutiny. </p><p>It was an administrative policy which could be removed if thought necessary when instituted in 1972, and remains as such today. </p><p>The handover did not transmogrify the policy into law, and the provisions remain as subject to removal as they were prior to the handover.</p><p> We do not need to wait until 2029 to cancel the policy. </p><p>Clive Noffke, Lantau</p><p>More taxis will make roads safer</p><p>Currently there are around 18,000 taxis in Hong Kong and the government imposes a cap.</p><p> I think that it should seriously reconsider this figure and look into the possibility of allowing more cabs on our streets. </p><p> Owning a taxi in Hong Kong can cost as much as an apartment in the city and a lot of drivers now have to rent them on a daily basis. </p><p>If there was an increase in the number of taxis available, it might be easier for people to own a vehicle and driving standards would improve.
