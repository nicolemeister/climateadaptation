According to news originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"A heavy rainstorm struck Henan, China, in July 2021. Previous studies have indicated that natural disasters have a wide range of psychological sequelae, but little research has been done on the psychological effects of floods specifically.\" </p><p><br/> Financial support for this research came from National Social Science Fund of China. <br/> Our news journalists obtained a quote from the research from Peking University, \"This study aimed to track the mental health trajectories of flood victims over time and identify associated protective and risk factors. People living in the areas most impacted by the flood (N = 376) were surveyed at four different time points: 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months post-flood. Latent growth mixture modeling was utilized to delineate longitudinal patterns of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression, a supervised machine-learning approach, was employed to discern predictors among 49 assessed variables at both contextual and personal levels. Results revealed three classes of PTSD (resilience, recovery, moderate symptoms) and anxiety (resilience, chronicity, recovery) trajectories, along with two classes of depression trajectories (resilience, chronicity). Key factors predicting resilience in mental health included personality traits, media consumption habits, pre-existing health conditions at the individual level, and asset loss and ongoing adversities at the contextual level. In spite of the widespread impact of the flood, most victims displayed resilience in the face of adversity.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Identifying critical factors across various psychological symptoms offers valuable insights for both pre-disaster preparation and post-disaster trans-diagnostic psychological interventions.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: A longitudinal investigation of mental health outcomes after the Henan floods in China: Examining predictors of resilience trajectories.

Many times, a chain reaction was triggered where the rescued joined in to extricate others who had been trapped with them.</p><p>These everyday heroes took to saving lives without any heed to their own safety or belongings. Unlike heroes in the movies, they did get hurt. Sharp objects flowing in the water and the breaking of glass panes in cars, buses, and subway trains left them bruised, with some getting their bones fractured. Many lost their phones and wallets.</p><p>And these heroes plunged into raging waters instinctively. They saw people would drown if not helped because many in need did not know how to swim.

Time is the most crucial resource in such emergencies. By making full use of the rapid speed of technology, damage to life and property was significantly reduced. Many tech-savvy students are now considering taking up careers through which they can continue contributing to society.</p><p>On social media, \"civilian heroes\" remained one of the most commonly seen tags. Through videos and stories of the everyday heroes, tributes from all over the country poured in under the tag. The humanitarian spirit went instantly viral, inspiring more and more people from far-off areas to join the relief efforts physically, through online assistance or donations.</p><p>The Chinese way of thinking in collective terms is a major factor behind the rise of everyday heroes. The country's unique societal culture first thinks of the overall good and service to others before serving the self.</p><p>The people seen doing selfless acts never did so in the hope of being known as heroes.

What people should learn from the floods is the importance of nature's adjustments together with man-made facilities in dealing with extreme situations, experts said.</p><p><br/><br/>As Henan reported at least 25 deaths in unprecedented rainfall and floods, the AFP on Tuesday highlighted a collapsing dam in Luoyang, saying the threat of floods has risen in China because of the construction of dams and levees, which \"cut connections between the river and adjacent lakes and disrupted floodplains that had helped absorb the summer surge.\"<br/><br/>Experts reached by the Global Times said the building of dams and \"worsening threat\" do not have direct links, especially in this case of Henan, which was more like a sudden act of nature.\u00a0<br/><br/>Overseas outlets are exaggerating the issue, as in fact the construction of dams and reservoirs will enhance regional disaster prevention and mitigation, rather than reduce it, Fu Zongfu, a professor from College of Water Conservancy and Hydropower Engineering at Hehai University, told the Global Times on Wednesday.<br/><br/>Most countries build dams, which greatly improve flood control and disaster reduction capacity, so the construction of dams should not be denied because of a rare disaster, Fu said.\u00a0<br/><br/>Due to the unprecedented heavy rain, the state flood control and drought relief bureau dispatched a work group to Henan and initiated a level III emergency response rescue work. About 849 people have been rescued.<br/><br/>Henan Province is located in Central China's plains, spanning four major river basins of Haihe River, Yellow River, Huaihe River and Yangtze River, and has 1,030 rivers each with a drainage area of at least 50 square kilometers.<br/><br/>The expert said floods may be caused by many factors, such as topography (Henan is low and vulnerable) and rapid urbanization, which makes the ground susceptible to water. However, the most important one is extreme climate, as drainage systems are not designed for such rare downpours.\u00a0<br/><br/>Ma Jun, director of the Beijing-based Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the construction of dams will have some impact on the floodplain's ecology, but has no direct connection to flooding.\u00a0<br/><br/>Chinese dam projects usually make ecological compensation, which requires that the water discharge of hydropower stations should not be lower than the normal ecological water discharge, meaning it has little impact on the ecology, Fu said.\u00a0<br/><br/>Experts also stressed that lakes adjacent to rivers and floodplains represent nature's \"regulating power,\" while the dam represents artificial regulation, and the two should work together for flood control.<br/><br/>While artificial regulation can play a role, the dangers of sudden extreme weather cannot be totally eliminated, so the importance of natural regulation cannot be ignored, Ma said.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>He explained that the dams often serve a combination of functions, including power generation, irrigation, and tourism.\u00a0<br/><br/>After the disastrous 1998 floods, China asked local governments to gradually \"return farmlands to the lakes,\" in a bid to restore natural regulating ability, and stop excessive development.\u00a0<br/><br/>Following the 1975 Banqiao Dam failure, which led to the collapse of 62 dams in Henan Province, China has strengthened the design, construction, operation and management of dams. China's dam technology and safety are world class, experts said.\u00a0<br/><br/>The collapsed dam in Luoyang on Wednesday is probably old and earth-made, dating back to the 1950s to 1970s. Despite constant reinforcement and maintenance, the fatal flaw of such levees is that they are prone to failure when heavy rainfall causes the water to overflow above the peak level, Ma said.\u00a0<br/><br/></p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 39, "title": "Henan floods should lead to better extreme weather response: Global Times editorial", "published": "2021-07-22", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Zhengzhou photo:IC</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The heavy rainfall in Central China's Henan Province has once again shocked the Chinese people's previous understanding of meteorological disasters and pushed us to rethink how to prevent such disasters from causing tragic consequences.<br/><br/>First, the intensity of the weather disaster exceeds our previous experience. For example, this time, the extremely strong rainfall in Zhengzhou, the capital city of Henan Province, with over 200 mm of precipitation in an hour, was beyond imagination. From tornadoes in northern China to the torrential rain in Henan, these disasters are telling us that extreme weather and its intensity are increasing significantly. In the future we can no longer use vague phrases, such as \"once in a thousand years\" or \"once in a hundred years,\" to guide the fight against disasters. We must be ready to encounter and contend with catastrophic weather more often.</p><p><br/><br/>It is not realistic to have our cities, as well as the rural areas, build the infrastructure that can effectively cope with heavy rainfall like in Zhengzhou in the past few days. It was absolutely impossible to keep Zhengzhou from flooding on Tuesday. Such a standard in the fight against disasters means unaffordable costs, and our cities are unlikely to take that extreme safety route.<br/><br/>However, we should seriously consider and implement measures, including enhancing cities' drainage so that they can provide valuable time for deployment and response for urban disaster relief in emergency situations.<br/><br/>We need to set a target for extreme disaster resistance: the most important thing under such a situation is to reduce or even avoid deaths. In other words, we cannot build super infrastructure for every city to get prepared for a so-called \"once in a thousand years\" flood. However, we must build the real ability of danger avoidance for every city, village, and town when facing meteorological disasters.<br/><br/>Situations around the world have repeatedly proven that despite human beings' continuous advancement in science and technology, nature is still the most powerful. Human beings cannot build a completely safe city. The most fundamental guarantee on disaster resistance lies in human beings' wisdom and measures to fight nature based on the increasingly solid infrastructure. After all, extreme meteorological disasters are of low probability, and it is difficult to avoid unexpected situations. However, our preparations should be able to quickly coordinate with the emergency response at critical moments, to jointly make up for the risks caused by unexpected situations, and reach the goal of reducing or even eliminating deaths.<br/><br/>For this reason, Chinese society needs to pay more for preventive response to early warnings for meteorological disasters. Such a cost is not too large when it is split into different areas, yet it can effectively reduce the probability of major human and property losses caused by meteorological disasters. This is worthwhile from the perspective of society. For this reason, all cities and towns should form relatively consistent standards for precautionary preparations.<br/><br/>It is also vital to ensure correct command in emergencies. Society should form a high degree of consensus to follow the command and fight floods at critical moments. There must be no hesitation or delay when evacuation and flood diversion are required. The implementation must be resolute and effective. Public opinion should support such an anti-disaster order.<br/><br/>It was reported that the floods had caused 25 deaths and 7 missing in Henan this time. This is the first human toll from the province since the floods began. The final deaths in the province will be a key indicator of the effectiveness of disaster relief.<br/><br/>Henan fought a huge battle this time. The People's Liberation Army and People's Armed Police Force were quickly mobilized and deployed to the most dangerous areas, and measures including flood diversions were used in time to effectively reduce some disaster risks. But the biggest loss of life took place in the Zhengzhou subway. China's Ministry of Transportation has already asked local authorities to learn from the lessons of the incident.<br/><br/>As the disaster-relief work continues in Henan, there is strong support for the province, the birthplace of Chinese civilization, to respond fully to the disaster. We hope that no new deaths will occur when the first wave of the disaster passes. It is believed that Henan's resilience to the floods has been quickly developed in the fast-paced disaster response and will not fail to meet public expectations.<br/><br/>Stay safe, Henan!

The training typically includes exercises such as ice-cave traversal and underwater searches. The firefighters belong to the Miyun Firefighting Water Rescue Team, a professional rescue outfit established in 2012 to meet the growing demand for aquatic rescue operations. In June 2019, the Ministry of Emergency Management's Fire and Rescue Administration also established the National Water Rescue Beijing Brigade, to build upon the foundations put down by the Miyun team. In China, there are now eight water rescue brigades similar to the one in Miyun district, which are comprised of hundreds of firefighters with expertise in such rescues. In recent years, they have participated in various operations during natural disasters including the 2021 Henan floods and the 2023 Beijing deluge. Cold comfortThe teams have largely remained out of the spotlight, and few people are aware of the dangers involved in the rescuers' work. In northern China, the toughest rescues occur in winter. A person waiting to be rescued in the South China Sea can survive for around 30 hours, but during the depths of a northern winter they may lose consciousness in just 20 minutes. Our mission is to rescue people trapped in the water, but in most cases their vital signs are absent when we find them,\" said Zheng Haiyang, a 26-year-old firefighter from Dezhou, Shandong province, who has trained as a water rescuer with the Miyun team for about eight years.

Since the start of the current round of rainfall on July 29, the \"Sky Eye\" smart system installed in some streets has remained vigilant. High-definition cameras installed on flood prevention emergency vehicles and rescue team helmets can monitor precipitation in real time, greatly improving the efficiency of flood responses.<br/><br/>\"Early assessment, early warning, and early deployment\" are the most significant forms of progress that the Global Times witnessed amid the slate of heavy rain that hit Beijing.<br/><br/>While visiting and reporting in waterlogged Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province, in July 2021, Global Times reporters found that the consensus among the public was they received warning notifications \"too late.\" While other areas in Henan Province had already been hit by heavy downpours, Zhengzhou city government did not decisively put measures in place to stop gatherings, suspend classes, and require the closure of businesses, wasting critical time in flood prevention and missing a key rescue window.\u00a0<br/><br/>The official investigation report on the severe rainstorm disaster in Zhengzhou which caused at least 398 deaths and missing, exposed serious misconducts in the city's response deployment, including inadequate warning, significant delays in emergency responses, and a lack of unified command at critical moments. These issues led to the highest disaster-related casualties seen in recent years, particularly with regard to the subway system and tunnel, which should not have occurred.<br/><br/>This time in Beijing, Global Times reporters found residents in the capital city received multiple flood prevention reminders via text from relevant departments before the heavy rain actually fell down. Beijing successively issued red rainstorm warnings, yellow lightning warnings, and blue wind warnings, reminding citizens to refrain from outdoor activities. Many organizations immediately issued directives for their employees to work from home.<br/><br/>News sources reported that in preparation, the Beijing Drainage Group initiated a top-level flood early-warning protocol, requiring all pump station personnel to be on duty. At the same time, a re-inspection and re-treatment of drainage facilities in key areas such as 155 depressed bridges and 249 subway stations, as well as a re-inspection of water pumps, backup power sources, flood control emergency equipment, and various monitoring systems in 87 rainwater pump stations across the city were conducted.\u00a0<br/><br/>Power system companies also deployed emergency teams in advance. The State Grid Corporation of China (Beijing), for example, had 22 rescue teams with 510 personnel on standby, ready to transport power generation vehicles, small generators, lighting vehicles, and other flood control emergency supplies and equipment to be stationed in areas with strong rainfall forecasted by meteorological bodies.\u00a0<br/><br/>Beijing's main cultural and tourism venues issued temporary closure notices soon after the Beijing city government temporarily asked to shut down access to all scenic spots on July 30.<br/><br/>All mountainous and water-related scenic spots and rural homestays in the heavily affected area of Fangshan district were temporarily closed and have stopped receiving visitors since then. All 17 tourist attractions in Huairou district were closed, and all homestays and folk accommodations were temporarily suspended to minimize risk.<br/><br/>Amid the heavy downpour sweeping through many parts of China, local authorities have stepped up efforts to counter flooding and power cuts. After days of search and evacuation efforts, disinfection work has begun in residential and commercial areas in the city over this weekend.<br/><br/>Throughout three major rainstorms, nonstop rescue missions have been executed with countless heartwarming stories. In the last decade, what has changed is our continuously honed ability to respond to floods, while what remains unchanged is the resilience exemplified by every individual, an essence of the Chinese civilization.\u00a0<br/><br/>We believe that in the future, we will face floods and other natural disasters with even greater composure and unite together to withstand the tests they bring.</p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["Emergency response personnel stand ready at an underpass prone to waterlogging in Shijiangshan district in southwestern Beijing to prepare for emergencies on July 30, 2023 as the metropolis has posted a highest-level red alert for heavy rainstorms brought by the remnants of Typhoon Doksuri.

Please inspect the sites and you will see why I am asking for full impact assessments covering the environment, traffic and drainage, plus a terrain hazard study that is essential given the topography of the area, before any consideration is given to rezoning. While the government may wish for this scheme to have some success, speculative acquisitions by developers should not be rewarded with any site on offer, and these two sites are fraught with problems. Allan Hay, Tai PoPay attention to reasons behind Henan floodsI am writing to express my views on the article \"China flood survivors tell of rising water and last goodbyes as disaster claims at least 25 lives and displaces thousands\" (July 21). Floodwater crashed through Henan province in China after days of torrential rain since July 17, with rescue work still continuing at the end of July. In one particularly horrifying episode, floodwater rushed into a train compartment in the provincial capital of Zhengzhou, steadily rising from ankle to neck height, leading passengers to stand on the seats. To add to the chaos, the compartment was plunged into darkness, as passengers waited for rescue that finally came hours later. Unfortunately, at least 12 people trapped in the flooded subway were among more than 65 people who died in this tragedy. In addition to my deep sense of sorrow after reading the news of this disaster, the reason for these floods is also worth our attention."]}, {"relevance_score": 23, "title": "Claims could hit 11b yuan over Henan flooding", "published": "2021-07-28", "bodyText": "<p>The Henan floods are likely to see total insurance claims of up to 11 billion yuan (HK$13.1 billion), Goldman Sachs said, with one \u00adexpert adding this could be the largest natural \u00adcatastrophe for \u00adinsurers in China's history.<br/>The floods in Henan province, caused by unprecedented rainfall last week, have killed 58 people with five still missing, while \u00adthousands of cars and homes have been damaged and farmland inundated.

This year has been filled with COVID-19 news, \u201cdraconian\u201d crackdowns and natural disasters \u2014 let\u2019s briefly cast our eyes back.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>Another year of COVID-19<br/><br/><br/><br/>2021 will be another year that goes down in history as one besieged by COVID-19. Many around the world had hoped that 2020 was the worst of it, but in many ways that just wasn\u2019t the case.<br/><br/><br/><br/>China has stuck firmly to its COVID-zero strategy, whereby absolute elimination is the goal, much to the chagrin of Western powers who have been pushing for China to \u201clive with\u201d the virus. With 800,000 already dead in the United States alone, it\u2019s not so much \u201clive with the virus\u201d as it is \u201cdie with the virus.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>New Zealand was the last Western nation to give up its COVID-zero strategy, but it gave a huge fight.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We\u2019ve had to accept that vaccines, initially hoped to stop transmission, are now just keeping the vaccinated out of hospital. In many Western nations, vaccine hesitancy is high \u2014 in the US, for example, only 61.7 percent of the population are fully vaccinated. In New Zealand, it\u2019s just over 75 percent, while Canada has achieved 77.2 percent.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In East Asia, the vaccine situation is much better. South Korea has fully vaccinated about 81.5 percent of its population, and China has fully vaccinated nearly 1.2 billion of its 1.4 billion citizens.<br/><br/><br/><br/>China\u2019s crackdowns<br/><br/><br/><br/>This year, China enforced huge crackdowns that caught the eyes of Western media. One of the most discussed was the crackdown on what they called \u201cidol worship,\u201d which especially gained momentum after A-list pop star and actor Kris Wu was arrested for allegedly taking advantage of young fans sexually. The regulations pushed for content creators to engage with more \u201cmoral\u201d artists and avoid promoting people with questionable characteristics.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Officials told online platforms to clean up fan circles, which were known to be toxic spaces where young fans would often waste money just to boost their idols in competitions. One such competition saw viewers having to buy a special brand of milk and scan the QR code inside in order to vote for their favorite performer on a talent show. This led to thousands of liters of milk being bought and tipped down drains, irking authorities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The biggest target of the Western mainstream media, though, was the new rules for children under 18 playing online games. Now they\u2019re only allowed to play for three hours a week, and only on weekends and national holidays. Western media called the move \u201cdraconian,\u201d which has since become a meme for China reporting.<br/><br/><br/><br/>... but at what cost?<br/><br/><br/><br/>Another meme of Western media reports on China that has gained popularity with China supporters this year is the hilarious \u201c... but at what cost?\u201d headline. Western media outlets will mention positive news from China, but make it negative by adding \u201c... but at what cost?\u201d at the end.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Here are some examples: \u201cChina invests in environment, but at what cost?,\u201d \u201cWuhan one year on: The city that appears safe from COVID \u2014 but at what cost?,\u201d \u201cChina is getting smarter, but at what cost?,\u201d \u201cGreen transition in China: At what cost?,\u201d \u201cChina\u2019s economy looks to be stabilizing, but at what cost?,\u201d \u201cClean air at what cost?\u201d and \u201cChina invests in Ethiopia, but at what cost?.\u201d<br/><br/><br/><br/>Henan floods<br/><br/><br/><br/>Massive flooding hit Henan Province in July, even crippling capital city Zhengzhou.

The record downpour showed no signs of abating, with requests for help popping up on China's social media platforms. The death toll from torrential rain in Henan had risen to 99 as of Thursday noon. More than 13.91 million people in 150 county-level regions had been affected by the latest round of downpours since July 16. The more information they got, the more desperate Zhao and Lou, both 21, were to go to the front line to render help. On July 21, they searched online and joined dozens of WeChat and QQ groups focusing on disaster relief. Zhang Jingshu was also a member of these groups. One of the admins of these online groups was a post-1995 generation netizen called Hezi from the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu. Hezi swung into action on July 20 and launched an online rescue campaign. \"We classify and verify the online messages before inputting the data on shared documents. Then, we connect those in need of help with the rescue forces,\" said Hezi. As more young people got involved in different online rescue groups, an anti-disaster fight by China's Generation Z soon started at the fingertips. The fight has rallied thousands of volunteers from home and abroad who are working in shifts 24 hours a day to offer help through the internet. On July 24, Hezi announced on his official WeChat account that he had founded 10 online rescue groups of more than 3,000 people. His teams had collected over 10,000 messages and assisted the rescue of thousands of people. The original aim of his online teams was simply to collect information calling for help, Hezi said. The situation, however, demanded more. \"With plenty of information pouring in, it is far from enough. The urgent messages might be washed away by the highly repetitive and scattered ones,\" Hezi added. To ensure targeted rescue, the teams were divided into several groups tasked with different responsibilities like searching and verifying information, and contacting rescuers. During her long-haul international flight back to China, Zhang Jingshu, majoring in education data analysis, was busy tapping on the laptop to filter critical information using her professional tech skills. As soon as she arrived, Zhang shared the information with other group members through Wechat. Zhao and Lou were part of another group to check whether the information source was reliable and if people were still awaiting help. They distinguished the information by marking them with different colors. For instance, green meant saved, red indicated very urgent, orange meant urgent while gray suggested the information sender lost contact or even possibly died. The two girls ate one hamburger, which was the only food they had after joining the volunteer team for two days. \"We didn't dare to sleep.

DW\u2019s correspondent Mathias Boelinger. Photo: Twitter Screenshot. Western journalists reported on these heroic efforts to save lives and shared the videos on Twitter. With similar intense floods occurring in Germany and Belgium, much of the foreign coverage of the Henan floods noted that they were a part of a worldwide pattern of intense and extreme flooding, most likely exacerbated by climate change. But curiously, Western reporters on the ground in Henan experienced hostility, even as the Western media largely framed the floods within the context of factual descriptions of damage and climate change. One reporter for Deutsche Welle, Mathias Boelinger, was encircled by a crowd as he reported from one of the worst hit parts of Zhengzhou. People in the crowd angrily told him to get out of China and accused him of spreading rumours. However, it turned out that the angry crowd thought Boelinger was Robin Brant, a BBC reporter. In March, Chinese Communist Party social media accounts and Chinese diplomats launched a large, coordinated social media campaign to discredit Brant and the BBC, after the BBC published a detailed report on extralegal detention in Xinjiang, which included firsthand allegations of rape by male camp guards."]}, {"relevance_score": 36, "title": "Harnessing Yangtze", "published": "2021-08-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Three Gorges Dam in Yichang, Central China's Hubei Province, opens 11 release valves to discharge water on August 20, 2020, to cope with the biggest flood since the construction of the dam.

In the face of severe flooding caused by record-breaking heavy rainfall in northern China, especially flash floods in Henan Province, major water conservancy projects along the Yangtze River in the south also put in place measures for flood control, and dam operators have been constantly on alert for possible sudden flood hazards.<br/><br/>Engineers and experts told the Global Times said that the dams built along the Yangtze River have all passed various tests and been playing a key role in combating seasonal floods. Despite the relatively low rainfall in the Yangtze basin this year, these cascade reservoirs have been a source of security for the life and property of people\u00a0 living along the river.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A robot inspects a 220kV GIS switchyard equipment at the Gezhouba Dam.

Faced with two consecutive floods delivering over 40,000 cubic meters of water per second, the Three Gorges Dam, the world's largest hydropower project, freed up 1.284 billion cubic meters of reservoir capacity in advance, controlling the discharge flow at about 31,300 cubic meters per second, cutting the peak rate by about 30 percent.<br/><br/>\"The Three Gorges Dam has changed the flood control across the Jingjiang reach of the Yangtze River, raising its flood control standard from once in 10 or 20 years to once in a hundred years,\" Li Shuai, senior engineer at Hub Operation and Management Center of Three Gorges Dam, told the Global Times.\u00a0<br/><br/>In 2020, the Yangtze River experienced several rounds of heavy flooding. The Three Gorges Dam opened 11 spillway tunnels and successfully confronted the largest-ever flood peak of 75,000 cubic meters per second, finally containing a total of 29.5 billion cubic meters of water, accounting for about 60 percent of the total floods prevented in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze.<br/><br/>Data shows that from 2003 to 2020, the Three Gorges Reservoir has been filled 61 times to prevent floods, among which three times were to contain mega-floods of more than 70,000 cubic meters per second.<br/><br/>Experts point out that in addition to the fully operational Three Gorges Dam, the cascade reservoir group in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has also assumed a vital task in resisting the threat of flooding.<br/><br/>In June, China's Ministry of Water Resources approved a conjunctive management plan saying that during this year's flood season, a total of 47 dams along the Yangtze River will be jointly operated for flood control and power generation purposes, with a total flood control storage capacity of 69.5 billion cubic meters. Among them, there are seven dams are under the jurisdiction management of the CTG, with a total regulating reservoir capacity of 47.3 billion cubic meters and 38.6 billion cubic meters flood control reservoir capacity, playing a key role in the flood control system of the Yangtze River Basin.<br/><br/>The Wudongde Reservoir on the upper Yangtze River, which came into full operation in June, is already capable of assisting in flood prevention, and the joint flood control operations will be carried out with its downstream reservoirs such as Baihetan, Xiluodu and Xiangjiaba to improve flood control standards in the Sichuan-Chongqing reach of the Yangtze, in combination with the Three Gorges Reservoir to hold back floodwaters in the middle and lower reaches of the river system, Li said. \"In the Yangtze River basin, there are 1,400 weather stations and more than 20,000 hydro-meteorological stations established for providing most real-time, accurate and comprehensive information for reservoirs' safe operation,\" a representative from the Three Gorges Cascade Dispatch and Communication Center told the Global Times.<br/><br/>The same representative noted that with technical support offered by the BeiDou Satellite Navigation System, the most advanced weather measurement equipment currently adopted by the CTG can issue and update refined weather forecasts every 10 minutes, and can accurately predict the precipitation situation of the entire Yangtze River basin within 10 days on a grid basis management.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"This precipitation and hydrological forecasting system divides upstream areas into more than 130 monitoring sections to measure the runoff into reservoirs through amount of precipitation, and on this basis to make a seven-day rolling operation plan for the terrace reservoir, with the forecast accuracy reaching 98 percent within 24 hours and 92 percent within one week,\" he added.\u00a0<br/><br/>At present, CTG is gradually strengthening inspection procedures for key equipment built into telemetry stations, and increasing the frequency of communication and information sharing with local governments in each reservoir area to ensure a rapid response to special and emergency situations.\u00a0<br/><br/>The Chinese government and many hydropower engineering companies have made an enormous effort to combat flooding, and over the years in a constant struggle against the forces of nature, Chinese people have become more humble, rigorous and respectful of science, forming a series of well-tested and regulated operations to deal with almost any contingency, He Wei, a deputy director of the Engineering and Construction Department of Baihetan Hydropower Station, the world's most technically challenging hydropower project under construction, told the Global Times.<br/><br/>\"The Yangtze River used to be a river that people couldn't harness, but now, the flood of the Yangtze is no longer a beast but a resource,\" He said.</p><p>A giant screen at the Three Gorges Cascade Dispatch and Communication Center\u00a0shows the flood peak shaving process.

The State Department also said in a press release on Wednesday that the meetings are \"part of ongoing US efforts to hold candid exchanges with PRC officials to advance US interests and values, and to responsibly manage the relationship.\"<br/><br/>If the US still has not learned how to treat other countries equally, then China, together with the international community, has a responsibility to teach the US, Wang noted.<br/><br/>Almost at the same time, US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin started his trip to Singapore, Vietnam and the Philippines on Friday and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken will pay a visit to India.\u00a0<br/><br/>Given the overall situation of the China-US relationship, in addition to apparent tensions at the Alaska meeting, the most recent face-to-face interaction between senior officials of the two countries, Chinese officials are unlikely to hold high expectations toward the upcoming dialogue, Li Yan, deputy director of Institute of American Studies of China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Sunday.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"Especially as the US government has taken a series of measures to further suppress China, which has largely lowered the expectations of the Chinese side,\" he said.\u00a0<br/><br/>China said on Friday that it will impose sanctions against six individuals including the former US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Louis Ross and Chairman of US-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) Carolyn Bartholomew, as well as one entity of the US, the Hong Kong Democratic Council, according to the Anti-Foreign Sanctions Law.<br/><br/>The move is a reciprocal countermeasure against the recent erroneous practice of the US targeting Hong Kong, when the White House issued an advisory to warn US businesses about risks to their operations and activities in Hong Kong, and sanctioned seven Hong Kong liaison office officials, while adding them to the US Treasury's \"specially designated nationals\" list on July 16.<br/><br/>A shift in China policy?<br/><br/>\"Since US President Joe Biden took office, his administration has been following strategies from the Trump era featuring the heavy pressure and dealing with China in a cold way.

Also, it has been about six months since Biden took office emphasizing competition, cooperation and confrontation, however, the competition and confrontation have been largely amplified over the past few months, leading to a negative impact on overall China-US relationship which needs to be adjusted.\u00a0<br/><br/>Ways to manage competition<br/><br/>US officials said prior to Sherman's visit that there needs to be a level playing field and guardrails to ensure ties do not turn into conflict, and the world's two largest economies need responsible ways to manage competition, Reuters reported on Sunday.\u00a0<br/><br/>\"She's going to underscore that we do not want that stiff and sustained competition to veer into conflict,\" one senior US administration official noted.\u00a0<br/><br/>The US wants to ensure there are \"guardrails\" and \"parameters\" in place to responsibly manage the relationship,\" he said, adding that \"Everyone needs to play by the same rules,\" according to the Reuters report.\u00a0<br/><br/>However, Chinese observers see such remarks \"vague and far from enough,\" as the \"guardrails\" and \"parameters\" were only set to serve US interests.<br/><br/>\"When the US said it wants to ensure there are guardrails and parameters in place to responsibly manage the relationship, it's still very dangerous if there is no clear boundary, as the competition can evolve into conflict.
