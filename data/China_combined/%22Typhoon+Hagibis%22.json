[{"relevance_score": 71, "title": "Explainer: What are typhoons, and how are they linked to climate change?", "published": "2024-09-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tropical cyclones are powerful storm systems characterised by low pressure, strong winds, and heavy rain. They form over warm ocean waters, mostly in tropical regions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once they sustain wind speeds exceeding 63 kilometres per hour they are considered a tropical storm and receive a name. Between 80 to 90 named tropical cyclones form every year around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Depending on the location, named tropical cyclones are referred to either as hurricanes or as typhoons. The former term is particularly used in the US as it comprises cyclones that originate in the Atlantic Ocean or northeastern Pacific Ocean.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tropical cyclones that form in the northwestern Pacific Ocean are known as typhoons. Depending on the area, the minimum wind speed needed for a cyclone to be classified as a typhoon varies. Vietnam and Japan classify it as such when winds reach a minimum speed of 98.2 kilometres per hour. In southern China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, the minimum speed must be 118 kilometres per hour.</p><p>Typhoons are then classified further as their speed increases. Hong Kong, for example, refers to them simply as Typhoons when the wind speed does not exceed 149 kilometres per hour, after which they become Severe Typhoons. When the speed is 185 kilometres per hour or above they are known as Super Typhoons.</p><p>Hong Kong also relies on a set of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hko.gov.hk/textonly/v2/explain/intro.htm\">numeric warming signals</url> to indicate the threat or effects of a typhoon, with the lowest-level T1,  or standby signal, issued when a tropical cyclone approaches within 800 kilometres of the territory and poses a threat of deteriorating conditions. </p><p>The warning can increase to a T3, indicating strong winds; a T8, indicating gale or storm force winds; a T9, which means that gale or storm force winds are increasing; and the maximum T10, indicating that hurricane force winds with sustained speeds reaching 118 kilometres per hour of above are forecast.</p><h>How do tropical cyclones form?</h><p>To form, tropical cyclones need a minimum sea surface temperatures of 26 degrees Celsius. This provides the necessary heat and moisture to fuel the storm, as opposed to cooler waters which can weaken or dissipate it.</p><p>Hurricanes or typhoons form when warm ocean waters heat the air above them, causing the warm, moist air to rise. As this air ascends, it cools and condenses, forming clouds and creating a low-pressure zone beneath. This low pressure allows more air to rush in from surrounding areas. </p><p>As the system continues to develop, it can lead to the formation of thunderstorms. If there are no strong winds to disrupt the process, the storm can intensify and evolve into a hurricane or typhoon, depending on its location.</p><p>Warm ocean waters, atmospheric instability, and favourable wind conditions all contribute to fuelling the cyclone and making it more powerful.</p><p>Viewed from space, tropical cyclones have spiral cloud bands and a visible \u201ceye,\u201d the cyclone\u2019s centre. In some cases, the structure of the eye is visible as well. The eye is a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.noaa.gov/jetstream/tropical/tropical-cyclone-introduction/tropical-cyclone-structure\">calm, generally clear area</url> of sinking air and light winds of maximum 24 kilometres per hour and is typically 32 to 64 kilometres across.</p><p>The diameter of a tropical cyclone is usually around 200 to 500 kilometers (124-311 miles), but can reach up to 1,000 kilometers (621 miles).</p><h>Economic impact</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29379-1\">Tropical cyclones are the costliest weather events globally</url>, particularly in cyclone-prone regions such as the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, and southern US. </p><p>The immense damage they can cause stems from high winds, heavy rainfall, flooding, and storm surges, which can devastate infrastructure, homes, and agriculture. They can cause billions of dollars in damages, loss of life, and long-term recovery costs.</p><p>The world\u2019s top-ten costliest tropical cyclones <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1297538/global-leading-tropical-cyclones-economic-loss/\">all occurred in the Atlantic Ocean</url>.

According to the attribution analysis, the winds were about 14 kilometres per hour, or 7 per cent, more intense due to human-made climate change.</p><p>The typhoon brought huge amounts of rainfall, too. The Philippines, which was not in Gaemi\u2019s path, saw its seasonal rains exacerbated by the typhoon\u2019s influence, triggering devastating floods that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/death-toll-in-philippines-climbs-to-34-as-typhoon-gaemi-batters-region/3286695#:~:text=The%20death%20toll%20from%20landslidesand%20two%20in%20Bicol%20area.\">killed 34 people</url>. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2024/08/02/at-least-30-dead-after-torrential-rain-in-central-china-dozens-more-missing/\">Gaemi made a second landfall in eastern China</url>, leading to heavy flooding, mudflows, and landslides.

This, they say, would reflect the wind speed already reached in a number of storms in the last decade, including Typhoon Haiyan (2013), Typhoon Meranti (2016), Typhoon Goni (2020), and Typhoon Surigae (2021) in the Western Pacific and Hurricane Patricia (2015) in the Eastern Pacific.</p><p>A 2020 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1920849117\">analysis</url> of satellite records from 1979 to 2017 found that the likelihood of a storm reaching Category 3 or above, with sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour, increased by 8 per cent per decade. </p><p>In 2023, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://earth.org/ipcc-assessment-report/\">Sixth Assessment Report</url> confirmed these observations, arguing that the proportion of Category 3 to 5 tropical cyclones as well as the frequency of rapid intensification events have likely increased globally over the past four decades. And with our atmosphere and oceans set to continue warming in the coming years as the climate crisis intensifies, there is little doubt that wind speeds will also progressively strengthen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Help safeguard press freedom &amp; keep HKFP free for all readers by <url normalizedValue=\"https://support.hongkongfp.com/\">supporting our team</url></emphasis></emphasis></p><p>class=\"newspack-popup-container newspack-popup hidden newspack-inline-popup newspack-lightbox-no-border \"</p><p>role=\"button\"</p><p>tabindex=\"0\"</p><p>style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF;color:#000\"</p><p>id=\"id_483304\"</p><p>data-segments=\"\"</p><p>data-frequency=\"0,0,0,month\"</p><p>&gt;</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">HKFP has an <url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2020/03/19/editorial-hkfp-gets-full-marks-newsguard-initiative-meeting-9-credibility-transparency-criteria/\">impartial stance</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/annual-report/\">transparent funding</url>, and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/hkfp-code-ethics/\">balanced coverage</url> guided by an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/hkfp-code-ethics/\">Ethics Code</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://hongkongfp.com/hkfp-corrections-policy/\">Corrections Policy</url>. </emphasis></emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://support.hongkongfp.com/en/\">Support press freedom &amp; help us surpass 1,000 monthly Patrons</url>: 100% independent, governed by an ethics code &amp; not-for-profit.</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Hong Kong Free Press", "instances": ["The world\u2019s top-ten costliest tropical cyclones all occurred in the Atlantic Ocean.

Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>The return of post-pandemic tourism and its associated carbon emissions, when viewed as a contributing factor to the potential extinction of the human race, may be considered a troubling development, but millions of livelihoods are dependent on the industry and it seems unlikely people will be willing to stop travelling for pleasure just yet. </p><p>As with much else on the planet, though, the tourism industry will increasingly be affected by the climate crisis, both in terms of how weather patterns change and what regulations, taxes or other restrictions governments place on the movement of people across borders to lower their carbon emissions. </p><p>There may be short-term winners from the changes - countries with wealthy populations that increasingly stay at home rather than jetting off for their holidays, for example - but among the many losers, some will suffer severe effects earlier than others. </p><p>\"We are the most vulnerable country in the world,\" the Maldives' minister of environment, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url> and technology Aminath Shauna told CNBC in May. \"There's no higher ground for us ... it's just us, it's just our islands and the sea.\" </p><p>Residents of low-lying nations such as the Maldives archipelago in the Indian Ocean and of regions prone to ever more intense forest fires will have an increasingly difficult time just staying put, let alone convincing tourists to visit. However, the consequences of climate breakdown for countries that are not so obviously sinking or burning may be a little less obvious to gauge. </p><p>Every year, non-profit NGO Germanwatch publishes the Global Climate Risk Index, which analyses the extent to which countries have been affected by weather-related events, by taking into account lives lost and financial costs incurred. </p><p>Although not a comprehensive scoring of climate vulnerability - the analysis focuses on extreme weather events such as storms, floods and heatwaves but does not take into account slow-onset processes such as rising sea levels, glacier melting or ocean warming and acidification - the research does give a sense of which countries are being hit hardest and most directly by the changes in the climate. </p><p>\"It is important to note that the occurrence of a single extreme event cannot be easily attributed to anthropogenic climate change,\" stresses the Bonn, Germany-based NGO. \"Nevertheless, climate change is an increasingly important factor for changing the likelihood of the occurrence and the intensity of these events.\" </p><p>The Global Climate Risk Index 2021, published in January and covering 2019, was accompanied by a second list, concerned with the period 2000-2019. Mozambique and The Bahamas appear in the top 10 of both lists; of the remaining 16 countries, nine are in Asia, including some popular tourism destinations. </p><p>Japan and India were among the the 10 nations worst affected by climate events in 2019. When climate events of the past two decades were considered, Myanmar, The Philippines, Thailand and Nepal all placed among the 10 hardest hit countries. </p><p>In October 2019, Japan was hit by Typhoon Hagibis, the most powerful storm the country had seen in more than 60 years. With wind speeds reaching 250km/h, Hagibis put paid to two Rugby World Cup matches before delivering up to 1,000mm of rain in 72 hours to the Tokai, Kanto and Tohoku regions (70 per cent of the annual average). Nearly 100 people died and 13,000 houses were destroyed or damaged. </p><p>At the time, Japan was still trying to recover from September 2019's Typhoon Faxai - one of the strongest typhoons to hit Tokyo in a decade and which had left more than 900,000 homes without power. The economic damage caused by the two typhoons is estimated at US$25 billion. </p><p>Japan also experienced a heatwave in August 2019 that led to more than 18,000 hospital admissions and killed 57 people. The authorities were particularly concerned about <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/east-asia/article/3011937/health-warnings-tourists-japan-swelters-during-record-heatwave\">the many tourists visiting at the time</url>. \"We are telling all customers who visit our retail outlets that they need to take as many precautions as possible,\" Kaori Mori, a spokeswoman for domestic travel giant JTB Corp, was quoted as saying. </p><p>In India, monsoon conditions, which usually last from June to early September, continued for a month longer than usual in 2019, with the extra rain causing floods that took 1,800 lives across 14 states and displaced 1.8 million people. Economic damage was estimated to be US$10 billion. </p><p>The year was made more miserable by eight tropical cyclones (six of them \"very severe\"), representing one of the most active Northern Indian Ocean cyclone seasons on record. The worst, May's Cyclone Fani, affected 28 million people, killing nearly 90 in India and Bangladesh and causing economic losses of US$8.1 billion, according to Germanwatch. </p><p>The list for the period 2000-2019 is based on the average Credit Risk Index values given by the NGO for each of the 20 years covered. \"The list of countries featured in the long-term [top] 10 can be divided into two groups,\" says Germanwatch. \"Firstly, those which were most affected due to exceptional catastrophes and secondly, those which are affected by extreme events on an ongoing basis.\" </p><p>Countries in the first category include Myanmar, where 2008's Cyclone Nargis caused more than 95 per cent of the damage and fatalities the country saw from storms between 2000 and 2019. \"The giant storm that swept up the Bay of Bengal and lashed southern Myanmar over the first weekend in May killed more than 138,000 people - the worst natural disaster ever to strike the country,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/664804/asias-year-living-dysfunctionally\">the Post reported</url>. </p><p>\"Its destructive force - 215km/h winds and a vast tidal surge - swept away low-lying areas on the fingers of land known as the Mouths of the Irrawaddy. Children were pulled from their parents' grasp as waves swept over villages in the darkness, reaching more than 30km inland. Entire towns were destroyed.\" </p><p>Countries affected by extreme events on a continuing basis include the Philippines, which is regularly exposed to fierce typhoons due to its geographical location. Typhoons Bopha (2012), Haiyan (2013) and Mangkhut (2018) were among the most destructive during the 20-year period under the microscope. </p><p>Countries' vulnerability to extreme events as highlighted by the indices should be understood \"as warnings in order to be prepared for more frequent and/or more severe events\", says Germanwatch. With climate information collected from 2020 - which equaled 2016 as the hottest on record - the NGO's Global Climate Risk Index 2022 will no doubt make for grim reading. </p><p>Reports such as those from Germanwatch show that the effects of climate breakdown do not fall equally. And they suggest that, in the near term at least, countries in Asia are likely to suffer more than most. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2021. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

But it was very different for rural areas, particularly where embankments alongside major rivers broke. </p><p>\"What is holding back further flood-defence measures are the limited budgets of more rural areas,\" Ichikawa said. </p><p>And if rainfall on this level occurs only once every 50 years or so, it causes a dilemma as to whether spending huge amounts of limited public funds on those defences is wise, he said. </p><p>\"Perhaps a different approach is needed,\" Ichikawa said. \"Warnings were issued through the television, radio and mobile phones, so it may be better to use technology to develop more accurate and rapid warning systems for the public. </p><p>\"If we give people more time to take action, such as evacuating a dangerous area, then we should be able to reduce the casualties,\" he said. </p><p>It was also important to change the mindsets of residents, Ichikawa said. </p><p>Most the dead and missing died in their own homes after either refusing to evacuate or being unable to leave. </p><p>\"We have to change the way that people think and encourage them to follow advice to evacuate,\" he said. \"People cannot simply blame the government; they have to take responsibility for their own well-being.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

The Japan Meteorological Agency has issued warnings for gale-force winds and heavy rain on Thursday evening in Tokyo and the surrounding regions, while Typhoon Bualoi is already battering the Ogasawara Islands, south of Tokyo, with strong winds, heavy rainfall and high waves. The death toll from Hagibis stands at 84, with nine people still listed as missing as a result of the October 12 storm. About 70,000 homes were damaged or destroyed by Hagibis, which also caused the agriculture and fisheries industries in 37 of Japan's 47 prefectures to suffer some 87. 6 billion yen (US$807 million) in losses. Kazuhisa Tsuboki, a professor at Nagoya University who studies super typhoons, says Bualoi is not as powerful as Hagibis and the eye of the storm is likely to travel north over the Pacific off Japan's east coast - but it still poses significant dangers."]}, {"relevance_score": 20, "title": "1st LD Writethru: Death toll rises to 68 in wake of Typhoon Hagibis ripping through Japan", "published": "2019-10-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">TOKYO, Oct. 15 (Xinhua) -- More than a dozen people are still missing with emergency crews desperately searching for them on Tuesday in the wake of Typhoon Hagibis ripping through Japan over the weekend, causing widespread damage with the death toll rising to 68.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Utility firms have said it could take as long as one week before some homes are back on the grid and receiving electricity safely as blackouts continue to affect many areas in Japan.</p><p>Industry Minister Isshu Sugawara said earlier that as many as 34,000 homes were still without power, with 16,000 homes in hard-hit Chiba Prefecture and 12,000 in Nagano Prefecture still affected.</p><p>Water supplies have also been knocked out in some regions, with 133,000 homes across 13 prefectures still without running water, the health ministry said.</p><p>The powerful typhoon has also led to severe flooding, with failing levees affecting 47 rivers in 66 areas across Japan, with the situation compounded by emergency services still unable to gain access and conduct full assessments due to extreme flooding in some areas.</p><p>Japan's public broadcaster NHK said that including the Chikuma River in Nagano Prefecture, located north of Tokyo, the catastrophic typhoon caused at least 200 rivers to overflow, adding to widespread flood damage across wide areas.</p><p>Along with power and water supply issues, the typhoon also triggered 146 mudslides across the country, Japan's infrastructure ministry said, with muddy flood water inundating at least 10,000 homes.</p><p>At a disaster task force meeting convened on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the government will have access to reserve funds, and if deemed necessary will draft a supplementary budget to cover the immense amount of reconstruction work necessary in the wake of the extensive damage caused by Hagibis.</p><p>\"It is urgent to provide adequate support for the victims.

In Chiba Prefecture's Kamogawa City, 85. 5 mm of rain per hour was logged as falling Friday morning and 215 mm over 12 hours until noon was logged in the prefecture's Otaki Town, the weather agency said, adding that the amount in Otaki in the 12-hour period was almost as much as an entire average month in the region. In the 24-hour period through Saturday morning, the weather agency has forecast 150 mm of rain to fall in the Kanto and Tohoku regions, and, along with the Pacific Izu Islands, 150 mm is expected to hit the central Japan regions of Tokai and Koshin. The current and coming downpours are likely to further hamper the stop-start repair and restoration work in areas pummeled by Typhoon Hagibis earlier this month as persistent rain since the most powerful typhoon to strike Japan in decades has continued in the wake of the mega-storm. According to local media reports Friday, the death toll from Typhoon Hagibis has risen to 88, with seven people still unaccounted for. In Fukushima Prefecture, worst hit by Hagibis and still reeling in the wake of the earthquake and tsunami disaster in 2011, 30 people have died, and officials are warning people in the northeastern region to be vigilant over the next 24 hours for further flooding, thunderstorms and landslides caused by the current unstable atmospheric conditions responsible for the downpours. More than 74,000 houses were inundated by the typhoon and 7,400 were destroyed or damaged, and as 4,000 people in 11 prefectures remain displaced in evacuation shelters, officials Friday urged local municipalities to prepare for more torrential rain and the possibility of more evacuees in the event of further weather-related disasters.

The three-time champions had won all 31 of their pool games dating back to the first tournament in 1987.

World Rugby said Hagibis, which has the same force as a Category 5 hurricane, \"is highly likely to cause considerable disruption in the Tokyo, Yokohama and Toyota City areas throughout Saturday.\" The England-France Pool C game in Yokohama was also canceled. The typhoon is predicted to be the worst of Japan's 2019 typhoon season and other games on Sunday might also be affected. Japan's World Cup had no contingencies for group games that couldn't be played on the day they were scheduled. No provision for a postponement and no chance of being played at another venue. The rules mean the game is called a scoreless draw and both teams get two log points. It's the first time any Rugby World Cup games have been cancelled. The All Blacks will get over it. After all, they still finish top of Pool B, as expected. New Zealand still has the playoffs and an attempt at a third straight World Cup title and fourth overall ahead of it. Coach Steve Hansen had no issues with the game being called off for safety reasons. \"When you get a typhoon to the level we're getting, then safety is the paramount thing so it's a no-brainer,\" Hansen said. The cancellation hit Italy harder. Italy had a sliver of a chance of going through to the quarterfinals if it beat the defending champion for the first time in its history. No one was expecting that, though, and it wasn't forefront in Italian players' minds in Toyota. Instead, Italy was ready to give veterans Sergio Parisse and Leonardo Ghiraldini fitting farewells after their long service to the team. No. 8 Parisse, Italy's captain, has played 142 tests, breaking the record for a northern hemisphere player in the Azzurri's last game at the World Cup against South Africa. He is the second most-capped player ever behind New Zealand World Cup winner Richie McCaw. The 34-year-old Parisse said he was going to retire after the World Cup and was due to go out against the world's best team in Toyota. At least he got to play at this World Cup. Hooker Ghiraldini, who is also 34, had to struggle to recover from injury to make Italy's squad and was due to be given his first action in Japan against New Zealand. It was to be in recognition of his 13 years and more than 100 tests of commitment in the front row.

Heads of states and representatives from nearly 200 countries and international organizations, including President Xi Jinping's special envoy and Vice President Wang Qishan, US Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, South Korean Prime Minister Lee Nak-yon, and Britain's Prince Charles, are attending the event.Emperor Naruhito's enthronement took place on May 1 and was attended mostly by Japanese people. This time, the ceremony is held mainly for the world at large. Which is the first country Emperor Naruhito will visit after the royal event?</p><p> How will Japan's royal diplomacy look like during the Reiwa era? All this will undoubtedly attract worldwide attention and there will be an element of anticipation.Activities of Japanese imperial family often attract public attention. But at this moment, imperial events have a special significance in the country - they can boost people's confidence and morale. Not long ago, Japan was hit by Typhoon Hagibis which left dozens dead, and caused shortage of water, food and electricity in many regions. The lives of tens of thousands of people have been affected. The royal ceremony can bring cheer to an otherwise gloomy atmosphere.The ceremony is attended by dignitaries from nearly 200 countries, a leap from the 160 at the enthronement of former emperor Akihito on November 12, 1990.Some people in Japan believe the increased number of participating countries shows Japan's growing international influence. But as far as I am concerned, it shows how the international community rates Hirohito and Akihito.After Hirohito became the emperor of Japan, the country did make certain contributions to the world, but it also launched aggressions against other countries that brought disaster to parts of the globe. Thus, opinions differ on Hirohito.But Akihito has been introspecting over the wars Japan launched, advocating peace, maintaining Japan's pacifist Constitution, refusing to visit the Yasukuni Shrine and being away from the country's right-wing forces. He has thus impressed the world and won worldwide acclaim and recognition from the international community.That being said, heads of states and representatives from about 200 countries and international organizations attending Naruhito's ascension ceremony not only shows their eagerness to greet the new emperor, it is also a way to pay their respects to Akihito.Akihito's Heisei era has come to an end. Will the core value of Heisei era's imperial diplomacy continue in the Reiwa era? Will Naruhito play the role of a peacenik and reflect on the wars Japan started? It is worth anticipating.In fact, there is no such term called \"imperial diplomacy\" in Japan's royalty. It is against the spirit of Japan's Constitution and would make people think that royal family can be manipulated by other forces. But in reality, imperial diplomacy does play a significant role for Japan both at home and abroad.For example, when Japan's right-wing forces emerged rapidly a few years ago and Japan continuously clamored over historic and territorial disputes, Akihito's remarks about his reflection on wars during his overseas visits to some extent restrained rightist voices. When Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe attempted to revise Japan's pacifist Constitution, Akihito signaled that he would like to step down from the monarchy to show his dissatisfaction. The move made the country more cautious toward constitutional amendments.Naruhito, who has studied abroad, once said that Japan should remember its wartime history correctly. This infuses people with more confidence in the country's imperial diplomacy during the Reiwa era.The author is a media professional and a Japan watcher. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:opinion@globaltimes.com.cn\">opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</email></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/88/157170274178.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/88/157170274178.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["Which is the first country Emperor Naruhito will visit after the royal event?

It will also add more voices to calls for an expanded tournament in France in four years' time and you can understand where they are coming from.

Lee also handed over a personal letter from South Korean President Moon Jae-in to Abe.It is worth noting that it was the first meeting between the Japanese and South Korean government leaders after South Korea's supreme court ordered Japanese companies to compensate 10 Koreans, who were forced labor victims, in October 2018.After the Japanese government announced in July that it would restrict raw materials exports to South Korea, the South Korean government struck back by cutting off military intelligence sharing with Japan.In the context of the nationalist support ignited by the two societies, the Japanese and South Korean governments have indeed punished each other with mutual sanctions. However, since the economy of the two countries is highly complementary, the negative impact from the sanctions has gradually emerged.As for Japan, the number of South Korean tourists to Japan has declined sharply and shown a long-term trend, and Japan's export of goods to South Korea has been greatly affected as well.For South Korea, the lack of Japanese raw material imports has damaged the supply chain, which has affected the overall economic performance.It's not hard to find that South Korea is more proactive than Japan in promoting the easing of their relations. </p><p>Earlier in October, Japan was hit by the super typhoon Hagibis. Moon immediately sent a message of condolence to Abe, which was regarded by the two countries' public opinion as a positive move to improve their relations.In addition, Moon also sent a personal letter to Emperor Naruhito through diplomatic channels. Dispatching Lee to the enthronement ceremony came after Moon's serious consideration. Known as an expert on Japan, Lee used to be a Tokyo correspondent before he joined the political stage and once worked as chairman of the Japan-Korea Parliamentarians' Union.Japan, on the other hand, does not seem to be as active as South Korea in repairing their bilateral relations. However, given the fact that the top officials of both sides understand that they cannot allow their relations to deteriorate even further, Japan needs to take measures to effectively interact with South Korea to actually improve their relations.Lee's latest trip to Japan was a good start, but was not enough as he is only the second-top leader from the Blue House. Only a dialogue between Moon and Abe can have substantial impact on the two countries' relations.Moreover, it also needs external support to foster Japan-South Korea relations. Since US President Donald Trump's administration is unwilling to mediate in the disputes between Japan and South Korea, there are voices inside both of the two East Asian countries saying that they hope China will play a role.China can do something together with Japan and South Korea to promote the betterment in Japan-South Korea relations.For example, at the Ninth China-Japan-South Korea Trilateral Foreign Ministers' Meeting in August, the three sides unanimously adopted the cooperation framework of \"China, Japan and South Korea plus X,\" which not only is conducive to the development of the three countries, but also can contribute to Asia's prosperity and stability.Last but not the least, Japan and South Korea are geographically and culturally close, and have basically the same political and economic system, living standards and social values. They should be close neighbors, but there has been constant friction between them in recent years. This might be explained by the famous Austrian psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud's thesis \"the narcissism of minor differences.\"Freud's idea explains that communities with adjoining territories and close relationships are especially likely to engage in feuds and mutually ridicule each other because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation.In fact, the differences between Japan and South Korea may not matter so much, but some politicians can gain political dividends by manipulating such small differences, which could be converted into opposition or even hatred.It is not something that can happen overnight for Japan and South Korea to reach a settlement on historical issues, but it is necessary to be alert to some politicians' manipulation of the small differences between the two countries.The author is a media professional and an observer of Japan issues. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:opinion@globaltimes.com.cn\">opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</email></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/22/157222106480.jpeg\">http://imgs.syndigate.info/478/1448/22/157222106480.jpeg</url></p><p><br/></p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["In the context of the nationalist support ignited by the two societies, the Japanese and South Korean governments have indeed punished each other with mutual sanctions.

Ireland hadn't beaten New Zealand in 28 matches over 111 years until its 40-29 victory at Soldier Field in Chicago in 2016. It did so again, 16-9, in Dublin in 2018, establishing Ireland as the one team in world rugby at present that regularly has the All Blacks' number. Ireland went on, after Wales' brief tenure atop the world rankings, to become the No. 1-ranked team just ahead of the Rugby World Cup, displacing New Zealand from a spot it had occupied since the ranking system began. Against that background, the match between Ireland and defending champion New Zealand at Tokyo on Saturday, which appears the most competitive of the quarterfinals, also seems a reckoning between the teams. It occurs earlier in the tournament than expected. </p><p>Japan's wins over Ireland and Scotland in Pool A went against pre-tournament predictions and saw the hosts emerge atop their pool, forcing second-place Ireland into a quarterfinal against Pool C winner New Zealand. \"The best part is we know who we're playing. They're a quality side, they've been No. 1 this year,\" All Blacks coach Steve Hansen said yesterday. \"The last three results are 'loss, win, loss' so there won't be any complacency in our camp. It's pretty exciting; we're right where we want to be.\" Hansen said last year's encounter was a \"titanic struggle\" and Ireland was slightly better on the day. \"It's taken them a long time to get there and obviously they enjoyed it,\" Hansen said of the drought-breaking win, \"so they decided to keep doing it.\" With more at stake this weekend, Hansen said the game would have a different feel to recent head-to-head meetings. \"The big difference here is it's a do or die game for both teams. Both teams are in good nick - fresh, excited.\" If there is an outside influence on the match it is the fact New Zealand's last scheduled pool match against Italy on Saturday was canceled because of Typhoon Hagibis, meaning they will go into the knockout round without a match since Oct. 6 when they beat Namibia 71-9 in a muddling performance. Ireland go into the quarterfinal on the back of a much more emphatic 45-7 win over Samoa on Saturday, achieved with only 14 men. That gives Ireland the better preparation, leaving New Zealand to do the bulk of its lead-up work on the training field. Ireland flyhalf Johnny Sexton was hopeful that Ireland's upset loss to Japan was the bad game they needed to get out of their system before the knockout rounds. Ireland has lost quarterfinals at the last two World Cups after being dominant in the pool stage. The fact they've beaten New Zealand twice since the last World Cup was also a boost. \"I suppose we can take a little bit of confidence from the last few times we've played them,\" Sexton said. \"I'm hoping that having lost a pool game that we've got that quarterfinal performance out of our system that we've had in other tournaments. \"The difference now is we're not favorites going into this quarterfinal whereas we were in the last two. So we're building nicely.\" The match is one of two - the other is between Japan and South Africa - which will involve an evident contrast in styles. New Zealand and Japan will both attempt to play an adventurous style, while Ireland and South Africa will attempt to slow down the game. That may be an over-simplification but the evidence of the tournament to date is that Ireland may rely strongly on a pick-and-go style, on box kicking and on a swift defensive line. The All Blacks showed a new ability to outflank rush defense in their pool win over South Africa but haven't been able to build on that in group matches against weaker opponents. New Zealand's high-tempo style often takes several matches each season to develop both in timing and accuracy. Their almost two-week layoff threatens a return of the rustiness they showed at the start of this season. At the same time Ireland does not appear to be as strong as they were last year when it won 11 or 12 tests, beat the All Blacks, won the Six Nations title and was named World Rugby Team of the Year. It's tactical focus has narrowed and it has become more forward-oriented and one-dimensional. Because both teams and coaches know each other well, there are likely to be subtle changes in tactics and systems on Saturday. All Blacks captain Kieran Read said his team had not been adversely affected by their longer than expected break before the quarterfinals. Their systems are strongly bedded in, their fitness is beyond question and they had used their down time productively. \"Final games are mental, as well as physical,\" he said. \"The eight teams left are capable of winning the competition, physically and probably mentally. \"It's about who can step up to the pressure moment.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">STEVE McMORRAN</emphasis></p><p>, AP</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AP19279176837791.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Macau Daily Times", "instances": ["Hansen said last year's encounter was a \"titanic struggle\" and Ireland was slightly better on the day. \"It's taken them a long time to get there and obviously they enjoyed it,\" Hansen said of the drought-breaking win, \"so they decided to keep doing it.

Results over this World Cup cycle suggest otherwise and the team has only impressed in patches this tournament, summing up the second half of Michael Cheika's five-year tenure. There's also uncertainty about the lineup, with 19-year-old Jordan Petaia getting a start in the centers in a big selection gamble from Cheika. England rearranged its midield, too. Flyhalf George Ford was benched, with Owen Farrell moving into 10, Manu Tuilagi moving in one to inside center and Henry Slade starting at No. 13 as England reverted to its Six Nations formation.</p><p>\"It's going to be a big step up and we're ready,\" Australia fly-half Christian Leali'ifano.</p><p>One of the highlights of Cheika's time in charge was the 33-13 win over England in the pool stage at the 2015 World Cup that contributed to the host nation getting eliminated, in unprecedented fashion, before the knockout stage.

They were also being dared to fulfil coach Warren Gatland's prophesy that if they prevailed, they would win the title. </p><p>On paper, there had been better Welsh teams, but none ranked the world's best, as Wales were to be by summer. Kicking on from Paris, they again trailed at half-time before downing England, and claimed a grand slam by tonking Ireland, who had beaten the All Blacks the previous autumn. </p><p>Masters of grinding out wins under Joe Schmidt, the Irish retained enough momentum to later displace Wales as world leaders, but their rot had begun against England in round one, when they were dismantled more convincingly than 32-20 suggested. </p><p>England's comeback would have to wait despite that win in Dublin and a 44-8 pasting of France. A reality check from Wales followed, along with a jaw-dropping collapse against Scotland, from showboating at 31-0 up to needing a last-minute try to draw 38-all. It spurred coach Eddie Jones into a rethink in which he dispensed with several mainstays for an autumn surge that sent England briefly atop the rankings, to be usurped by the Springboks. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Showpiece proves best yet</emphasis></p><p>Principally, 2019 was memorable for the ninth World Cup. The first held in Asia, it was widely rated the best so far. Quarter-finalists tend to be four or five of the old Five Nations, plus three or four of the Rugby Championship quartet, but hosts Japan became the first disrupters since Fiji in 2007. </p><p>The Fijians were sublime at times, even if they and a regressing Tonga and Samoa again showed they need greater support from the blazers. A bureaucratic lead was shown with a clampdown on dangerous play at a time when concussion horror stories from ex-players were coming thick and fast. </p><p>Whether the same could be said of the contingency plans when Typhoon Hagibis hit is debatable, although Japan put to bed most of the sporting misgivings over cancelled matches with a pulsating victory over Scotland. In doing so they scored some of the tries of the year, notably their offload-tastic second by Keita Inagaki; competing claims included Wallaby Marika Koroibete's lungbuster against England, and TJ Perenara's corner-flag acrobatics for New Zealand against Namibia. </p><p>Perenara and Co were denied a shot at a third straight title by England's best display of the year - arguably ever. A 19-7 semi-final success made household names of Tom Curry, Sam Underhill and Kyle Sinckler, yet another reality check was coming. South Africa, who squeezed past Wales to reach the final, had the best set-piece, the best defence and stars of the calibre of fly half Handre Pollard and wing Cheslin Kolbe. </p><p>And they shone when it mattered most, dominating England to prevail 32-12. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New bosses, new brooms</emphasis></p><p>Japan was Steve Hansen's last hurrah with New Zealand, and he had company as six of the world's top seven changed coach. </p><p>Ian Foster, Hansen's assistant, succeeded him, while their countryman Wayne Pivac will build on Gatland's Wales legacy, probably in more expansive style. Another New Zealander, Dave Rennie, faces a Wallabies rebuild but can inspire the green-and-gold up a peg or few in the crowded new world order. </p><p>The same is surely true for Fabien Galthie after France's decade of underachievement, and Andy Farrell, stepping up from Schmidt's defence guru to lead an Ireland due some fresh ideas. Jacques Nienaber is poised to make the same move to follow Rassie Erasmus for South Africa, who'll aim to stay exactly where they are. </p><p>The All Blacks may have something to say about that in June when they return against Farrell's Ireland - expect a ferocious response. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Empires fall</emphasis></p><p>The Webb Ellis Cup was not the first trophy the Springboks ripped from New Zealand's grasp this year: the Rugby Championship had been in their care for seven years out of eight before they were relieved of it in August. </p><p>Traditional club giants were adjusting to harsh realities. In December, Stade Francais sat bottom of France's Top 14, while Toulon were grubbing around in the second-tier Challenge Cup alongside Stade, Leicester and Wasps \u00ad- all multiple European Cup winners. </p><p>Reigning continental champs Saracens ended the year struggling in their pool and bottom of the English Premiership after being docked 35 points for salary cap breaches. Leicester and Wasps joined them at the wrong end as Bristol and Worcester became unlikely candidates for the play-offs. </p><p>Challenges to the status quo came on all fronts. Italy, with no wins in 22 matches, make little case for staying in the Six Nations ahead of, say, Georgia, who did their cause no harm at the World Cup. Spain, Romania and Russia are among others who would benefit from a second division. </p><p>Hong Kong are next cab off the rank in Asia, while the United States almost won the World Sevens Series - arguably overdue, given the talent vying for NFL contracts, and something for the game's rulers to ponder as they look at replicating Japan 2019 on other continents. </p><p>The minnows are nearing a tipping point just as the top bracket swells. If the image of Siya Kolisi, the Springboks' first black captain, lifting the World Cup was a defining one for his country, it served similarly for the rugby year, perhaps the next four-year cycle.

Of the 20 competing teams, 19 will have their hopes dashed. The 20th team won't be immune, either, as the champion sheds tears of joy. But every team has players who know they are not only playing their last Rugby World Cup, but also their last match for their country. </p><p>With only the final and bronze matches remaining, some rugby luminaries are in the final week of their careers. The chance to go out in glory in Saturday's final has been earned by the likes of South Africa's Schalk Brits, Tendai Mtawarira and Frans Steyn, and England prop Joe Marler. None have said they're retiring but expectations are they will. Steyn could become only the second Springbok to win two Rugby World Cups, after Os du Randt, a teammate in the 2007 squad. Steyn missed the 2015 Rugby World Cup following the death of his brother, and he didn't expect to play in another until he was summoned in July by coach Rassie Erasmus. \"I'm at a stage now where you know there is not going to be 10 more years to make a wrong right,\" Steyn said. \"So I get a little bit more serious before a test match.\" Marler already retired once, but changed his mind 10 months later. \"I have worked my buns off to try to get back into an emotional and mental state capable of contributing to the squad the best I can,\" he said. \"And the physical state, too, that has been even harder.\" Friday's bronze playoff between New Zealand and Wales will mark the last appearances in an All Blacks jersey for captain Kieran Read, center Sonny Bill Williams and fullback Ben Smith. The All Blacks' loss to England in the semifinals was only Read's 16th in 126 tests. Like Williams, Read won unprecedented back-to-back Rugby World Cups in 2011 and 2015, after which he became the captain following the retirement of Richie McCaw. \"In your heart you want to play forever, but in your head you know that's not possible,\" Smith said. Kenki Fukuoka's 27-year-old heart could have played on, but the Japan winger decided before this Rugby World Cup to quit test rugby to attend medical school. It's a family tradition to be a doctor. He wants to bow out of rugby in sevens at next year's Tokyo Olympics. In the meantime, Fukuoka has returned to Top League club the Panasonic Wild Knights, where he will be joined by Australia flanker David Pocock, another who has retired relatively young from internationals. The 31-year-old Pocock endured a career disrupted by injuries, including six months out until September. That break made him feel like his year was just starting to hum until the quarterfinal loss to England. \"This is not how I thought I would end,\" he said. At least he got to play. Teammate Sekope Kepu was a mere spectator at the end of his 110-cap run. Scrumhalf Will Genia also finishes with 110 caps. \"How lucky was I?\" Genia asked. \"Got to play 11 years for Australia, three World Cups.\" Ireland captain Rory Best played in four World Cups, but a third consecutive quarterfinal exit had him in tears as he was replaced against New Zealand in the second half of his 124th and last test. \"There are big men in tears (in the changing room) and that is what happens when you put heart and soul into something,\" Best said. Best had the whole second half to see the end coming, unlike France captain Guilhem Guirado, who thought his team was advancing to the semifinals until the last minutes against Wales. Louis Picamoles also hadn't envisaged his 82-cap France career would end in the quarterfinals. It might not have if teammate Sebastien Vahaamahina hadn't been sent off after halftime while they were leading 19-10. Vahaamahina retired from test rugby the next day, saying he was sorry and \"I just lost control.\" Very much in control was former captain Mamuka Gorgodze as Georgia bowed out with only one win in four pool games. Gorgodze quit in 2017, returned for the World Cup to help an injury-hit squad, played well, but had no more tears for his second retirement: \"I don't feel any pressure or sadness.\" Tonga also won only once, but it was the perfect finale for captain Siale Piutau and Sione Kalamafoni. Tonga beat the United States , Piutau scored a try, was man of the match, and it was his 34th birthday. \"I see myself coming back, hopefully as a coach,\" Piutau said. \"There's a calling for me to keep being a part of this team.\" Family commitments are calling Kalamafoni. \"My wife and I had our third child just a few months ago and hats off to her for staying with them so I could do this,\" he said. \"A rugby career involves a lot of sacrifices and it feels like the right time.\" Other careers finished with a whimper. Typhoon Hagibis forced the cancellation of three matches, including the last for Canada and Italy. DTH van der Merwe, Canada's all-time leading try-scorer, was denied a last chance to become the fifth player to score in four World Cups. \"Nobody has the divine right to have a fairytale ending,\" he said after 13 years wearing the red maple leaf. Reports of Italy captain Sergio Parisse retiring after 18 years proved to be premature in the wake of the abandoned group game against New Zealand. He's available for the 2020 Six Nations, which conveniently finishes for Italy in Rome. \"My final page with Italy is still to be written,\" Parisse reportedly said on a fan site. \"It won't be a typhoon to end my adventure with the national team.\" Juan Manuel Leguizamon got to write his final page in style. Argentina dedicated its last pool game to its last Puma from the 2007 World Cup side, and Leguizamon was lifted on the shoulders of teammates in front of his wife and kids and singing fans. \"It's hard to say goodbye,\" Leguizamon said. But, \"you have to do it.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FOSTER NIUMATA, AP</emphasis></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://macaudailytimes.com.mo/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AP19299411355279.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Macau Daily Times", "instances": ["\"There's a calling for me to keep being a part of this team.

We've come through the system together and to get to a World Cup ... there was something amazing about being on the world stage with him,\" Baker said. \"He is my best mate and to see him in the middle and to be able to support him on the sidelines was an incredible experience.\" </p><p>Japan deservedly won the game 28-21, thrilling the neutrals and reintroducing itself to the rugby world as Asia's best team. While much of Tokyo's focus has been on the upcoming 2020 Olympics, Baker described the breathtaking scenes throughout the win. </p><p>\"The Japanese fans went out of their way to learn the national anthem for their team - 60,000 Japanese people singing their own anthem, standing in red and white, it was amazing,\" he said. </p><p>Baker also played a crucial officiating role in matches such as New Zealand vs South Africa and Ireland vs Scotland. The New Zealand game, in particular, required nerves of steel after it was halted by an early and controversial Head Injury Assessment (HIA) for loose forward Sam Cane. </p><p>Cane underwent a procedural HIA test at half-time by independent doctors having been knocked in the head after four minutes. </p><p>While Cane passed the test, officials rejected his return to the field because the 15-minute half-time lasted five minutes more than a player's maximum allotted 10 minutes for an HIA test. Kiwi coach Steve Hansen was obviously unhappy with the decision, but Baker - who was amid all the sideline tension - felt it was the correct call. </p><p>\"The HIA was early in the game and it got back to myself and my colleague who had to make the decision in the end. We made the right decision, and the next day World Rugby was out with a new law and had the backing of us,\" Baker recalled, adding there was pressure from all directions. </p><p>\"We had the pressure to make the decision, using the World Rugby referee, people wanting the decision immediately, and having to tell the New Zealand team that they couldn't have one of their star players back on the field. You put all that together on the World Cup stage ... the pressure was real but I'm thankful. </p><p>\"Having that happen in the fourth minute of the opening game is pretty massive - it was a good learning experience as I don't get to do that role very often because in Hong Kong I'm usually on the field.\" </p><p>It was undoubtedly an experience of a lifetime for the man who perpetually aims to raise Hong Kong rugby's officiating standards. Fellow HKRU staff in reserve assistant referee Matt Rodden, match-day doctors David Owens and Ken Wu, and match-day medical observers Lucy Clarke, Chau Chi-wai and Karen So also represented Hong Kong at the World Cup. </p><p>Exposure to high-level officials from the world over - such as English international rugby union referee Wayne Barnes - gave Baker plenty of wisdom to bring home. </p><p>\"I was very lucky working with those guys in a proper big game,\" Baker said. \"It helped open my eyes to a few things that I want to bring back to Hong Kong to help raise the standards of our young referees here. </p><p>\"[Referees] have got to still remember that you're human and to just enjoy the occasion. It's not about getting the decisions right or wrong, but being a team player on and off the field. There's a bigger message that it's OK to relax after the game. </p><p>\"To me it's about having empathy with and managing the players, and sometimes throwing the referee law book out the window to make a decision that everybody understands - players, stakeholders, all of them. We've always got the referee hat on but there's also a hat where you need player empathy and knowing what to blow up and what not to. It's a big balance that gets there with experience. </p><p>\"Especially in Hong Kong, not everyone knows the laws here but the players are getting more and more educated and the game is better and better, so we [referees] have to lift our games, too.\" </p><p>As Baker returns to the city's men's and women's rugby scene, as well as the newly launched Global Rapid Rugby league, his long-term aim is to reach the next Women's World Cup to be held in his native country. </p><p>\"To be honest, the men's [World Cup] is probably a hurdle too far for those of us living in Asia,\" Baker said, adding that much of the credit for Hong Kong's referees making it on the world level go to coach Hugh Watkins. \"My realistic goal is to carry on refereeing for the women's Six Nations games and to be selected again for the 2021 Women's World Cup in New Zealand. </p><p>\"I'll be representing Hong Kong but there will be a side of me that's a bit New Zealand.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

"published": "2012-04-17", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">   One of 12 Chinese fishing boats  returned to port Saturday evening after a recent encounter with  the Philippine Navy in the South China Sea. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">    On April 10, twelve fishing boats were harassed by a Philippine  Navy gunboat while taking refuge from harsh weather in a lagoon  near China's Huangyan Island. Two Chinese Marine Surveillance  ships conducting routine patrols in the area later came to the  fishermen's rescue. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">    The incident is just the latest case in a string of incidents  in which Chinese fishermen have been harassed by the Philippine  military, with hundreds of fishermen in south China's Hainan  province having had encounters with Philippine officers.  HUMILIATING MEMORIES </p><p>    At dawn on April 10, Xu Detan, captain of the Qiong-Qionghai  09099, a Hainan-registered fishing boat, saw a gunboat speeding  into the lagoon. He then heard someone speaking in Filipino  through his ship's shortwave radio and realized they couldn't run  away from the Philippine Navy. </p><p>    \"Their gunboat blocked the entrance of the lagoon. We tried to  escape, but we couldn't move. They were armed with guns and we  could only wait,\" said Xu. </p><p>    Xu said the Philippine gunboat began to search the fishing  boats one by one at 6 a.m. At about 8:30 a.m., nine Philippine  soldiers boarded his boat. </p><p>    Xu said the soldiers turned off his ship's satellite navigation  system and radio communication equipment while on board. </p><p>    They asked Xu and four crew members to stand on the ship's bow  and took photos of the fishermen. The photos were published online  and used as evidence that the Chinese fishermen were illegally  fishing. </p><p>    The searches and photography didn't stop until 11 a.m., said  Xu. </p><p>    Almost twelve hours later, the two Chinese military vessels  discovered their predicament and came to protect them from the  Philippine gunship. </p><p>    The crew of the Qiong-Qionghai 09099 subsequently decided to  suspend their planned 50-day voyage on its 25th day. </p><p>    \"We came back in a rush because were were scared and wanted to  go back to rest,\" Xu said. </p><p>    Xu said it was the first time for him to encounter such a  situation since beginning his fishing career 30 years ago.  However, he said some of his friends have been detained by  Philippine military officers multiple times. </p><p>    As the captain of the boat, Xu is responsible for his crew and  their safety. However, the 55-year-old captain said he wouldn't be  able to withstand the suffering if he were detained by the  Philippine Navy. </p><p>    \"I was so scared when I thought that I might not see my family  again, especially my eight-month-old grandson,\" Xu said.  FREQUENT DETAINMENT </p><p>    Seizures and detainments by the militaries of other countries  are common for the residents of Tanmen township, located in Hainan  province. Local government records indicate that Vietnam, the  Philippines, Malaysia and Indonesia have detained Chinese  fishermen in the past. </p><p>    The Philippines has detained the largest number: 265 Chinese  fishermen in 14 separate incidents that occurred between 2000 and  2011. </p><p>    Chen Zebo, captain of the Qiong-Qionghai 03026, another fishing  boat involved in the April 10 incident, was detained twice by the  Philippine Navy in 1994 and 1999, respectively. </p><p>    Feng Xinyi, another fishing boat captain, was detained by the  Philippine Navy with another three fishermen in 2001. They were  kept on the Philippine island of Palawan for one year, during  which time he said they were beaten by soldiers when they refused  to sign confessions. </p><p>    Local fisherman Xie Jinfang and another five fishermen have  been detained by the Philippine Navy since March 24, 2011,  according to Dai Yudao, a member of the Tanmen township committee. </p><p>    However, some of the fishermen of Tanmen have been quick to aid  fishermen from other countries when they encounter problems at  sea, despite having been previously harassed by the militaries of  those countries. </p><p>    In December 2007, Typhoon Hagibis blew into the South China  Sea. More than 10 fishing boats took shelter at Zhongye Island to  ride out the storm. Qiu Guru, head of the Nansha fishermen's  association in Tanmen township, said he and his crew saved and  aided seven Vietnamese fishermen and 42 Philippine fishermen  during the disaster.  FISHING TO LIVE </p><p>    Although one of the boats involved in the April 10 incident has  returned home, the other 11 boats are continuing to fish near the  Xisha and Nansha islands, as the fishermen on board must ensure  that they can catch enough fish to sustain their livelihoods. </p><p>    Most of the fishermen living in coastal areas come from  families of fishermen, having learned the craft from their parents  and grandparents. For them, fishing is not simply a way to make a  living, but is a life in itself. </p><p>    \"Our fish sell like hot cakes and are priced high. That's why  we risk fishing in such far-off places,\" said Ke Weixiu, the owner  of a fishing boat. </p><p>    The fishermen have received some help from the government, with  the fishery department of Tanmen installing satellite navigation  systems in local fishing boats to help them verify their  whereabouts. </p><p>    The navigation systems allow the fishery department to warn the  fishing boats if the boats cross maritime borders and enter  hostile territory. Border police also check in with the boats in  the morning, afternoon and evening via radio, giving the fishermen  weather updates and ensuring their safety.  THE GOVERNMENT SPEAKS </p><p>    On April 11, Foreign Ministry spokesman Liu Weimin said the  actions taken by the Philippine Navy in the waters near Huangyan  Island constitute an infringement of China's sovereignty and are  in violation of a bilateral consensus on maintaining peace and  stability in the South China Sea. </p><p>    Liu called for the Philippines to avoid actions that could  complicate and aggravate the situation. </p><p>    Liu said Huangyan Island is an integral part of Chinese  territory and that China has indisputable sovereignty over the  island. </p><p>    \"We urge the Philippine side to take action based on our  bilateral friendship, as well as peace and stability on the South  China Sea. We call on them to stop creating difficulties and work  with China to create good conditions for the healthy and stable  development of bilateral ties,\" he said.  </p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["Chen Zebo, captain of the Qiong-Qionghai 03026, another fishing  boat involved in the April 10 incident, was detained twice by the  Philippine Navy in 1994 and 1999, respectively.
