According to news reporting originating from Gansu, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Adequate revegetation of abandoned farmland acts as a defence against desertification and soil loss, and can help remove carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, thereby playing an important role in regulating regional climate change. Legume, a nitrogen-fixation species, which could effectively improve vegetation coverage to control soil erosion, was widely used for revegetation.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Lanzhou University, \"However, the dynamics of soil and plant development after legume introduction on abandoned farmland remain unclear. A 16-year in situ experiment including three treatments, natural abandonment (fallow), planting of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), and sweet clover (Melilotus officinalis L.) was conducted on bare farmland of the Loess Plateau in 2003-2018. The results showed that initially introduced species significantly affected the potential succession patterns in the community. Alfalfa introduction decreased plant community stability (CS) and hindered plant species establishment in early successional stages due to inter/intraspecific competition caused by high aboveground biomass (AB). Plant CS was affected by species evenness, AB, revegetation time and revegetation methods. Sweet clover facilitated succession process by rapidly improving soil conditions (organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) and quickly exiting from the community after its life span to avoid further competitive effects. During 2003-2018, the soil (water storage, organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus), plant (AB, CS), and ecological related variables (plant diversity and soil carbon sequestration) contributed 60.1%, 15.7% and 20.2%, respectively, to the ecosystem health. Alfalfa planting increased ecosystem health index (EHI) in the long-term while sweet clover favours plant diversity, providing less overall EHI but recover faster than natural abandonment community.

While this view sounds reasonable, ride-hailing apps are not new technology - the likes of Uber already run similar platforms smoothly. </p><p>To raise service standards, the premium fleets should hire as many drivers as are necessary to meet demand, especially during rush hour.

During the event, representatives from London, Liverpool, and Shanghai jointly launched the World-class Waterfront Development Initiative, aiming to drive the comprehensive transformation of urban waterfronts worldwide? from spatial regeneration to the integration of ecology, economy, and culture. The initiative aspires to establish global demonstration zones and pioneering models of waterfront development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Julia King, Co-founder of Social Place and former Researcher at the Cities Research Centre at the London School of Economics, shared her perspective: \"I think China broadly has done a lot more interesting projects around nature-based solutions for rivers in general. And I think the approach that Shanghai is taking to its river, to its principal attributes is something that I think we could probably learn a lot from and then have an exchange as to kind of around public realm. Michael Clifford, Economic Advisor at EY-Parthenon, added: \"I think there's already a good foundation of working collaboration between London and Shanghai. London has a real focus on investable propositions and opportunities and particularly in the development space, a whole set of kind of development opportunities around and alongside the river.

No sector, no part of the economy, and no country is immune to its impacts.\" </p><p>Therefore, Tsegai said that drought today is no longer an isolated climate event confined to rural farming regions. The \"cascading and spiraling impacts of droughts\" are widespread and multidimensional; even megacities are facing water scarcity and extreme drought risks. He noted that the nature of droughts is changing: they are becoming more frequent, more intense, more widespread, and increasingly unpredictable. One particularly alarming trend is the rise of \"flash droughts,\" which develop rapidly over a short time and intensify without sufficient early warning, severely affecting agriculture, water supply, and urban operations. Traditional approaches to drought are no longer sufficient, Tsegai said. \"When we talk about drought, we shouldn't just look up to see if it's raining. We need to look down and ask: can we still grow crops? Do we still have the capacity to restore degraded land?\" According to the Drought Hotspots Around the World 2023-2025 report that was released Wednesday, the frequency of drought events globally increased by 30 percent between 2000 and 2019. Despite being labeled a \"silent disaster,\" the impacts of drought are never silent. \"Drought is a threat multiplier,\" Tsegai said. \"It affects food, water, biodiversity, health, and energy -- these are all pillars of society that drought is scrambling in front of our eyes.\" He highlighted the unequal impacts of drought across populations and regions, noting that around 85 percent of those affected live in low and middle-income countries. \"Drought knows no boundaries, but drought knows gender,\" he said. \"In some areas, drought causes hunger, school dropouts, even forces girls into early marriage.\" The discussion on drought has been shifting in recent years. \"It's very important that we talk about drought as being an economic issue as well,\" he said. \"It is costing countries between one and ten percent of their GDP, depending on the country. The losses are significant.\" Drought is indeed \"expensive,\" but the real problem, Tsegai said, lies in the lack of preparedness. Citing recent studies, he noted that \"a one-dollar investment in drought resilience brings about seven dollars in recovery.\" Nevertheless, many countries are still stuck in reactive responses, lacking proactive and forward-looking strategies to deal with drought effectively. Tsegai noted that over 80 countries have developed national drought plans, but the key challenge lies in putting them into action. \"We need to improve irrigation technology so that we can really help to minimize the waste of water. Investing in watershed restoration and indigenous crop systems pays back many times over in avoided losses,\" he said. He also highlighted the importance of \"nature-based solutions, land restoration, land rehabilitation, and rainwater harvesting.\" \"This is not a matter of choice, but a necessity,\" he said. Tsegai stressed that tackling drought requires moving beyond short-term emergency responses toward building long-term resilience. He said that drought is not a challenge confined to a single sector, such as agriculture or water; rather, it acts as a \"connector,\" affecting everything from tourism and energy to education and public health. As such, he stressed the need for cross-sectoral and multi-level cooperation, involving ministries, local communities, and national governments alike. Speaking about China's role in global drought governance, Tsegai said the country has accumulated extensive experience in land restoration and drought-resilient technologies, and is sharing that experience with drought-prone regions like Africa and Central Asia. \"China's support has played a central role in regions like Central Asia and has been widely welcomed,\" he said. \"In Africa, China is helping to shift the paradigm from a reactive approach to a more proactive one, focusing on building drought resilience in advance.\" Tsegai noted that \"the biggest problem with drought management approaches is the short-termism.\" He emphasized that China not only provides technical expertise and investment, but also supports capacity building, which has \"a long-term effect on the change that we want.\" \"About 130 countries have committed to land-degradation-neutrality (LDN) under the UNCCD,\" he said, adding that China's experience, technologies, and know-how will play a constructive role in this global process.

Hospitals plunged into darkness. Endangered dolphins floated lifeless in the shrinking Amazon... These are not scenes from a horror film, but real consequences of some of the most devastating droughts in recorded history, according to a new UN-backed report released Wednesday. Prepared by the U.S. National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), with support from the International Drought Resilience Alliance, the report Drought Hotspots Around the World 2023-2025 provides a comprehensive account of how droughts compound poverty, hunger, energy insecurity, and ecosystem collapse. </p><p>It warns that drought, fueled by climate change and relentless pressure on land and water, has escalated since 2023 into one of the most widespread and damaging crises in recorded history, triggering cascading shocks to food, energy, ecosystems, and human survival. DROUGHT INTENSIFIES ACROSS CONTINENTS Eastern and Southern Africa are among the worst-affected regions. Over 90 million people are facing acute hunger. Southern Africa, already drought-prone, was devastated, with about 68 million, roughly one in six people, needing food aid in August 2024. In Zimbabwe alone, the 2024 corn crop was down 70 percent year on year, and doubling maize prices, while 9,000 cattle died of thirst and starvation. In Somalia, drought-related hunger led to an estimated 43,000 deaths in 2022. Zambia faced a major energy crisis in 2024 when the Zambezi River fell to just 20 percent of its long-term average. The country's largest hydroelectric plant fell to 7 percent generation capacity, causing blackouts of up to 21 hours per day. Countries across the Mediterranean are also battling prolonged drought and extreme heat. Spain's olive crop fell by half by September 2023, pushing olive oil prices to double. Morocco's sheep population has shrunk 38 percent since 2016. In T\u00fcrkiye, drought accelerated groundwater depletion, triggering sinkholes. Also, record-low river levels in 2023 and 2024 in the Amazon Basin led to mass deaths of fish and endangered dolphins, and disrupted drinking water and transport for hundreds of thousands. Severe drought slashed Panama Canal traffic by more than one-third between late 2023 and early 2024, forcing ships onto longer routes and disrupting global supply chains. VULNERABLE POPULATION PAST BREAKING POINT The report describes the 2023-2024 El Nino event as having \"added fuel to the fire\" of climate change, amplifying drought impacts in agricultural and ecological hotspots. \"This was a perfect storm,\" said co-author Kelly Helm Smith of NDMC. \"Many vulnerable societies and ecosystems were pushed beyond their limits.\" The economic fallout is mounting. Co-author Cody Knutson, who oversees NDMC drought planning research, underlined a recent OECD estimate that a drought episode today carries an economic cost at least twice as high as in 2000, with a 35 percent to 110 percent increase projected by 2035. \"Ripple effects can turn regional droughts into global economic shocks,\" she adds. \"No country is immune when critical water-dependent systems start to collapse.\" The human toll is equally severe. Most vulnerable to the effects of drought: Women, children, the elderly, pastoralists, subsistence farmers, and people with chronic illness. In Eastern Africa, rates of child marriage more than doubled as families sought dowries to survive. In Zimbabwe, entire school districts saw mass dropouts due to hunger, costs, and sanitation issues for girls. In some areas, the Amazon River fell to its lowest level ever recorded, leaving residents stranded, including women giving birth, and entire towns without potable water. \"Girls pulled from school and forced into marriage, hospitals going dark, and families digging holes in dry riverbeds just to find contaminated water -- these are signs of severe crisis,\" said lead author Paula Guastello, NDMC drought impacts researcher. CALL for COORDINATED GLOBAL ACTION The report urges immediate global investment in drought preparedness, calling for stronger early warning systems and real-time monitoring of drought and drought impacts. \"This is not a dry spell,\" said Mark Svoboda, report co-author and NDMC Founding Director. \"This is a slow-moving global catastrophe, the worst I've ever seen. \" The report highlights the importance of nature-based solutions such as watershed restoration and indigenous crop use. Building resilient infrastructure, including off-grid energy and alternative water supply technologies, is also needed, it said. \"Drought is not just a weather event. It can be a social, economic, and environmental emergency,\" said Smith of NDMC. \"The question is not whether this will happen again, but whether we will be better prepared next time.\" To ensure no one is left behind, the report stresses the need for gender-responsive adaptation, ensuring that women and girls are not further marginalized. Strengthened international cooperation is vital, it said, especially in protecting transboundary river basins and trade routes. \"Drought is a silent killer. It creeps in, drains resources, and devastates lives in slow motion. Its scars run deep,\" said UNCCD Executive Secretary Ibrahim Thiaw. \"Drought is no longer a distant threat,\" he added.

But the reality is, developed countries are not fulfilling their obligations,\" Correa do Lago noted during the ongoing UN June Climate Meetings in the southwestern German city of Bonn, where UNFCCC is headquartered. \"The developed countries have reduced their contributions, and the absence of the United States (in the Paris Agreement and the June meetings) obviously shows that very clearly,\" said the Brazilian diplomat. </p><p>Some developing countries, such as China and Brazil, have made significant progress in climate action through their own domestic efforts, without waiting for international funding. \"China has provided the world with amazing answers to fight climate change that are financed by the Chinese budget. Brazil is doing the same, presenting many solutions funded by ours,\" he said. He further noted that China and Brazil are not only taking action domestically but also supporting other developing countries through mechanisms such as South-South cooperation. \"When a developed country brings cooperation, it generally assumes that it has the answers for other countries,\" he said. \"When Brazil and China bring cooperation to another developing country, however, we bring our experiences, but we understand that each recipient country needs its own answers. It doesn't have to follow exactly what China or Brazil is doing.\" \"That's why our South-South cooperation is more careful and more attentive to the specific needs of our partners,\" Correa do Lago said. However, he made it clear that such solidarity-based cooperation cannot substitute the responsibilities of developed nations. \"That's where there is a difficulty sometimes for people to understand: one dimension is an obligation which is the developed countries to support the developing countries; and the other is solidarity that China or Brazil have towards other developing countries,\" he said. During the interview, the designated president also emphasized that China, in particular, has become one of the world's most important contributors of practical climate solutions, largely due to its technological capacity and production scale. \"China now is probably the country that is bringing more answers to how to fight climate change,\" he said. \"China has succeeded in lowering the cost of many technologies, for instance, solar panels or electric vehicles,\" he said, adding that by doing so, China has accelerated the adoption of climate solutions in many developing countries, because lower costs, such as of solar panels, have enabled regions like Africa to enter solar energy production much faster. He elaborated that when the cost of solar energy was comparable to fossil fuel alternatives, many projects depended on uncertain financing. \"But when solar becomes so much more inexpensive than other technologies, many countries are embracing solar energy thanks to China,\" he said. COP30 is scheduled to take place this November in Brazil's Belem, a city in the heart of the Amazon rainforest. Correa do Lago explained that this location was chosen not only to draw attention to vulnerable ecosystems under threat from climate change, but also to highlight the crucial role that nature-based solutions, such as forest restoration, play in climate mitigation. \"Forests, like other ecosystems, bring many answers on how to fight climate change. Restoration of forests, for instance, is the only scientifically demonstrated way of capturing CO2 that has already been emitted,\" he said. Looking ahead, Correa do Lago said that COP30 is expected to serve as a global stage to showcase hope and pathways for transformative change. \"Brazil wants the COP30 to be a COP that shows to the world that fighting climate change is good for the economy, is good for jobs, and is good for developing countries,\" he said. \"We must show the world that it cannot give up the fight against climate change, because the answers have never been closer.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["\"China now is probably the country that is bringing more answers to how to fight climate change,\" he said. \"China has succeeded in lowering the cost of many technologies, for instance, solar panels or electric vehicles,\" he said, adding that by doing so, China has accelerated the adoption of climate solutions in many developing countries, because lower costs, such as of solar panels, have enabled regions like Africa to enter solar energy production much faster.

Looking ahead, Correa do Lago said that COP30 is expected to serve as a global stage to showcase hope and pathways for transformative change. \"Brazil wants the COP30 to be a COP that shows to the world that fighting climate change is good for the economy, is good for jobs, and is good for developing countries,\" he said. \"We must show the world that it cannot give up the fight against climate change, because the answers have never been closer."]}, {"relevance_score": 7, "title": "Pakistan calls for global climate action to mitigate adverse impacts of climate change", "published": "2025-04-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">ISLAMABAD, April 28 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Musadik Masood Malik called for global solidarity and action to mitigate the adverse impact of climate change, saying there is an urgent need for comprehensive climate adaptation strategies. \"To combat climate change, we need to invest in resilient infrastructure, improved water management systems, enhanced disaster preparedness, and the promotion of climate-smart agriculture,\" the minister said while addressing an event on Sunday. </p><p>Citing the devastating 2022 floods in Pakistan, Malik stressed that Pakistan bears a disproportionate share of the climate burden, adding that the country remained consistently ranked among the countries most vulnerable to climate change, despite contributing less than 1 percent to global greenhouse gas emissions. \"Rising average temperatures, increasingly erratic rainfall patterns, and the alarming retreat of glaciers are clear indicators of an unfolding crisis that threatens the country's water security, agriculture, and overall economic stability,\" he added.

Our experience doing fieldwork in Shui Hau has inspired me to write this letter, in view of the current policy to stabilise the buffalo population by sterilising them.  <br/>Far from being a nuisance, these buffaloes offer a cost-effective, nature-based solution for managing wetlands. By grazing, they help control reed overgrowth, promote plant diversity and sustain a unique commensal relationship with cattle egrets - birds that follow buffaloes to catch insects stirred up by their movement. Their trampling connects isolated pools, improving aquatic habitat connectivity, while their wallowing creates muddy depressions that provide feeding and breeding grounds for fish and birds. More importantly, buffaloes may help trap carbon. While they are known to emit methane, studies show that their grazing activities compact the soil and create low-oxygen conditions that slow microbial decomposition and enhance carbon storage.  <br/>Research also links buffalo manure to increased soil carbon. However, as Shui Hau's marshes shrink by around 15 per cent every five years and gradually convert into grasslands, carbon-rich soils become increasingly exposed to oxygen, leading to increased carbon emissions. As these habitats continue to shrink, the increasing encounters between buffaloes, tourists and residents pose a growing concern. It was in response to this that the government implemented a neutering programme. However, this approach threatens the future existence of these creatures, as it may disrupt their natural population dynamics and diminish their ecological role in the environment.  <br/>Public opinion leans towards supporting the coexistence of buffaloes with people. A 2024 survey by the University of Hong Kong and City University of Hong Kong found that most residents living near buffaloes view them positively.  <br/>Instead of treating water buffaloes as pests, we should recognise them as allies in preserving our ecosystem. Managed wisely, these gentle grazers could be part of Hong Kong's nature-based solutions to climate change.

Investigating the soil nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) and salinity from the 37 field experiments (22 treatments and 15 control plots in 11 villages) over 2017-2023, this study examined the effects of vermicompost on soil nutrients and salinity (electrical conductivity [EC]) in drought-prone and salinization-affected regions of Bangladesh. Results reveal that the application of vermicompost reduced soil salinity in salinization-affected region and enhanced soil nutrient contents in both regions over 7 years. In vermicompost-utilized experiments in the salinization-affected region, soil salinity (EC1:5) levels decreased from 5.56-7.65 dS m- 1 in 2017 to 4.93-5.89 dS m-1 in 2023. Soil salinity and nutrient contents showed significant differences among the vermicompost-applied experiments, while no detectable changes in salinity and nutrient contents were found in the controlled experiments. None of the cropping patterns in salinization-affected region (brinjal-watermelon and potato-watermelon) and drought-prone region (brinjal-pointed gourd and brinjalsesame) had significant effects on the observed changes in soil salinity and nutrient contents. These findings suggest that regardless of the crop combinations, vermicompost is a sustainable and versatile soil amendment, which can be effectively used in diverse agricultural systems and environments. The study provides empirical evidence to support policy decisions aimed at promoting sustainable agricultural practices and enhancing soil health using vermicompost.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The findings inform strategies for reducing soil salinity and enhancing sustainable agriculture in comparable regions worldwide.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Transforming Agriculture With Vermicompost: 7-year Empirical Evidence From Drought-prone and Salinization-affected Regions of Bangladesh.

This leaves a land area roughly the size of Brazil and Australia combined, and at sea an area larger than the Indian Ocean, to be designated in order to meet the global target of protecting 30 percent of terrestrial, marine and freshwater spaces by 2030.</p><p>Sustainably protecting the world's increasingly fragile ecosystems will require significantly enhanced efforts and accelerated actions. To this end, China's continued pursuit of an \"ecological civilization\" has been an important commitment. Indeed, during the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, China has made significant strides by improving its natural resource management, establishing conservation systems, and strengthening legislation for protected areas, which currently account for 18 percent of the country's landmass.</p><p>Moving ahead, it will be critical to accelerate momentum by building on this work and further expanding conservation efforts to increasingly larger areas to reach the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's 30 percent target.</p><p>In doing this, we must recognize that biodiversity conservation goes hand in hand with climate action as two sides of the same coin. Healthy ecosystems provide some of our most effective nature-based solutions for both climate adaptation and reducing emissions. China's announcement that its new national climate action plan to be submitted later this year will include all sectors of the economy and all gases is therefore a critical step, and presents an opportunity to synthesize efforts by including biodiversity as a key priority.</p><p>Another way to do this is through financing. Currently, there is a $700 billion annual funding gap to protect and restore nature. A nature-positive economy could generate more than $10 trillion in annual business value and create 395 million jobs by 2030. Realizing this, however, will require a reorientation of financial systems away from siloed funding vehicles, and toward the UN Sustainable Development Goals \u2014 our global blueprint to ensure the future of both humans and the planet. By adopting integrated financing mechanisms and approaches that comprehensively tackle development challenges, increasing resources can be unlocked for broader impact.</p><p>Between 2022 and 2024, the UN Development Programme promoted more than $870 billion in investments toward the SDGs. In particular, our SDG Investor Maps and SDG Impact Standards have helped identify areas where investment opportunities align with sustainable development needs, and ensure that such investments are clearly linked to measurable social and environmental outcomes.</p><p>Similarly, the Kunming Biodiversity Fund announced by China in 2021, and launched last year, provides an international financing vehicle for developing countries to access additional funding needed to advance conservation efforts.</p><p>However, further accelerating financing at the speed and scale needed will require global, collective efforts. To that end, the 4th International Conference on Financing for Development in June will be a critical opportunity to unite countries around the world in reforming domestic and international financing and catalyzing greater investments toward sustainability. It will also be an opportunity for large creditor countries to consider debt repurposing to free up more resources for the protection of nature.</p><p>Finally, with the rapid emergence of revolutionary new technologies and cutting-edge digital tools, it will be critical to harness the transformative potential of these advancements and direct them toward development challenges, including biodiversity protection. Innovations like artificial intelligence offer ways to process vast amounts of environmental data, identify critical patterns and break down silos that have traditionally hindered conservation. UNDP has supported more than 50 countries in using AI to align national policies with global biodiversity goals. At UNDP, we look forward to continue building on our decades-long partnership with China in strengthening biodiversity protection to advance progress on the SDGs and promote harmony with nature.</p><p>We can still protect the planet through meaningful, decisive action, but it must happen now, and it must happen collectively. The stakes have never been higher, but together we can and must turn ambition into impact to create a more inclusive and sustainable future for all life on Earth \u2014 one in which nature and humanity will not only coexist, but also thrive.</p><p>The author is the UNDP resident representative in China.</p><p>The views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.chinadailyhk.com/upload/main/image/2025/05/22/2ed69b253d4552ca911a56d1d7c8db23.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily (Hong Kong Edition)", "instances": ["Sustainably protecting the world's increasingly fragile ecosystems will require significantly enhanced efforts and accelerated actions.

The snipe tries to attack the clam, which traps the bird's beak in its shells. Both creatures could survive a couple of days without water.

The embargo was only lifted in the '70s. </p><p>Over the years, US-China relations warmed, but more recently, the relationship has begun to fray and we are now at a point where complete decoupling is not unimaginable. </p><p>But, at the end of the day, they need each other. China needs a big market, capital investment and new technology. Who can provide this? The US. America needs cheap imported goods so that inflation can be kept at bay. China can provide this. </p><p>We need a more pragmatic approach. Yes, the current system has been in use since World War II. It has its flaws which we must fix.

By grazing, they help control reed overgrowth, promote plant diversity and sustain a unique commensal relationship with cattle egrets - birds that follow buffaloes to catch insects stirred up by their movement through the wetlands. Their trampling connects isolated pools, improving aquatic habitat connectivity, while their wallowing creates muddy depressions that provide vital feeding and breeding grounds for fish and birds. </p><p>More importantly, buffaloes may help trap carbon. While they are known to emit methane, studies show that their grazing activities compact the soil and create low-oxygen conditions that slow microbial decomposition and enhance carbon storage. </p><p>Research also links buffalo manure to increased soil carbon - particularly the easily decomposable portion of it. However, as Shui Hau's marshes shrink by around 15 per cent every five years and gradually convert into grasslands, carbon-rich soils become increasingly exposed to oxygen, leading to increased carbon emissions. </p><p>As these habitats continue to shrink, the increasing encounters between buffaloes, tourists and residents pose a growing concern. It was in response to this that the government implemented a neutering programme.

This die-off, the worst on record, has raised alarms across the agricultural sector, which relies on honeybees to pollinate over 100 crops worth about $18 billion annually. Researchers have yet to identify a single cause, though contributing factors may include pesticide exposure, parasitic Varroa mites, and potentially new viruses. The crisis has left beekeepers scrambling to meet pollination demands and could result in financial losses totaling hundreds of millions of dollars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is far from an isolated incident. In fact, honeybee populations have been in decline across the globe for the past few decades. Growing concerns over bee health have led to significant policy actions, including the European Union's 2018 ban on three neonicotinoid pesticides linked to pollinator decline. In Brazil, an estimated 500 million bees died over just a few months in 2018 and 2019, with studies pointing to widespread pesticide use (particularly neonicotinoids and glyphosate) as a likely cause. These alarming trends have helped elevate insect biodiversity and pollinator protection to a critical focus in global environmental policy discussions.</p><p>The dramatic global decline in bee populations represents an ecological crisis driven by a complex web of external pressures. Chief among these are habitat loss and fragmentation, as well as the widespread, indiscriminate use of pesticides, particularly neonicotinoids and organophosphate insecticides (like Chlorpyrifos), which have been strongly linked to pollinator decline. In addition, climate change is disrupting flowering cycles and increasing the frequency of extreme weather events, while the spread of pathogens and parasites due to human activity, combined with nutritional stress from monoculture farming systems, poses further significant threats to bee survival.</p><p>May 20 is celebrated as World Bee Day, a day dedicated to raising awareness about the crucial role that bees play in pollination and maintaining biodiversity. The date was chosen to honor the birthday of Anton Jan\u0161a, a pioneer of modern beekeeping in the 18th century, who made significant contributions to the development of beekeeping techniques. World Bee Day was officially established by the United Nations in 2017 to highlight the importance of protecting bee populations, which are facing numerous threats, including habitat loss, pesticide exposure, and climate change. The day serves as a reminder of the vital ecological service bees provide in pollinating plants, including many crops that are essential for human food production.</p><p>As the world's most efficient pollinators, Bees are crucial to 76 percent of food crops and 84 percent of wild plants, including key economic crops such as apples, blueberries, and almonds. Without bee pollination, yields could dramatically decline or even fail. In Beijing's Miyun district, bee pollination directly boosts fruit and vegetable production by over 800 million yuan annually. Bees also play a critical role in maintaining the stability of the food chain and are considered \"environmental sentinels\", reflecting ecosystem health. Beyond pollination, bees provide valuable products such as honey, propolis, and royal jelly, widely used in food, medicine, and cosmetics. Protecting bees plays a key role in advancing sustainable agriculture and maintaining healthy ecosystems, helping to strike a balance between economic growth and environmental protection.</p><p>I'm encouraged by the growing global attention to pollinators' biodiversity and its influence on environmental policy. From April 28 to May 9, 2025, during the joint Conference of the Parties (COPs) to the Basel, Rotterdam, and Stockholm Conventions in Geneva, we witnessed a significant step forward: the COPs to the Stockholm Convention adopted the decision to list chlorpyrifos (a widely used organophosphate insecticide) in Annex A of the Convention, thereby agreeing to a global phase-out of its uses. Chlorpyrifos is widely recognized for its persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity, with demonstrated harms to pollinators, potential neurodevelopmental effects, and possible links to cancer. Even at low doses, it impairs honeybee behavior and nervous systems, posing serious risks to ecosystems and agriculture.</p><p>However, these efforts are still far from enough. Global biodiversity is declining rapidly, and the crisis facing bees is just one example. We should take inspiration from the cooperative nature of bees and work together to strengthen our global response. Only through collective action can we slow the pace of the sixth mass extinction. With that in mind, I would like to offer a few suggestions.</p><p>First, mainstreaming biodiversity. We need to shift the aesthetic preferences shaped by industrial civilization. Biodiversity conservation often prioritizes visually appealing or charismatic species (eg. panda, Crested Ibis), while insects, including wild bees, receive far less attention. Yet their ecological roles are critical. We shall give insect biodiversity the importance it deserves based on its function in sustaining ecosystems. Communicating the impact of wild bee decline on ecosystem stability, food security, and human well-being is essential to drive public awareness, policy change, and meaningful resource investment.</p><p>The second common pitfall is that seeking quick fixes, which can cause long-term harm when nature is treated as a backdrop, not a system. During the recent May Day holiday in the Qinling Mountains, a swarm of insects disrupted tourists near a cable car station. The rapid use of insecticide solved the nuisance\u2014but at what cost? This was the height of pollination season, and no effort was made to identify the insects or assess their role in the ecosystem. Managing such events with a purely reactive mindset can damage food webs and undermine ecological resilience. Without scientific diagnostics or early warning systems, such interventions risk solving surface problems while ignoring deeper ecological imbalances.</p><p>Third, farming can work with nature, not against it. Nature-based Solutions (NbS), such as letting weeds and wildflower strips and hedgerows stay (instead of removing them), support bees by providing food and nesting space.

Many of the plants labeled as \"weeds\" are actually important sources of food and shelter for insects like bees. To support biodiversity, cities need to shift toward more ecological approaches that allow native plants to grow and minimize chemical use.

These insights can guide smarter, targeted actions -- from pesticide management to flower planting -- to better protect pollinators where they need it most.</p><p>The author is deputy secretary-general of the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation and a member of the IUCN Intersessional Council Working Group on the development of a new 20-year Strategic Vision for the Union.</p><p>The views don't necessarily reflect those of China Daily.</p><p>Contact the editor at editor@chinawatch.cn. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202505/19/682b17d7a310a04a9678b915.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202505/19/682b17d7a310a04a9678b915.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["The rapid use of insecticide solved the nuisance\u2014but at what cost?

The research, published last week in Nature Reviews Earth &amp; Environment, explains how global warming intensifies both wet and dry extremes, creating ideal conditions for fast-moving, destructive fires -- such as the Palisades and Eaton blazes. The study, titled \"Hydroclimate Volatility on a Warming Earth,\" reveals that rapid transitions between extremely wet and extremely dry conditions are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change. </p><p>Such volatility fosters a dangerous cycle: abundant vegetation flourishes during wet periods, becoming highly combustible fuel in subsequent dry spells. \"Hydroclimate volatility refers to sudden, large, and/or frequent transitions between very dry and very wet conditions,\" said lead author Daniel L. Swain. The research indicates that globally averaged subseasonal (three-month) \"whiplash\" events have increased by 31 percent to 66 percent since the mid-20th century. This climate whiplash effect is evident in the current Los Angeles wildfires. The region experienced heavy rainfall earlier in the year, encouraging widespread vegetation growth. However, hot, dry conditions soon followed, converting that vegetation into prime fuel. Powerful Santa Ana winds then accelerated the fire's rapid spread. Santa Ana winds are strong, hot, and exceedingly dry, typically affecting Southern California in the fall and winter. These winds form when high-pressure systems over Nevada and Utah push cold, dry air through mountain passes and canyons toward the California coast, warming the air significantly as it descends. Wind speeds can exceed 70 miles per hour, quickly parching vegetation and increasing fire risk. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), the Palisades Fire, which ignited on Jan. 7, has already burned 95.75 square kilometers and is only 14 percent contained. Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire has consumed over 57 square kilometers and destroyed 7,000 structures. The speed at which these fires spread aligns with the study's projections. \"With 3 degrees Celsius of warming, subseasonal whiplash is projected to increase by 113 percent over land areas,\" said Swain. This heightened volatility can lead to more frequent and intense wildfires, as the current Los Angeles blazes demonstrate. The study also shows how climate change amplifies wet and dry extremes. Rising temperatures boost the atmosphere's water-holding capacity, leading to more intense rainfall events. Simultaneously, higher temperatures accelerate evaporation rates, drying out vegetation more quickly. These dual effects were displayed in Southern California during the 2022 to 2023 season when Downtown Los Angeles received 613 millimeters of rain -- 308 millimeters above the seasonal average. By early January this year, however, Los Angeles International Airport had recorded only 0.8 millimeters of rainfall since Oct. 1, 2024, a stark contrast to the previous wet season. Regions at high latitudes and those stretching from northern Africa through South Asia are expected to experience the greatest increases in hydroclimate volatility. Such shifts can exacerbate natural hazards -- flash floods, wildfires, landslides, crop losses, and disease outbreaks -- and cause substantial disruptions to both societies and ecosystems. The review stresses that conventional water management, which typically separates flood and drought planning, is increasingly inadequate. Instead, it advocates for adaptive, integrated strategies -- such as nature-based solutions -- that account for both extremes and proactively secure water supplies. Given these findings, the implications for fire management and urban planning are significant. As climate volatility worsens, communities in fire-prone areas may need to reevaluate their preparedness and response strategies. Many fire hydrants went dry during the battle against the Palisades Fire, forcing firefighters to withdraw; the lack of water contributed to extensive home losses. This crisis exposed a critical gap in the Los Angeles metropolitan area's water infrastructure and planning.

Regions at high latitudes and those stretching from northern Africa through South Asia are expected to experience the greatest increases in hydroclimate volatility. Such shifts can exacerbate natural hazards -- flash floods, wildfires, landslides, crop losses, and disease outbreaks -- and cause substantial disruptions to both societies and ecosystems. The review stresses that conventional water management, which typically separates flood and drought planning, is increasingly inadequate. Instead, it advocates for adaptive, integrated strategies -- such as nature-based solutions -- that account for both extremes and proactively secure water supplies. Given these findings, the implications for fire management and urban planning are significant. As climate volatility worsens, communities in fire-prone areas may need to reevaluate their preparedness and response strategies. Many fire hydrants went dry during the battle against the Palisades Fire, forcing firefighters to withdraw; the lack of water contributed to extensive home losses. This crisis exposed a critical gap in the Los Angeles metropolitan area's water infrastructure and planning.

These include limited land area and high cost for afforestation, insufficient standards and monitoring methods, and inadequate institutional regulations and financial inputs. Going forward, China can consolidate and improve its carbon sink capacity in three aspects to better achieve its carbon peaking and net-zero goals.</p><p>First, China can optimize natural resource management policies and motivate business entities with regard to their production and operations related to natural resources. Priority can be accorded to the carbon sink value of State-owned forests by improving the management system of State-owned forest farms, and promote the effective protection and scientific utilization of forests. China can deepen the reform of the collective forest rights system, clarify the ownership relationship between forest property rights and forestry carbon sink property rights, and set up a reasonable benefit-sharing mechanism for carbon sink trading. China can also optimize forest and grassland resource development policies, improve the management of forest harvesting, promote the moderate-scale management of forest land, improve the value realization mechanism of ecological products in the forest and grass industry, and improve sustainable operations. As part of the incentive mechanism, China can comprehensively increase scientific and technological support for the forest and grass industry, enhance forestry and grass industry mechanization, promote the development of large-diameter timber and high-quality grass, develop wood and bamboo processing, forestry biomass energy and other industries, and explore greater space for the diversified development of the forestry industry.</p><p>Second, China can improve the design of the carbon offset mechanism and create an internationally leading voluntary emissions reduction market. The first is to accelerate the standardization of ecosystem measuring, reporting and verification, apply satellite and other information technologies, improve regional-scale ground surveys, gradually align national ecological carbon sink accounting with international standards, and improve the credibility of the voluntary carbon credit market. The second is to strengthen the supervision and information disclosure of carbon sink projects, improve the disclosure standards for enterprises to participate in carbon offsets, strengthen the informatization of carbon sink projects, and introduce third-party assessment agencies to improve the transparency of the voluntary carbon market. The third is to encourage Belt and Road countries to jointly build a large-scale voluntary carbon market with high transparency and high liquidity, and to form a stable price mechanism and avoid potential market risks.</p><p>Third, China can fully mobilize non-governmental capital to support the investment and financing of ecological carbon sink projects. First, it can introduce fiscal and financial support policies by developing bonds, insurances and other green financial products and financial instruments related to forest and grass, and explore other models such as public-private partnerships. Second, the government can guide enterprises and financial institutions to improve relevant rules and standards by considering incorporating carbon credits into the net-zero goals of institutions, enriching the environmental, social and governance evaluation system, and reducing the financing for activities with a negative impact on nature. Third, international cooperation in green finance can be promoted to include more nature-based solutions projects in the green finance catalog, encourage developing countries to explore nature-based solutions paths and practices suited to their respective national conditions, and clarify the relationship between the participation of developed countries in nature-based solutions project investments and their responsibility to finance climate change mitigation.</p><p>Liu Changyu is an associate researcher at the Center for International Knowledge on Development.

The CEM, titled \"Pathways to Sustainable and Inclusive Growth in Rwanda,\" is a collaborative report between the Government of Rwanda and the World Bank. It showcases Rwanda's economic resilience, with gross domestic product growth averaging 7.4 percent annually from 2000 to 2023, alongside social improvements including increased life expectancy, improved healthcare access, and expanded educational attainment. </p><p>The report identifies key areas for Rwanda to build on, including expanding private sector engagement, strengthening human capital, and enhancing agricultural resilience to sustain Rwanda's growth trajectory. It provides policymakers, stakeholders, and development partners with insights into addressing current challenges and seizing opportunities across sectors such as private investment, education, agriculture, and climate resilience. Speaking at the event, Rwandan Minister of Finance and Economic Planning Yusuf Murangwa highlighted Rwanda's achievements and future goals. \"Rwanda's progress over the years has laid a strong foundation for economic growth and social well-being. To achieve NST-2's targets, we must prioritize productivity, private sector engagement, and investing in our people.\" He added that the CEM offers a strategic framework for addressing these priorities, guiding Rwanda toward a more inclusive and resilient economy. Key findings from the CEM reveal that while public investment has driven growth, there is significant potential for the private sector, particularly in services and manufacturing. The report suggests reforms to enhance competition, increase access to finance, boost domestic savings, and encourage innovation and information and communications technology development. It also emphasizes regional integration to expand market access and foster sustainable trade partnerships. Speaking at the launch, Sahr Kpundeh, World Bank country manager for Rwanda, underscored the strength of the partnership with Rwanda. \"Our collaboration reflects a shared commitment to Rwanda's vision for sustainable growth. The CEM's recommendations offer clear pathways to greater economic resilience and shared prosperity,\" he said.

The meeting, dubbed the Climate Adaptation Changemakers School, organized by the University of Nairobi (UoN) and the Global Center on Adaptation (GCA), brought together 50 experts at a time when climate change continues to threaten infrastructure systems. </p><p>Participants will explore how to conduct climate risk assessments, identify vulnerabilities, and develop adaptation strategies to bolster infrastructure resilience. Charles Nhemachena, regional director for Africa at the GCA, said that climate change-associated socioeconomic safeguards result in costly damages, repairs and maintenance in many countries. \"The poorest people in the poorest countries are the least prepared to withstand the health, social, and economic impacts of the climate emergency,\" Nhemachena told the participants, urging them to embrace learning, collaboration, and innovation opportunities in managing climate change since it is a real risk to economies. During the meeting, the experts are expected to acquire practical tools to incorporate climate considerations into project management for infrastructure projects and learn about public-private partnerships to facilitate effective collaborations between public and private sector entities. Nhemachena revealed that through the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program that is being implemented with the African Development Bank (AfDB), the collective efforts are already shaping a future where climate adaptation and resilience are foundational. He said that since the project's inception in January 2021, the joint goal with the AfDB has been to mobilize 25 billion U.S. dollars over five years for adaptation to set the stage for a sustainable, vibrant, and equitable future. Daniel Olago, chairman of the Department of Earth and Climate Sciences at the University of Nairobi, said that the meeting is a commitment to action that is meant to bridge the gap between science, policy, and practical implementation. Olago noted that the project is aimed at scaling up adaptation in Kenya and East Africa's infrastructure resilience through a multistakeholder approach. The meeting, he said, is focusing on exploring scalable and innovative approaches that integrate infrastructure improvements with nature-based solutions to enhance resilience against climate impacts. He observed that the ripple effects of infrastructure failure due to climate events extend far beyond the immediate hazard zone as they affect everything from healthcare and education to agriculture. \"The infrastructure failures are far more than mere inconveniences since they threaten the very fabric of society and they end up undermining decades of development gains,\" Olago added. Timothy Waema, professor of Information Systems with the Department in the School of Computing and Informatics at the University of Nairobi, urged new developers to embed climate adaptation and resilience into every facet of infrastructure investment.

Sidna Ahmed Ely, director general of the National Agency of the Great Green Wall of Mauritania, told Xinhua that his country, with 84 percent of land desertified, was inspired by and gained strength and determination from China's \"green Great Wall.\" Noting that Mauritania has established a partnership with the Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017, Ahmed Ely said: \"We are proud of our first partnership under the framework of the Great Green Wall initiative for Africa. We are proud of the Chinese experience.\" NEW TECHNOLOGIES New technologies that China applied in its desertification control were showcased at the China Pavilion at an exhibition held along with summits, ministerial dialogues, award presentations, and theme days during COP16. Visitors were drawn to an AI tree planting robot model brought by Eason Intelligent Equipment (Beijing) Co., Ltd. \"With AI, autonomous driving, the BeiDou satellite navigation system, and green energy, robots can reduce afforestation costs by 20-25 percent, increase planting survival rates by 10-20 percent, and are over five times more efficient than manual ways,\" the company's General Manager Bian Lijun told Xinhua. After learning that robots could plant trees in 20-30 seconds remotely, Majed Al-Mebairik, facility administrative assistant of the UN Development Programme, said he was impressed. \"It's very automatic, interesting, and very helpful,\" Al-Mebairik said. \"I have visited many countries' pavilions and learned about their actions, twice to China's pavilion though. I think China's practice is the best,\" said Saldan Odontuya, Mongolian environment and climate change minister. GREEN COMMITMENT Despite being faced with some of the world's most severe challenges in desertification, China has taken a unique path that integrates ecological restoration with improving livelihoods, driven by top-level policies, legislation and technological innovation. According to official data, 53 percent of China's treatable desertified land has been restored, leading to a net reduction of approximately 4.33 million hectares of degraded land. China has become the first nation to achieve zero net land degradation while reducing both desertified and sandified areas. The green development has also witnessed green prosperity. Traditional Chinese medicinal herbs and high-quality forage grass are planted in those sandy areas, so are melons and walnuts. In some areas, income from forest fruits constitutes more than half of farmers' net income, data from China's National Forestry and Grassland Administration have shown. \"We're incredibly proud to be a partner with China. China has been a pioneer in showing how to create prosperous areas in areas that were once desertified and degraded. And we are proud to partner with you (China) to bring those lessons to other countries,\" said Valerie Hickey, global director for the environment at the World Bank. China has championed global cooperation in combating desertification, establishing an international knowledge management center with the UNCCD and hosting the Kubuqi International Desert Forum to share global research and ecological economy insights. To join the efforts of the Global South, China has also launched desertification control centers with Arab states and Mongolia, created demonstration sites in Central Asia and Africa, and provided satellite technology and big data support for Africa's Great Green Wall initiative. \"I wanted to commend the Chinese government leadership globally on combating desertification, and the experience-sharing between China and the bigger Global South,\" said Charles Karangwa, global head of nature-based solutions at the International Union for Conservation of Nature.

Financial professionals understand the concept of risk. They recognise the need to assess the potential impact of biodiversity damage or loss on businesses, investments and financial performance. Integrating biodiversity risks into investment analysis and portfolio decision-making can reduce exposure to biodiversity-related risks, such as water scarcity for a drinks business, while also identifying new opportunities aligned with biodiversity conservation.", "These targets will need to be localised by governments to enable the recovery of natural ecosystems over the next 20 years, with the aim of achieving the convention's vision of \"living in harmony with nature by 2050\". Hong Kong's authorities are naturally eager to engage with financiers and leading businesses in the creation of the city's new biodiversity strategy. Still, the new-found interest of financial professionals and corporate leaders in nature conservation has been a surprise to government officials. Biodiversity and ecosystems used to be seen as topics of interest primarily for nature lovers and experts such as ecologists and arborists. Indeed, businesses are already working with the local biodiversity community precisely because of their expertise, and together they have organised a non-government process to interact with the authorities on the Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan. There is keen interest in how the government will foster innovation in biodiversity by enabling the collection, sharing and understanding of biodiversity data for nature-based solutions. Investors are seeking out companies with innovative practices, such as property developers who integrate biodiversity into their projects. The backdrop to all of this is the effort of the public sector - the stronger the government's plans, the more the private sector can add to them. Sustainable agriculture as well as marine farming and aquaculture are also attracting investors' attention. There is growing interest in local food production, such as in expanding local-regional oyster cultivation and branding it as a high-quality speciality from Hong Kong through rigorous science and certification. Local nature-tech start-ups have attracted investments, such as from the Middle East to produce 3D-printed reef tiles."]}, {"relevance_score": 35, "title": "Hong Kong can take a leaf out of national green guidelines", "published": "2024-09-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Readers discuss aspects of China's green transition plan Hong Kong can emulate, and valuable trees on part of a golf course taken over by the government   </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Feel strongly about these letters, or any other aspects of the news?

However, financial crises have also occurred during this time, leaving many in the clutches of penury.</p><p>Three challenges currently threaten the 80-year record of rising global living standards and poverty reduction. First, it is widely recognized that the crisis in the global commons, the term encompasses cross-border challenges that do not fall under national jurisdictions, such as climate, pandemic and technology, are having an increasingly negative impact on the global economy.</p><p>Second, these challenges risk becoming even more urgent without effective collective action over time. Third, despite this recognition, most people agree that progress in addressing the issues has been too little and too slow.</p><p>What are the reasons that have stopped the global economic architecture from acting in time and at scale? First, the challenges in managing the global commons have grown more numerous and more difficult, with climate change perhaps being the most pressing issue. Second, the global economy has become more fragmented, and geopolitical tensions have increased, making collective action difficult.</p><p>After decades and decades of supportive geopolitics, demographics and advances in technology, many of the positive trends are now being reversed. Moreover, the tailwinds to global growth, such as growing markets, increasing trade, expanding supply chains, and financial globalization were disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Strategic competition and geopolitical tensions have been inevitable fallouts of armed conflicts, exaggerating this fragmentation. The conflict in Ukraine has ruptured the rules that govern the international order. International cooperation is at its lowest point since the Cold War. The peace dividend has evaporated as defense spending has risen across the globe. These developments have increased political tensions leading for a rush for food, energy, security, near assuring of supply chains and the adoption of protectionist policies.</p><p>However, the cost of fragmentation is high. Depending on how it goes, the IMF estimates that it is somewhere between 2 percent to 7 percent of GDP. Many economic forecasts show that in the next 30 to 40 years, about two thirds to three quarters of global growth will come from the Global South. However, these countries will be devastated by adverse climate changes.</p><p>So the challenge is, how can we keep global growth up in a situation where the countries that are supposed to grow are also facing the strongest headwinds? That is a governance issue that needs to be tackled by the official sectors because it is hard to have a collective movement forward where the governance of the institutions does not reflect the realities.</p><p>China plays a significant role in the fight against climate change. On one hand, China's growth is critical for the growth of Asia and of middle and low-income countries. On the other hand, China has made tremendous progress on the emission front and in devising a market and a taxonomy for dealing with climate change. That is something that other countries can learn from.</p><p>The private sector is key to solving climate change challenges. All estimates of needed financing are in the band of $3 trillion to $4 trillion annually, the bulk of which is supposed to come from domestic revenue mobilization and foreign direct investment.</p><p>Therefore, there is merit in identifying the specific shortcomings in the entire system, public and private, that are impeding progress. With respect to climate specifically, three gaps exist in both the public sector and in the private sector. These are gaps in governance, implementation and accountability.</p><p>And finally, despite the existence of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, there is no institution that has the overall responsibility to coordinate the global climate change policy and system wide financial effort. A reform of the global financial system is urgently needed to assess and coordinate the necessary financing, as well as fiscal policies.</p><p>The first question that comes up is, do we need a new institution to close the gap? In today's geopolitics, it will be very hard to reach a consensus on a new institution's role, charter and funding. Even if we reach an agreement on a new institution, it will take at least a decade for the institution to gain the necessary scale and expertise to make an impact.</p><p>Also, technical advances over the last few decades have improved the feasibility of making rapid progress. In particular, innovation has dramatically improved the economics of reducing carbon emissions. Thus, the problem is no longer whether it's technically feasible to stabilize and then bring down global carbon emissions, but, instead, how to do it quickly, equitably and at scale. It means that the focus needs to shift toward coordinating actions that will help set priorities for mitigation and adaptation and mobilize financial resources. The private sector can contribute effectively to meet these challenges.</p><p>Two key instruments are needed to encourage the private sector's participation. One is the global carbon trading schemes that facilitate increase in voluntary compliance, the integration of nature-based solutions in the form of decarbonization plans and the introduction of carbon taxes, including cross-border adjustments, together with appropriate policies that would help middle- and low-income countries.</p><p>The IMF and the World Bank should help support the development of global carbon markets and assist in the development of carbon taxes and mechanisms. A regime that allows the real price discovery of carbon in advance and developing economies would be essential for the ecosystem to develop.</p><p>Finally, on the accountability side, the current system of voluntary disclosures enforced by shareholder action is not manageable.

Lowering the cost of spirits could lead to increased consumption of hard liquor, exacerbating alcohol-related health problems and placing additional strain on healthcare systems. Before embarking on a major change to our tax regime for spirits, we should fully assess the public health impact. </p><p>Second, the revenue generated from the spirits tax is an important source of funding for the government, with reports stating that HK$700 million is generated from the levy. Our government is facing for the first time in many years a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3253573/hong-kong-budget-2024-25-city-will-return-fiscal-balance-2-years-dipping-rainy-day-future-fund\">major deficit challenge</url>. We should therefore be looking at policies that help increase government coffers, rather than push for those that could result in a loss of revenue. We should properly weigh the potential economic benefits of any tax reduction against the quantifiable negative impact on public finances. </p><p>Third, the process of changing tax policy should be transparent and inclusive. The speed with which an increasingly likely cut to the spirits tax has been discussed shows we have not followed due process. Stakeholders, including public health experts, economists and community representatives, should be consulted to provide a comprehensive understanding of the potential consequences. An impact assessment should be conducted to evaluate the short-term and long-term effects. This due diligence is necessary to ensure that any policy change is well-informed and balanced. </p><p>In short, while there are arguments in favour of reducing the tax on spirits, we must thoroughly consider the broader implications. The potential health risks and loss of revenue must be assessed. That is best done through a thorough and inclusive decision-making process. Only then can we ensure that any changes to tax policy are made with the best interests of society in mind. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Francis Neoton Cheung, convenor, Doctoral Exchange</emphasis></p><p>Hong Kong stands at a pivotal moment in economic transformation.

This year marks the second anniversary of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. How much progress has been made? According to CBD Executive Secretary Astrid Schomaker, 31 parties have submitted their national biodiversity strategies and action plans, while 103 countries have submitted their national targets.

With only six years left to reach the 2030 target, the gap obviously remains significant, making the task ahead daunting.</p><p>A closer look reveals that many countries' current reports still focus primarily on the area of protected areas. However, the Kunming-Montreal framework comprises four long-term goals for 2050 and 23 action targets for 2030, aimed at halting and reversing biodiversity loss. The target to protect 30 percent of land, oceans and inland waters is just one of these specific goals. More broadly, the 2050 goals emphasize ecosystem and species health, including stopping human-induced species extinction, sustainably using biodiversity, ensuring equitable benefit-sharing, and securing funding to close the annual $700 billion biodiversity financing gap.</p><p>Therefore, we need to maintain a necessary vigilance and avoid complacency over the achievements we currently observe, as we overlook the broader context \u2014 global biodiversity is rapidly declining, and this trend is accelerating without signs of mitigation.</p><p>First, the intense focus on the area of protected lands may lead us to neglect the effectiveness of conservation efforts, especially in regions that truly need protection, such as biodiversity hotspots. A recent study published in Nature Communications explored the distribution of global protected areas and their influencing factors. It concludes that there is a significant imbalance in the global distribution of protected areas, particularly in regions of high biodiversity, indicating that current conservation strategies may not effectively encompass critical ecosystems and habitats. Another study published in Marine Policy in 2023 found that one-third of the global marine protected areas assessed may be \"paper parks\".

Now at Ekkoabit, an educational project on environmental awareness in Barcelona, I teach, share, and explore knowledge and experiences with students from all over the world.</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>One of the most interesting experiences has been the opportunity to teach in China for more than five years. In this country I have found the students very proud of their culture, very sensitive to environmental issues, and very interested in contributing to the quality development of their country.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Climate change, resource depletion, and biodiversity loss are humanity\u2019s greatest challenges as a species. China is aware of this situation and has become one of the leading countries to address these challenges. <br/><br/><br/><br/>In this context, the training of future architects and urban designers requires a strong focus on environmental design and sustainability strategies. At Ekkoabit we work with Chinese students, promoting creativity as a basis for finding new ways to better relate to our environment. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Students from the Gengdan Institute of Beijing University of Technology in the course \u201cRethinking Hutongs,\u201d which integrates traditional Chinese architectural values with modern technology and design.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Fostering imagination and creativity while valuing traditions<br/><br/><br/><br/>Imagination is the first step to creativity, and there is no innovation without it. In order for students to have innovative minds, it is important that they learn to develop their imagination. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The first step in creating more humane and sustainable environments is to generate \u201cpossible futures\u201d in which people do not feel outside of nature by destroying it and depleting its resources, but are aware that they are an interdependent part of it. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The challenge we face in environmental terms requires major development of creativity and innovation because we cannot continue to face current problems with the tools and mentality that created them. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Many years of trial and error throughout history has generated local wisdom on how to manage the environment in which we live. China has a long tradition of relating harmoniously with nature through garden and landscape design, as well as constructing buildings with sustainable low-carbon materials such as wood, ceramics, and earth. <br/><br/><br/><br/>The new generations of Chinese students are beginning to take a keen interest in their own cultural values. This philosophical knowledge should not be lost as it can contribute to the development of a new urban and architectural modernity that is more sustainable and more linked to Chinese culture. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Students participate in a collective drawing in the workshop titled \u201cLooking for Narratives to Reconnect with Earth\u201d at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Creating public spaces in a nature-based way<br/><br/><br/><br/>China\u2019s urban growth is without precedent in human history. The country's great effort to eradicate extreme poverty in a certain time span had generated buildings that prioritize quantitative aspects such as density and economic cost over qualitative aspects such as thermal comfort, environmental quality, and green recreational areas.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The idea of \u201cplacemaking\u201d is to avoid segregated spaces without any link to the natural and social environment. The idea is to generate spaces with diversity of uses and activities, accessible spaces that promote community life among the different generations of inhabitants, cultural values and contact with nature.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Aging population, green and digitalized industrial transformation, changes in mobility, energy crisis, and climate change are some of the factors that will transform current Chinese cities in the process of generating new public spaces to improve people\u2019s living environement.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The pedestrianization of streets, creation of green axes, and the design of areas of traffic pacification or superilles, that is, green hubs where traffic is discouraged, carried out recently in Barcelona are examples that can be illustrative for Chinese architects and urban planners.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Instead of fighting against nature, we must learn from it. Designing nature-based solutions allows architects and urban planners to solve needs while maintaining harmony with the environment.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Nature can be a great ally for designers and architects.

Among these are the New Development Bank, also known as the BRICS bank, headquartered in Shanghai and now headed by former Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff; the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank; the Boao Forum; China's South-South Climate Cooperation Fund (SSCCF); and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China's infrastructure investment program that has now reached around 150 countries \u2014 with signals from Brasilia suggesting that Brazil could soon be its next member. With significant headway for increasing investments under the SSCCF and strong moves to green the BRI, we can expect a lot more in that direction.</p><p>International climate financing, however, has not kept pace with these tectonic shifts. Emerging and developing economies accounted for more than two-thirds of global GDP growth and 95% of greenhouse gas emissions increases in the last decade. Yet, international climate finance remains concentrated in richer countries, with only 16% going to emerging markets, developing economies and the 45 least developed countries in 2021-2022, according to the most recent Global Landscape of Climate Finance report. The insufficient climate finance that has been forthcoming largely fails to meet the most acute needs: during those years, only 5% went to adaptation and 3% reached the climate-vulnerable least developed countries.

With around 90% of the state's 497 municipalities affected, and over half a million people displaced, the relief and recovery efforts require funding beyond the state and federal authorities' capabilities. Rebuilding sustainably will depend on significantly increased international climate finance that is more responsive to countries' requirements, suggesting a need for new approaches.</p><p>Climate finance flows under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change are, by design, dominated by Global North donor countries \u2014 and for sound reasons, given their relative economic strength and the \"carbon debt\" incurred in their high-emissions development. This reflects the structure of the international climate regime, of which the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR) has been a cornerstone and will remain sacrosanct for emerging and poorer countries.</p><p>This means rich countries' obligation to provide financial support to developing countries' effective implementation of the Paris Agreement remains core to any agreement that may be reached on a new climate finance goal at the upcoming COP29 summit in Azerbaijan in November. Developing countries legitimately complain about rich countries' failures to deliver on promises of finance, although it should be noted that this is a failure in the aggregate, with many countries meeting and even exceeding their fair shares.</p><p>That notwithstanding, we have reached a point where progress cannot be held hostage to this fraught political dynamic.</p><p>The formalization of a greater role for emerging economies and of South-South cooperation would reflect a growing reality in the world and can help deliver on two core objectives at COP29: a change of magnitude in the amount of climate financing provided, and a greater targeting and responsivity of that financing to the needs of developing countries.</p><p>Crucially, this would be consistent with the principle of CBDR. Recognizing emerging economies' potential voluntary contributions as investors, trade partners and facilitators of transition financing does not in any way reduce the moral obligation for richer countries to provide more concessionary public financing for climate action in the Global South. These are two distinct layers of the multi-level climate finance stack needed to deliver the desired quantum leap expressed by the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance that must be agreed on at COP29.</p><p>China and Brazil uniquely positioned to lead</p><p>At a time when economic and geopolitical headwinds are making ambitious agreement on finance more difficult, China and Brazil are uniquely positioned to set a new course for international climate finance, given their ambitious leadership, robust international advocacy and clout with Global South countries.</p><p>A recent ministerial meeting on climate change in Wuhan, Hubei province, set the tone: alongside South Africa and India, as part of the BASIC bloc of newly industrialized countries, both Brazil and China reaffirmed their commitment to multilateralism and low-carbon development. Minsters also emphasized the need for urgent action and a new collective goal for climate finance, moving from billions to trillions of dollars annually to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>As a leading manufacturer and supplier of low-carbon energy technologies, China is uniquely positioned to drive investments that accelerate the adoption of affordable solutions worldwide, thereby facilitating green transitions. China is already contributing to this effort across Latin America and other regions. Meanwhile, the Brazilian government is proposing a new industrial policy and an ecological transition program focused on enhancing resilience, promoting environmental sustainability, and advancing energy transition in all its productive sectors.</p><p>Beyond financing, there is also tremendous value that the two nations can contribute to support partner countries in the Global South, particularly in advisory and technical services and technology transfer, as well as in developing and implementing transition plans and co-creating investment opportunities. This can \u2014 indeed, should \u2014 be done in a way that complements existing efforts by richer donor countries, and keeps the door open to financing from other sources.</p><p>China and Brazil have a historic opportunity to demonstrate a novel, more robust model of South-South climate cooperation that, beyond financing, is about solidarity in the face of shared challenges, and shared commitment to net-zero economic transitions. Such a partnership would signal a robust corrective to current biases and shortcomings in international climate finance.

However, soil carbon also has an inorganic component, known as soil inorganic carbon (SIC).</p><p><br/><br/><br/><br/>Solid SIC, often calcium carbonate, tends to accumulate more in arid regions with infertile soils, which has led many to believe it is not important.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In a study recently published in the journal Science, a team of researchers led by Huang Yuanyuan from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Zhang Ganlin from the Institute of Soil Science of the CAS, have quantified the global store of SIC, challenging the long-held view.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The researchers found a whopping 2,305 billion tonnes of carbon stored as SIC in the top two meters of soil worldwide, which is more than five times the carbon found in all of the world's vegetation. This hidden pool of soil carbon could be key to understanding how carbon moves around the globe.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This huge carbon pool is vulnerable to changes in the environment, especially soil acidification. Acids dissolve calcium carbonate and remove it either as carbon dioxide gas or directly into the water, Huang said.<br/><br/><br/><br/>\"Many regions in countries like China and India are experiencing soil acidification due to industrial activities and intense farming. Without remedial actions and better soil practices, the world is likely to face a disturbance of SIC in the next 30 years,\" she added.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Disturbances to SIC accumulated over Earth's history have a profound impact on soil health.

However, soil carbon also has an inorganic component, known as soil inorganic carbon (SIC). Solid SIC, often calcium carbonate, tends to accumulate more in arid regions with infertile soils, which has led many to believe it is not important. In a study recently published in the journal Science, a team of researchers led by Huang Yuanyuan from the Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and Zhang Ganlin from the Institute of Soil Science of the CAS, have quantified the global store of SIC, challenging the long-held view. The researchers found a whopping 2,305 billion tonnes of carbon stored as SIC in the top two meters of soil worldwide, which is more than five times the carbon found in all of the world's vegetation. </p><p>This hidden pool of soil carbon could be key to understanding how carbon moves around the globe. This huge carbon pool is vulnerable to changes in the environment, especially soil acidification. Acids dissolve calcium carbonate and remove it either as carbon dioxide gas or directly into the water, Huang said. \"Many regions in countries like China and India are experiencing soil acidification due to industrial activities and intense farming. Without remedial actions and better soil practices, the world is likely to face a disturbance of SIC in the next 30 years,\" she added. Disturbances to SIC accumulated over Earth's history have a profound impact on soil health. This disruption compromises the soil's ability to neutralize acidity, regulate nutrient levels, foster plant growth, and stabilize organic carbon. Essentially, SIC plays a critical dual role in storing carbon and supporting ecosystem functions that depend on it. The researchers revealed that approximately 1.13 billion tonnes of inorganic carbon are lost from soils to inland waters each year.

Its waters are host to a third of the world's types of coral. With 46 per cent of its land covered in green spaces, the city state is home to an impressive array of primary and secondary tropical forests, natural reserves and parks that have become sanctuaries for critically endangered animals, such as the Sunda pangolin, the Raffles' banded langur and the straw-headed bulbul. </p><p>Singapore's achievements have been so remarkable that its biodiversity index, introduced in 2008 to evaluate and monitor <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2185246/chengdu-blossoming-chinas-park-city\">conservation efforts within urban centres</url>, has been adopted by more than 40 cities worldwide, including Tokyo, and many others in Japan, Bangkok and London. According to a 2012 United Nations Environment Programme report, Hong Kong had also agreed to apply the self-assessment tool. </p><p>When Singapore became independent, it had been a British colony and military base for almost 150 years, and more than 95 per cent of its land had been cleared for commercial crops, such as pepper and rubber. Apart from the Botanic Gardens and a few patches of primary forest unsuitable for plantation, little remained of the original flora and fauna. Yet <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/short-reads/article/3262241/singapore-gets-new-prime-minister-and-unlike-those-imperial-china-he-wont-vie-power-absolute-monarch\">Prime Minister</url> Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's founding father, understood that nature could play a pivotal role in upgrading and promoting the city state. </p><p>\"Planting trees was part of a larger plan to help with the psychology of living in an urban space, to make happy citizens, happy workers,\" says Timothy Barnard, associate professor of environmental history at the National University of Singapore. </p><p>Singapore used to brand itself as the Garden City, a manicured urban space that was attractive for locals, expatriates and foreign investors. The green areas increased in size dramatically thanks to tree-planting and reforestation efforts, the opening of new parks and the careful preservation of what was left of Singapore's original forests. Rare and endangered flora and fauna - such as species of orchids and gingers, the Sambar deer and the leopard cat - were gradually reintroduced. </p><p>\"The evolution from Garden City to City in Nature is the proper expression of our evolution in understanding the benefits of nature,\" says Lim Liang Jim, group director for conservation at Singapore's National Parks Board. </p><p>As the green plan evolved, Singapore began treating natural spaces not only as pleasant backgrounds but also as living elements indispensable to the city state's future and the long-term wellness of its people. Nowadays, Singapore's 350 parks and nature reserves are connected by a 300km network of green corridors. </p><p>\"Connectivity encourages animals that pollinate plants and disperse seeds to move from one place to another, enhancing greenery naturally and organically,\" says Lim. \"It's a virtuous cycle that improves animals' and plants' genetics and makes nature more diverse and stronger.\" </p><p>Even roadside planting has been modified to emulate the tiers of a forest, with four layers: tall trees, canopy, shrubbery and ground cover. </p><p>\"In this way, different animals find their own ecological space,\" says Lim. \"You can have squirrels in the canopy and hornbills at the very top.\" </p><p>The idea is to treat nature holistically, protecting Singapore's more representative flora and fauna by looking after pollinators - such as bees and butterflies - at the base of the food chain. </p><p>\"Ecologically, butterflies are proxy to the diversity of plants and the health of your ecosystem,\" says Khew Sin Khoon, CEO of Singapore-based architectural firm CPG Corp. \"When you don't see butterflies, something's wrong with the environment.\" </p><p>In 2006, Khew assisted the National Parks Board in turning an abandoned quarry on biodiverse Pulau Ubin island into a butterfly trail. The area now hosts around 140 of the more than 300 butterfly species living in the city state. </p><p>Singapore has made nature not only ubiquitous and easily accessible but also a part of daily life. The result is a model that offers exciting possibilities for a planet on which more than half the population already lives in cities. </p><p>Within a five-minute walk of one of Singapore's most bustling areas, people can immerse themselves in the thick canopy of a tropical forest filled with macaques and colugos, or in wetlands amid crocodiles and sea turtles; in the evening, the grasslands at Jurong Lake Gardens are a riot of dragonflies of all colours and shapes, while Orchard Road, Singapore's main shopping artery, is host to a butterfly trail - complete with handout map - and at times becomes a rest stop for migratory birds. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/books/article/2092727/what-homes-singapore-can-teach-hong-kong-about-urban\">Singapore's tropical architecture</url> boasts buildings equipped with rainwater-recycling systems that mimic the design of ant hills (for example, the Solaris, in the Fusionopolis complex), porous structures that take advantage of natural ventilation to reduce air conditioning (Punggol Waterway Terraces) and hospitals that blend into parks to benefit from greenery's therapeutic properties (the Khoo Teck Puat Hospital). </p><p>The thick maze of climbing plants covering the Oasia Hotel has become a nesting ground for vultures and eagles. </p><p>\"We're building a kind of ecological paradise,\" says Richard Hassell, the co-founder of WOHA, the architectural firm behind the Oasia project. \"Once you have established the presence of plants, there's so many directions nature can take.\" </p><p>Blending the natural with the urban also makes Singapore more resilient to climate breakdown. The natural areas - superorganisms with a life of their own - provide the city state with invaluable ecosystemic functions, from water and air purification to drought and flood prevention and microclimate regulation. </p><p>\"The larger and more connected green spaces are, the more significant the difference in terms of temperature\", says Winston Chow, professor of urban climate at the Singapore Management University's College of Integrative Studies and the principal investigator for Cooling Singapore, a multidisciplinary research project dedicated to developing solutions to address urban heat. \"The cooling that takes place at the micro scale expands through the tree networks towards neighbourhoods and urban areas, maximising its potential.\" </p><p>Singapore's mangrove reforestation programme is creating coastal buffer zones that protect the city state from rising sea levels. Former concrete water canals have been naturalised and turned into ponds and rivers that act as reservoirs, enhancing biodiversity and protecting nearby buildings from flooding. </p><p>\"For many people, architectural cities are places where humans have created a different world from nature,\" says Hassell. \"We have to bring nature back into cities and create nature literacy to make people interested in and committed to it.\" </p><p>Although Singaporeans were initially lukewarm towards the government's green plans, judging from interviews with officials and members of the public, the post-pandemic years have seen a marked improvement in public sentiment: a large part of the nationwide OneMillionTrees planting programme - scheduled to end in 2030 and already 70 per cent complete - is being carried out by volunteers. </p><p>Earlier, the Singaporean public had been vocal in their support of the conversion of the Rail Corridor - a 24km decommissioned railway line that has become one of the city state's most crucial green connectors - and active in the mobilisation that saved Pulau Ubin from becoming a military training camp. </p><p>In a place where roads and housing estates are being demolished and reconstructed constantly, ancient forests and single trees have come to symbolise Singapore's identity, and are among the most powerful connections people have with their past. </p><p>\"Our forests are also a way for animals and plants to live a life of their own within a city, without any human intervention. It's remarkable, especially nowadays when the world is losing animal species and forests on a daily basis\", says Robert Zhao Renhui, a visual artist who represented Singapore at this year's Venice Biennale and who has dedicated much of his career to documenting local forests and their impact on the country and its people. \"The most beautiful part of what Singapore has created are the things you cannot predict, those that test the limits of what people can accept when living with nature. </p><p>\"I have so many stories of people, when they live very near the forest, they have so many problems, there is a limit to what they can accept, like monkeys or snakes or mosquitoes, the mould, the humidity, your books going yellow, your work getting destroyed. So there's a part where it's not controllable.\" </p><p>Nevertheless, the City in Nature project has profoundly changed the daily lives of citizens to the point where sharing a lakeside spot with otters or encountering wild boar during a jog in the park has become the norm. For Lim, the solution to the occasional conflict is to educate humans rather than try to control nature. </p><p>\"We have to make people understand that we cannot give all this up,\" he says. \"If we want this to continue, we will have to calibrate our relationship with everything that shares the space with us, including wild animals.\" </p><p>After centuries in which progress has been conceived as a constant struggle to tame nature and bend her to our will and needs, letting her co-manage or take over urban centres, the very symbols of human civilisation, is a mental leap. </p><p>\"It means going back towards a sort of 'pre-civilised' mindset, where nature is your mother and your father, where nature looks after you, and you have to look after nature,\" says Hassell. \"It is already happening here.\" </p><p>An enthusiastic Lim concludes, \"I think innovation in greenery and nature will keep evolving. The next chapter could be something wild, like building giant tree houses able to fit 25,000 people. </p><p>\"The world is your oyster, and you're only limited by your imagination.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2024.

A group of more than 60 conservationists from the academic, NGO and corporate sectors came together today for the first time since 2016 to start a collaborative process to discuss progress made under the current BSAP (2016-2021) and make suggestions for the next BSAP. China's current BSAP (2023-2030) was released in mid-January this year and makes reference to Hong Kong as a important region for biodiversity. </p><p><br/><br/>The 2016-23 BSAP was Hong Kong's first, and was led by the then Environment Bureau and Agriculture Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD). The action plan consisted of 57 actions divided into four areas: i) enhancing conservation measures, ii) mainstreaming biodiversity, iii) improving our knowledge and, iv) promoting community involvement. While the COVID19 pandemic delayed progress in many fronts, it also highlighted the value of having a diverse array of natural coastal and mountainous areas on the city's doorstep, as millions took to the country and marine parks and other natural areas to escape the crowds and relax. Nature based tourism such as scuba diving reported record numbers looked within the SAR for recreational opportunities. <br/><br/>Major biodiversity-related developments globally since 2016 include a deeper onset of climate change with various weather records being broken (including locally), and a worsening of the related global biodiversity crisis. For example the WWF Living Planet Report 2022 found that monitored populations of more than 5,200 species around the world had declined around 69% between 1970 and 2018. Findings such as these have triggered an upscaling of the global response including the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) agreed in late 2022 which includes goals for 2030 and 2050 to halt and reverse nature loss. Leading financial institutions and companies have also come together to address biodiversity loss in a way never seen before through the formation of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures (<url normalizedValue=\"https://tnfd.global/\">TNFD</url>) and framework for measuring, disclosing and addressing biodiversity impacts. <br/><br/>A diverse Expert Biodiversity Steering Committee has been formed locally to guide a process through which the conservation community can review progress under the current BSAP, and make suggestions for the new phase. This process is expected to last for most of 2024, and culminate with a final report to the Environment and Ecology Bureau, and AFCD. The process kicked off today with a workshop held at the Maritime Museum to brief interested conservationists on the upcoming process, and to start working on priority areas. Government representatives from the AFCD took part and shared their plans and priorities for updating the BSAP. <br/><br/>Steering Committee Chair Christine Loh, Chief Development Strategist, Institute for the Environment at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology noted \" The importance of biodiversity is now acknowledged globally as just as important as decarbonization in the era of achieving sustainability. The loss of biodiversity is a major planetary boundary. Hong Kong's effort in producing an appropriate BSAP for this era is essential, and we can only do it with cooperation across the public and private sectors.\" <br/><br/>Business Environment Council CEO Simon Ng \u2013 another Steering Committee member \u2013 acknowledged the significant increase in interest in nature conservation amongst the corporate sector since formulation of the current BSAP. \"Recently, corporate awareness of the relevance and importance of biodiversity and nature conservation to business strategies and operations is on the rise. Leading companies in Hong Kong have made global commitment by signing up as TNFD early adopters, signalling their intent to adopt the TNFD recommendations. Meanwhile, companies deep into their net-zero journey are seriously exploring nature-based solutions as a means to address carbon and enhance climate resilience. It is the best of time to bring corporates to the table, discuss approach on nature-positive economy, and solicit their perspectives into BSAP 2.0.\" <br/><br/>Dr. Michael Lau, ecologist and Founder of the Hong Kong Wetlands Conservation Association highlighted that to underestimate Hong Kong's biodiversity because the SAR's small size would be a mistake. \"Hong Kong's biodiversity is of global importance. There are endemic orchid, snake, lizard, firefly and other insect species that cannot be found in other parts of the world. We also host globally critically-endangered species, such as Big-headed Turtle in which Hong Kong is a stronghold. The denuded hillsides and degraded wetlands are prime areas for restoring lush forests and productive wetlands. Nature-based Solutions such as these can support a rich biodiversity, enhance the city's climate resilience, and also provide natural areas for the enjoyment of the people.\" <br/><br/>Marine Thomas, Associate Director of Conservation for The Nature Conservancy (TNC) Hong Kong said \" The BSAP establishes government policy for years to come and is an opportunity to correct course where necessary. For example, the protection of marine biodiversity still falls far behind when compared to terrestrial biodiversity. From endangered shellfish reefs to mighty whales, Hong Kong hosts ~25% of all marine species found in China. Currently only 5% of waters are protected, well below the GBF global target of 30%, while less than 20% of our marine ecological hotspots are protected. A review of marine conservation policies can help ensure that our network of Marine Protected Areas adequately fulfils its role to protect and restore our rich marine resources.\" <br/><br/>Background Information <br/><br/>All countries that are signatories to the Convention for Biological Diversity should have a Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (BSAP). Hong Kong SAR has a city focused <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/conservation/Con_hkbsap/con_hkbsap.html\">BSAP</url> that contributes to China's national plan. The formulation of the first Hong Kong Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2016-21) was a very inclusive process and benefitted from the expert input of many academics, NGOs and others. The BSAP has expired and needs to be updated through a new plan. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has shared through an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eeb.gov.hk/sites/default/files/en/node5840/ACE_Paper_15_2023.pdf\">update to the Advisory Coucil on the E</url>nvironment in early September 2023 that it is preparing to produce a next phase BSAP, with a view to making the plan public in 2025. <br/><br/>An informal Steering Committee has been formed to guide a process through which the conservation community can review progress under the current BSAP, and make suggestions for the new phase.

They are complementary and mutually reinforcing treaties that address biodiversity loss and climate change challenges.</p><p>At its most basic, climate change is a major driver of biodiversity loss, with impacts on species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services. Conserving and restoring natural ecosystems like forests, wetlands and grasslands helps mitigate climate change through carbon sequestration and other ecosystem regulatory functions. In turn, this makes them more resilient to a changing climate.</p><p>Biodiversity and climate change are highly technical and wide-ranging subjects, requiring the engagement of experts working together with governments, businesses, industries, and communities to prioritize, develop, and implement specific plans.</p><p>Indeed, the CBD requires each signatory country to develop and implement its own national biodiversity strategy and action plan (BSAP). China's first BSAP was issued in 1994; its most recent BSAP covers 2023-30. As a subnational entity, Hong Kong published its first five-year city plan in 2016.</p><p>In preparing the Hong Kong BSAP, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government conducted extensive consultations, starting with a steering committee made up of nongovernment experts and relevant government officials.</p><p>The steering committee chairman was a distinguished scholar, and the vice-chair was a senior official, thus balancing the importance of subject expertise with policy priorities.</p><p>The process lasted over two years and ended with a public consultation document with 67 specific actions for community comment, which became the city's BSAP plan.</p><p>The process was unique. The nongovernment steering committee members worked hard to reach out to more interested people to hear their views and recommendations. They gathered some 400 recommendations.</p><p>The government accepted important items but could not implement the massive wish list \u2014 some of which required fundamental revamping or removal of land and housing policies \u2014 while many other suggestions could be incorporated under the broad heading of public education about biodiversity.</p><p>Despite complaints that the government should have adopted more of the recommendations, it was appreciated that the process broke new ground in Hong Kong's consultation experience. Today, about 85 percent of the commitments have been completed, and the rest are expected to be achieved soon.</p><p>From the government's perspective, the BSAP required \"mainstreaming biodiversity within the government\". Relevant bureaus and departments had to incorporate biodiversity considerations into their work, such as enhancing biodiversity</p><p>considerations in development plans, projects, and programs and promoting biodiversity in the urban environment. In other words, biodiversity had to be considered in all government work.</p><p>Hong Kong must now develop a new BSAP, following the UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming in 2021 and Montreal in 2022. This resulted in the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), which recognizes the dire circumstances of biodiversity loss and contains global targets to be achieved by 2030 and beyond. China hosted the</p><p>Kunming gathering and was a co-host in Montreal.</p><p>The GBF's 23 global targets, to be achieved by 2030, need to be localized by governments. This allows for the recovery of natural ecosystems in the following 20 years with net improvements by 2050 to achieve the CBD's vision of \"living in harmony with nature by 2050\".</p><p>The HKSAR government is proposing a 10-year plan that aligns with the national plan by focusing on four strategic areas: enhancing biodiversity conservation, building capacities, partnering with neighboring cities (e.g., partner cities in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great Bay Area), and further mainstreaming biodiversity.</p><p>This time, the government feels there is no time to conduct another extensive consultation process like the previous time, as officials wish to publish the next BSAP in 2025.</p><p>Nevertheless, the city's experts, which include five universities, 14 nongovernment groups working on biodiversity, and commercial companies, have come together voluntarily to determine the priorities for the coming decade in an organized process of regular meetings and to cooperate with the government.</p><p>They have sorted themselves into areas of expertise, including on new topics such as businesses' interest in \"nature-based solutions\" to meet the increasing global demand for integrating biodiversity into developments for both the public and private sectors, which will, in turn, impact the bankability of projects.</p><p>Ecologists and the government are experiencing a new business interest in biodiversity.

The Jamuna River Sustainable Management Project 1, the first among a series of proposed projects, will help improve navigation channels with adequate depth that can accommodate large cargo vessels year-round, said the Washington-based lender in a statement published Tuesday. </p><p>This will help revive inland water transport and boost regional connectivity and trade, said the bank, adding that it will also help protect about 2,500 hectares of land from riverbank erosion and flooding, safeguarding the livelihoods and assets of the local people and creating new economic opportunities. \"Jamuna is one of the largest and most dynamic rivers in the world. It provides a lifeline to millions of people. Yet, river erosion, aggravated by climate change and rising water levels, displaces thousands of people every year, pushing them to poverty,\" said Abdoulaye Seck, World Bank country director for Bangladesh and Bhutan. \"Sustainable and climate resilient management of the Jamuna River will bring enormous economic benefits for the country and its people. The World Bank is helping Bangladesh to develop and implement a multi-phased program to protect sections of riverbanks and improve navigation channels and we will continue working closely with our multilateral and bilateral development partners.\" According to the statement, the project, for the first time in Bangladesh, will pilot nature-based solutions and innovative river structures and navigation at two channels of Jamuna, crossing Phulchhari, Gaibandha, and Kalihati. The improved navigation channels will benefit about 100,000 people by providing better safety and cheaper transportation for those switching from buses to passenger ferries, it said. \"The project will be the major first multi-sectoral investment under the Bangladesh Delta Plan 2100,\" said Ahmed Shawky, World Bank senior water resources management specialist and team leader for the project. \"The pilot activities will help improve climate resilience while protecting the environment and will not interfere with the river's natural course.

Policymakers in the region see the imperative for climate mitigation and adaptation but underscore the inadequacy of climate finance as an impediment. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The region, according to an estimate by the Asian Development Bank, requires US$210 billion annually through 2030 for climate-infrastructure investment. That amounts to 12 per cent of the US$1.8 trillion of sustainable-infrastructure investment needed annually through 2030 for emerging economies (excluding China), as estimated by an independent panel for this year's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/g20\">G20</url> meetings. </p><p>A significant proportion of the investment needed stems from the cost of transitioning away from carbon-intensive industries, investing in renewable energy, and improving energy efficiency. Additionally, protecting forests and adopting sustainable land-use practices are vital for carbon sequestration. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>Adaptation measures are also needed, including strengthening transport and energy infrastructure to withstand extreme weather, finding drought-resistant crop varieties, and activating early warning systems for natural disasters. </p><p>The amount of climate investment needed translates to roughly 4 or 5 per cent of the gross domestic product of all emerging economies, including those in Southeast Asia. Analysis suggests that two-thirds of that US$1.8 trillion figure, or US$1.2 trillion, will have to be raised domestically. </p><p>The remaining US$600 billion could come from international sources. About half of this amount would come from private debt and equity flows and the other half from public sources, mainly multilateral development banks. Considering that the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/world-bank-group\">World Bank</url>'s total lending was US$71 billion and the Asian Development Bank's US$20 billion in 2022, the climate financing gap would appear to be large. </p><p>There is an urgent need, therefore, to encourage multiple sources of climate finance from multiple stakeholders using innovative financing mechanisms. Political constraints preventing the opening of new avenues away from the monopolistic or oligopolistic hold of state-owned enterprises need to be addressed. </p><p>Doing so would help strengthen policy and regulatory frameworks that govern climate finance, including price signals such as financial incentives for green bonds. Government-linked and other state-owned enterprises in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/indonesia\">Indonesia</url>, for example, should be able to issue green bonds to supplement green-infrastructure projects that are financed by the government's budget. Multilateral development banks can boost domestic green-bond markets in Indonesia and other countries by providing guarantees against the loss of capital. </p><p>Steps to raise the profile and credibility of green finance in domestic markets will help. As investments in renewables and other green ventures are typically risk-prone, greater transparency about the nature and intensity of those risks will help. </p><p>Accounting for climate impacts can be conducted in asset valuation, for example. In this way, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/philippines\">the Philippines</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/vietnam\">Vietnam</url> - countries with high exposure to extreme weather - would gain from more transparent accounting of the risks. </p><p>Better communication can also help. To promote a better understanding of green bonds and other index-linked products, Indonesia, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/thailand\">Thailand</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/malaysia\">Malaysia</url>, the Philippines and Vietnam have developed taxonomies that establish a common language for green investments. </p><p>Carbon markets and trading, underpinned by quantitative restrictions or taxes on carbon, can provide another source of finance for Southeast Asia. By putting a price on carbon, businesses are, in one way or another, motivated to reduce emissions. </p><p>These mechanisms create economic incentives for emission reductions by allowing the buying and selling of carbon credits. Southeast Asian countries can participate in international carbon markets, generating revenue from emissions reductions achieved through their climate projects. </p><p>Given the size of the financing gap, Southeast Asia should also tap grass-roots financing mechanisms. Community-based initiatives, crowdfunding, and social impact bonds can empower local communities to contribute to climate projects. </p><p>This bottom-up approach helps climate finance reach those most vulnerable to climate change. Frank Lysy, a former World Bank economist, notes that in cases where investments took place on a massive scale, be it in cellular mobile services or digital technologies, the viability of the technologies and supportive regulatory frameworks were key, not top-down financing by the public sector. </p><p>Climate finance is different from those instances, given the vast spillover harm inherent in emissions and the risks of clean technology. Nonetheless, the role of grass-roots financing should be capitalised on. </p><p>The nature and even the extent of climate finance can also be influenced by giving greater play to nature-based solutions defined by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as \"actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural or modified ecosystems\". </p><p>One example of such an initiative is the East Asian-Australasian Flyway. The flyway, one of the world's greatest bird migration routes, utilises nature-based solutions that are also climate-friendly. The Philippines is also trying to employ nature-friendly solutions to mitigate flood risks in six river basins. </p><p>In line with the agenda for COP28, Southeast Asia needs to mobilise sizable resources to tackle mitigation and adaptation needs. Even though climate change is a pressing problem, policymakers are stretched by other urgent priorities and have to tackle multiple issues, such as food insecurity and healthcare. </p><p>Given such competing priorities, the urgency of climate action seems to take a back seat in the eyes of politicians and the public.

Ours is a region where climate change-induced disasters are becoming more frequent and intense. Since 1970, 2 million people have lost their lives to disasters. Tragically, but all too predictably, the poorest in the least developed countries are worst affected. They will find themselves in the eye of the storm as temperatures rise, new disaster hotspots appear and existing risks increase. Unless we fundamentally change our approach to building resilience to disaster risks, temperature rises of 1.5C or 2C will make adaptation to the threat of disasters unfeasible. Disaster risk could soon outpace resilience in Asia and the Pacific.</p><p>It is worth pondering what this would mean. The grim tally of disaster-related deaths would inevitably rise, as would the annual cost of disaster-related losses, forecast to increase to almost $1 trillion, or 3 percent of regional GDP, under 2C warming-up from $924 billion today, or 2.9 percent of regional GDP. The deadly combination of disasters and extreme weather would undermine productivity and imperil sustainable development. In the poorest parts of our region, such as the Pacific small island developing countries, disasters would become a major driver of inequality. Losses would be particularly devastating in the agriculture and energy sectors, disrupting food systems and undermining food security as well as jeopardizing energy supply and production. Environmental degradation and biodiversity loss would be remorseless, leading to climate change-driven extinctions and further increasing disaster risk.</p><p>To avoid this exponential growth of disaster risk, there is a narrow window of opportunity to increase resilience and protect hard-won development gains. To seize it, bold decisions are needed to deliver transformative adaption. They can no longer be postponed.</p><p>This week, countries meeting during our Committee on Disaster Risk Reduction will consider key questions such as prioritizing greater investment in early warning systems. Expanding coverage in least developed countries is the most effective way to reduce the number of people killed. Early warning systems can shield people living in multi-hazard hotspots and reduce disaster losses everywhere by up to 60 percent. They provide a tenfold return on investment. To protect food systems and reduce the exposure of the energy infrastructure \u2014 the backbone of our economies-sector-specific coverage is needed. Investments at the local level to improve communities' response to early warning alerts, delivered through expanded global satellite data use and embedded in comprehensive risk management policies, must all be part of our approach.</p><p>Nature-based solutions should be at the heart of adaptation strategies. They support the sustainable management, protection and restoration of degraded environments while reducing disaster risk. The evidence is unequivocal: preserving functional ecosystems in good ecological condition strengthens disaster risk reduction. This means preserving wetlands, flood plains and forests to guard against natural hazards, and mangroves and coral reefs to reduce coastal flooding. Forest restoration and sustainable agriculture are essential.

Mangroves are essentially forests that grow in the interface between the land and the sea, while seagrass are underwater plants that thrive in brackish and shallow water. </p><p>The region had been lax in preserving its blue carbon potential, Siti said. </p><p>\"For example, a lot of the mangroves in Sumatra and Java [in Indonesia] are quickly being converted into shrimp farming, and there's also conversion into palm oil [cultivation],\" she said. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/indonesia\">Indonesia</url> is home to over a third of the world's mangroves, while other parts of Asia-Pacific such as Papua New Guinea and Sunderbans between India and Bangladesh also have extensive belts. </p><p>There are also mangrove belts in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/philippines\">the Philippines</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/cambodia\">Cambodia</url>. </p><p>Many poverty-stricken areas also cut down mangroves to use them as firewood for cooking, while a steady erosion is also happening due to the impact of climate change, Siti said. </p><p>\"With sea levels rising, you will get more of these mangroves being inundated more frequently. And you will have changes in hydrodynamics, which drives erosion and mangroves,\" she said. </p><p>Even prosperous nations like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/singapore\">Singapore</url> have lost swathes of mangroves over the years due to land reclamation for urbanisation projects, she said. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/myanmar\">Myanmar</url> and Indonesia are among the countries worst hit by high population growth. </p><p>The marine systems need to be protected and nurtured for their potential because they cannot only absorb carbon within the plant biomass but also in the soil sediments, Siti said. </p><p>Around 71 countries have three of the richest blue carbon sources - mangroves, seagrass and salt marshes - but only half of these nations have included coastal and marine nature based solutions in their initial nationally determined contributions, she said. </p><p>The Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is a climate action plan to cut emissions and adapt to climate impacts. Each party to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/paris-climate-summit-2015\">Paris Agreement</url> is required to establish an NDC and update it every five years. </p><p>The Paris Agreement aims to strengthen global response to the threat of climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below two degrees. A UN report late last year said the world is not on track to meet the goal. </p><p>Most Southeast Asian nations also aim to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 or 2060. </p><p>The potential for blue carbon in climate mitigation was first recognised by the UN intergovernmental panel on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/climate-change\">climate change</url> about 13 years ago, the resource has been slowly gaining recognition by countries since then. </p><p>\"Blue carbon is a relatively new kid on the block,\" Siti said. \"Whenever we hear about nature-based climate mitigation, everyone thinks of forests. </p><p>\"There's still a lot of awareness that needs to be built around what are the kinds of policies that will encourage more of this more protection and restoration actions around blue carbon ecosystems,\" she said. </p><p>Siti said the International Blue Carbon Institute is encouraging countries to include blue carbon ecosystems in their NDC. </p><p>The institute in October organised workshops around policy and financing solutions for blue carbon with the support of the UK government and the Singapore national climate change secretariat. </p><p>While some headway has been made, there is a lot of work ahead because the true extent and condition of resources like seagrass meadows in parts of the region have yet to be validated, Siti said. </p><p>Policymakers are sometimes unsure of how these resources can be included in their climate policy goals, she said. </p><p>\"So some countries are quite advanced in that sense. And other countries are still learning about their own blue carbon resources and how they can actually include it in the nationally determined contributions,\" Siti added. </p><p>Another climate scientist said developing blue carbon should be a priority for national governments, but it should go hand-in-hand with efforts to reduce carbon emissions from industries and other sources simultaneously. </p><p>Souparna Lahiri, senior climate and biodiversity policy adviser at the Global Forest Coalition, cautioned that benefits derived from developing such ecosystems should not be used for trading in carbon credits in world markets because it would hurt climate objectives. </p><p>\"Marine ecosystems are very good carbon sequesters, and they should have traditionally been protected. But you should not seek to develop them in order to trade carbon credits that would enable industries to compensate for their emissions,\" he said. </p><p>\"If I emit carbon now, then it stays in earth's atmosphere for at least 100 years. By developing blue carbon sources, it will reduce carbon 40 to 50 years later,\" Lahiri said, adding that any effort to develop marine ecosystems for their environmental impact should be a standalone activity. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2024.

The report, released ahead of the Africa Climate Summit to be held in Nairobi on Sept. </p><p>4-6, said children are woefully neglected by the key climate financing flows required to help them adapt, survive, and respond to the climate crisis. Lieke van de Wiel, UNICEF deputy director for eastern and southern Africa, said it is clear that the youngest members of African society are bearing the brunt of the harsh effects of climate change. \"They are the least able to cope, due to physiological vulnerability and poor access to essential social services. We need to see a stronger focus of funding toward this group, so they are equipped to face a lifetime of climate-induced disruptions,\" van de Wiel said. The report titled \"Time to Act: African Children in the Climate Change Spotlight\" said children in 48 out of 49 African countries assessed are categorized as at high or extremely high risk of the impacts of climate change. The analysis assesses countries based on children's exposure to climate and environmental shocks, such as cyclones and heatwaves, as well as their vulnerability to those shocks, based on their access to essential services. The report said children living in the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria, Guinea, Somalia, and Guinea-Bissau are the most at risk. The report examined how multilateral climate funds (MCF) are targeting their resources. Just 2.4 percent of this key global climate funding can be classified as supporting child-responsive activities, with an average value of just 71 million U.S. dollars per year. \"If the target group is increased to include youth, the figure rises to just 6.6 percent of total MCF spending,\" the report said.

Over time, the aim is for the oysters to form a hard oyster reef structure. The shells should provide crevices to shelter other marine organisms such as fish, molluscs and crustaceans. </p><p>While man-made oyster reefs have been around for some years and are already established in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/australia\">Australia</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe\">Europe</url> and the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states\">United States</url>, the concept remains relatively new to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia\">Southeast Asia</url>. </p><p>Oyster reefs are among the most severely degraded marine habitats on the planet, reports by The Nature Conservancy show, mainly due to overharvesting, poor fishing practices and coastal developments. </p><p>But scientists say artificial oyster reefs have far-reaching potential. They help boost the local marine biodiversity and lower pollution in waters via the oysters' natural filtering abilities. </p><p>They also provide food for other organisms, such as fish, crabs and birds, protect shores from erosion and encourage the growth of other marine ecosystems such as sea grasses. </p><p>The idea first came about when Yokoyama's manager was mulling ways to reduce food waste while working with hospitality partners. Yokoyama is an ecologist at Witteveen+Bos, a leading Dutch engineering consultancy. </p><p>Singapore has naturally occurring oyster populations, which can survive in intertidal zones. These hardy rock oyster species are resilient to stresses and changing environments in and out of the water. </p><p>Yokoyama and her team saw value in repurposing old oyster shells to make an artificial reef, given that this could be used to augment the city state's existing oyster populations. </p><p>Armed with a seed grant from Singapore's Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, the oyster pilot project began in August last year, when Yokohama's team started approaching hotels and chefs. </p><p>Shell collection began in November, with 5kg to 15kg of oysters sourced each time from hospitality partners such as Sofitel, W Singapore - Sentosa Cove, The Oyster Cart and Joo Chiat Oyster House each time. </p><p>So far, preliminary data from their baseline studies has shown promising results, Yokoyama said. </p><p>The jetty pillars are already a \"rich living sea wall\", with a rich population of shellfish, green mussels, black mussels, predatory molluscs known as drills, nerite snails, sea squirts and coral polyps. </p><p>But with the presence of the reef bags, plenty of new residents have taken up residence, ranging from crabs, seen scuttling in and around the reef bags, to goby and other reef fish species. </p><p>\"The holes and crevices between the oyster shells offer shelter and protection from waves and currents and a safe space from predators during low tide, as compared to a sandy seabed ... It's like a vertical HDB flat for marine life,\" Yokoyama said, referring to apartments provided by Singapore's public housing authority. \"A lot of people look at this wall and think it's very ugly, but it's all alive.\" </p><p>The team took inspiration from a similar project in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</url> by The Nature Conservancy to restore once-thriving oyster reefs along the city's coastline after centuries of over-exploitation. </p><p>Yokoyama and her team were curious to see if the non-native species of oyster shells - typically Pacific oysters - used to attract native baby oysters would also work in Singapore. </p><p>Oysters in warm waters are more productive than those in cooler waters, and can gobble up more pollutants and particles to improve water quality. In turn, cleaner water can help other types of ecosystems, such as coral and seagrass, flourish as more light is able to penetrate deeper and promote growth. </p><p>To date, the team has collected some 130kg of shells, and plan to attach 30 of their reef bags on the jetty's pillars. </p><p>Oysters reproduce quickly and typically take between 18 months and three years to grow into adults. </p><p>This year, the team plans to monitor the shells for six months to see if the oyster larvae mature into adults. They also want to rope in citizen scientists to help with observation and documentation. </p><p>Yokoyama acknowledged that the project is still relatively small, but was a \"good start\". The team estimates it could take three to five years to see results. </p><p>For some of the team's corporate partners, the project has provided a platform to practice greater sustainability, and embrace more environmentally friendly and responsible practices. </p><p>Among them was W Singapore - Sentosa Cove. </p><p>Within a month of the hotel starting discussions with Yokoyama's team, it had started collecting its first batch of oyster shells. In December, when the team needed 1,000kg of oyster shells, the hotel contributed 26kg despite manpower constraints during the year-end festive period. </p><p>The hotel soon realised it needed to broaden its perspective, and came up with a number of \"diverse activities\" aimed at expanding how it could \"contribute more effectively to food waste projects and sustainability\", it said in a statement. </p><p>For instance, the hotel offered used plastic bottles to its partner, the Sentosa Development Corporation, to build a road using more sustainable resources. The plastic waste will be converted into new bitumen for road construction. </p><p>For restaurant Joo Chiat Oyster House, repurposing oyster shells is not new. It organised candle-making workshops in December, using old oyster shells as a base. </p><p>\"We had always hoped to recycle our oyster shells to be used as construction material, but we lacked the expertise ... To see them being used in the ocean is something new and something we never thought about,\" said restaurant co-founder Maggie Chen. </p><p>Yokoyama is happy that the oysters are finally getting their turn in the spotlight. </p><p>\"Oysters are hardy ecosystems. In Singapore there's a lot of attention on coral reefs and mangrove forests, which are important, but it's not feasible to implement, because of the tolerance range of where they can thrive,\" she said. \"Oyster reefs are a good way to complement them, using soft engineering through nature based solutions.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2024.

A systematic review of biodiversity studies was conducted to enumerate freshwater biodiversity change during eutrophication, encompassing 572 samples from 155 lakes in East China. Empirical samples were then taken of 93 phytoplankton communities from 38 lakes in ecologically degraded states of eutrophication. Samples were analysed for niche overlap in relation to biodiversity and productivity, and metrics of network structure indicative of community stability. Reviewed publications on eutrophication in East China lakes revealed losses in biodiversity of macrophytes, fishes, zooplankton and zoobenthos but not phytoplankton. Empirically sampled eutrophic lakes maintained high phytoplankton biodiversity through niche differentiation, and phytoplankton biodiversity correlated positively with biomass, in line with the expectations of BPR. The positive effect of biodiversity on phytoplankton productivity in eutrophic lakes acts in opposition to the negative impacts on productivity induced by eutrophication-management strategies of nutrient suppression. In degraded systems, the BPR contributes to sustaining productivity of lake phytoplankton communities, impeding recovery from a eutrophic state. This is a case of the BPR playing an undesirable role at the ecosystem level.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"Lake recovery programmes need to anticipate that the control of phytoplankton biomass will depend on reducing nutrients to a level sufficient to degrade the internal structure of the phytoplankton community.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: High Phytoplankton Diversity In Eutrophic States Impedes Lake Recovery.

But microalgae have a prodigious capacity for carbon dioxide relative to their mass, which is why Alcarbo - and many competitors - are racing to demonstrate that microalgae operations can scale up sufficiently to become a cost-effective carbon-capture solution and help reduce human-induced climate change. </p><p>Alcarbo's team of six set up the facility on a 150-square-metre patch in San Tin in the Yuen Long district over five months in early 2023. The site houses two shipping containers that contain algae cultivation and harvesting equipment, as well as a water filtering system - all powered by solar panels. Nearby is a \"wall\" of 12 algae photobioreactors, which are capable of absorbing half a tonne of carbon dioxide a year even after factoring in the carbon footprint of electricity consumption and construction, Ng said. </p><p>\"But it can do much better than that,\" Ng said, because adding more capacity increases the carbon-absorbing capacity without significantly adding to the carbon footprint. \"When we scale it up we just have to build more reactors.\" </p><p>Countries and companies around the world have pledged to reduce their carbon emissions in line with commitments to limit global warming, and innovative solutions including the use of algae to capture carbon dioxide are emerging to help reach those goals. </p><p>Natural algae, including both multicellular macroalgae and single-cell <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3242572/hong-kong-biotech-graduates-come-microalgae-solution-capture-carbon\">microalgae</url>, convert about 95 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide every year into organic molecules, accounting for 47.5 per cent of the greenhouse gas absorbed through photosynthesis, according to ENN Group, one of China's largest private energy companies. </p><p>A tonne of microalgae absorbs around two tonnes of carbon dioxide while releasing 1.3 tonnes of oxygen as it grows, according to ENN. </p><p>ENN launched a research and development project for microalgae carbon absorption in 2007, aiming to prove the technology's potential on an industrial scale. </p><p>Since then, ENN has built a microalgae demonstration base with a total area of more than three acres on desert land in Dalad Banner in Ordos in Western Inner Mongolia. </p><p>For Alcarbo, Hong Kong has proved to be a good base of operations, so far. </p><p>\"It's a good demonstration place,\" Ng said. \"For research and development it's a really good place. It's also good for us to showcase our proof-of-concept to people from all over the world so they can see that this is really working.\" </p><p>Alcarbo has received HK$2.6 million (US$332,000) in funding from Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks (HKSTP), City University of Hong Kong's HK Tech 300 fund and the Hong Kong Polytechnic University's Micro Fund. </p><p>The company hopes to scale its capacity up to 100 tonnes a year by next year. That would require 2,900 bioreactors spanning 3,500 square metres, around half the size of a professional football stadium, including a water storage tank and a filtering system. Such a facility would absorb carbon dioxide equivalent to 90,000 square metres of forest, or around 13 football pitches. </p><p>\"For scale-up, I think we need to find other places, as the rent and the labour in Hong Kong is too expensive,\" Ng said.

That means that these systems are expensive and not economically viable, especially for carbon-dioxide fixation purposes.\" </p><p>International firms working on microalgae as a means for decarbonisation include London-based start-up Brilliant Planet, which aims to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by growing local strains of marine algae on land in coastal desert areas. </p><p/><p>\"The business originally focused on marine microalgae for the production of animal feed stock,\" said Piers Mudd, Brilliant Planet's chief operating officer. \"Studies into the power of photosynthesis and the study of carbon-rich algal species then saw the business pivot to focus on carbon.\" </p><p>Brilliant Planet's facilities can capture 30 times more carbon per year than an equivalent area of forest, without competing for productive land, the company said. </p><p>In July, Brilliant Planet announced that it would remove 1,500 tonnes of carbon by 2027 at its planned demonstration facility in Morocco for global technology company Block. </p><p>Block bought desert algae carbon removal from Brilliant Planet through the Watershed Marketplace, an enterprise climate platform that allows companies to buy carbon removal options. </p><p>Brilliant Planet is currently operating a five-hectare pilot facility and intends to build its first commercial facility in 2027, capable of removing around 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year.

There is no time to lose in securing a nature-positive society, it warned in the 14th edition of its biennial Living Planet Report 2022. Across the globe, monitored wildlife populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish have seen a devastating 69 percent decline on average since 1970. In a video interview with Xinhua, WWF International's Director General Marco Lambertini said that \"The figures are shocking and confirm the fact that our way of living, consuming and producing is just simply not sustainable. The impact on the natural world is immense.\" </p><p>\"We need to restore what's possible and we need to sustainably manage the rest. That means we need to transition the 'Big Five' economic drivers of nature loss: agriculture, fishing, infrastructure, extractives and forestry from nature-negative to nature-positive practices,\" Lambertini said. The dataset in the report features almost 32,000 populations of 5,230 species. The Living Planet Index (LPI) within the report, provided by the Zoological Society of London (ZSL), shows that between 1970 and 2018, monitored wildlife populations in Latin America and the Caribbean region declined by 94 percent on average. It also revealed that in less than a lifetime, monitored freshwater populations have fallen by an average of 83 percent, the largest decline of any species group. Habitat loss and barriers to migration routes are responsible for about half of the threats to monitored migratory fish species.

The organization is advocating for leaders to commit to a \"Paris-style'\" agreement capable of reversing biodiversity loss to secure a nature-positive world by 2030, Lambertini noted. \"We really hope that a global goal could be adopted so that we will have carbon neutrality on the one hand and secure a nature-positive world on the other,\" Lambertini said. The authors of the report also called on policymakers to transform economies so that natural resources are properly valued. \"We need to invest more directly in supporting the global south and in protecting more of the nature they still have,\" Lambertini said. \"A mobilization of resources led by the north through different mechanisms from the private sector and multilateral banks is necessary to support more action in the global south for nature conservation and sustainable management.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["It also revealed that in less than a lifetime, monitored freshwater populations have fallen by an average of 83 percent, the largest decline of any species group.

The putrid conditions were in stark contrast to the vibrant community that now flourishes around the lake's rejuvenated environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The lake, once part of bustling Yundang Port, has since been cleaned up to become a thriving urban haven thanks to a succession of measures taken by researchers and local authorities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nowadays, Zuo, a retired nurse, regularly goes for hourlong walks in a park near the lake. She also takes advantage of a newly built fitness trail and enjoys looking at egrets that hover around the body of water.</p><p>In the 1970s, a crucial change happened with the construction of a western embankment, transforming Yundang Port into a sprawling lake, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources. The port, which was connected to the sea, covered 10 square kilometers while the area of Yundang Lake was 2.2 square kilometers.</p><p>However, in the early 1980s rapid economic development brought industrial pollution and fish and shrimp disappeared from the lake. Back then, more than 100 polluting enterprises, including paper mills, tanneries, breweries, and electroplating factories, discharged wastewater into Yundang.</p><p>Xi leads action</p><p>A meeting chaired by Xi Jinping, then serving as executive vice mayor of Xiamen, in 1988 set in motion a comprehensive strategy to revitalize the lake.</p><p>The meeting outlined a plan that detailed legal governance, stopping pollution, dredging work, revitalization of the body of water and improvement of the surrounding environment.</p><p>In the same year, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Xiamen passed the \"Accelerating the Comprehensive Improvement of Yundang Lake\" proposal, which outlined the principles for restoration work.</p><p>At that time, 45 percent of the city's industrial wastewater and half of Xiamen's domestic sewage was discharged into the lake. Cutting off sources of pollution and treating sewage were crucial steps to improving the water quality, according to the local government. The Xiamen government eventually shut down or relocated major polluting industrial plants.</p><p>Supervision of Xiamen's drainage system was also stepped up and a major innovation was introduced.</p><p>Wang Yanyan, chief engineer of Xiamen's Municipal Affairs and Gardens Bureau, said they now manage the city's drainage system for both residential and business areas.</p><p>The bureau regularly inspects and supervises renovations and new construction in business areas to ensure polluting waste doesn't make its way into the waterways. \"We instruct business owners to install the necessary infrastructure, including grease traps, and to also obtain drainage permits before they renovate business premises,\" she said.</p><p>The preventive approach aims to stop grease and waste from blocking drainage systems. There are also two drainage systems that separate rainwater from wastewater. The wastewater is then treated before being discharged into rivers and lakes, she said.</p><p>\"The drainage management authority tracks and manages the system. It's like a doctor regularly tracking (the system's) health and taking care of it,\" Wang said.</p><p>The Xiamen government has also used tidal differentials to connect the lake to the sea, facilitating water exchanges during low and high tides. This movement of water has transformed the once stagnant lake into a dynamic and thriving ecosystem and promoted a healthier aquatic environment.</p><p>Sea dikes removed</p><p>In the 1920s, Xiamen began expanding its area by reclaiming land from the East Sea through the building of dikes.</p><p>Back then, travel from Xiamen Island relied heavily on shipping. Sea dikes not only guarded against waves, but also enabled rail lines and highways to be built to better connect the city to outside areas and boost economic growth.</p><p>The sea dikes, including one near Yundang Port, enhanced industries such as salt fields and aquaculture. However, the dikes also created a pollution problem.</p><p>Pan Shijian, former vice chairman of the Xiamen Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: \"Xiamen experiences two influxes of seawater from the Taiwan Strait, bringing clean seawater into the city. If we were to fill in the bay and turn it into land, our tidal inflow would greatly decrease, leading to a dismal future for this city.</p><p>\"Despite the large cost and efforts, the Xiamen government made a resolute decision to open up the sea walls and clear millions of cubic meters of sediment, introducing seawater into bays.\"</p><p>Xiamen removed all the dikes that it could. Those needed for flood management and tide control were kept, and sluice gates or additional openings were added. Since 1988, Xiamen has opened seven sea dikes, including ones at Yundang Lake and Maluan Bay, the Ministry of Natural Resources said.</p><p>With the completion of sea-crossing bridges and tunnels such as the Xiamen Bridge, Haicang Bridge and Xiang'an Tunnel, the transportation functions once shouldered by the sea dikes have gradually diminished. The sea dikes had curbed Xiamen's efforts to improve the environment and achieve high-quality urban development, the ministry said.</p><p>\"Returning much of the land to the sea is something you may find hard to imagine. It required a significant amount of money and it seemed unbelievable at the time,\" Pan said.</p><p>Mangroves restored</p><p>So far, the renovation of Yundang Lake has cost about 1.99 billion yuan ($277 million).</p><p>\"We are not only engaged in environmental restoration, but also preserving our city's culture,\" Pan said.</p><p>\"For example, our sailing sports lead the way in China. People in Xiamen no longer just observe the sea from the shore. They can now sail and see dolphins in the sea. It has changed our lifestyle.\"</p><p>To restore wetlands, the city's forestry bureau and Xiamen University planted mangroves along lakefronts and seashores.</p><p>The mangrove restoration projects were done in \"forest-friendly\" areas including Yundang Lake and Tong'an Bay.

She also takes advantage of a newly built fitness trail and enjoys looking at egrets that hover around the body of water.</p><p>In the 1970s, a crucial change happened with the construction of a western embankment, transforming Yundang Port into a sprawling lake, according to the Ministry of Natural Resources. The port, which was connected to the sea, covered 10 square kilometers while the area of Yundang Lake was 2.2 square kilometers.</p><p>However, in the early 1980s rapid economic development brought industrial pollution and fish and shrimp disappeared from the lake. Back then, more than 100 polluting enterprises, including paper mills, tanneries, breweries, and electroplating factories, discharged wastewater into Yundang.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Xi leads action</emphasis></p><p>A meeting chaired by Xi Jinping, then serving as executive vice mayor of Xiamen, in 1988 set in motion a comprehensive strategy to revitalize the lake.</p><p>The meeting outlined a plan that detailed legal governance, stopping pollution, dredging work, revitalization of the body of water and improvement of the surrounding environment.</p><p>In the same year, the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of Xiamen passed the \"Accelerating the Comprehensive Improvement of Yundang Lake\" proposal, which outlined the principles for restoration work.</p><p>At that time, 45 percent of the city's industrial wastewater and half of Xiamen's domestic sewage was discharged into the lake. Cutting off sources of pollution and treating sewage were crucial steps to improving the water quality, according to the local government. The Xiamen government eventually shut down or relocated major polluting industrial plants.</p><p>Supervision of Xiamen's drainage system was also stepped up and a major innovation was introduced.</p><p>Wang Yanyan, chief engineer of Xiamen's Municipal Affairs and Gardens Bureau, said they now manage the city's drainage system for both residential and business areas.</p><p>The bureau regularly inspects and supervises renovations and new construction in business areas to ensure polluting waste doesn't make its way into the waterways. \"We instruct business owners to install the necessary infrastructure, including grease traps, and to also obtain drainage permits before they renovate business premises,\" she said.</p><p>The preventive approach aims to stop grease and waste from blocking drainage systems. There are also two drainage systems that separate rainwater from wastewater. The wastewater is then treated before being discharged into rivers and lakes, she said.</p><p>\"The drainage management authority tracks and manages the system. It's like a doctor regularly tracking (the system's) health and taking care of it,\" Wang said.</p><p>The Xiamen government has also used tidal differentials to connect the lake to the sea, facilitating water exchanges during low and high tides.

Sea dikes not only guarded against waves, but also enabled rail lines and highways to be built to better connect the city to outside areas and boost economic growth.</p><p>The sea dikes, including one near Yundang Port, enhanced industries such as salt fields and aquaculture. However, the dikes also created a pollution problem.</p><p>Pan Shijian, former vice chairman of the Xiamen Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, said: \"Xiamen experiences two influxes of seawater from the Taiwan Strait, bringing clean seawater into the city. If we were to fill in the bay and turn it into land, our tidal inflow would greatly decrease, leading to a dismal future for this city.</p><p>\"Despite the large cost and efforts, the Xiamen government made a resolute decision to open up the sea walls and clear millions of cubic meters of sediment, introducing seawater into bays.\"</p><p>Xiamen removed all the dikes that it could. Those needed for flood management and tide control were kept, and sluice gates or additional openings were added. Since 1988, Xiamen has opened seven sea dikes, including ones at Yundang Lake and Maluan Bay, the Ministry of Natural Resources said.</p><p>With the completion of sea-crossing bridges and tunnels such as the Xiamen Bridge, Haicang Bridge and Xiang'an Tunnel, the transportation functions once shouldered by the sea dikes have gradually diminished. The sea dikes had curbed Xiamen's efforts to improve the environment and achieve high-quality urban development, the ministry said.</p><p>\"Returning much of the land to the sea is something you may find hard to imagine.

The second edition of the State of Finance for Nature Report says that investments in habitats' conservation must increase from the current 154 billion U.S. dollars to 384 billion dollars annually by 2025, in order to secure a green, resilient and prosperous future for humanity. </p><p>Inger Andersen, UNEP Executive Director, said that scientific consensus was categorical that countries must scale up financing to preserve health of the natural world, tame the climate crisis and avert looming extinction of species. \"We must collectively and urgently redirect and scale up capital to nature, climate and restorative-positive activities that bring us back on track towards a stable and nature-abundant planet that we can all equitably benefit from,\" said Anderson. The UNEP report notes that nature positive investments remained below target, only to worsen poverty, water stress, hunger, disease and climate emergencies. The report says the investments required to halt biodiversity loss, land degradation and shield vulnerable communities from the climate crisis should increase by 230 billion dollars annually by 2025.

Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>These disasters raised questions about the effectiveness of China's climate-resilience strategy for extreme rainfall, the \"sponge city\" initiative launched nationwide in 2015. Experts say that the basic idea - making cities better at absorbing excess rain - is a sound one. But its roll-out so far has turned out to be something of a damp squib. For the initiative to truly hold water, infrastructure must be deployed more rapidly. Even then it will not, on its own, protect against the most severe events that climate change is spawning, experts say. </p><p>China is among the world's most highly exposed countries to floods, with nearly 400 million people directly exposed to once-in-100-year floods, representing more than a third of global exposure, according to a study published by <url normalizedValue=\"https://blogs.worldbank.org/climatechange/flood-risk-already-affects-181-billion-people-climate-change-and-unplanned\">World Bank</url> in 2022. The country loses an estimated 1 per cent of its gross domestic product each year to floods, with more than 640 cities subject to flood risks and 67 per cent of the population living in flood-prone areas, World Bank said. </p><p>China's State Council, the cabinet, announced the sponge city initiative in 2015. Similar to the concept of \"low-impact development\" in the United States and Canada, the approach calls for more green and blue spaces, like trees, wetland parks, and lakes, to be placed among conventional infrastructure like roads and buildings. This mimics natural water cycles to allow cities to soak up rainwater, then drain it away or make use of it. </p><p>The government expected the approach to not only strengthen the country's drainage and water-management systems to enhance urban flood prevention, but also make it an engine for economic growth. \"Promote the construction of sponge cities, so that urban areas will have not just outward form but real substance,\" said former premier Li Keqiang in the annual government work report in 2017. </p><p/><p>The council set ambitious targets: equipping 80 per cent of urban areas with sponge-city features by 2030 and recycling at least 70 per cent of rainfall. The government had identified 60 cities as pilot cities as of May 2023, offering them subsidies from 700 million yuan to 1 billion yuan each. </p><p>From 2016 to 2020, cities engaged in more than 33,000 sponge-city projects, from residential communities to parks, spanning 90 cities in 13 provinces, with the total investment reaching 1.06 trillion yuan, according to state media. </p><p>Developers are on board. </p><p>The concept is \"integrated into all our developments, especially the mixed-use precincts\", said Michael Long, group head of sustainability at New World Development. </p><p>\"For New World, we see that the sponge city concept remains an important aspect of our strategic approach towards climate resilience and resource conservation, and also [other] aspects of protecting our natural environment, and how we integrate that into business decision-making, from new investments to development design and asset operations.\" </p><p>The Canton First Estate in Foshan, a mixed-use project spanning villas, serviced apartments and a golf course by the developer's mainland China property arm, New World China, includes drainage-improving features such as basins that collect and filter rainwater, as well as permeable pavement. </p><p/><p>The development can process up to 4.45 million cubic metres of rainwater and greywater each year and withstand a once-in-50-years torrential rainstorm, Long said. </p><p>Despite such efforts, Chinese cities remain vulnerable. Last July, cities and provinces in northeastern China, including Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei province, experienced extreme rainfall and flooding as a result of Typhoon Doksuri. At least 1.3 million people were affected and more than 200,000 homes were damaged, according to the Beijing municipal government. </p><p>In September, Typhoon Saola hit southern China's Fujian and Guangdong provinces after battering Hong Kong, prompting the evacuation of more than 800,000 people and the cancellation of hundreds of flights. According to the Fujian government, the event led to a direct economic loss of about 870 million yuan in the province. </p><p>Such losses pose the question: after many billions of yuan invested and nearly a decade of construction, does sponge-city infrastructure really work in protecting cities from flood damage? </p><p>According to water and engineering experts, sponge-city measures are a reasonable approach to improve resilience against heavy rainfall. Impermeable surfaces in urban areas, such as concrete, brick and steel, reduce infiltration and raise the risk of floods during storms. Sponge-city infrastructure can improve a city's capability to absorb and store water. </p><p>\"China's actions to address floods and heavy rainfalls, especially its 'sponge city' initiative, are an important strategy to proactively address the challenges of contemporary urban development and climate change,\" said Li Junqi, vice-principal at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. </p><p>Many cities that have implemented the concept, such as Shanghai and Wuhan in Hubei province, have experienced less waterlogging during heavy rainfall than before, according to Li. </p><p>However, such infrastructure can only manage a certain amount of rainwater. And climate change is fuelling extreme events that exceed the levels sponge cities can handle, according to experts. </p><p>\"People who think the sponge city initiative failed tend to think that there's a silver bullet to solve the water risks,\" said Mark Fletcher, global water business leader at engineering consultant Arup. \"But there are no silver bullets in the fight against uncertainty and climate change.\" </p><p/><p>For example, according to statistics from the water authority of the Shenzhen Municipality, after investing more than 2.3 billion yuan from 2016 to 2022 in sponge-city projects, the city is now protected against heavy floods of the type that occur once every 100 to 200 years. </p><p>But according to Hong Kong officials, the rainstorm in September was a \"once in 500 years\" event. </p><p>\"The challenge we're facing is an awful lot of uncertainty with climate change,\" Fletcher said. \"There are really good things that we're doing at the moment with water resilience, like sponge cities, but maybe it's time to go to the next level, like 'sponge city plus', as we're getting bigger and more extreme events.\" </p><p>It is crucial to include non-structural measures, such as effective forecasting and early-warning systems, into urban flood-protection efforts, according to Fletcher. </p><p>Using advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence and big data throughout the urban planning, forecasting and early warning processes can help build different layers of resilience, he said. For example, a city can concentrate infrastructure development in problem areas, or move quickly to relocate people and equipment to minimise damage when flooding is imminent. The government should educate citizens about risks and protection methods to improve community resilience, rather than just focusing on infrastructure resilience, he said. </p><p>Swire Properties has incorporated sponge-city concepts into projects such as Taikoo Place in Hong Kong and Savyavasa in Jakarta, according to Fiona Shiu, director of the technical services and sustainability department and facilities management.

A strong, united, multilateral response to this inequity has become an emerging consensus, reaffirmed by convening the Africa Climate Summit in early September and the ongoing Africa Climate Week. In a world fixated on emissions, Africa's paradox is stark: It emits little yet suffers profoundly. The United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) recognizes the urban-climate connection, as cities are at the frontline of this struggle, with the urban poor hit the hardest. </p><p>Population increases in urban areas, especially in Africa, are making cities hotspots of misery that suffer from flash floods, droughts and heatwaves. The recent devastation from Cyclone Freddy in Malawi and Mozambique is a wake-up call -- over 2 million affected, 600 lives lost, and 140 million U.S. dollars in damage, mostly in urban areas. Astonishingly, despite being home to over 600 million people, African cities receive the least attention in global climate discourse. CITIES: THE MAIN BATTLEFIELD At COP27 in Egypt, the first-ever ministerial meeting on urbanization and climate change acknowledged the critical role of cities in reducing emissions. We flipped the script by putting cities forward as the solution and not only the villain. There should be increasing awareness that the climate battle will be won or lost in cities. Cities need to adapt to the effects of climate change. At the same time, they need to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels. The best place to do this will be in Africa. Additionally, the UN Habitat Assembly, held in June 2023 in Nairobi, passed key resolutions reaffirming UN-Habitat's role as the focal point for sustainable urbanization and human settlements. These resolutions highlight the interlinkages between urbanization and climate change. They call upon us to use technology to create smart cities to improve living standards. They underscore the importance of multilevel climate action and the pivotal role of cities and local governments in implementing the Paris Agreement and the National Determined Contributions (NDCs). This echoes the African Union's recognition that climate change is central to the continent's development. Although African countries are beginning to incorporate urban climate resilience into their NDCs, these political commitments must be translated into action on the ground. STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS &amp; MULTILEVEL ACTION Partnerships, like the collaboration between UN-Habitat, UNDP and the African Union Commission, highlight the path to resilient urban development and pave the way to effectively implement AU's Africa Urban Resilience Programme. In addition, Kenya is leading an initiative on Building Climate Resilience for the Urban Poor to support the resilience perspective for the more than 54 percent of the urban population living in informal settlements in Africa. Such efforts -- and others being implemented by a wider community of the United Nations, academic and civil society partners -- are supporting the implementation of SDG 11 with a focus on climate action in cities and contributing to achieving SDG 13. FASTER LOCAL ACTION NEEDED Amid Africa's urban climate paradox, a vital challenge looms: the need for localized climate data. This scarcity hampers evidence-based planning, a linchpin of effective climate action. Informed choices rely on precise, context-specific data. Overcoming this obstacle requires collaborative efforts to enhance data collection, monitoring and modeling. Creating resilient cities requires proactive long-term planning, weaving climate priorities into the urban fabric. Climate justice, green energy and innovative financing must be at the core. Yet, along with a shortage of skilled planners, the financing gaps persist. Projections suggest that the loss and damage due to climate change could cost Africa between 289.2 to 440.5 billion U.S. dollars from 2022 to 2030. Fulfilling NDCs requires an estimated 234 to 250 billion U.S. dollars annually until 2030. Inaction is not an option. Creative financing, empowering local communities and addressing climate data gaps are essential. SOLUTIONS ATTAINABLE Moving forward, we must enhance coordination across all levels of government and support inclusive climate action that transforms cities and improves lives. The enhanced role of local government in climate action means investing more to build capacities at the local level. This is the only way to ensure we can implement national strategies and solutions for adaptation and low-carbon development. By undertaking integrated planning that leaves no one behind, embracing ecosystem-based approaches and mobilizing climate finance, we can build thriving urban spaces and human settlements in Africa and protect our shared future. As UN-Habitat, our commitment is unwavering -- we support African countries and cities in taking concrete climate action, providing technical assistance to develop and implement local climate plans and resilience strategies. We will continue to assist countries to access climate funds and promote multilevel inclusive climate governance. We are committed to scaling support to the Least Developing Countries and Small Islands Developing States. Collaborative, data-driven strategies are attractive to investors and donors. Fostering innovation, embracing nature-based solutions and integrating technology into climate action are the keys to success. By building partnerships, engaging civil society and accessing climate funds, we can turn political commitments into tangible change. As of now, we have mobilized 36 million U.S. dollars, a drop in the ocean. What is needed is a seismic shift to help make cities more resilient in this age of multiple crises. The time has come for the Paris Agreement to resonate in Africa's cities. It is time for local governments to play their part in preparing for climate action. The journey forward is collective. My hope for the Africa Climate Summit centers on collective progress. Africa's urban destiny rests on it.

Similarly, our planet, now threatened by climate change and biodiversity loss, also needs healing in a holistic way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are beginning to realize the intertwined nature between climate and biodiversity. Climate change aggravates biodiversity loss and weakens nature's capacity to absorb carbon, further hastening climate change. To break this vicious cycle requires addressing these two challenges simultaneously and with equal vigor.</p><p>Although there is growing consensus on this among scientists, policymakers, and financiers, globally financing for climate and biodiversity remains lopsided. Global climate financing reached $632 billion in 2019/2020, while biodiversity financing totaled just $124-$143 billion.</p><p>This contrast also exists in the deployment of green finance, where financing for climate efforts dwarfs that for biodiversity. According to the International Development Finance Club, of a total of $185 billion green finance commitments its members made in 2020,$179 billion or 96 percent went to climate finance, and only a meager $5.4 billion or 3 percent to biodiversity.</p><p>It is the same with green bonds issued in China. According to the China Green Bond Market Report 2020, of the $44 billion green bonds issued by Chinese entities in 2020, only about 5 percent were allotted for biodiversity or ecological protection, with the rest largely going to climate-related projects.</p><p>Many reasons drive this imbalance. In the climate space, greenhouse gas emissions can be credibly converted to CO2 equivalents, now a common currency to measure the contribution to climate change. This makes designing, financing, and monitoring climate-focused projects feasible. In contrast, quantifying ecosystem services and biodiversity (in either biophysical or monetary terms) is fiendishly difficult. Inevitably, this impedes investments that rely on quantifiable results.</p><p>Thanks to regulation to internalize the cost of carbon emissions, climate-focused projects (e.g., renewable energy development and energy efficiency) already have proven cash flows and attract sizable private investment. On the other hand, biodiversity still struggles to convert its benefits to human societies into financial revenue. Except for sustainable forestry, eco-tourism, mitigation banking, and a handful of other examples, \"bankable\" biodiversity projects are generally few and far between. This explains why most financing for biodiversity still comes from public sources.</p><p>Finally, biodiversity is often uniquely local, and projects designed for one place are therefore rarely directly replicable or scalable in other places. For their generally modest size and disparate nature, biodiversity projects don't conveniently fit the parameters of existing financial products and markets that favor standardization and economies of scale. So, biodiversity projects have a long way to go to take full advantage of modern financial markets' efficiency, reach and vast resources.</p><p>Nevertheless, ways to channel more financing into biodiversity conservation and bring about better alignment between climate and biodiversity do exist. To begin with, efforts to address climate and biodiversity must not undercut each other. For example, the land footprint of some clean energy infrastructure can be up to 12 times that of traditional energy sources, so where we place it is crucial. Without careful planning, well-intentioned clean energy infrastructure could endanger biodiversity and create additional financial burdens to restore impaired biodiversity.</p><p>We must step up efforts to explore the benefits of tackling both climate and biodiversity challenges with nature-based solutions. For example, restoring mangrove forests can deliver multiple benefits, from enhancing fish nurseries to storing carbon to mitigating the impacts of storm surges.</p><p>Encouragingly, China is jump-starting this effort by launching its National Mangrove Conservation and Restoration Action Plan, an initiative informed in part by a strategic study completed by the Paulson Institute and its partners. Under this plan, a total of 18,800 hectares of mangrove forests will be rehabilitated and planted by 2025.</p><p>In addition, China's national carbon emission trading system inaugurated in July 2021, and its planned expansion to cover eight high-emission sectors, has immense potential for scaling up nature-based solutions as it is expected to allow carbon credits generated from ecosystem-based projects to offset carbon emissions. Moreover, experts are also calling for the introduction of emissions allowance auctioning and allotment of a portion of the proceeds to ecosystem protection and restoration, which will help boost financing for biodiversity.</p><p>Seeking innovative ways to bridge the gap between biodiversity projects and existing financial markets is also imperative. For example, by combining replicable homogenous projects or bundling multiple heterogeneous projects into one diversified product, conservation projects may be structured into more marketable financial products, thus unlocking the vast financial resources that are increasingly looking for environmental, social and governance-themed investment opportunities. An example of this is the mangrove bonds that are gaining interest among financial institutions in and outside China.</p><p>Last but not least, exploring innovative mechanisms that help realize the economic value of ecosystem services by either leveraging existing markets or creating new ones must continue. For example, the New York Stock Exchange is exploring a new nature-based asset class in the form of Natural Asset Companies designed to capture and store nature's intrinsic and productive value.</p><p>Of course, for biodiversity finance to grow at scale, many other challenges must be addressed, such as strengthening the regulatory framework to value natural capital, building capacity, and implementing de-risking measures to incentivize private investment.

Per the tech giant's announcement, the initiative will be handled by Veritree, a startup that specializes in using blockchain technology to track every stage involved in the tree planting process. The Samsung tree planting initiative is billed to be completed in the first half of this year, with the tropical trees expected to restore roughly 200 hectares of land and sequester roughly one billion pounds of Cabon dioxide (CO2) over a 25-year period. Veritree's acclaimed tree planting role will help in deploying blockchain technology to verify and track every step of the reforestation process. Samsung's sustainability journey is an ongoing and multi-faceted one. Investing in tech innovations, such as those that create efficiency improvements and minimize waste, in combination with nature-based solutions, are vital in the fight against climate change,  said Mark Newton, Head of Corporate Sustainability at Samsung Electronics America. Drawing on our history of open collaboration, we're teaming up with veritree for the tree-planting initiative as an added way to contribute to a better global society. While the cost of the project was not disclosed, the nobility of the exercise was well acclaimed. Trees are very crucial in combating climate change as they trap CO2 which are useful to plants in food manufacture.

Similarly, our planet, now threatened by climate change and biodiversity loss, also needs healing in a holistic way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are beginning to realize the intertwined nature between climate and biodiversity. Climate change aggravates biodiversity loss and weakens nature's capacity to absorb carbon, further hastening climate change. To break this vicious cycle requires addressing these two challenges simultaneously and with equal vigor.</p><p>Although there is growing consensus on this among scientists, policymakers, and financiers, globally financing for climate and biodiversity remains lopsided. Global climate financing reached $632 billion in 2019/2020, while biodiversity financing totaled just $124-$143 billion.</p><p>This contrast also exists in the deployment of green finance, where financing for climate efforts dwarfs that for biodiversity. According to the International Development Finance Club, of a total of $185 billion green finance commitments its members made in 2020,$179 billion or 96 percent went to climate finance, and only a meager $5.4 billion or 3 percent to biodiversity.</p><p>It is the same with green bonds issued in China. According to the China Green Bond Market Report 2020, of the $44 billion green bonds issued by Chinese entities in 2020, only about 5 percent were allotted for biodiversity or ecological protection, with the rest largely going to climate-related projects.</p><p>Many reasons drive this imbalance. In the climate space, greenhouse gas emissions can be credibly converted to CO2 equivalents, now a common currency to measure the contribution to climate change. This makes designing, financing, and monitoring climate-focused projects feasible. In contrast, quantifying ecosystem services and biodiversity (in either biophysical or monetary terms) is fiendishly difficult. Inevitably, this impedes investments that rely on quantifiable results.</p><p>Thanks to regulation to internalize the cost of carbon emissions, climate-focused projects (e.g., renewable energy development and energy efficiency) already have proven cash flows and attract sizable private investment. On the other hand, biodiversity still struggles to convert its benefits to human societies into financial revenue. Except for sustainable forestry, eco-tourism, mitigation banking, and a handful of other examples, \"bankable\" biodiversity projects are generally few and far between. This explains why most financing for biodiversity still comes from public sources.</p><p>Finally, biodiversity is often uniquely local, and projects designed for one place are therefore rarely directly replicable or scalable in other places. For their generally modest size and disparate nature, biodiversity projects don't conveniently fit the parameters of existing financial products and markets that favor standardization and economies of scale. So, biodiversity projects have a long way to go to take full advantage of modern financial markets' efficiency, reach and vast resources.</p><p>Nevertheless, ways to channel more financing into biodiversity conservation and bring about better alignment between climate and biodiversity do exist. To begin with, efforts to address climate and biodiversity must not undercut each other. For example, the land footprint of some clean energy infrastructure can be up to 12 times that of traditional energy sources, so where we place it is crucial. Without careful planning, well-intentioned clean energy infrastructure could endanger biodiversity and create additional financial burdens to restore impaired biodiversity.</p><p>We must step up efforts to explore the benefits of tackling both climate and biodiversity challenges with nature-based solutions. For example, restoring mangrove forests can deliver multiple benefits, from enhancing fish nurseries to storing carbon to mitigating the impacts of storm surges.</p><p>Encouragingly, China is jump-starting this effort by launching its National Mangrove Conservation and Restoration Action Plan, an initiative informed in part by a strategic study completed by the Paulson Institute and its partners. Under this plan, a total of 18,800 hectares of mangrove forests will be rehabilitated and planted by 2025.</p><p>In addition, China's national carbon emission trading system inaugurated in July 2021, and its planned expansion to cover eight high-emission sectors, has immense potential for scaling up nature-based solutions as it is expected to allow carbon credits generated from ecosystem-based projects to offset carbon emissions. Moreover, experts are also calling for the introduction of emissions allowance auctioning and allotment of a portion of the proceeds to ecosystem protection and restoration, which will help boost financing for biodiversity.</p><p>Seeking innovative ways to bridge the gap between biodiversity projects and existing financial markets is also imperative. For example, by combining replicable homogenous projects or bundling multiple heterogeneous projects into one diversified product, conservation projects may be structured into more marketable financial products, thus unlocking the vast financial resources that are increasingly looking for environmental, social and governance-themed investment opportunities. An example of this is the mangrove bonds that are gaining interest among financial institutions in and outside China.</p><p>Last but not least, exploring innovative mechanisms that help realize the economic value of ecosystem services by either leveraging existing markets or creating new ones must continue. For example, the New York Stock Exchange is exploring a new nature-based asset class in the form of Natural Asset Companies designed to capture and store nature's intrinsic and productive value.</p><p>Of course, for biodiversity finance to grow at scale, many other challenges must be addressed, such as strengthening the regulatory framework to value natural capital, building capacity, and implementing de-risking measures to incentivize private investment. In addition, reforming subsidies harmful to climate and biodiversity in the energy, agriculture, and fishery sectors and eliminating deforestation from soft commodity supply chains are essential to achieving climate and biodiversity goals more broadly.</p><p>Fundamentally, the climate and biodiversity crises are consequences of our current economic systems' failure to sufficiently value nature in all economic activities. To remedy this, we must transform our economies to recognize our natural capital's finite resources and services.</p><p>Healing our planet will take time and requires a holistic approach.

One hectare of mangroves can store 3,754 tons of carbon. However, if destroyed, degraded or lost, mangroves become sources of carbon dioxide. It is estimated that a total of 8,183 square kilometers of mangroves globally are restorable, securing future storage of an estimated 1.27 gigatons of CO2 equivalent. Mangroves also act as a natural coastal defense against storm surges, tsunamis, rising sea levels and erosion, preventing more than $65 billion in property damages and reducing flood risk to around 15 million people every year.</p><p>In recent years, spectacular and prolific mangrove ecosystems are highly recognized on the world stage. In November 2022, the 14th Meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands (COP 14) adopted the Wuhan Declaration, explicitly encouraging priority conservation and management of vulnerable ecosystems, including mangroves. The meeting also adopted a resolution on the establishment of the International Mangrove Center.</p><p>In addition, mangroves are included in the \"30X30\" target under the Convention of Biological Diversity, and are increasingly mentioned in the Nationally Determined Contributions submitted by parties to the Paris Agreement.</p><p>While actively promoting mangrove conservation on the world stage, China is also steadily advancing mangrove conservation domestically. As of November 2022, more than 55 percent of mangroves in China fell within protected areas, making it one of the few countries with a net gain of mangroves. There are five Ramsar sites in China that focus on mangrove conservation. In terms of progress in policymaking and legislation, China has launched an action plan for conservation and restoration of mangroves until 2025, and has integrated mangrove conservation and restoration in relevant laws and regulations, such as the Wetland Conservation Law and the Marine Conservation Law of the People's Republic of China. In addition, China and Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding on conservation of wetlands and mangroves in April this year, making mangroves a bridge for international cooperation.</p><p>Numerous good practices are being explored and implemented globally to address local environmental and development challenges through conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of mangroves. To address the increasing risk of storm surges due to climate change and the resulting salinization of farmland, the government of Bangladesh, with support from the Global Environment Facility and the United Nations Development Program, followed the \"Forest, Fish, Fruit\" model, reforesting the coastline with various species of mangroves in four coastal districts, interspersed with timber and fruit trees, while integrating fish nursery ponds between the trees in the area.</p><p>Under the project, around 9,650 hectares of new mangrove plantations made up of 10 key mangrove species were established and estimated to be able to absorb 965,000 tons of CO2 annually and reduce the impact of cyclones, flooding, coastal erosion, saline intrusion and sea-level rise. The project also supported innovative land management and livelihood diversification strategies for local stakeholders.</p><p>China is actively exploring the conservation, restoration, and wise use of mangroves to balance development and conservation. The Zhanjiang Mangrove Afforestation project, launched in 2015, planted four local mangroves on 380.4 hectares to restore the degraded mangrove ecosystem, and developed the first mangrove carbon trading project in China that complies with the Verified Carbon Standard and Climate, Community and Biodiversity Standards in 2019.</p><p>The following funding from blue carbon trading will be used for the management of mangrove restoration and community engagement.</p><p>Despite the progress made, long-term and consistent policy and financial support, as well as contribution and efforts from all sectors, are still required for mangrove conservation, restoration, and sustainable management. In addition to traditional public and philanthropic fundings, carbon markets, blue bonds, insurance-based investments, and blended financing models are emerging. Innovative conservation practices are also necessary, exploring paths and methods to realize the value of natural assets and providing alternative livelihoods for local communities to ensure sustainability of conservation and restoration projects.</p><p>Other effective area-based conservation measures which combine the wisdom of local communities can achieve long-term and positive conservation results and other benefits. Finally, social organizations and other sectors can play an important role in mangrove conservation, restoration, and sustainable management, as well as promoting international exchanges.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202307/24/64bda631a310a47825fff90d.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>YE HAI/FOR CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Jiang Xueyuan is a program officer at the Greenovation Hub.
