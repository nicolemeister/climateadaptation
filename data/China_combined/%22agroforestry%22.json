The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry launched Wednesday urgent plans for drought-prone regions and unveiled a five-year roadmap -- the 2025-2030 Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation Strategy -- outlining 23 measures focused on agriculture. </p><p>Key steps include promoting rainwater harvesting, reusing treated wastewater, shutting down illegal wells, expanding modern irrigation systems, and adopting a basin-based water management model. The plan also calls for boosting research on alternatives to chemical fertilizers, such as organic, organomineral, compost, and green manure options, while promoting the expansion of agroforestry and living windbreak practices. It further aims to protect and sustainably manage ecosystems, increase carbon sink areas, boost greenhouse gas sequestration, and reduce ecosystem-based emissions. The urgency behind these measures stems from an alarming decline in rainfall and water reserves this year. According to the General Directorate of Meteorology, T\u00fcrkiye's average rainfall in July dropped to 9.6 kg per square meter, far below the 1991-2020 average of 15.6 kg and last year's 32.7 kg. Several regions, including the Marmara, Aegean, Western Black Sea, Central Anatolia, and parts of the east and southeast, recorded deficits of more than 80 percent. The Marmara region suffered the steepest shortfall -- 95 percent below normal. \"This is the first time we have experienced such a severe meteorological drought,\" Halim Orta, an academic at Tekirdag Namik Kemal University and a wheat farmer in Thrace, told Xinhua on Thursday. \"Surface and groundwater levels are continuing to decline, intensifying the hydrological drought,\" he said, noting that water storage levels in the Marmara drinking water reservoirs fell below 1 percent in August, reaching critical lows. \"Ultimately, this leads to socioeconomic impacts -- people struggle to find enough water for living and hygiene, while reduced production causes food prices to rise and disrupts accessibility,\" Orta said. Agriculture experts warned the crisis is already cutting deep into harvests. Wheat production is forecast to fall by 15 percent this year, and sunflower yields by half, with canola losses of at least 30 percent. Irfan Donat, an agriculture editor of online news platform Food and Agriculture, said that record temperatures in the southern region have also caused sunburn damage to citrus crops such as lemons, oranges, and mandarins, with Adana province reaching 47.5 degrees Celsius -- the highest in the past 95 years. \"Calling it a disaster year would not be an exaggeration,\" Donat noted.

According to the Greek daily Kathimerini, blazes were reported simultaneously in Evia, Messinia in the Peloponnese, Kythera Island, and the Thessaloniki region in northern Greece. Firefighters are battling the flames on multiple fronts under extreme and dangerous conditions. </p><p>The most critical fire is burning out of control in Pissonas, a village located at the foothills of the Dirfi mountain range, northeast of Halkida, the capital of Evia. Authorities issued a 112 emergency alert, urging residents to evacuate toward the village of Afrati. Thick smoke and erratic winds have trapped several fire engines -- some of which have already been engulfed in flames -- while aerial firefighting efforts are hampered by poor visibility. Livestock facilities in the area have sustained significant damage.

The widespread fires come as Greece grapples with an extreme heatwave, with temperatures soaring beyond 42 degrees Celsius in many areas and peaking at 45. 8 degrees Celsius in Skala, Messinia -- one of the fire-affected regions -- according to the National Observatory of Athens. The intense heat has elevated wildfire risk across the country, stretching firefighting capabilities and placing critical infrastructure under severe pressure.

At the core of this drive is the Green Legacy Initiative (GLI), a homegrown tree-planting campaign launched in 2019 to address climate change, environmental degradation, and food security challenges at home and across the region. Now a central pillar of Ethiopia's development and climate adaptation strategy, the annual campaign kicked off on Thursday, with a broad goal of planting 7.5 billion seedlings during the June-September rainy season, pushing the cumulative total beyond 47.5 billion trees. </p><p>To institutionalize progress, Ethiopia took a landmark step in December 2024 when parliament unanimously ratified a proclamation establishing the Green Legacy Initiative and Degraded Land Rehabilitation Special Fund. The legislation earmarks 0.5 to 1 percent of the federal annual budget for restoring degraded landscapes through forestry and agroforestry, with regional states contributing based on capacity. According to the parliamentary motion, the fund is expected to deliver broad social, economic, and ecological benefits while attracting greater international cooperation. Institutionalizing the GLI has elevated Ethiopia's leadership in environmental restoration, serving as a regional and global example for long-term financing and sustainability of climate initiatives. According to a recent study by the Ethiopian Ministry of Agriculture, the GLI has \"significantly reduced\" soil erosion, once a major threat. Previously, an estimated 1.9 billion tonnes of fertile soil were lost annually. Currently, average losses have dropped to 208 million tonnes thanks to the GLI, helping preserve farmland and prevent siltation in dams, according to data from the ministry. The government credits the GLI with strengthening food security, particularly through the planting of fruit trees that contribute to household income, nutrition, and community resilience. The United Nations (UN) also recognized the GLI's contribution to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, targeting zero hunger, through planting high-value fruit trees that enhance food availability. Ethiopia's GLI also aligns with more global climate goals, including SDG 13, which urges urgent climate action. The UN has praised the initiative's \"immense contribution\" to adaptation efforts and its alignment with the Paris Agreement, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the African Union's Agenda 2063. The GLI is also inspiring regional action. Nigerian Vice President Kashim Shettima, who joined this year's tree-planting in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, hailed it as \"an inclusive, impactful, and visionary model,\" urging African countries to follow Ethiopia's lead. Shettima also called the initiative a practical and inspiring response to the climate crisis, with wide-ranging benefits for land restoration, agricultural productivity, and job creation. Experts and policymakers argue that through the GLI, Ethiopia is demonstrating that large-scale, nationally-led climate action is both achievable and essential for securing a stable future in the Horn of Africa and beyond.

UNEP-IEMP Program Manager Wang Guoqin highlighted the project's potential to regenerate the Nzoia River basin and enhance its resilience to climate-related shocks while curbing biodiversity loss. The project will showcase China's expertise in ecological restoration through bamboo while facilitating skills and technology transfer to foster a vibrant bamboo industry in Keny, said Wang, adding that local farmers and fishermen will receive training on establishing bamboo nurseries, planting, and managing the trees until maturity, which will help stabilize the riverbank ecosystem, sequester carbon, and provide wildlife habitats. Judith Nyunja, a senior scientist from the Wildlife Research and Training Institute, noted that large-scale bamboo cultivation offers a cost-effective and sustainable approach to managing recurrent floods that have exacerbated poverty, displacement, and disease outbreaks in the area. Kenya's national bamboo policy aligns with the government's ambitious goal of planting 15 billion trees by 2032, which aims to restore degraded forests and freshwater bodies, said Nyunja, emphasizing that this initiative will significantly contribute to achieving that objective.

The 22-year-old, a native of a serene village in northern Kenya, braved the chilly dawn weather to race along the 27.1-km Chinese-built Nairobi Expressway, competing against both local and international long-distance runners. Bundi knew his chances of winning the 21-km half marathon were slim, but the thought of running alongside well-known athletes of long-distance races was irresistible. \"This is my first time to participate in the Nairobi City Marathon,\" Bundi said. </p><p>\"Surprisingly, I finished the race without any major hiccup. I feel energized to run similar ones in the future.\" Themed \"I Love Nairobi-Run the City You Love,\" this year's race attracted over 17,000 elite and amateur runners from more than 70 countries and regions, including more than 13,000 Kenyans and 300 Chinese nationals. Ruth Kemunto, a bubbly amateur runner from the western Kenyan county of Kisii, was in her element after completing the 10-km race, sweating profusely but rehydrating with mineral water. Participating in the annual competitive race has been her personal goal, driven by the quest for physical wellness that many of her peers have ignored in the relentless pursuit of career mobility and financial success. \"Finishing the 10-km race triggered some renewal in my whole mental, physical and emotional realm. Running is fun and therapeutic. I am confident I will compete in the 21-km race next year,\" said Kemunto. Since May 2022, when the inaugural Nairobi City Marathon was held, the subsequent editions have grown in stature, prestige, diversity, and impact on the wider society. The prize money has also been increased, with this year's full marathon winners awarded 3.5 million Kenyan shillings (about 27,100 U.S. dollars), and half marathon winners in both male and female categories taking home 2.5 million Kenyan shillings. In addition, the race elevated the sustainability agenda through partnerships with the United Nations Environment Program, Stockholm Environment Institute, and the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry. Steve Zhao, chief executive officer of Moja Expressway, the operator of the Nairobi Expressway, said the thoroughfare has integrated climate-smart practices to boost urban greening initiatives in the capital. The electronic toll collection system adopted by the Nairobi Expressway has helped reduce carbon emissions while enabling motorists to save time, fuel, and travel costs, Zhao said. He added that Moja Expressway supported the installation of air quality monitors at five stations that acted as key turning points for the four race categories during the Nairobi City Marathon. Park Jun-hee, a South Korean tourist visiting Kenya for the first time, said that taking part in the marathon provided him with a chance to view Nairobi's skyline and its scenic landscape. He was impressed by the modern infrastructure in the Kenyan capital, as well as the warmth and hospitality of the local athletes he competed against. Zhang Dongqiang, who contributed his expertise to the construction of the Nairobi Expressway, said he has participated in all four editions of the Nairobi City Marathon, and always marvels at the transformative impact of Chinese-built infrastructure projects in the capital. \"It makes me happy every time I hear locals say it is a great road,\" Zhang said, adding that he looks forward to stronger cooperation between China and Kenya.

According to news reporting originating in Xining, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Current research primarily focuses on exploring and developing innovative substrates for cultivating , aiming to address substrate shortages and the continuous rise in production costs. This study uses (oak) sawdust (OS) as a control to evaluate the potential of (KP), (seabuckthorn) pruning (HRP), and (goji) pruning (LBP) in the cultivation of by measuring parameters such as mycelium growth, yield, protein, fat, fiber, amino acids, soluble sugars, and organic acids.\" </p><p><br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research, \"Furthermore, principal component analysis and official script function analysis were used to investigate the influence of the matrix formula ratio on the nutritional values of shiitake mushrooms. Results showed that the average duration to complete stages 2 and 3 of mycelial growth on 10% KP substrates significantly decreased compared to the OS group by 11.0 and 10.7 days, respectively. The weight of mushrooms produced from all agro-forest waste substrates was significantly lower than that of the control group, decreasing by 18.96 to 53.88%. The average mushroom weight for KP groups ranged from 235.37 g/kg to 252.27 g/kg, which was statistically higher than that of the LBP treatments, which ranged from 143.56 g/kg to 165.96 g/kg. However, the protein content in the 10% LBP and 10% HRP groups was significantly higher than that of the control, with increases of 4.69 and 12.89%, respectively, and fiber content also improved, increasing by 3.98 to 12.59%. Furthermore, the content of sweet-tasting amino acids in the 10% KP and 20% KP groups significantly increased compared to the OS group (by 34.86 and 144.92%, respectively). The 30% LBP and 10% KP-10% LBP-10% HRP groups exhibited higher glucose values compared to the OS (increased by 118.71 and 72.26%, respectively). Interestingly, the addition of LBP and KP to the substrates promoted the synthesis of acetic acid in shiitake mushrooms, while this organic acid was not detected in the OS. In summary, shiitake mushrooms cultured in 20% KP, 10% LBP, or 10% KP-10% LBP-10% HRP demonstrated significantly better overall performance. This approach not only reduces operational costs by at least 1,680 RMB but also contributes to environmental sustainability by diverting 2,400 kg of agro-forest waste from landfills.

Understanding the patterns of wild boar crop damage is important for properly managing these conflicts, and can improve the effectiveness of existing prevention strategies.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Provincial Special Project of Wild Boars for Prevention and Control of ASF by State Forestry and Grassland Administration, Forestry Research Project of Guizhou Province, Guizhou Provincial Science and Technology Development Project. <br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from Guizhou Normal University, \"We collected a comprehensive dataset from Guizhou Province, China, from 2017 to 2020, obtained from motion-sensitive camera monitoring, transect surveys, interview surveys, and wildlife management administrations. These data include 3,156 records of wild boar activity in natural areas and 576 records of crop damage. We applied a multi-scale MaxEnt model to map the regional distribution of wild boar habitat suitability and crop damage risk in Guizhou Province and focused on the role of habitat suitability in wild boar crop damage from a regional perspective. Wild boar habitat suitability exhibits a divergent pattern, expanding from the central area of Guizhou Province to the eastern, northern, southern, and northwestern regions, with a gradually increasing trend. Suitability of habitat for wild boar was associated with composite topographic index, mean coldest season temperature, isothermality, Shannon diversity index, edge density, and distance to village roads.

According to news reporting originating from Beijing, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Limiting adverse consequences of mining activities requires ecosystem restoration efforts, whose arrangement around mining areas is poorly designed. It is unclear, however, where best to locate ecological projects to enhance ecosystem services cost-effectively.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from the China University of Geosciences, \"To answer this question, we conducted an optimized ecological restoration project planning by the Resource Investment Optimization System (RIOS) model to identify the restoration priority areas in the Pingshuo Opencast Coal Mine region in Shanxi Province. This region features notable mining activity, agricultural land use, and urban development. We found that the land use changes were primarily influenced by human activities such as mining and urbanization, as well as ecological interventions from 1986 to 2022, during which the area of industrial and construction land continuously expanded. The RIOS model was configured using input data such as land use, digital elevation models (DEM), and biophysical coefficients. Ecological restoration objectives were selected, including Erosion Control for Drinking Water Quality, Erosion Control for Reservoir Maintenance, Nutrient Retention, and Baseflow. Investment optimization scenario simulations revealed that over 90% of ecological projects in the Pingshuo Opencast Coal Mine are distributed in the low-slope areas (0\u00b0-15\u00b0). Four types of technical reclamation and ecological restoration projects, i.e., agroforestry, grass strips, riparian management, and terracing, exhibit strong preferences for specific locations. Riparian management and agroforestry tend to be distributed on soil dumps; terracing and grass strips tend to be distributed in the upstream agricultural areas of rivers and junctions of watershed gullies and slopes. The model prioritized areas based on ecological restoration goals and stakeholder interests, optimizing locations that would maximize ecological benefits while addressing the objectives. Moreover, depending on the different goals of ecological restoration in the mining area, investment plans that maximize benefits for stakeholders should range between 3 and 6 million dollars. While the restoration strategies in this study were designed for the Pingshuo region, they hold potential for other mining areas with similar biophysical conditions, surrounding ecosystems, and mining scales. The RIOS model adjusts its recommendations based on specific input data, making it adaptable and broadly applicable to other mining area. The results of this study positively contribute to alleviating the conflict between ecosystem protection and socioeconomic development in mining areas, scientifically regulating ecological restoration activities, and enhancing ecosystem services.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"Our results provide evidence that ecological restoration interventions contribute measurably to restore the degraded ecosystems in the mining areas.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Optimal allocation of technical reclamation and ecological restoration for a cost-effective solution in Pingshuo Opencast Coal Mine area of China.

According to Dennis Otieno Ochuodho, a senior researcher at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology in Kenya, a project partner, the bamboo agroforestry project offers an effective, nature-based solution to climate-induced flooding. Ochuodho said the project aims to expand research, training, and technology transfer in bamboo farming, restore the degraded Nzoia River basin, and enhance food security through mixed cropping systems. A large-scale bamboo plantation, he added, will protect native species, serve as a carbon sink, and supply raw materials for herbal medicine, supplements, and roofing. Despite her advanced age, Alice Makhulo's passion for cultivating bamboo on her seven-acre farm near a swamp remains undiminished, thanks to the economic and environmental benefits she has reaped from the trees.

As part of the China-funded bamboo agroforestry initiative, more than 200 farmers will receive training in sustainable bamboo cultivation, which also includes a 25-hectare demonstration site to showcase ecological restoration through the planting of this iconic tree species. Guoqin Wang, program manager at UNEP-IEMP, emphasized that by stabilizing the Nzoia River banks, the project not only curtails flooding but also enhances local livelihoods by combining food crops with bamboo and creating natural products for sale. Leveraging Chinese bamboo technology and expertise, the initiative aims to regenerate degraded landscapes, conserve water sources, and improve climate resilience for river communities, Wang added. Symprose Anyango, coordinator of Eco Green Kenya, a conservation lobby, noted that communities along the Nzoia River have embraced the project, particularly women, saying that \"bamboo has in particular been of huge benefit to women who suffer most from climate change. They are using bamboo to revive traditional weaving and earn an additional income.

However, the country's recent policy shifts reveal a contradiction. Earlier this year, China set an annual quota of one metric tonne of pangolin scales for medical use despite the global ban on the trade.

The ambitious plan, themed \"Building Resilient and Sustainable Agri-Food Systems,\" serves as a blueprint for transforming the agriculture sector to achieve food security, sustainable land use, and economic development. </p><p>Speaking at the launch Friday, Minister of Agriculture and Animal Resources Mark Cyubahiro Bagabe emphasized the transformative potential of PSTA5, calling it a unique approach to agricultural development. \"PSTA5 is unique because it is centered on agri-food systems-that is the central pivot,\" he said. Bagabe urged Rwanda's youth to play a pivotal role in implementing the plan, highlighting the integration of advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. \"When you talk about using technology tools like the Internet of Things and AI to move agriculture forward, I can tell you we are together. I see young people as the pillar of productivity,\" he said. He also stressed the importance of translating the strategy into tangible results. \"We must chip into this strategic plan and ensure this blueprint is translated into actions,\" he added. Bagabe also emphasized that the success of the strategy lies in collective action to ensure resilient, sustainable, and equitable agri-food systems for all. PSTA5 focuses on modernizing agriculture and animal resource production, fostering inclusive markets, and creating jobs within agriculture and food systems. The five-year strategy aims to address pressing challenges such as low productivity, food insecurity, and limited commercialization in the sector while enhancing resilience to climate shocks like droughts and floods. It aligns with national priorities and global frameworks, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). PSTA5 incorporates lessons from its predecessor, PSTA4, which made significant progress in areas such as marshland development, agroforestry, and irrigation infrastructure. Challenges like climate change and limited investment in agriculture, however, persist, necessitating further innovation and funding. The expected impact of PSTA5 is transformative. The plan targets an average annual agricultural growth rate of 6.5 percent, increasing export revenues to 1.54 billion U.S. dollars and creating over 644,000 off-farm jobs in agri-food systems, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Animal Resources. The strategy also aims to empower 72 percent of women in agriculture and improve food and nutrition security nationwide. With the launch of PSTA5, Rwanda has reaffirmed its commitment to driving inclusive and sustainable agricultural development. Rwanda's agricultural sector remains vital to the country's economy, with about 69 percent of households engaged in farming and around 400,000 people employed in agri-food systems, according to the Fifth Population and Housing Census (2022).

Mieke Bourne, scientist at the Center for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry and former Regreening Africa program manager, said the initiative is significant because it brings together community, research, development partners, government and private sector to collaborate, work together and learn from one another. edithmutethya@chinadaily. com. cn"]}, {"relevance_score": 10, "title": "World Bank, FAO launch climate resilience project in South Sudan amid floods", "published": "2024-07-24", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">JUBA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Sudan, the World Bank, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) said on Tuesday that they have stepped up efforts to build farmers' climate resilience amid flooding and other disaster risks.

The mother of two is an early adopter of conservation agriculture, which promotes soil health through minimal tillage alongside organic methods of controlling crop pests and diseases to boost yield. Ever since she started practicing zero tillage, intercropping and application of compost manure, her one-acre farm has produced enough to feed her family and sell surplus at local markets. \"I have been a farmer for two decades and used to grapple with depressed harvests, but when I embraced conservation agriculture and organic weed and pest control methods, total crop yield shot up,\" Mogambi told Xinhua at her farm on Monday. </p><p>Smallholder farmers in Nakuru County, one of Kenya's breadbaskets, have not been spared the challenges posed by a warming planet, including voracious pests, diseases, market volatility and shrinking arable land. The Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research (CGIAR), through its Initiative on Diversification in East and Southern Africa, has nevertheless assisted these farmers in deploying technologies and innovations that enhance climate resilience, promoting food and nutritional security. In Kenya, the initiative dubbed \"Ukama Ustawi,\" which translates to \"partnership and progress,\" is being implemented in Nakuru and Kenya's eastern counties of Embu and Makueni. Mogambi's farm has served as a demonstration site for various innovative practices, including zero tillage, stripping, intercropping, crop rotation, mulching and agroforestry. Since adopting these climate-smart farming techniques, Mogambi has reported a threefold increase in maize, legume, kale, tuber and fruit harvests, improving both her family's nutrition and income. \"Currently, I am able to harvest 36 bags of maize and 20 tons of silage, and before embracing conservation agriculture, I used to harvest a maximum of seven bags of maize. Now I am proud to say farming is my full-time employer,\" Mogambi said. Boaz Waswa, a soil scientist with the Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT), a member of CGIAR, said that indigenous knowledge and innovation are key to boosting the resilience of local smallholder farmers. According to Waswa, these farmers should be empowered to increase crop diversification, zero tillage and the use of organic manure and drip irrigation to boost crop yield and combat hunger, poverty and malnutrition. \"When we diversify crops, households will have more nutritious food and better incomes. We also need to apply agroecological solutions that improve soil health.\" He said that the deployment of these climate-smart innovations has also been gender-inclusive, ensuring that women and youth farmers are empowered to cope with climatic shocks. The \"Ukama Usawa\" initiative, which is being implemented in 12 African countries, including Kenya, has enhanced yield stability at the smallholder level, boosting the fight against rural hunger and poverty, Waswa added. On the southern edge of Nakuru County, where Serah Ndung'us two-acre farm is located, a variety of crops including maize, beans, kales, potatoes and avocado trees create a green foliage that grabs the attention of passersby. The middle-aged farmer is a champion of sustainable practices, including agroforestry, conservation agriculture, intercropping and mulching, that have guaranteed her bumper harvests in any given season. Ndung'u said that smallholder farmers are keen to transition from conventional methods of growing crops that have proved unsustainable. Skills gained through the initiative have enabled her to leverage climate-resilient innovations to boost the production of cereals, legumes, tubers and vegetables. \"Sometimes it can turn very dry in my locality, but through mulching, drip irrigation, and minimum tillage, I am able to retain soil moisture on my farm and grow different crop varieties to maturity,\" Ndung'u said.

An apple-soybean intercropping system was selected as the research object, and two mulch types [straw mulch (M1) and plastic mulch (M2)] and four maximum irrigation levels [no irrigation (W0), 55% (W1), 70% (W2), and 85% (W3) field capacity (Fc)] were tested. No mulch together with no irrigation was the control treatment (CK). The results showed that there was no photosynthetic siesta phenomenon in the intercropping system, and the daily variations of the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and transpiration rate (Tr) were unimodal. The mean values for Pn, Tr, and leaf photosynthetic efficiency (PUE) of the apple and soybean under the M2 treatment were generally higher than under the M1 treatment, whereas Tr and PUE increased as the amount of irrigation increased. In 2017-2018, the maximum mean Pn values for both apple and soybean were observed under the M2W2 treatment, whereas in 2019, they were observed under the M2W3 treatment. The Pn, Tr, and leaf intrinsic water use efficiency (WUEi) of soybean correlated positively with the distance from the trees, whereas PUE correlated negatively with it. Mulch and water replenishment increased apple shoot growth and the height, leaf area index, and yield of soybean, especially under plastic mulch.

Notably, correlations between the abundances of sensitive amplicon sequence variants (sASVs) for different karst vegetation types and EMF varied in distinct network modules, being positive in module 1 and negative in module 2. Moreover, the relative abundance of keystone taxa in fungal and protistan communities provided greater contributions to EMF than the bacterial communities.

In an interview with Xinhua, Mbambo, 41, said she uses about 2 tons of wood per months for cooking and to perform other domestic chores that need energy such as ironing. \"There is no other means at my disposal to cook because I cannot afford to buy electricity cooking gas. So, I have to cut down trees in the forest near where I am renting a one room,\" she added. </p><p>According to Mbambo, she used to use electricity in the past even if she had no means to pay for it because BPC, Botswana's sole power utility, had not switched from post-paid to pre-paid electricity. Pre-paid electricity means a customer can only be allocated electricity according to what one has paid for. The payment is done before the customer has used the electricity, said Mbambo, adding that many are failing to do so. Tiny Moloi is a neighbor to Mbambo and in most cases they go to the forest together in search for firewood \"because like my friend (Mbambo), I cannot afford to buy the pre-paid electricity,\" she said. Moloi said she needs at least 1.5 tons of wood every month in order to meet all her energy needs. She tried to substitute electricity with liquefied gas and illuminated paraffin, but it proved expensive for her. A single unit of electricity costs more than one pula while liquefied gas is valued at more than two pulas, according to a recent survey conducted by the Department of Consumer Affairs, which falls under Botswana's Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry. Mbambo needs 500 pula (about 38 U.S. dollars) per month while Moloi needs 300 pula (about 24 U.S. dollars). Mbambo has five children and Moloi has three. The bigger the family, the higher electricity expense there are. Dumezweni Mthimkhulu, Botswanan Minister of Environment and Tourism, admitted in an interview with Xinhua that residents account 20,000 hectares of deforestation each year in Francistown. \"We are deeply concerned by the alarming rate of deforestation and forest degradation in our country, driven by unsustainable land-use practices, illegal logging, agricultural expansion and infrastructure development,\" he said. Mthimkhulu said this destruction not only threatens biodiversity and ecosystems but also exacerbates climate change, leading to adverse impacts on weather patterns, water cycles, and human health. \"We call upon residents, civil society, and the private sector to prioritize the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of forests,\" said Mthimkhulu. He said Botswana is doing everything within its power to strengthen protected area networks, implementing land-use planning and zoning regulations, promoting agroforestry and sustainable agriculture practices, and supporting community-based forest management initiatives. In addition, Botswana has embarked on promoting clean energy through installation of solar farms with a view of making electricity accessibility cheaper and more convenient to the residents. Under Botswanan law, anyone who cuts down trees and collects other forest products without a license risks arrest and a fine of between 5,000 pula and 500,000 pula (357 U.S. dollars and 35,714 U.S. dollars). But little has been done in terms of enforcing the laws protecting forests because \"it is difficult to enforce a law when the government is the one failing to provide the amenities to its people,\" said Mthimkhulu. According to an analysis by the World Bank, the forestry sector contributes an average of between 4 percent and 19 percent to the gross domestic product (GDP) of seven member states in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region, including Botswana.

The sharing of tea between the two world leaders was a symbol of the exchanges between civilizations and the values of harmony, respect and friendship that this social ritual implies. This seemingly simple act of sharing tea is something that takes place millions of times every day throughout the world. Tea, after all, is the world's most popular beverage after water. Tea also originated in China and is one of its most significant contributions to human civilization. The tea and context of the setting where the two leaders took their refreshment also celebrated Chinese civilization through music, art and aesthetics. Thus rather than a \"clash of civilizations,\" the act of sharing tea can pave the way for a \"confluence of civilizations\".It doesn't matter if we are state leaders or ordinary folk, when we share tea we are opening ourselves up to the possibility of meaningful dialogue and exchange. This \"civility\" is indeed one of the hallmarks of \"civilization\".</p><p>The Global Civilization Initiative was proposed by President Xi in March 2023. Through this initiative, and the related Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, China is outlining a plan for harmony and cooperation between civilizations. The Global Civilization Initiative advocates respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity, the importance of inheritance and innovation of civilizations, and robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation.</p><p>Tea is a part of the story of exchanges between civilizations. May 21 is marked by the United Nations as International Tea Day. This is a day set aside to celebrate the tea plant \u2014 Camellia sinensis \u2014 and the people whose livelihoods depend upon it and for everyone else who enjoys this most intoxicating elixir. It is, therefore, very appropriate that we take some time to consider the relationship between tea and civilization.</p><p>With regards to art, literature and philosophy, tea has been a major inspiration for many artists in China and beyond. Lu Yu, a Chinese writer and tea master, completed the Classic of Tea during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Lu Yu's work is considered one of the earliest guides to tea cultivation, preparation and appreciation in Chinese history. The Classic of Tea is the beginning of what we might call a specific \"tea civilization\".</p><p>Later this body of work and the refined practice of tea drinking became the famous Tea Ceremony or chanoyu of Japan. Tea also provided the fuel for creativity of many a great intellect beyond China. For example, Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) is an English writer best known for his influential literary works and his role in compiling one of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language. It is well known that Johnson was a ravenous imbiber of tea. Johnson's fondness for tea is evident in his writings, where he sometimes humorously remarked on the pleasures of tea drinking and the social atmosphere it fostered. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is widely considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. He also made important contributions to what would become International Relations theory. His breakfast is recorded as consisting of \"a cup of tea and a pipe of tobacco\". As a mild stimulant and refreshing beverage, tea has played a positive role in shaping civilizational development and facilitating the exchanges between civilizations.</p><p>Tea and humanity are also entangled in what we can refer to as an ecological civilization. The concept of ecological civilization, also a crucial component of the Global Civilization Initiative, reflects China's commitment to achieving sustainable development while preserving environmental quality and ensuring the well-being of present and future generations in China and beyond.

The region, with immense potential for future growth in agricultural production and exports, holds a crucial position in China's strategy for diversifying agricultural imports. Countries such as Brazil are highly dependent on imports for fertilizers and seeds. For instance, Brazil relies on the international market for 85 percent of its fertilizers, with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers reaching dependency levels of 95.7 percent, 72 percent, and 96.4 percent, respectively. Looking ahead, to enhance the stability and reliability of China's agricultural supply chains in South America, it is essential to support relevant enterprises in establishing coordinated supply chains in the region. The nation should strengthen investment and trade cooperation across the entire agricultural industry chain with countries such as Brazil and Argentina, particularly in fertilizers and seeds.</p><p>Third, the Black Sea and Central Asia should be identified as key regions for diversifying agricultural imports. The Black Sea region, including Russia, and Central Asia, including Kazakhstan, still possess significant potential for agricultural production and trade growth. Chinese businesses should sign long-term agreements in conducting trade and investment cooperation within such regions.

The sharing of tea between the two world leaders was a symbol of the exchanges between civilizations and the values of harmony, respect and friendship that this social ritual implies. This seemingly simple act of sharing tea is something that takes place millions of times every day throughout the world. Tea, after all, is the world's most popular beverage after water. Tea also originated in China and is one of its most significant contributions to human civilization. The tea and context of the setting where the two leaders took their refreshment also celebrated Chinese civilization through music, art and aesthetics. Thus rather than a \"clash of civilizations,\" the act of sharing tea can pave the way for a \"confluence of civilizations\".It doesn't matter if we are state leaders or ordinary folk, when we share tea we are opening ourselves up to the possibility of meaningful dialogue and exchange. This \"civility\" is indeed one of the hallmarks of \"civilization\".</p><p>The Global Civilization Initiative was proposed by President Xi in March 2023. Through this initiative, and the related Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, China is outlining a plan for harmony and cooperation between civilizations. The Global Civilization Initiative advocates respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity, the importance of inheritance and innovation of civilizations, and robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation.</p><p>Tea is a part of the story of exchanges between civilizations. May 21 is marked by the United Nations as International Tea Day. This is a day set aside to celebrate the tea plant \u2014 Camellia sinensis \u2014 and the people whose livelihoods depend upon it and for everyone else who enjoys this most intoxicating elixir. It is, therefore, very appropriate that we take some time to consider the relationship between tea and civilization.</p><p>With regards to art, literature and philosophy, tea has been a major inspiration for many artists in China and beyond. Lu Yu, a Chinese writer and tea master, completed the Classic of Tea during the Tang Dynasty (618-907). Lu Yu's work is considered one of the earliest guides to tea cultivation, preparation and appreciation in Chinese history. The Classic of Tea is the beginning of what we might call a specific \"tea civilization\".</p><p>Later this body of work and the refined practice of tea drinking became the famous Tea Ceremony or chanoyu of Japan. Tea also provided the fuel for creativity of many a great intellect beyond China. For example, Samuel Johnson (1709-1784) is an English writer best known for his influential literary works and his role in compiling one of the most comprehensive dictionaries of the English language. It is well known that Johnson was a ravenous imbiber of tea. Johnson's fondness for tea is evident in his writings, where he sometimes humorously remarked on the pleasures of tea drinking and the social atmosphere it fostered. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) is widely considered one of the most important figures in modern philosophy. He also made important contributions to what would become International Relations theory. His breakfast is recorded as consisting of \"a cup of tea and a pipe of tobacco\". As a mild stimulant and refreshing beverage, tea has played a positive role in shaping civilizational development and facilitating the exchanges between civilizations.</p><p>Tea and humanity are also entangled in what we can refer to as an ecological civilization. The concept of ecological civilization, also a crucial component of the Global Civilization Initiative, reflects China's commitment to achieving sustainable development while preserving environmental quality and ensuring the well-being of present and future generations in China and beyond.

(People's Daily Online/Wang Wangwang)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The all-encompassing approach to food was raised by Chinese President Xi Jinping when he worked in Fujian province. Xi proposed to \"attach as much importance to sea areas as to cultivated land, and as much to marine development as to food production, so as to extend the tentacles of speeding up economic development from land to sea.\" He proposed the \"Fuzhou at Sea\" and \"Fujian at Sea\" initiatives to seek economic development from the sea.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Over the past 30 years, Fujian has earnestly implemented the all-encompassing approach to food, harnessing its abundant natural resources found in mountains and seas to create a diverse food supply system tailored to its unique geographical advantages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This approach has yielded remarkable results. The province overfulfills grain production tasks assigned by the central government every year. The output of livestock and poultry has seen a significant increase, with the total meat production reaching 3.11 million tons last year, a 250 percent increase compared to early 1990s. In particular, poultry production surged by 13 times.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The per capita share of aquatic food in Fujian province stands at over 200 kilograms, one of the highest across China.

Her movement is training women farmers who traditionally have no access to education, explaining their rights and financing women-led agricultural projects.</p><p>Across West Africa, women usually don't own land because it is expected that when they marry, they leave the community. But when they move to their husbands' homes, they are not given land because they are not related by blood.</p><p>Sonko grew up watching her mother struggle after her father died, with young children to support.</p><p>\"If she had land, she could have supported us,\" she recalled, her normally booming voice now tender. Instead, Sonko had to marry young, abandon her studies and leave her ancestral home.</p><p>After moving to her husband's town at age 19, Sonko and several other women convinced a landowner to rent to them a small plot of land in return for part of their harvest. They planted fruit trees and started a market garden. Five years later, when the trees were full of papayas and grapefruit, the owner kicked them off.</p><p>The experience marked Sonko.</p><p>\"This made me fight so that women can have the space to thrive and manage their rights,\" she said.

Saltwater is invading her rice paddies bordering the tidal estuary and mangroves, caused by rising sea levels.

She bellowed out the names of rice - some hundreds of years old, named after prominent women farmers, passed from generation to generation - and the women echoed with what they call it in their villages.</p><p>This preservation of indigenous rice varieties is not only key to adapting to climate change but also about emphasizing the status of women as the traditional guardians of seeds.</p><p>\"Seeds are wholly feminine and give value to women in their communities,\" Sonko said. \"That's why we're working on them, to give them more confidence and responsibility in agriculture.\"</p><p>The knowledge of hundreds of seeds and how they respond to different growing conditions has been vital in giving women a more influential role in communities.</p><p>Sonko claimed to have a seed for every condition including too rainy, too dry and even those more resistant to salt for the mangroves.</p><p>Last year, she produced 2 tons of rice on her half-hectare plot with none of the synthetic pesticides or fertilizer that are heavily subsidized in Senegal. The yield was more than double that of plots with full use of chemical products in a 2017 U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization project in the same region.</p><p>\"Our seeds are resilient,\" Sonko said, sifting through rice-filled clay pots designed to preserve seeds for decades. \"Conventional seeds do not resist climate change and are very demanding.

Yet, financing for climate adaptation is a drop in the ocean of what is needed.</p><p>Nyambuga said the global approach, which seems fixated on mitigation, neglects Africa's pressing need for adaptation financing and loss and damage compensation.

This fund was agreed in principle at the previous summit as a vehicle to help low-income countries that are most exposed to climate change impacts, and was featured prominently in the Nairobi Declaration.</p><p>The financial commitments announced by several countries at COP28, with pledges totaling more than $700 million, reflect a glimmer of hope for developing countries, said Yakubu, a climate activist from Ghana.</p><p>\"The first round of pledges will clearly be insufficient to support countries in Africa and around the world on the front line of the climate crisis. However, the success of this fund will depend on the speed and scale at which funds start flowing to people in need,\" he said.</p><p>Another area that received much attention at COP28 was Africa's contribution to the voluntary carbon market, he said. This market provides a route for Africa to financially benefit from its natural resources and assets which remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide other environmental services to the planet.</p><p>\"COP28 achieved good progress toward realizing the win-win opportunities from the carbon markets.

Ethiopia and Somalia have experienced five failed rainy seasons since late 2020, which have displaced 1.4 million Somalis and killed 3.8 million livestock.</p><p>This period of extreme drought was followed by the El Nino-induced heavy rains and flash flooding that killed hundreds in Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia last year, the United Nations said. The deluge swamped more than 1,000 hectares of cropland in Ethiopia and Somalia, challenging the agricultural economies in the two countries where more than 65 percent of the population relies on farming and much of the region's farmland relies on rainfall for irrigation.</p><p>Kilion Nyambuga, a research and planning expert involved in the resettlement of slum dwellers in Kenya, said Africa is responsible for only a fraction of global emissions but is suffering disproportionately from climate change.</p><p>\"The fact that Africa is continuously facing the extreme effects of climate change despite the continent's low emissions is harming food security, ecosystems and economies while fueling displacement, migration and worsening the threat of conflict over dwindling resources,\" he said.</p><p>Emissions of carbon dioxide per person in Africa in 2021 were 1.04 metric tons, standing in stark contrast to the global average, which is more than four times as high, said a report published by the World Meteorological Organization in September.</p><p>The report, called \"State of the Climate in Africa 2022\", said the rate of temperature increase across Africa has accelerated in recent decades, with weather and climate-related hazards becoming more severe.

This fund was agreed in principle at the previous summit as a vehicle to help low-income countries that are most exposed to climate change impacts, and was featured prominently in the Nairobi Declaration.</p><p>The financial commitments announced by several countries at COP28, with pledges totaling more than $700 million, reflect a glimmer of hope for developing countries, said Yakubu, a climate activist from Ghana.</p><p>\"The first round of pledges will clearly be insufficient to support countries in Africa and around the world on the front line of the climate crisis. However, the success of this fund will depend on the speed and scale at which funds start flowing to people in need,\" he said.</p><p>Another area that received much attention at COP28 was Africa's contribution to the voluntary carbon market, he said. This market provides a route for Africa to financially benefit from its natural resources and assets which remove carbon from the atmosphere and provide other environmental services to the planet.</p><p>\"COP28 achieved good progress toward realizing the win-win opportunities from the carbon markets.

More than a quarter of the world's population relies on wood to cook their food and even more use non-wood forest products for food, feed and medicines. Investments in forestry and agroforestry will build more diversified and resilient local economies. New investment must also be scaled up in areas such as climate finance, green recovery programmes and private investment support. Getting finance to small-scale producers is essential. We cannot rely on a \"trickle down\" effect. Instead, we need new solutions that meet their needs and reduce inequalities. We will only achieve results if we stop working in silos.", "Agrifood systems transformation and forest protection, restoration and sustainable management must go hand in hand. Today's environmental, health and social crises call for urgent action for a sustainable recovery. Promoting a model where forests and agriculture mutually support each other requires increased political, financial and technical investment. More than 20 developing countries have already shown that it is possible. Recent data confirms that deforestation has been successfully reduced in South America and Asia. Among the means for achieving this are national policies that promote sustainable local markets, a green and circular economy; repurposed agricultural subsidies; setting clear national targets for sustainable agricultural development and forest protection and sustainable use; and secure land tenure and rights for farmers in agroforestry landscapes to use forests and trees. FAO is dedicated to working towards more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable agrifood systems and promotes the contribution of forests to this process, through conservation, restoration and sustainable use. But we must do more to empower rural farmers, smallholders, women and youth, Indigenous Peoples and local communities. They are the guardians of almost half of the world's forests and farmlands. This week, the World Forestry Congress, taking place in Seoul, Republic of Korea, brings together representatives from five continents and offers a unique opportunity to focus on impactful solutions towards building a green, healthy and resilient future with forests, and achieving the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. Scaling up solutions based on forests and trees can unlock their potential to help mitigate the economic disruptions and food insecurity affecting the most vulnerable."]}, {"relevance_score": 32, "title": "Study Findings on Environmental Factors Are Outlined in Reports from Hainan University (The Increasing Contribution of Greening To the Terrestrial Evapotranspiration In China)", "published": "2023-03-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"><br/>2023 MAR 06 (NewsRx) -- By a News Reporter-Staff News Editor at Daily China News -- A new study on Environment - Environmental Factors is now available. According to news reporting originating in Haikou, People's Republic of China, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Evapotranspiration (ET) in terrestrial ecosystems is of great significance for water resource evaluation, crop water requirements, and drought monitoring and is affected by multiple environmental factors. Several studies investigated the environmental factors affecting evapotranspiration with long time series, but there are few detailed research exploring changes in the dominant controls of ET.\" </p><p><br/> Financial supporters for this research include National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Pan-TPE), Special Fund of Chinese Central Government for Basic Scientific Research Operations in Commonweal Research Institutes, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Natural Science Foundation, United States Department of Energy (DOE), UC Berkeley. <br/> The news reporters obtained a quote from the research from Hainan University, \"It is essential to understand the primary mechanisms involved and their response to climate change. In this study, we analyzed the dominant controls on ET using variable importance in projection (VIP) scores from a Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) analysis and then explored the change of dominant controls over time. Our results indicated a significant ET increase trend over 1982-2015 of 1.40 mm/year in China, with solar radiation (SR), temperature (T), and leaf area index (LAI), as the dominant controls contributing to the increasing changes of ET. Increase in LAI (greening) was the primary cause of increasing ET over the 1982-2015 period, especially in temperate monsoon climate regions. In contrast, the VIP scores of SR and T indicated a negative contribution to increasing ET during the 34 years. The differences in the contribution dynamics of dominant controls to ET may result from different sensitivities to canopy resistance in different vegetation types.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"This research revealed an increasing contribution of greening to terrestrial evapotranspiration in China and improved our understanding of the change of dominant controls over China from 1982 to 2015 and their influence to ET under the changing climate and its impact.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: The Increasing Contribution of Greening To the Terrestrial Evapotranspiration In China.

However, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Lao economy has faced many challenges, including a sharp currency depreciation and high inflation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The price of food had risen 39 percent by late 2022, hitting poorer households disproportionately harder and forcing disadvantaged families to reduce their consumption of food and fuel. These household challenges, combined with the \"5F crisis\" (lack of food, feed, fuel, fertilizer and access to finance), threaten to derail the country's efforts \u2014 under the United Nations General Assembly plan \u2014 to graduate from the least developed country category by 2026.</p><p>Agriculture has long been the backbone of the country's economy, employing more than 60 percent of the workforce (64 percent for women). While the agricultural sectors have transitioned toward commercial production of raw products for export, other sectors still face considerable constraints such as limited access to technology, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of financing opportunities. Higher incomes generated from commercial agriculture accounted for 80 percent of the decline in poverty (from 25 percent in 2013 to 18 percent in 2019). In addition, most agriculture workers are self-employed in small-scale and primarily subsistence family farms. Smallholders face a wide range of supply-side challenges that affect their farm-level productivity and market participation. However, the average rural household remains disproportionately affected by poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition.</p><p>To tackle the agricultural and developmental challenges (and bridge the financing gap), the Lao government and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have jointly launched an agrifood investment initiative under the auspices of the FAO's Hand-In-Hand Initiative. It uses advanced geospatial modeling and analytics, as well as a robust partnership-building approach to accelerate the country's market-based transformation of its agrifood systems. This will help raise incomes, improve the nutritional status and well-being of poor and vulnerable populations, and strengthen resilience to climate change.</p><p>As part of the Hand-In-Hand Initiative, a new high-speed railway corridor between China and Laos aims to increase the economic potential of trade between the two countries and will facilitate Lao smallholders' access to markets in China, Thailand and Vietnam. The initiative also aims to mobilize public and private sector financing for the Lao agricultural sector.</p><p>In a recent National Agriculture Investment Forum, jointly organized by the FAO and the Lao government, development partners and investors highlighted the country's potential as a logistics hub for the entire China and Southeast Asia trading area. From being a \"landlocked country\", Laos is becoming a \"land-linked country\" thanks to the new rail corridor (informally named the \"China-Laos Railway\"). It connects the Lao capital of Vientiane with China and beyond.</p><p>The opportunities are many. Embracing modern farming techniques, such as precision agriculture and other sustainable practices, can significantly enhance productivity and reduce post-harvest losses. Increased investments in research and development through the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute, as well as the adoption of innovative technologies, can empower farmers with knowledge and tools to improve yields and ensure food security.</p><p>The lack of proper transportation, irrigation systems, and storage facilities hampers agricultural productivity and impedes access to markets. Hence, strategic investments in rural infrastructure, especially farm-to-market access and irrigation, will facilitate year-long agricultural production, movement of agricultural produce, reduce wastage, and enable farmers to connect with buyers and consumers more efficiently.</p><p>Smallholders and rural entrepreneurs often struggle to access credit and financial services, limiting their ability to invest in their farms and agribusinesses. Therefore, encouraging financial institutions to offer tailored financial products, microcredit schemes, and promoting public-private partnerships can provide the necessary capital and resources for agricultural development in rural areas.</p><p>Investments in agriculture go beyond cultivation and production; they can create a ripple effect, promoting rural economic diversification and generating employment opportunities. By strengthening value chains, fostering agro-processing industries, and supporting rural enterprises, we can empower local communities and reduce their dependency on subsistence farming alone.</p><p>Establishing processing units in rural areas can add value to agricultural products and open new markets. This not only enhances farmers' incomes but also creates jobs along the value chain, ranging from food processing to packaging, marketing, and distribution.</p><p>Encouraging entrepreneurship and skill-development programs can empower the rural youth to explore business opportunities beyond traditional agriculture. By equipping them with skills in agribusiness management, marketing, financial literacy and technology, we can foster a new generation of rural entrepreneurs, driving economic growth in remote areas.</p><p>Investing in the rural economy should prioritize gender equality and youth empowerment. By providing training, financial support, and equal opportunities for women and young individuals, we can harness their potential as agents of change, fostering inclusive growth and social progress.</p><p>Promoting climate-smart practices such as organic farming, agroforestry and water conservation can enhance the sector's resilience to climate change while reducing the environmental footprint. This ensures the preservation of natural resources for future generations.</p><p>Investments in agriculture, trade and the rural economy hold the key to sustainable development and inclusive growth. By prioritizing technology, infrastructure, finance, and agriculture trade, we can unleash agricultural potential, create employment opportunities, and reduce rural poverty.</p><p>Simultaneously, by promoting economic diversification, sustainable production and climate change adoption will be the key to agricultural development in Laos \u2014 and beyond. It's a win-win situation for both the macro economy and the livelihoods of smallholders.</p><p>In conclusion, we should make full use of the opportunities for agricultural trade provided by the \"China-Laos railway\" and vigorously promote agri-trade, as it can increase the agricultural sector's and smallholders' income, and attract investment in agriculture.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202305/24/646d413fa310b1dec135410b.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>SONG CHEN/CHINA DAILY</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Shi Jiaoqun is a special adviser for South-South and Triangular Cooperation of the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.

However, since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the Lao economy has faced many challenges, including a sharp currency depreciation and high inflation.</p><p>The price of food had risen 39 percent by late 2022, hitting poorer households disproportionately harder and forcing disadvantaged families to reduce their consumption of food and fuel. These household challenges, combined with the \"5F crisis\" (lack of food, feed, fuel, fertilizer and access to finance), threaten to derail the country's efforts \u2014 under the United Nations General Assembly plan \u2014 to graduate from the least developed country category by 2026.</p><p>Agriculture has long been the backbone of the country's economy, employing more than 60 percent of the workforce (64 percent for women). While the agricultural sectors have transitioned toward commercial production of raw products for export, other sectors still face considerable constraints such as limited access to technology, inadequate infrastructure, and lack of financing opportunities. Higher incomes generated from commercial agriculture accounted for 80 percent of the decline in poverty (from 25 percent in 2013 to 18 percent in 2019). In addition, most agriculture workers are self-employed in small-scale and primarily subsistence family farms. Smallholders face a wide range of supply-side challenges that affect their farm-level productivity and market participation. However, the average rural household remains disproportionately affected by poverty, food insecurity, and malnutrition.</p><p>To tackle the agricultural and developmental challenges (and bridge the financing gap), the Lao government and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) have jointly launched an agrifood investment initiative under the auspices of the FAO's Hand-In-Hand Initiative. It uses advanced geospatial modeling and analytics, as well as a robust partnership-building approach to accelerate the country's market-based transformation of its agrifood systems. This will help raise incomes, improve the nutritional status and well-being of poor and vulnerable populations, and strengthen resilience to climate change.</p><p>As part of the Hand-In-Hand Initiative, a new high-speed railway corridor between China and Laos aims to increase the economic potential of trade between the two countries and will facilitate Lao smallholders' access to markets in China, Thailand and Vietnam. The initiative also aims to mobilize public and private sector financing for the Lao agricultural sector.</p><p>In a recent National Agriculture Investment Forum, jointly organized by the FAO and the Lao government, development partners and investors highlighted the country's potential as a logistics hub for the entire China and Southeast Asia trading area. From being a \"landlocked country\", Laos is becoming a \"land-linked country\" thanks to the new rail corridor (informally named the \"China-Laos Railway\"). It connects the Lao capital of Vientiane with China and beyond.</p><p>The opportunities are many. Embracing modern farming techniques, such as precision agriculture and other sustainable practices, can significantly enhance productivity and reduce post-harvest losses. Increased investments in research and development through the National Agriculture and Forestry Research Institute, as well as the adoption of innovative technologies, can empower farmers with knowledge and tools to improve yields and ensure food security.</p><p>The lack of proper transportation, irrigation systems, and storage facilities hampers agricultural productivity and impedes access to markets. Hence, strategic investments in rural infrastructure, especially farm-to-market access and irrigation, will facilitate year-long agricultural production, movement of agricultural produce, reduce wastage, and enable farmers to connect with buyers and consumers more efficiently.</p><p>Smallholders and rural entrepreneurs often struggle to access credit and financial services, limiting their ability to invest in their farms and agribusinesses. Therefore, encouraging financial institutions to offer tailored financial products, microcredit schemes, and promoting public-private partnerships can provide the necessary capital and resources for agricultural development in rural areas.</p><p>Investments in agriculture go beyond cultivation and production; they can create a ripple effect, promoting rural economic diversification and generating employment opportunities. By strengthening value chains, fostering agro-processing industries, and supporting rural enterprises, we can empower local communities and reduce their dependency on subsistence farming alone.</p><p>Establishing processing units in rural areas can add value to agricultural products and open new markets. This not only enhances farmers' incomes but also creates jobs along the value chain, ranging from food processing to packaging, marketing, and distribution.</p><p>Encouraging entrepreneurship and skill-development programs can empower the rural youth to explore business opportunities beyond traditional agriculture. By equipping them with skills in agribusiness management, marketing, financial literacy and technology, we can foster a new generation of rural entrepreneurs, driving economic growth in remote areas.</p><p>Investing in the rural economy should prioritize gender equality and youth empowerment.

The Green Legacy campaign, a personal initiative of Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed as part of his ambition to recover Ethiopia's lost forests, was launched some four years ago, with an overarching goal of planting 20 billion seedlings in four consecutive years. As the initiative gets traction among Ethiopians from all walks of life, this year's edition of the campaign, which marks the end of the ambitious initiative, started last month under the theme \"Our Legacy for Our Generation.\" One of the ardent participants of the tree planting initiative is Getachew Birhanu, a civil engineer in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia. </p><p>Birhanu said he has already planted close to 35 seedlings over the past few weeks alone, together with his wife and two young children. During the course of the recently-started Ethiopian rainy season alone, the ambitious Green Legacy initiative will see the plantation of some six billion tree seedlings throughout the East African country in the coming months. \"As a father of two toddlers, I believe we are truly leaving behind our legacy for our country and the generations to come. This is something we should really be proud of,\" Birhanu told Xinhua one day in early July after he planted seedlings on the outskirts of Addis Ababa, accompanied by his wife and children. Birhanu, who had been actively participating in all the previous tree planting campaigns, said he would continue planting trees even after the end of the four-year national campaign as it would propel Ethiopia's green development efforts. Over the past three years, the East African country has planted more than 18 billion seedlings, according to figures from the Ethiopian government. Experts blame the growing rate of deforestation for the rise in the adverse effects of climate change in Ethiopia as Africa's second most populous nation lost its abundant forest coverage, with worsening trends over the past few decades. According to the Ethiopian Environmental Protection Authority (EEPA), Ethiopia only contributes to an estimated 0.04 percent of the global greenhouse gas emission, but is highly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, mainly due to its high dependence on rain-fed agriculture and natural resources, as well as its relatively low adaptive capacity. Speaking to Xinhua recently, EEPA director-general Getahun Garedew said the East African country is now facing the brunt of climate change and needs to urgently build climate resilience capability. \"Ethiopia is contributing very little toward climate change but being affected very hugely,\" he said. \"Biodiversity loss is another challenge, which is also a worldwide problem.\" According to Garedew, as the adverse effects of climate change persist, heavy rains, flooding and soil erosion are putting both urban and rural infrastructure at risk, particularly for the vulnerable segment of the population. According to EEPA figures, there has been considerable evidence of climate change impacts in Ethiopia over the last 50 years. At the national level, temperatures have increased by an average of around 1 degree Celsius since the 1960s. Rainfall is subject to high inter-annual and intra-annual variability, in which yearly variation around the mean rainfall level is 25 percent and can increase to 50 percent in some parts of the country. Extreme weather events like droughts and floods have also become more frequent in Ethiopia. The Ethiopian PM, in his message on the launch of this year's campaign, said Ethiopia is gravely affected by climate change-induced challenges and is considered a climate vulnerable country. \"Our immediate and practical approach to addressing climate change is the Green Legacy Initiative,\" Ahmed said, as he called on Ethiopians to make this year's edition of the tree planting initiative a success. According to the Ethiopian government figures, with an annually improving survival rate of around 80 percent of the newly planted seedlings, the initiative is ultimately contributing to the creation of new forest areas across Ethiopia. Of this year's seedlings prepared for planting, agroforestry trees make up about 52 percent and forestry trees account for 47 percent, while the remaining are ornamental trees, according to figures from the Ethiopian government. Billene Seyoum, a press secretary for the Office of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, told journalists recently that one of the key successes of the green legacy initiative has been its instrumental role in mobilizing millions and creating public awareness, eventually leading to a significant decline in the rate of deforestation over the past couple of years.

Named Burj Zanzibar - \"burj\" meaning tower in Arabic - the spectacular high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. Dubbed \"vertical green village\", it would represent an iconic landmark not only for the island but for the whole of Africa and a global environmental milestone, being the first timber structure worldwide of such proportions. The design of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a playful beehive style with breathtaking ocean views, was unveiled to the public in Muscat, Oman on 1 October. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the concept, said: \"Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new ecosystem for the future of living\". </p><p><br/><br/>The residential tower with 266 residences is to be located in Fumba Town, East Africa's pioneering eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm CPS. Categorised as a strategic investment and fully supported by the Zanzibar government, the growing city near the capital, where foreigners are allowed to buy, stretches along a 1.5-kilometre seashore on the southwest coast. \"Burj Zanzibar will be the highlight and natural continuation of our efforts to provide sustainable housing in Africa, thereby empowering local employment and businesses\", elaborated CPS CEO Sebastian Dietzold in Muscat. <br/><br/>With turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and a UNESCO-protected historic Stone Town, Zanzibar recorded 15% annual growth in tourism in recent years and 6.8% economic growth. Earlier this year, the semi-autonomous archipelago, 35 kilometres off the coast of Tanzania, stretched its wings also into another direction, launching an initiative to attract African tech companies with a total worth of six billion dollars. <br/><br/>Benefits of timber <br/><br/>Timber is the oldest building material in the world. As timber technology, it currently enjoys a renaissance because of its environmental benefits and longevity. New timber products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam are considered the building material of the future. One cubic metre of wood binds half a ton of carbon dioxide, whereas conventional concrete construction is responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions. <br/><br/>Once realised, Burj Zanzibar would be the highest timber building in the world and Africa's first high-rise ever in this innovative technology. A few weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH).

Dino Martins, an entomologist and executive director of Mpala Research Center said that insects provide critical ecosystems services hence the need to protect them from harm. </p><p>\"Insects are intrinsically involved in food production besides helping reengineer ecosystems. They are aesthetically appealing and have been part of cultural heritage for many Kenyan communities,\" said Martins. \"Protecting the diversity of insects is now more urgent as threats to their survival mount against a background of chemical intensive farming,\" he added. Martins spoke during a virtual briefing on the state of insects in Kenya organized by advocacy group, Route to Food, which sheds light on emerging threats facing pollinators in the country. He said that Kenya's rich diversity of insect pollinators like bees and butterflies is facing decline amid pollution linked to over-use of pesticides, habitat depletion and changing weather patterns. \"We are losing butterflies and bees as we mechanize agricultural systems,\" said Martins adding that loss of pollinators has disrupted ecosystem services and is detrimental to human health. Faith Toroitich, an entomologist and lecturer at Egerton University said that protecting insects will ensure that Kenyan communities have a steady supply of honey and medicinal products. \"We should protect insects because our survival is heavily dependent on them. They are central to food security and help improve soil fertility through decomposing organic matter,\" said Toroitich. She said that insects have historically provided alternative dietary needs to local communities besides cleaning the environment by hastening decomposition of dead animals and plants. Toroitich said that habitat fragmentation and monoculture has contributed to decline of insect diversity adding that restoration of habitats is key to stemming loss of pollinators. Fathyia Khamis, an Integrated Pest Management expert at Nairobi-based International Center of Insect Physiology and Ecology (ICIPE) said that Kenya should harness biological methods to restore the population of pollinators. \"Biological control tools like agroforestry, mixed cropping and improved agricultural practices have proved effective in reducing threats to insect pollinators,\" said Khamis. She said that Kenya should leverage on cultural practices of local communities, and improve habitat management and use of natural pesticides in order to combat threats to insects effectively.

LI TIANPING/FOR CHINA DAILY</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">China's tropical island province of Hainan has joined the ranks of celebrated places of origin for chocolate. World-class master chocolatier Pierre Marcolini played a big role in this transformation by debuting Grand Cru Hainan chocolates at his online flagship shops in June.</p><p>\"This is a fantastic Grand Cru. I feel a slight bitterness, very pleasant, without astringency, with notes of citrus, grapefruit. It is extraordinary,\" said Marcolini. The Belgian chocolate composer spoke via video about his latest bean-to-bar products made with beans grown in Hainan, a place he said he learned about by chance. Grand Cru, meaning \"great growth\" in French, was originally a classifier for fine wines.</p><p>Always on the hunt for new resources in his frequent and far-reaching travels, Marcolini learned about the island in 2017 in the International Journal of Food Properties, a magazine published in the United States. It said Chinese scientists had developed a new variety of cacao in Hainan, a place already known for tropical fruits and economically important plants such as black pepper, vanilla, coffee, pandan, jackfruit, breadfruit, mango, litchi and wax apple. Cacao is the plant that produces seeds from which cocoa and chocolate are made. The seeds are often called cocoa beans.</p><p>Late in 2020, 500 kilograms of cocoa beans were shipped to Brussels, the world's premier city for chocolate, from the Xinglong area of Wanning on the eastern coast of Hainan. The humid island environment, which includes vibrant biodiversity, imparted special qualities to the cocoa beans, including fine quality and special textures and flavors. This captivated Marcolini, who asked his representatives in China to look into the bean.</p><p>\"This is the first time China has exported its locally produced cocoa beans,\" said Qin Xiaowei, deputy director of the Spice and Beverage Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, or CATAS, and lead author of the article that introduced Hainan to Marcolini.</p><p>\"The deal showed that our cocoa quality and production standards have been recognized by the international community,\" Qin said.</p><p>Local reports said that Marcolini has placed two additional orders of Xinglong beans.</p><p>After learning that Hainan is building the world's largest free trade port and has enacted favorable tax-free policies on imports of raw materials and production equipment to encourage investment, Marcolini said he looked forward to visiting Hainan cacao plantations in person, understanding the local culture, and may consider opening a duty-free shop selling chocolates made with Hainan's quality cocoa beans, according to local reports.</p><p>Mark Huestch, a descendent of an eminent family known for their chocolate business in the US, said he was also impressed by the superb quality of the local beans during a recent tour to inspect the planting and fermentation process in Hainan.</p><p>\"Hainan cocoa beans have a very unique flavor, with strong red fruit and nut flavors,\" Huestch said, adding that he would recommend his chocolate products made with Hainan beans to US consumers.</p><p>\"With a growing number of orders flowing in from food producers at home and abroad, Hainan's cocoa production simply cannot meet market demand,\" said Li Fupeng, director of the Cocoa Research Center of CATAS, located at the Xinglong Tropical Botanical Garden, a base for the preservation of tropical and subtropical plants in China.</p><p>While the known cultivation of cacao dates back thousands of years in Latin America, Hainan's cacao growing can be traced only to the 1950s, when returned overseas Chinese brought in seeds and grew them on farms and in the courtyards of their homes in Hainan.</p><p>The cacao cultivation area once reached some 667 hectares around 2004, following large-scale promotion efforts in the 1980s and 1990s. But the acreage dwindled to about 133 hectares mainly due to slack market demand and insufficient processing equipment and technologies, said Li.</p><p>Over the past 60 years, researchers from the Spice and Beverage Research Institute have established a nursery for 500 varieties of cacao, making China an important base in the protection, evaluation and innovative utilization of cacao germplasm resources. A total of 21 new varieties have been developed through systematic breeding and artificial hybridization, boasting high yields, fat content and cold tolerance. The technology and standards for growing cacao in China have reached advanced levels, according to reports from CATAS.</p><p>\"The annual yield of Reyin No 4, China's first cacao variety with independent intellectual property rights, has reached 1,600 kg per hectare, 3.5 times higher than the world average. It has a unique flavor, fine quality and is rich in polyphenols,\" Li said. Polyphenols are compounds that can have health benefits.</p><p>He said, however, that with a limited planting area, Hainan is not in a good position to compete with big cacao growing countries in terms of its cocoa bean industry's output.

Therefore, sustainable forestry development is actively being promoted and the results are gradually being seen.\" </p><p>Chan's organisation is the first non-profit public charity devoted to combating climate change by using plants for carbon sequestration. In addition, Chan is an adviser to the CFGC Amital Green Fund, established last year as a venture between Hong Kong's Euto Capital Partners and the state-owned China Forestry Group Corporation (CFGC). It supports companies that invest in sustainable and high-yielding afforestation, as well as the development of carbon sinks and related technology. </p><p>China has planted 78 billion trees since 1981, according to state media. As a result, a green wave has expanded across the map. </p><p>Forest coverage reached 23 per cent in 2020, up from 12 per cent in the 1980s, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. China wants to boost forest coverage to 24.1 per cent by 2025, and increase the forest stock to 19 billion cubic metres by 2025, up from 17.56 billion cubic metres in 2020. </p><p>China is \"a very significant restoration story,\" Bronson Griscom, senior director of natural climate solutions at US-based non-profit Conservation International, told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Post</emphasis>. \"But there is certainly a lot more to be done.\" </p><p>The flood-control initiatives are just part of the effort. Afforestation programmes also carry high priority for China in the northern and western regions, where they aim to stem the advancement of the Gobi - merely 1,000 kilometres from Beijing - and other minor deserts. </p><p>Sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi, the world's fifth-largest sandy desert, are an annual nuisance that smothers the Chinese capital almost every spring, turning Beijing into a Mars-like landscape during the worst occurrences. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/long-reads/article/2177586/chinas-green-great-wall-front-line-its-fight\">Green Great Wall project</url>, launched in 1978 and slated to continue until 2050, aims to plant some 88 million acres of protective forests in a belt nearly 3,000 miles long and as wide as 900 miles in places. The government has added a handful of other major afforestation projects in recent years. It all adds up to what is easily the biggest tree-planting project in human history. </p><p>How much difference do these efforts make for climate-change goals? Globally, nature-based decarbonisation has the potential to deliver one third of the emission reductions needed to meet 2030 climate goals, according to World Resource Institute. </p><p>\"Agriculture, forestry and other land use [Afolu] can provide large emission reductions, and remove and store carbon dioxide at scale,\" Inger Andersen, executive director of United Nations Environment Programme, told reporters during the launch of the IPCC report. </p><p>Under increasing pressure from investors and the public to reduce their carbon footprints, corporations increasingly view afforestation projects as wise investments, because they qualify for carbon credits that offset carbon emissions. </p><p>\"The fact that [mitigation] does have fairly large potentials to both reduce emissions and enhance removals quickly got attention from the business community, which has been keen to increase investments and saw it as a potential avenue for [carbon] offsets,\" said Stephanie Roe, one of lead authors of the IPCC report. </p><p>As a result, mitigation actions could equate to emission reductions of between 8 billion and 14 billion tonnes per year between 2020 and 2050, according to the report. That would make a significant dent in global emissions, which hit 32 billion tonnes in 2020, according to BP estimates. </p><p>The above assumes that carbon credits would be priced near US$100 per tonne. If the price falls to US$20 per tonne, only 30 to 50 per cent of the reduction would be reaped, according to the IPCC. </p><p>Despite all its promise, mitigation has so far delivered only 650 million tonnes of reductions per year between 2010 and 2019 - equivalent to 1.4 per cent of global emissions. </p><p>What's more, only around US$700 million has been spent on Afolu mitigation globally so far - far short of the over US$400 billion per year needed to deliver on the global climate goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, according to the IPCC. </p><p>\"A gradual redirection of existing agriculture and forestry subsidies would greatly advance mitigation,\" it said, adding that governments currently spend much more than US$400 billion a year on subsidies to the agriculture and forestry industries. </p><p>Chinese president Xi Jinping stressed the importance of tackling environmental degradation and climate change. In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3102761/climate-change-xi-jinping-makes-bold-pledge-china-be-carbon\">September 2020</url>, he set national goals of peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2060. </p><p>Last August, Xi visited the historic Saihanba Mechanical Forest Farm in Hebei province. Established in 1962, the so-called 'green lung of Beijing' is estimated to absorb 747,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide and release 545,000 tonnes of oxygen every day. During the trip, Xi reiterated the importance of developing a \"green economy and ecologically friendly civilisation\". </p><p>In the southwestern provinces of Yunnan, Guizhou and Guangxi, and Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces in the northeast, rapid afforestation has seen forest area increase annually by between 40,000 and 440,000 hectares - one-third to four times the size of Hong Kong - over the past decade. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What are the various activitie that can generate carbon credits?

China Development Bank said last month it has issued some 114 billion yuan (US$17.7 billion) of loans over the past five years to support the planting and maintenance of about 4 million hectares of forests. </p><p>By the time China achieves its carbon peak in 2030, these forests are expected to absorb 72 million tonnes of carbon dioxide every year, it said. However, this represents less than 1 per cent of China's annual carbon-dioxide emissions, which totalled almost 10 billion tonnes in 2020, according to BP's tally. </p><p>Complicating the picture, Afolu activity is a big source of emissions as well as a source of potential offsets. The category also encompasses deforestation and substantial methane emissions from livestock and rice farming. Overall, Afolu contributed 22 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions in 2019. This puts it below only energy production (33 per cent) and industry (24 per cent), and above transport (15 per cent), according to the IPCC report. </p><p>In addition, afforestation - especially on natural grasslands - can cause additional problems when not done right, said Roe, the IPCC report author, who also serves as global climate and energy lead specialist with global conservation organisation WWF. </p><p>\"Putting trees in ecosystems where they don't belong originally has proven problematic in various types of projects,\" she told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Post</emphasis>. \"In some projects, that has affected the water table as the trees have taken too much water and had to be deforested.\" </p><p>Moreover, even as it increased its forested area, China also imported more timber, offsetting the environmental benefits. In addition to being the world's largest timber importer and exporter of wood products, China is also one of the largest importers of illegal timber and deforestation-linked commodities, said the Environmental Investigation Agency of Washington DC, in a November report. </p><p>Without strengthening mitigation measures, the world is headed for 3.2 degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which will have catastrophic impacts on humans and the Earth's ecosystems, according to the IPCC. So far warming has already reached 1.1 degrees. </p><p>\"The science is clear, to keep the 1.5 degrees global warming limit of the Paris Agreement within reach, we need to cut global emissions by 45 per cent this decade,\" The UN's Guterres said. \"Current climate pledges would mean a 14 per cent increase in emissions.\" </p><p>\"But it does not have to be this way, [there are] viable and financially sound options in every sector that can keep the possibility of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees alive.\" </p><p>New trees are just one instrument in the mitigation toolbox. Looking at the total of 8 billion to 14 billion tonnes of annual carbon-capture the IPCC says mitigation measures are capable of providing, the bulk - between 4.2 billion and 7.4 billion tonnes per year - comes from the conservation, restoration and better management of forests, wetlands and grasslands. </p><p>This is followed by more sustainable crop and livestock management, soil carbon storage and agroforestry (planting of trees in agricultural land), which can contribute 1.8 billion to 4.1 billion tonnes a year of reduction. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2022.

By the 1980s, the village school, lacking students, had closed, and the farmland was abandoned. That is until HSBC partnered with HKU to breathe life back into the village, training residents in innovative farming practices such as agroforestry, a more efficient land-use system. </p><p>\"When we revitalise the farmland, we diversify the habitat so that we have different habitats for different species of animal,\" says Leung. \"So you have more species of frogs and more fish. The whole area becomes more diverse in terms of habitats and biodiversity. It will be a more resilient system than if you just abandon it for a longer time and the whole area turns into forest.\" </p><p>While some fauna species have been naturally drawn to the revitalised village area, others have been carefully reintroduced. HKU's research team found rice fish - which live in rice paddies - in a village a 30-minute walk from Lai Chi Wo, and suspecting that they were part of the ecosystem during the village's heyday, they brought them back, while at the same time removing another, more invasive fish species. </p><p>\"The rice fish are part of the bigger picture,\" says Leung. \"They could be controlling the mosquitoes and could be food for birds and other animals - they are predator and prey. They add more diversity and make the system more complex. In ecology, diversity is our one golden rule.\" </p><p>Environmentalists worldwide warn that the threat to biodiversity is as great a risk to humanity as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>. And while few will have missed the furore around the COP26 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url> summit in Glasgow in November, there was far less awareness of the UN biodiversity summit, COP15, held in Kunming, in China's Yunnan province, a month earlier, where the world's leading independent conservation organisation WWF reported a 68 per cent average decline in global vertebrate populations between 1970 and 2016. </p><p>While that drop is terrifying, one of the challenges of biodiversity - as it was with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url> 20 years ago - is making the issue quantifiable. Thankfully, the world is starting to do that. A report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2019 was the first to put a price tag on the issue, asserting that the world's natural ecosystems provide benefits to humanity estimated to be worth up to US$140 trillion a year. </p><p>And in 2020, a report by reinsurance company Swiss Re estimated that half of the world's GDP depends on high-functioning biodiversity. </p><p>\"Natural ecosystems are humanity's most precious resource,\" says Marine de Bazelaire, group adviser on natural capital at HSBC. \"Protecting them is essential to achieving net-zero carbon emissions. Our challenge is to look at the entire economy through the lens of this 'natural capital' and establish it as an asset class in its own right, adapting business models to preserve habitats and creating policies and regulation that prioritise the living world. That's the only way we can continue to benefit from productive land, healthy oceans and clean air.\" </p><p>In May 2021, HSBC teamed up with global research organisation World Resources Institute and WWF to form a five-year philanthropic partnership. Backed by US$100 million of HSBC funding and working with local bodies, the Climate Solutions Partnership aims to scale up nature-based solutions and climate-innovation ventures. It now has 32 projects under way globally and has embarked on a Nature Based Solutions (NBS) Accelerator. </p><p>Working with local teams worldwide, the accelerator, like the Lai Chi Wo programme, aims to help projects grow with connections to funding and a blueprint for replication. In Hong Kong, a good example is <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education/article/2176259/wwf-hong-kongs-mission-ensure-visit-mai-po-nature-reserve\">the Mai Po nature reserve</url>: wetlands, including mangroves, are known to sequester carbon and so help mitigate climate change. The Mai Po project is seeking a management strategy to safeguard the carbon sequestration of the wetlands around the nature reserve while also maintaining a diverse habitat for migratory birds. </p><p>Back in Lai Chi Wo, Leung says the project is not simply about conservation - after all, if the village was left for another 100 years it might return to rainforest - but about the whole ecosystem, including how humans can best fit into the picture, living and working in harmony with the land, primarily through sustainable farming. </p><p>\"With HSBC funding we have been able to do a lot of new things,\" says Leung. \"We have capital investment for equipment.\" </p><p>In addition to the obvious revenue stream of selling fresh produce at local farmers' markets, HSBC funding has allowed for the provision of a food-processing kitchen in nearby Sha Tau Kok. Some of the project's produce, such as ginger and winter melon, is sent to the factory for processing. </p><p>\"Traditionally, lots of farmers in Hong Kong do farming, but they are not good at marketing,\" says Leung. \"They focus all their time and energy into the farming itself and then they sell their produce at a relatively low price. I think food processing is the missing link in the farming industry.\" </p><p>Abandoned farmland is an environmental issue because when soils erode, they release greenhouse gases. Restoring farmland allows it to become a carbon sink once more. While banks and big businesses have supported conservation efforts for years, usually under the banner of corporate social responsibility, that is no longer enough. </p><p>Leung hopes that the lessons learned at Lai Chi Wo can be replicated elsewhere, and the team has already begun working on revitalising farmland in neighbouring villages. </p><p>\"We are trying to scale up the whole thing, doing agriculture with the awareness of conserving the environment as well,\" he says. \"We are trying to plant coffee there and other types of crops. Each village can serve its own purpose, and Lai Chi Wo may be the hub.\" </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3162333/sustainable-finance-greenwashing-concerns-raised-hong-kong-airport-floats\">Green bonds</url> are booming. In just 15 years, green, social, sustainability and sustainability-linked bonds have swollen to pass the US$1 trillion mark, yet the tangible value of biodiversity is only just beginning to be recognised. </p><p>\"For many people, when they think of green projects, they think of renewable energy or green buildings,\" says Luying Gan, HSBC's head of sustainable bonds for Asia Pacific, \"but biodiversity is a little further from people's understanding. It is difficult to measure and not easy for people to understand why it is important.\" </p><p>Invest in a wind farm and you can assess its success according to how many kilowatts of renewable energy it produces. For a biodiversity bond, the most obvious measure would be the number of species that are protected or reintroduced into the environment, but that is not easy to measure. </p><p>\"I think that's one of the reasons it's not a common green project in the sustainable-bond or sustainable-finance market,\" says Gan. \"It is more in the charity domain - you see big organisations giving out money for support under the charity agenda, as with Lai Chi Wo.\" </p><p>The first green bond in Asia to focus exclusively on biodiversity was launched by the Bank of China (BOC) in September 2021 in response to COP15, the global biodiversity conference held in Kunming. Among the projects within its reach is an ecological hub covering 3.5 million square metres of wetlands in central China and the bond is expected to help protect and diversify species in the area. HSBC was one of the first banks to support the bond and the first impact report is due to be delivered in September - 12 months after the launch. </p><p>Gan expects biodiversity to become a more popular theme in green bonds, but sees impact data remaining a challenge for issuers. </p><p>\"BOC may not choose to report on the number of animal species,\" she says. \"It may use other data, such as the area protected by the community that lives there.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2022.

I feel a slight bitterness, very pleasant, without astringency, with notes of citrus, grapefruit. It is extraordinary,\" said Marcolini.

Grand Cru, meaning \"great growth\" in French, was originally a classifier for fine wines.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Always on the hunt for new resources in his frequent and far-reaching travels, Marcolini learned about the island in 2017 in the International Journal of Food Properties, a magazine published in the United States. It said Chinese scientists had developed a new variety of cacao in Hainan, a place already known for tropical fruits and economically important plants such as black pepper, vanilla, coffee, pandan, jackfruit, breadfruit, mango, litchi and wax apple. Cacao is the plant that produces seeds from which cocoa and chocolate are made. The seeds are often called cocoa beans.</p><p>Late in 2020, 500 kilograms of cocoa beans were shipped to Brussels, the world's premier city for chocolate, from the Xinglong area of Wanning on the eastern coast of Hainan. The humid island environment, which includes vibrant biodiversity, imparted special qualities to the cocoa beans, including fine quality and special textures and flavors. This captivated Marcolini, who asked his representatives in China to look into the bean.</p><p>\"This is the first time China has exported its locally produced cocoa beans,\" said Qin Xiaowei, deputy director of the Spice and Beverage Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, or CATAS, and lead author of the article that introduced Hainan to Marcolini.</p><p>\"The deal showed that our cocoa quality and production standards have been recognized by the international community,\" Qin said.</p><p>Local reports said that Marcolini has placed two additional orders of Xinglong beans.</p><p>After learning that Hainan is building the world's largest free trade port and has enacted favorable tax-free policies on imports of raw materials and production equipment to encourage investment, Marcolini said he looked forward to visiting Hainan cacao plantations in person, understanding the local culture, and may consider opening a duty-free shop selling chocolates made with Hainan's quality cocoa beans, according to local reports.</p><p>Mark Huestch, a descendent of an eminent family known for their chocolate business in the US, said he was also impressed by the superb quality of the local beans during a recent tour to inspect the planting and fermentation process in Hainan.</p><p>\"Hainan cocoa beans have a very unique flavor, with strong red fruit and nut flavors,\" Huestch said, adding that he would recommend his chocolate products made with Hainan beans to US consumers.</p><p>\"With a growing number of orders flowing in from food producers at home and abroad, Hainan's cocoa production simply cannot meet market demand,\" said Li Fupeng, director of the Cocoa Research Center of CATAS, located at the Xinglong Tropical Botanical Garden, a base for the preservation of tropical and subtropical plants in China.</p><p>While the known cultivation of cacao dates back thousands of years in Latin America, Hainan's cacao growing can be traced only to the 1950s, when returned overseas Chinese brought in seeds and grew them on farms and in the courtyards of their homes in Hainan.</p><p>The cacao cultivation area once reached some 667 hectares around 2004, following large-scale promotion efforts in the 1980s and 1990s. But the acreage dwindled to about 133 hectares mainly due to slack market demand and insufficient processing equipment and technologies, said Li.</p><p>Over the past 60 years, researchers from the Spice and Beverage Research Institute have established a nursery for 500 varieties of cacao, making China an important base in the protection, evaluation and innovative utilization of cacao germplasm resources. A total of 21 new varieties have been developed through systematic breeding and artificial hybridization, boasting high yields, fat content and cold tolerance. The technology and standards for growing cacao in China have reached advanced levels, according to reports from CATAS.</p><p>\"The annual yield of Reyin No 4, China's first cacao variety with independent intellectual property rights, has reached 1,600 kg per hectare, 3.5 times higher than the world average. It has a unique flavor, fine quality and is rich in polyphenols,\" Li said. Polyphenols are compounds that can have health benefits.</p><p>He said, however, that with a limited planting area, Hainan is not in a good position to compete with big cacao growing countries in terms of its cocoa bean industry's output. Hainan should explore an industrial path that is \"small in scale but beautiful and exquisite in quality\".</p><p>Hainan is promoting cultivation of shade tolerant cacao trees in forests of rubber, coconut and areca palm trees, a practice known as \"an economy under the trees\".</p><p>\"While increasing the output per unit of land, we have found that planting cacao trees in coconut forests can play a role in protecting the growth of coconut tree roots, a practice that is not only conducive to building a complex agroforestry ecosystem and maintaining soil fertility but also helpful to farmers in generating more income in one place as well,\" Li said.</p><p>Cultivation of high-quality cacao varieties will create favorable conditions for Hainan to build a superb origin and international brand of high-quality cocoa beans, he added.</p><p>Hainan has established a primary cocoa processing production line and a quality and safety control traceability system. It also has developed key processing technologies such as low-temperature drying and baking, ultrafine grinding, scientific fixation of aroma and flavor enhancement, local government officials said.</p><p>With the special features and quality of Hainan cocoa beans gaining more recognition, more domestic and foreign enterprises are looking to do business with the island province, said Liao Zirong, director of the Hainan tropical agriculture international technology transfer center of CATAS. An increasing number of local farmers are turning to the center, asking for technical guidance in cultivating new varieties of cacao trees, Liao said.</p><p>The Spice and Beverage Research Institute has reached agreements with international organizations and institutions such as the Tropical Agricultural Research and Higher Education Center, or CATIE, the Alliance of Bioversity International and CIAT, and Ghent University of Belgium to boost future collaboration and exchanges in scientific and technological innovation, talent training, technical upgrades and brand development, said Qin.</p><p>Qin added that they will work together to promote the high-quality development of the cocoa industry in Hainan.</p><p>Cocoa beans are rich in ingredients such as cocoa butter, the vasodilator theobromine and flavonoids, which are good for the heart, kidney and intestines. Experts have suggested that Hainan tap their potential health value and develop products with local features that can be marketed to tourists as gifts.</p><p>Cacao trees and their fruits are a special attraction for tourists, especially those from northern regions, as the fruit changes from green to yellow, pink and red as they become ripe.</p><p>In Xinglong Tropical Botanical Garden, the attractive fruit, or pods, growing on the trunks and branches of the leafy trees\uff0dinstead of only on the branches as with most other fruit trees\uff0dattract crowds of photo-snapping tourists.

Grand Cru, meaning \"great growth\" in French, was originally a classifier for fine wines.</p><p>Always on the hunt for new resources in his frequent and far-reaching travels, Marcolini learned about the island in 2017 in the International Journal of Food Properties, a magazine published in the United States. It said Chinese scientists had developed a new variety of cacao in Hainan, a place already known for tropical fruits and economically important plants such as black pepper, vanilla, coffee, pandan, jackfruit, breadfruit, mango, litchi and wax apple. Cacao is the plant that produces seeds from which cocoa and chocolate are made. The seeds are often called cocoa beans.</p><p>Late in 2020, 500 kilograms of cocoa beans were shipped to Brussels, the world's premier city for chocolate, from the Xinglong area of Wanning on the eastern coast of Hainan. The humid island environment, which includes vibrant biodiversity, imparted special qualities to the cocoa beans, including fine quality and special textures and flavors. This captivated Marcolini, who asked his representatives in China to look into the bean.</p><p>\"This is the first time China has exported its locally produced cocoa beans,\" said Qin Xiaowei, deputy director of the Spice and Beverage Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences, or CATAS, and lead author of the article that introduced Hainan to Marcolini.</p><p>\"The deal showed that our cocoa quality and production standards have been recognized by the international community,\" Qin said.</p><p>Local reports said that Marcolini has placed two additional orders of Xinglong beans.</p><p>After learning that Hainan is building the world's largest free trade port and has enacted favorable tax-free policies on imports of raw materials and production equipment to encourage investment, Marcolini said he looked forward to visiting Hainan cacao plantations in person, understanding the local culture, and may consider opening a duty-free shop selling chocolates made with Hainan's quality cocoa beans, according to local reports.</p><p>Mark Huestch, a descendent of an eminent family known for their chocolate business in the US, said he was also impressed by the superb quality of the local beans during a recent tour to inspect the planting and fermentation process in Hainan.</p><p>\"Hainan cocoa beans have a very unique flavor, with strong red fruit and nut flavors,\" Huestch said, adding that he would recommend his chocolate products made with Hainan beans to US consumers.</p><p>\"With a growing number of orders flowing in from food producers at home and abroad, Hainan's cocoa production simply cannot meet market demand,\" said Li Fupeng, director of the Cocoa Research Center of CATAS, located at the Xinglong Tropical Botanical Garden, a base for the preservation of tropical and subtropical plants in China.</p><p>Pods on a cacao tree ripen in Wanning.

But the acreage dwindled to about 133 hectares mainly due to slack market demand and insufficient processing equipment and technologies, said Li.</p><p>Over the past 60 years, researchers from the Spice and Beverage Research Institute have established a nursery for 500 varieties of cacao, making China an important base in the protection, evaluation and innovative utilization of cacao germplasm resources. A total of 21 new varieties have been developed through systematic breeding and artificial hybridization, boasting high yields, fat content and cold tolerance.

The small town of Lytton, in BC, recorded the country's highest-ever temperature: 49.6 C.</p><p>Shortly after, the town was razed by an out-of-control forest fire. The fire was fed by a deep layer of dryness that facilitated its spread. Towns were evacuated\uff0din the case of the town of Lytton, near where Mark lives, in just 15 minutes. Meanwhile, haze was another problem.</p><p>It made it all the way down to Vancouver, 200 kilometers away.

It's been one worry right after the other,\" Mark said from her home in Kamloops, BC, a larger city deeper into the interior, early last month.</p><p>\"There's been travel restrictions because of the fires.

The Caldor Fire in California destroyed more than 81,000 hectares of forests and forced the evacuation of tens of thousands, and, as the summer holiday was ending at the end of August, it rapidly approached Lake Tahoe, which was on alert. The entire Lake Tahoe Basin, a unique landscape, is being changed by the fires.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Dixie Fire, also in California, had grown to more than four times the size of Caldor. By Sept 13, it had grown to more than 388,500 hectares.</p><p>Wildfires in the Northern Hemisphere continued through last month, until rains helped bring them under control.</p><p>Unusually and intensely high temperatures this year also sparked wildfires in Turkey, Greece and Italy. Sicily, in the south of Italy, recorded a temperature of 48.8 C in mid-August.</p><p>Just as those fires began cooling off, the Southern Hemisphere has started lighting up.</p><p>The Amazon rainforest is getting destroyed bit by huge bit every year and the fire season there is just beginning because the seasons are reversed, with summer in the South just beginning as fall and winter begin in the North.</p><p>Last year more than 2,500 fires burned in the BrazilianAmazon alone, more than 41 percent in standing forest, a new trend.

Now, it comes around every four or five years,\" Wijaya said.</p><p>The worst fire season on record in Indonesia was in 2015, when the fires proved to be catastrophic and led to a regionwide reckoning. Not only did Indonesia move to curb the practice of burning but neighbors Malaysia and Singapore, which are home to the headquarters of most of the companies that rely on burning to clear land, also took policy measures to limit the practice.</p><p>In the Amazon, there is plenty of evidence linking policies and climate change to wildfires, said Brian Enquist, a professor of macroecology and biodiversity at the University of Arizona in the US.</p><p>\"We show that since 2001, drought and forest policy are the best predictors of fire and deforestation impacts on Amazonian biodiversity,\" he said.</p><p>His team analyzed the geographic range of about 15,000 plant and animal species in the Amazon Basin and found that between 2001 and 2015 some 64 percent were affected by fire.

This is more than those who  sell the country's major staple crop maize.", "Millions of dollars worth of  income could be unlocked for poor farmers in developing countries  by changing existing policies that reduce investment in  agroforestry. Almost half the agricultural land in the world, about a billion  hectares, has more than 10 percent tree cover, but there is still  huge potential to increase the number of trees on farmland and  improve their productivity. Incorporating trees within farming landscapes, or agroforestry,  can increase soil fertility, raise and sustain yields, increase  income through the sale of timber and other tree products, and  produce fodder and fuelwood. To encourage the formation of a global partnership to unlock  this untapped potential, the Nairobi-based World Agroforestry  Center on Wednesday launched an Agroforestry Policy Initiative  that aims to support policy reviews and reforms that will  stimulate agroforestry and benefit rural people. \"This Initiative will support national and local policy reforms  that will reduce barriers and improve incentives for private  investment in agroforestry,\" said Dennis Garrity, director general  of the center. \"Agroforestry can deliver a wide range of benefits. It can  enhance food security, improve rural livelihoods, make better use  of scarce rainwater and absorb atmospheric carbon.

A study of around 1, 000 smallholders in Kenya found that 55  percent sold fruits to earn income. This is more than those who  sell the country's major staple crop maize. In Haryana and surrounding states in northern India, hundreds  of thousands of smallholders are growing poplar trees within  irrigated wheat and barley fields, and this is generating about 1  million U.", "Even in areas where tree cover is low, the impact of trees can  be high. In the Sahelien parklands, critically important species  such as Faidherbia albida, baobab and karite provide income of up  to 325 dollars per year for households, together with food, fodder  and fertilizer. International trade in shea butter provides substantial foreign  exchange earnings for West African countries like Burkina Faso. According to the study, revising outdated policies and forest  regulations will allow farmers in many countries to take full  advantage of growing trees on farms, providing them with a  lucrative source of income. For example, following reforms to the Code Forestier in Niger,  farmers have again been cultivating trees and the country has seen  a tremendous increase in tree cover on over 5 million hectares in  the past 20 years. \"At the global level, agroforestry is increasingly recognized  as an important climate change adaptation and mitigation practice  by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and  by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,\" said Frank  Place, Impact Assessment Advisor for the World Agroforestry  Centre. \"It is one of the most effective land use systems in storing  carbon above and below ground. Agroforestry is both a contemporary and an age-old practice,  but there are many missed opportunities to further enrich the  lives of smallholder farmers.

Up to six gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent, or up to two Gt of  carbon, could be sequestered each year by 2030, which is  comparable to the current emissions from agriculture.", "Key among these methods are agroforestry, reduced cultivation  of the soil, and the use of natural nutrients such as fertilizer  trees. A study by World Agroforestry Center scientists, for example,  on fertilizer trees that capture nitrogen from the air and  transfer it to the soil indicates that their use can reduce the  need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers by up to 75 percent while  doubling or tripling crop yields. \"These results should make agroforestry appealing to farmers\",  noted Dennis Garrity, director general of the World Agroforestry  Center and co-chair of the Congress Global Organizing Committee. \"If implemented over the next 50 years, agroforestry could  result in 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide being removed from the  atmosphere, about a third of the world's total carbon reduction  challenge,\" Garrity said. Researchers suggest that integrating agroforestry in farming  systems on a massive scale would create a vital carbon bank. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates no less  than a billion hectares of developing country farmland is suitable  for the conversion to carbon agroforestry projects. \"Nations must seal the deal on a comprehensive and  scientifically-credible new climate agreement in Copenhagen --  there are a lot at stake, not least the future of agriculture and  farmers' livelihoods,\" said Steiner.

Up to six gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent, or up to two Gt of  carbon, could be sequestered each year by 2030, which is  comparable to the current emissions from agriculture. Many of the  agricultural practices that store more carbon can be implemented  at little or no cost.", "The majority of this potential -- 70  percent- - can be realized in developing countries. The Carbon Benefits Project launched in May 2009, is developing  a standard and reliable method for accurately measuring,  monitoring, reporting, and projecting how much carbon each kind of  land use is storing. This global project makes use of the latest remote sensing  technology and analysis, soil carbon modeling, ground-based  measurement and statistical analysis. Garrity noted that if nations agree to a scheme for REDD in  Copenhagen, the work of the Carbon Benefits Project will provide a  more credible basis for smallholders to receive payments for  conserving forests, practicing conservation agriculture and  increasing tree cover on their farms that sequesters carbon. \"Saving carbon is not a priority for smallholder farmers. But  supporting them to expand their agroforestry systems provides  income generation and service benefits to farmers that also have  the co-benefits of sequestering carbon,\" Garrity said. \"For example, by using fertilizer trees and other conservation  agriculture techniques, farmers have increased their maize yields  from an average of one ton per hectare to three or even four tons  per hectare while greatly improving exhausted soils. Food security  is enhanced while farmers' production systems become better  adapted to climate change,\" said Garrity     The director general also cited an agroforestry project  underway in Malawi, where smallholder farmers are being supported  with knowledge about how to plant trees for fertilizer, fruit and  fuelwood benefits.

One key step will be for nations to agree to a scheme for  Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD)  which will pave the way for preserving forests and other key  ecosystems, as well as closing the gap in global demand for  sustainable timber by shifting production from forest to farm,\"  Steiner said. According to a UNEP report released in June, the farm sector  has the largest readily achievable gains in carbon storage, if  best management practices were widely adopted. Up to six gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2 equivalent, or up to two Gt of  carbon, could be sequestered each year by 2030, which is  comparable to the current emissions from agriculture.", "Key among these methods are agroforestry, reduced cultivation  of the soil, and the use of natural nutrients such as fertilizer  trees. A study by World Agroforestry Center scientists, for example,  on fertilizer trees that capture nitrogen from the air and  transfer it to the soil indicates that their use can reduce the  need for commercial nitrogen fertilizers by up to 75 percent while  doubling or tripling crop yields. \"These results should make agroforestry appealing to farmers\",  noted Dennis Garrity, director general of the World Agroforestry  Center and co-chair of the Congress Global Organizing Committee. \"If implemented over the next 50 years, agroforestry could  result in 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide being removed from the  atmosphere, about a third of the world's total carbon reduction  challenge,\" Garrity said.

Many of the  agricultural practices that store more carbon can be implemented  at little or no cost.", "The majority of this potential -- 70  percent- - can be realized in developing countries. The Carbon Benefits Project launched in May 2009, is developing  a standard and reliable method for accurately measuring,  monitoring, reporting, and projecting how much carbon each kind of  land use is storing. This global project makes use of the latest remote sensing  technology and analysis, soil carbon modeling, ground-based  measurement and statistical analysis. Garrity noted that if nations agree to a scheme for REDD in  Copenhagen, the work of the Carbon Benefits Project will provide a  more credible basis for smallholders to receive payments for  conserving forests, practicing conservation agriculture and  increasing tree cover on their farms that sequesters carbon. \"Saving carbon is not a priority for smallholder farmers. But  supporting them to expand their agroforestry systems provides  income generation and service benefits to farmers that also have  the co-benefits of sequestering carbon,\" Garrity said. \"For example, by using fertilizer trees and other conservation  agriculture techniques, farmers have increased their maize yields  from an average of one ton per hectare to three or even four tons  per hectare while greatly improving exhausted soils.

Impoverished villagers turn to whatever short-term solutions they can find, including the harvesting of valuable local resources. Because many of these resources are not easily replenished, this ultimately leads to deforestation and desertification.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this battle for subsistence, both local villagers and international development organizations are mired in the old ways of doing things, planting seeds that simply will not sprout into a sustainable future.</p><p>But there is hope. Plant varieties once poorly understood by the scientific community are now being developed and tested by Chinese scientists from the Kunming Institute of Botany under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with some species showing incredible promise for global poverty alleviation.</p><p>One of the plants is Calotropis, commonly known as milkweed. Native to the Sahel Africa and other semiarid tropics in Asia, Calotropis is a fast-growing and drought-resistant plant that adapts to diverse soil conditions. Naturally suited to grow where other plants fail, Calotropis may globally transform the way we think about ecological restoration in arid and semiarid regions.</p><p>Calotropis is much more than simply a hardy plant that can rejuvenate soil and reduce erosion. Calotropis seeds are coated in a downy fiber that is comparable in smoothness and softness to silk, but is as breathable as cotton.</p><p>As a result, Calotropis fiber has been called the cashmere of the plant kingdom. The fine, silky, durable, and high-quality fibers of Calotropis are beginning to be used in an array of industries.</p><p>With the price of cotton soaring in recent years, there is great potential for the increased marketization of Calotropis, and the multipurpose uses of the fiber are beginning to draw the attention of the industry.</p><p>Its twigs and leaves can be utilized as manure and an organic pest repellent; its stem fibers can be used in bio-composites for construction; its latex contains a stable protease with industrial potential, and its dried latex can act as a potent anti-inflammatory; and after treatment, Calotropis leaves can be used as fodder for livestock. Importantly, Calotropis can bloom and fruit in the same year of planting, and in the third year, outputs reach a high level.</p><p>Because Calotropis is a perennial plant and does not require plowing or sowing, the planting costs are low, making it an ideal crop within poverty alleviation campaigns. And, unlike other cash crops, Calotropis has a short reproductive cycle and is well adapted to salty soils, meaning it can be planted and harvested with a much quicker turnaround.</p><p>The global potential of Calotropis remains untapped. What is required is not only continued research, but transformative initiatives that integrate this research into industry and society.</p><p>The Center for Mountain Futures \u2014 a joint laboratory of the Kunming Institute of Botany and the World Agroforestry Center headquartered in Nairobi \u2014 has been collecting and screening indigenous germplasms to facilitate the improvement of Calotropis varieties with drought-resistance for integration into degraded African landscapes.</p><p>But the Mountain Futures pilot project in Kenya is not simply following old models whereby outside experts come in and dictate the terms of development.

Because Calotropis is a perennial plant and does not require plowing or sowing, the planting costs are low, making it an ideal crop within poverty alleviation campaigns. And, unlike other cash crops, Calotropis has a short reproductive cycle and is well adapted to salty soils, meaning it can be planted and harvested with a much quicker turnaround. The global potential of Calotropis remains untapped. What is required is not only continued research, but transformative initiatives that integrate this research into industry and society. The Center for Mountain Futures \u2014 a joint laboratory of the Kunming Institute of Botany and the World Agroforestry Center headquartered in Nairobi \u2014 has been collecting and screening indigenous germplasms to facilitate the improvement of Calotropis varieties with drought-resistance for integration into degraded African landscapes. But the Mountain Futures pilot project in Kenya is not simply following old models whereby outside experts come in and dictate the terms of development. Instead, Mountain Futures relies on the insights and expertise of local institutions, as well as local managerial and technical staff. The research and development of Calotropis in Kenya has attracted the support of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Natural resources in Kenya, who believe in the potential of this unique Sino-Africa cooperation project.

The issue of the use of organic fertilizers is expected to come  up during the three day agriculture development forum that started  on Monday in Nairobi, aimed at reviewing the progress and  achievements of agriculture practices by the public and private  sector.

In Malawi, the highest average maize yield was found in fields  that combined both fertilizer trees and inorganic fertilizers, but  applied at just half the standard recommended amounts. \"Maize mono-crops grown with inorganic fertilizers may have  higher yield in some years but the yield is less reliable in the  long run. Mono-cropping without replenishing soil nutrients in any  way--the de facto practice of resource-poor maize farmers--was the  least productive and most unpredictable of all,\" the study notes.", "The new study offers an opportunity for maize farmers in the  continent to ease their dependency on artificial fertilizers that  are often expensive because they have to be imported. It is now that several African countries like Nigeria and Kenya  through country and regional initiatives are planning to set up  fertilizer factories. The new findings will also encourage use of organic fertilizers  that is cheaper and often available to rural farmers because it  can easily be made from farm waste. The findings if applied will  also help farmers increase their on- farm afforestation and  provide them later with trees and shrubs that can be used for  cooking, as wood fuel is the most common in the rural areas. \"Now we know this is not just a temporary phenomenon. For maize  farmers who can't afford fertilizers, agroforestry with nitrogen-  fixing trees offers a stable increase in production, allowing them  to feed their families and replenish the soil,\" said Gudeta  Sileshi, the lead scientist on the study and regional  representative for ICRAF's Southern Africa Program. While maize is the region's stable crop in Sub-Sahara African  and the most popular crop among the small scale farmers, its  vulnerability to changing rainfall patterns blamed on climate  change and over use of soils has reduced its yields, with  concerted efforts being made by various stakeholders to reverse  the trend. Use of nutrient-inducing trees is therefore seen as one of the  measures that will help small scale farmers mitigate against some  of the risks facing maize farmers in the region. Maize accounts for more than half of the cropped area and the  calories consumed in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The small-scale maize farming system, covering 10 percent of  the region, is in crisis, with yields in many areas either  stagnating or declining. As a result of rapid population growth, average farm sizes have  fallen to less than 0."]}, {"relevance_score": 43, "title": "The urgency for a global biodiversity accord", "published": "2019-11-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governments from around the world are already preparing for the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP15) to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in Kunming, China. This is no ordinary gathering: Its goal will be to conclude a new policy framework on biodiversity that works for all member states.</p><p><br/><br/>Although the CBD adopted the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in 2010, the international community has been decidedly ineffective in achieving them. <br/><br/>The next decade will show that we can no longer treat the destruction of nature as \u201cbusiness as usual.\u201d We are quickly approaching environmental and climatic tipping points that could trigger catastrophic feedback loops, making climate change impossible to reverse. A major report by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services earlier this year showed that our current activities could lead to the extinction of up to 1 million species in the next few decades.<br/><br/>Given that such losses to biodiversity will jeopardize the future of humankind itself, the time for effective public and private leadership is now \u2014 or never. In developing a framework to align international policies and industrial practices, we should focus on 10 key priorities that belong in any new CBD framework.<br/><br/>First, we must end the global trade in wildlife and endangered species, by making it illegal in both supplier and destination countries. As matters stand, the international community is doing nothing about this issue. <br/><br/>Second, we need a global agreement on how to regulate high-seas industrial fishing, given that industry subsidies are currently contributing to unsustainable overfishing.<br/><br/>Third, we must put an immediate stop to industrial-scale logging and burning of primary forests, be they tropical, boreal, or temperate. Allowing such activities makes no sense. Industrial logging benefits neither governments nor indigenous communities, which should be permitted to farm and log their own lands sustainably.<br/><br/>Fourth, related priority is to ban deforestation across the board. In many countries, deforestation can be conducted legally simply by submitting a request for a change in land use on a given plot. Reaching a world of zero-deforestation commodities will require the support of private companies and consumers who are willing to make a change.<br/><br/>Fifth, we need all governments to adopt a carbon tax, without which we will be effectively promoting a market failure. Currently, we not only subsidize fossil fuels; we also fail to provide ample compensation for the carbon sequestration provided by tropical forests, agroforestry systems, mangroves and wetlands. While carbon prices in voluntary markets averaged US$3 per ton of CO2 equivalent in 2016, the global price should be in the order of US$40 per ton if we are to meet the reduction targets under the 2015 Paris climate accord.<br/><br/>A carbon tax makes sense<br/><br/>Implementing a carbon tax might be politically complicated, but it makes perfect economic sense. Costa Rica introduced a carbon tax in 1997 that now generates US$32 million per year. Those funds are then used to provide environmental services to indigenous communities, farmers and others who plant trees with the intention of increasing biomass in the productive landscape.<br/><br/>Sixth, we should adopt a new financial target for the international community\u2019s biodiversity efforts. We are currently investing a mere 0.08 percent of global GDP in natural conservation. If we can commit to mobilizing 1 percent of global GDP under the new framework, we will have the resources to meet all the other targets we set. Although conservation programs are a domestic matter for national governments, the target should be framed as a multilateral benchmark, given that biodiversity loss is a shared problem.<br/><br/>Seventh, we must stop \u2014 and reverse, if possible \u2014 PADDD (protected area downgrading, downsizing, degazettement) events. In the US and elsewhere, the movement to deregulate protected lands, or to strip them of their protected status entirely, is well-funded and powerful. Obviously, such efforts pose a direct threat to all conservation efforts.<br/><br/>Eighth, we should aim to phase out single-use plastics before the end of next decade, as the accumulation of non-biodegradable plastics is impeding many other conservation efforts. <br/><br/>Ninth, in a similar vein, we need to start thinking about how we can tax pollution of all kinds. In too many cases, polluting is simply free. In the absence of any costs, the problem will only worsen.<br/><br/>Finally, governments urgently need to adopt green national accounting systems. Effective policymaking requires the best available data. Insofar as the current economic system fails to account for biodiversity loss, water pollution and greenhouse-gas emissions, it is part of the problem, not the solution.<br/><br/>Carlos Manuel Rodr\u00edguez is minister of environment and energy of Costa Rica.

much degraded land they  have and how much land they are losing every year for other  development issues,\" she said. </p><p>    So it is essential to develop scientific knowledge in those  countries to make them well known about the real situation they  are facing, for which the UNCCD is now trying to help. </p><p>    In addition to building a global outlook as well as developing  a real map on land degradation for the world, the UNCCD has  already started to create an index, which will classify countries  across the world on basis of their own land degradation. </p><p>    \"We think it is a

But equally important, COP25 offers an opportunity to elevate one of the most powerful tools we have to address climate change: nature.</p><p><br/><br/>Nature-based solutions (also known as natural climate solutions) leverage the world\u2019s forests, grasslands, wetlands, and soils to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. Healthy ecosystems absorb and store carbon on their own. And if they are protected, restored, and managed sustainably, they can provide one-third of the emissions reductions needed to meet the Paris climate agreement\u2019s goal for 2030.<br/><br/>In other words, nature is offering us an opportunity that we cannot afford to miss. Reducing fossil-fuel emissions is crucial, but it will not be enough to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius, let alone 1.5 degrees Celsius, relative to pre-industrial levels. <br/><br/>To secure a livable future on this planet, we also must commit to funding nature-based solutions. <br/><br/>All countries need to start incorporating nature-based solutions into their national climate pledges, and begin investing accordingly. Two years ago, scientists from The Nature Conservancy and its partners published new research showcasing nature-based solutions\u2019 potential to fight climate change. Yet natural climate solutions have continued to attract relatively little attention \u2014 and even less funding.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this may be starting to change. In September, nature-based solutions featured prominently at UN Climate Week in New York City. Although that event did not live up to UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres\u2019s call for \u201cclear steps to enhance nationally determined contributions by 2020,\u201d it did offer a platform to a new generation of climate and nature advocates. From the Youth4Nature coalition to the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, young people were on hand to demand that today\u2019s leaders account for the challenges they will inherit.<br/><br/>Climate Week also produced an announcement from a coalition led by China and New Zealand, focused on encouraging nature-based solutions in both national climate plans and the corporate sector. And the private sector itself has made new commitments, with a group of 230 international investors (representing US$16.2 trillion in assets under management) calling on companies to take immediate action to address deforestation in their supply chains.<br/><br/>Political leaders now must maintain this momentum, by taking a closer look at what nature can do to help mitigate and build resilience to climate change. For example, one promising solution is sustainable agroforestry, in which food crops are grown alongside native trees. <br/><br/>Nurture critical wildlife<br/><br/>Expanding this practice can bolster food security and boost incomes in rural communities and simultaneously restore soil health, sequester carbon, and nurture critical wildlife.<br/><br/>Another nature-based solution is being pioneered in Australia, where massive bushfires are putting people and wildlife at risk \u2014 and releasing enormous amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. The Nature Conservancy is cooperating with Indigenous communities to improve grassland health, sequester carbon, and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Drawing on traditional knowledge dating back thousands of years, Indigenous rangers set smaller, controlled burns to prevent the buildup of dry grass that contributes to larger, hotter wildfires. This program contributes to healthier grasslands while generating income for Indigenous communities through the sale of carbon credits.<br/><br/>These kinds of programs benefit people and the environment; but much more investment is urgently needed. Although natural systems play a critical role in regulating the climate, nature-based solutions still receive under 4 percent of total public funding for climate action. <br/><br/>Worse, natural systems that could be part of the solution to climate change are facing increasingly severe threats. <br/><br/>We have all seen the recent images of fires raging through the Amazon rainforest, which plays a major role in regulating the world\u2019s climate. Record-high temperatures, environmental crimes, weak oversight, ineffective firefighting, and other factors have increased the vulnerability of systems that store a disproportionate share of the planet\u2019s carbon.<br/><br/> And the Amazon is just one example. The conversion and degradation of natural land and marine habitats is ongoing around the world. Such practices undermine our ability to adapt to climate effects like rising sea levels, and directly threaten our food security by wiping out species that pollinate crops, contribute to soil health, and provide habitats for fish and other marine life. Nature, climate, and human wellbeing are intimately connected; none can be addressed in isolation.<br/><br/>COP25 offers an opportunity for world leaders to seize on these connections in the run-up to 2020, which will be a veritable \u201cenvironmental super year.\u201d In addition to finalizing an international high-seas treaty and establishing a new framework for the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, governments will also revisit their climate commitments at COP26 in Glasgow, Scotland.<br/><br/>But any commitments that countries make at these meetings will mean little without concrete plans to back them up.

This program contributes to healthier grasslands while generating income for Indigenous communities through the sale of carbon credits."]}, {"relevance_score": 34, "title": "Feature: Wild fruits seen as hidden treasures for Kenyan farmers", "published": "2012-12-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">   Ever thought of eating a wild  fruit?

advocating small-scale farming as a practical way of achieving food self-sufficiency in asian, pacific and african commonwealth countries.  the three-day conference noted that most commonwealth countries achieved their political independence after world war two and since then they have paid too much attention to cash crops such as coffee, cocoa and palm oil, resulting in food shortage at present.  the small family farm, the conference pointed out, appears to be the most promising approach to address the food crisis because it not only promises to improve dietary conditions of the families themselves, but also has high job-creating potential.  to ensure the small-scale farming strategy a success, the conference called on the member countries to promote cooperation among small-scale farmers by help forming more small farmers' associations.  such an association, the conference believed, can help small farmers to overcome physical, knowledge and psychological barriers as banks and finance corporations prefer to provide soft loans to organized farmers.  small farmers can thus use their associations to pass more information on agriculture and exchange their experience on greater production,the participants agreed.  they shared the view that without an association, small farmers will be detered from approaching credit institutions for the expansion of their production.  it is widely recognized that most of the food-deficit countries in africa can not be assured of food assistance from other parts of the world as a solution to famine and hunger.

income from exports like tropical fruits and world famous cigars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the economic blockade imposed unilaterally by the United States since the 1960s has caused millions of dollars in losses to this sector.</p><p>The economic hit usually occurs due to incomes lost from exports of goods and services, geographical relocation of exports, additional banking transactions

Where recommendations about which fertilizer to use and crops  to plant were once based on data collected from a variety of  sources, of differing quality, and using different methods and  languages, the new digital soil maps and associated databases can  be used to directly target land management decisions. The conference will also encourage the recognition of results  from pademetric analyses in informing planning, management  decisions and public policy. Traditionally, soil maps identified soil types buy landscape  but advances in technology for example digital soil mapping, have  enabled scientists to create soil maps that show the dynamic soil  properties and how these properties are important to farmers."]}, {"relevance_score": 11, "title": "Indonesia minister stress protection of ecosystem", "published": "2013-08-26", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indonesian Environment Minister  Balthazar Kambuaya said on Monday the performance of the national  economy is measured not only by growth but also a healthier  environment and better social advancement. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">    Even though Indonesia has enjoyed economic growth in the last  two decades, the economic advancement has also put pressures on  the country's resources and environment, the minister said at the  Sixth International Ecosystem Services Partnership Conference in  the famous tourist resort of Bali, which runs through Friday. </p><p>    The forum, co-organized with the World Agroforestry Center and  Wagenigen, the Netherlands-based Ecosystem Services Partnership,  will discuss, share experiences and valuable inputs and determine  the expectations in the future to rehabilitate the environment  that has started to get vulnerable at the time being. </p><p>    \"The theme of the conference describes the need to recognize  and understand the ecosystem services before being valued and  counted,\" the minister said. </p><p>    The value of ecosystem services should be verified before it is  submitted in national accounting scheme for environment  accounting, and efforts should be made to improve the awareness of  the real contribution of ecosystem services to national  development,\" he added. </p><p>    According to the minister, Indonesia is facing problems in the  implementation of the ecosystem services scheme in its fiscal  policy, resources and legal, institutional and business aspect. </p><p>    \"We have been taking efforts to address those challenges,  engaging all means possible.
