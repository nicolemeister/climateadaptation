In a study published recently, a team from Australian National University (ANU) found that weather-related disasters can have significant mental health impacts on people living thousands of kilometers away from the directly affected area. Surveys of Australians found that authorities have underestimated the mental impact of the devastating 2019-20 Black Summer bushfires. </p><p>The fires, which burned for months across Australia, claimed dozens of lives and burned more than 24 million hectares, killing or displacing billions of animals. A survey of more than 1,400 people across the country six months after the fires found that many Australians were dealing with a sense of loss regardless of whether they were directly affected. Zoe Leviston, lead author of the report from the ANU School of Medicine and Psychology, said the findings suggest policymakers should be more aware of solastalgia -- the distress people feel as a result of unwanted environmental change -- and deploy mental health support services in response. She said some people could be on the other side of the continent witnessing the devastation and that solastalgic response to environmental destruction was enough to negatively impact their mental health. \"Traditionally the way we assess the damage caused by bushfires is thought of in terms of direct physical impact, such as how many people had to evacuate, how many people lost property and how many people lost their lives, which is all important information to capture,\" Leviston said. \"But importantly, people not directly impacted by a bushfire event also experience solastalgia and poorer mental health outcomes following bushfires. By not taking solastalgia into account, we are being very conservative in our estimates of bushfire impact on peoples' mental health and wellbeing.\" Leviston suggested that given the less visible impacts of disasters such as solastalgia, climate scientists and the health sector should work together to identify areas where compounding disasters are more likely to occur and deploy resources accordingly.

The study was published in the Nature journal on Wednesday, and lead researcher Peter Strutton from the University of Tasmania said they found the links between the phytoplankton bloom and the smoke triggered by the bushfires. </p><p>In the summer beginning in 2019, the Australian state of New South Wales experienced bushfires of unprecedented extent and intensity. The fires burnt through an estimated 5.3 million hectares or 6.7 percent of the state's total land area, realizing an estimated 715 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere -- more than Australia's total annual emissions. Using satellite imagery, the researchers observed the smoke cover vast distances through the earth's stratosphere before settling above the Southern Ocean thousands of kilometers off Australia's east coast. \"The phytoplankton bloom in this region was unprecedented in the 22-year satellite record and lasted for around four months,\" said Strutton. The bloom was shown to spread across an area of the ocean larger than the entire Australian continent. \"What made it more extraordinary is that the part of the season when the bloom appeared is usually the seasonal low point in phytoplankton, but the smoke from the Australian bushfires completely reversed that,\" said the researcher. One of the seemingly positive consequences of rapid growth of the microscopic marine algae, phytoplankton, is its natural process that absorbs CO2. While it is estimated that the huge levels of absorption were enough to offset the CO2 released in the fires, Strutton warned that conclusions should not be jumped to in terms of the phenomenon's greater implications. \"We need a far more comprehensive representation of wildfires in climate models and targeted studies to understand their influence on marine ecosystems. Our capacity to adapt to future climate change depends on it.\" Strutton said further research would be needed to determine if the sequestered CO2 is released back into the atmosphere or stored deep in the ocean after the event passes. Weighing in on the subject, international expert Dr. Chris Mays from the Department of Palaeobiology at the Swedish Museum of Natural History, lauded the importance of linking algal blooms to wildfires but warned of its impact on marine ecosystems. \"Explosive blooms of plankton can be deadly to animals. A single bloom event can wipe out countless thousands of animals in a few days, and leave 'dead zones' in freshwater lakes and coastal areas,\" he said. He said that human activity is making such events more frequent and devastating. \"For these kinds of toxic soup, you need three main ingredients: high temperatures, high CO2 and an influx of nutrients ...

Rix said that deaths of insects and spiders would be more significant than those of koalas and kangaroos. \"Small animals are the foundation of healthy ecosystems,\" he said. \"Insects are crucial in all food webs in any major habitat on Earth and spiders are major predators of insects.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 14, "title": "Australian bushfires to become \"more frequent, prolonged and severe\": study", "published": "2021-01-08", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">CANBERRA, Jan. 8 (Xinhua) -- Experts have warned that Australia's devastating 2019/20 bushfires were a \"wake up call\" to the extreme effects of climate change in the country.

Abram said that the Black Summer was an example of what was to come for Australian summers. \"When we look to the future we see southeast Australia continuing to become even hotter because of human-caused climate change. On top of that climate change is altering our patterns of year-to-year climate variability so that we expect extremely hot and dry years to occur more often,\" she said. \"There are also indications that southeast Australia could continue to become drier in winter and experience more frequent weather fronts in summer that cause dangerous fire weather, but more research is needed to fully understand how these fire-relevant impacts of climate change might develop.\" \"All of those expected and possible climate change indicators point towards a rapidly increasing risk of catastrophic bushfires that are beyond anything we have experienced in the past.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 11, "title": "Logging native forests increases severity of deadly Australian bushfires: study", "published": "2020-05-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">SYDNEY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Logging of Australia's native forests likely contributed to the severity of deadly bushfires which swept the nation last summer, a new research revealed on Wednesday. By increasing fuel loads and changing the ecology of wet forests, logging increases the risk and severity of fires, a team of researchers from the Australian National University (ANU), Macquarie University, University of Queensland (UQ), and the Wildlife Conservation Society found. </p><p>\"Logging causes a rise in fuel loads, increases potential drying of wet forests and causes a decrease in forest height,\" UQ Professor and Wildlife Conservation Society Director James Watson explained. \"It can leave up to 450 tons of combustible fuel per hectare close to the ground - by any measure, that's an incredibly dangerous level of combustible material in seasonally dry landscapes.\" The team was investigating Australia's historical and contemporary land-use in the wake of the devastating bushfires, which were the worst in the country's history, killing at least 34 people and destroying an estimated 18.6 million hectares of bushland. Study lead author Prof. David Lindenmayer from ANU said there were land management actions authorities could take to help prevent such fires from occurring in the future. \"The first is to prevent logging of moist forests, particularly those close to urban areas. We must also reduce forest fragmentation by proactively restoring some previously logged forests,\" Lindenmayer said. The research concluded that logging should be removed from areas where it adds to the fuel load and creates risk to human safety such as close to housing developments.

Sam Mitchell, the manager of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, told News Corp Australia that the park took in 600 koalas to protect them from the fires but only half survived.

At least 25 people were killed, while about half a billion animals were feared dead. Many cities, including the capital Canberra, were blanketed in heavy smoke, where air quality was ranked as the worst in all major cities in the world. </p><p>The vastness of the country as well as its climate including heat and lack of rainfall have surely been a major cause of the spread of the devastating fire. Australia is made up of large unpopulated areas of wilderness that are extremely difficult to reach. Once a fire starts in one of these regions, the naturally dry and dense Australian bush can quickly become consumed by flames and spread beyond what fire crews are able to contain. Contributing to conditions this season was an ongoing drought which left fuel sources such as dead leaves and timber extremely dry and much more likely to burn. Last year, Australia experienced its driest spring in 120 years of recorded history, according to the country's Bureau of Meteorology (BoM). There have also been several days of strong winds and high temperatures -- conditions which can quickly spread fires and create very dangerous conditions for those trying to contain them. However, apart from the wilderness and drought, the policies of the federal government were also criticized for failing to bring the bushfires under control. At the end of last year when firefighters were busying combating the bushfires, Australian people found their Prime Minister Scott Morrison \"disappeared.\" There was news that he went to Hawaii for holiday. Angry web users launched an online campaign #WheresScotty. Thousands of protesters camped outside Morrison's Kirribilli House in Sydney where they said they would wait until he returned to \"confront the climate crisis.\" The prime minister soon returned to the country. During his visit to Cobargo, where a father and a son lost their lives in the bushfire, Morrison was heckled by local residents, who refused to shake hands with him. Morrison and Defence Minister Linda Reynolds later announced that 3,000 Australian Defence Force (ADF) reservists will be deployed to help with the recovery from catastrophic bushfires in an unprecedented move. The pair also announced 20 million Australian dollars (13.9 million U.S. dollars) in funding for four additional fire-fighting aircraft and the deployment of Royal Australian Air Force and Navy craft for rescue efforts. On Monday, the Australian government launched the National Bushfire Recovery Agency which would be funded with an initial 2 billion Australian dollars (1.38 billion U.S. dollars). But as former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd said, the government's response has been \"evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and, above all, too late.\" Meanwhile, the measures taken by the Australian government also made people guess if they have underestimated the scale of the bushfires this year. As of the beginning of last December, New South Wales (NSW) was scorched by more than 80 blazes, half of which not under control. Former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull called on Morrison to provide hands-on leadership and coordinate a national response to a bushfire emergency. Morrison said there already was a \"nationally coordinated effort\" which he did not think could go any higher. But that was obviously not the case. At the end of last December when the Morrison government agreed to compensate NSW volunteer firefighters, opposition leader Anthony Albanese argued firefighters outside NSW needed extra support as well. \"This has been an issue that was raised with me across the country,\" he said. Minister for Police and Corrective Services in Queensland Mark Ryan also accused Morrison of \"being a prime minister for New South Wales only.\" About Morrison's plan of deploying army reservists to assist, NSW Rural Fire Service commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said neither he nor defence force personnel working from the state control center were informed beforehand. Fitzsimmons said he was \"disappointed and frustrated\" to learn of the plan through media reports. Some experts also criticized the government for not being well prepared for the bushfires. Rod Keenan, a professor with the University of Melbourne, said bushfire management comprises three planks: preparation, response and recovery. \"The federal government mostly focuses on bushfire response and recovery,\" he said. A Guardian report on Sunday said Greg Mullins, former commissioner of NSW Fire and Rescue, and 22 other former emergency services chiefs had sent a letter to the federal government outlining the potential crisis and asking for more specialized equipment to deal with the hotter and longer bushfire periods. \"They were ignored,\" said the report. \"Emergency services have been asking for resources since 2016, when the National Aerial Firefighting Center asked for a 'national large air-tanker fleet' to support firefighting operations but were rebuffed,\" it said. This is not the first time that Australia has seen bushfires. In February 2009, the Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria claimed 173 lives. In the capital city Canberra, fires entered the suburbs in 2003, killing four, ruining nearly 500 homes and severely damaging almost 70 percent of the Australian Capital Territory's (ACT) pastures, pine plantations and nature parks. The 2016 State of the Climate report said that Australia's climate has warmed since national records began in 1910, especially since 1950. According to the Climate Council in Australia, since the mid-1990s, southeast Australia has experienced a 15-percent decline in the late autumn and early winter rainfall and a 25-percent decline in average rainfall in April and May. \"Climate change is driving an increase in the intensity and frequency of hot days and heatwaves in Australia, in turn increasing the severity of droughts,\" said one of its reports. While many believed that climate change led to the prolonged bushfire period in Australia, Morrison said, \"Our emissions reductions policies will both protect our environment and seek to reduce the risk and hazard we are seeing today.\" Australia has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate agreement. Despite several demonstrations across Australia in the past, Morrison has repeatedly ruled out pursuing more ambitious climate change policies than those Australia has already committed to. \"Australia is a highly developed country,\" said former foreign minister Julie Bishop. \"If a country like Australia fails to show leadership, we can hardly blame other nations for not likewise showing leadership in this area.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["CANBERRA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian bushfires have engulfed more than 6 million hectares of bush, forest and parks, which is twice the size of Belgium.

Two people, a father and son, have died and more than a third of the island has burned in fires since December. Addressing the bushfire crisis that has devastated much of the island, Kangaroo Island Mayor Michael Pengilly on Thursday called for forestry to be \"forbidden\" on the island going forward, describing the practice as \"a categorical disaster.\" \"These blue gum plantations and pine plantations have made it almost impossible to control fires when they come out of parks, because they just act like giant wicks that drag it through and then we can't get on top of them,\" he told News Corp Australia. \"I want to see forestry written off the agenda on Kangaroo Island.\" More than 800 properties on the island were without electricity on Friday morning as the result of a fire-related outage. Grave fears are still held for the island's diverse wildlife. Approximately 25,000 koalas, half the island's population, are feared dead. Despite being told to evacuate Sam Mitchell, the owner of the Kangaroo Island Wildlife Park, and his family remained behind on Thursday to protect the property and its 700 animals, including koalas injured in other blazes. Fears are also held for hives of the island's Ligurian bees, which produce honey that is exported around the world. Island Beehive, the island's biggest honey producer, has lost almost half of its hives to the fires. \"We are trying to rescue everything we can to preserve what stocks (of Ligurian bees) we have got left so we can try to rebuild,\" head apiarist Mark Harte said. \"We have been looking after these bees for many years and it is just heartbreaking.\" The air quality in Adelaide, the capital of SA, on Friday morning was the 11th worst of any city in the world after smoke drifted from Kangaroo Island to the mainland. Smoke blanketing much of the state prompted SA Health to warn that it \"could pose a serious threat to health, particularly for vulnerable people with lung or heart conditions.\" \"People should keep windows and doors shut and ventilate the house once the smoke clears,\" Nicola Spurrier, the state's chief public health officer, said.

Prof. </p><p>Christopher Dickman, an ecologist from the University of Sydney, told Xinhua that a large amount of wildlife are expected to be perished, which would provide food for scavenging animals, making it hard to ensure biodiversity. He said the bushfires may have a \"fairly dramatic effect\" on those species. Over 1 billion native mammals, reptiles and birds are expected to be wiped out and from 20 to 100 species are already threatened, including vertebrates and plants. While Australia's iconic koalas have been viewed around the world as a visual symbol of the wildfire's devastation, and are now likely to be reclassified as endangered, Dickman explained there are also many other lesser-known animals that may be facing similar population losses. \"In terms of the percentages, around 77 percent of the 1 billion calculated is likely to be reptiles,\" he said. \"So these are small skinks, geckos and dragons, things that if you spend a little bit of time in forest environments just looking into the leaf litter and rolling logs. These are the abundant animals that you'll see that have been particularly badly affected.\" To make matters even worse for Australia's native wildlife, the effects of the bushfires which have burnt through 18.6 million hectares of vegetation may also see the number of destructive invasive species surge. With a massive pile up of carcasses scattered across fire grounds, it's unclear what effect this will have on the ecosystem but experts suspect it will provide a major food boost for scavenging animals. Although this is likely to be beneficial for a small number of native animals like wedge-tailed eagles, quolls and dingos, Dickman said it might also be a bonanza for introduced species like feral cats and the red fox. \"We need to find a rapid monitoring tool that allows us to identify any areas of unburned habitat in the landscape. This might come from remote sensing by a satellite,\" he said. \"If there are remnant populations of species, particularly threatened species, then we'll need to take further steps to make sure they get through.\" \"That kind of action, as well as removing predators around small unburnt patches where there are predator-susceptible species, that will be really valuable.\" In the longer term, Dickman said the entire country will need to come together to evaluate the science and take stock of what it's predicting. \"I think it's probably fair to say there's been a feeling in the science community over the past 20 years or so, that biodiversity issues have not been front and foremost in thinking or planning. Now, we need to really be very serious about ensuring that biodiversity is up there,\" he said. \"It's quite likely that in conditions as we saw last year, that is extreme heat, extreme dryness, we will have these kinds of fires again. It's almost certain that they will occur. It's very difficult to see how we can stop them.\" \"So the question then becomes in those years, what can we do to make sure that wildlife survives?\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 34, "title": "Feature: Australian bushfires destroy wildlife, huge tracts of land amid slow gov't response", "published": "2020-01-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Matt Goss CANBERRA, Jan. 9 (Xinhua) -- The death toll from the unfolding bushfires in Australia, which began unusually early in September, has risen to 27 as the fires continue to burn. As of Wednesday more than 10.7 million hectares of land had been burned across the country. On Thursday morning, the state government of New South Wales (NSW) announced that 1,870 homes have been destroyed in the state. </p><p>Both NSW and Victoria have declared a state of emergency and catastrophic bushfire conditions could persist. Smoke from the fires has blanketed Australia's major cities for days at a time and has spread as far east as to New Zealand and to South America. According to data compiled by the World Wide Fund for Nature, 1.25 billion animals have perished in the fires, many of whom were iconic Australian species including koalas, kangaroos, wallabies and cockatoos. In response to the crisis, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack on Monday established the National Bushfire Recovery Agency and announced 2 billion Australian dollars (1.37 billion U.S. dollars) in funding for relief and recovery efforts. The announcement was made amid one of Morrison's difficult months since he became prime minister in August 2018. In December, he apologized after he left the country for a family holiday to Hawaii while much of his home state of NSW was ablaze. Since he cut his holiday short, Morrison has faced significant pressure to pursue more ambitious climate change policies to mitigate future crises. Australia has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 26-28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate accord, a target that Morrison has said will \"protect the environment\" while also guaranteeing the long-term viability of \"people's jobs and livelihoods.\" The mounting pressure on the prime minister to take action to prevent future fires came to a head earlier in January while he was touring the affected NSW town of Cobargo where two people died. Morrison was heckled by local residents. The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) on Thursday released its Annual Climate Statement, revealing that 2019 was both Australia's warmest and driest year since records began in 1900. According to BOM data, Australia's mean temperature in 2019 was 1.52 degrees Celsius hotter than the long-term average. The national rainfall total was 277.6 millimetres (mm), well below the previous record in 1902 (previous lowest was 314.5 mm). Andrew Gissing, an emergency management expert from the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Cooperative Research Centre, recently said that Australia spends \"too much on disaster relief and recovery and not enough on mitigation.\" \"More people are living in high-risk bushfire areas, emergency services are stretched and the climate is rapidly changing,\" he said in a media release. \"Future crises are inevitable. We must consider the prospect of a monstrous bushfire season, the likes of which we've never seen.\" More than a third of the Kangaroo Island off the coast of South Australia has been burned by fires and approximately 25,000 koalas, half the island's population, are feared dead. The koalas of Kangaroo Island are considered crucial to the long-term survival of the species because they have been found to be free of the chlamydia that affects almost half of those on the mainland, causing widespread blindness, infertility and death. Chris Dickman, an ecologist from the University of Sydney, on Wednesday said that 800 million animals have died in NSW alone. \"We're probably looking at what climate change may look like for other parts of the world in the first stages in Australia at the moment,\" he said in a statement. \"It's a very sad time.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 47, "title": "Australian bushfires are a warning of climate catastrophe; is Hong Kong listening?", "published": "2020-01-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">As horrific as the recent bush fires in Australia have been, a satellite image <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/australia-fires-iss-image/\">attributed to NASA shared recently on social media made me gasp</url>.

UNPRECEDENTED FIRE With tremendous plumes of smoke sent into the atmosphere, Canada is grappling with its worst wildfire season on record. By Thursday there are 907 active wildfires in Canada with 572 of them classified as \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Center (CIFFC). The scale of the wildfires is unprecedented, with over 90,000 square km of land already burned, said the CIFFC. </p><p>That exceeds the previous record of some 76,000 square km set in 1989, according to official data. Natural Resources Canada said earlier this month that due to long-range forecasts for warm temperatures and ongoing drought, most recent projections indicate a continued potential for higher-than-normal fire activity across most of the country throughout the 2023 wildland fire season. The smoke generated by the fires shrouded regions from British Columbia to Quebec, blanketed a large portion of the United States and even made their way across the Atlantic to Europe by late June, triggering weeks of air quality alerts and jeopardizing residents' health. \"Smoke is really dangerous for humans and wildlife because if the very small particulates in smoke get into our lungs and bloodstream, they are difficult for bodies to handle,\" said Karen Hodges, a professor in ecology at the University of British Columbia. Hodges said that the overall impact of wildfire on the ecosystem is a long-lasting change in water flow, in the trees and plants that grow there and also in habitat quality for wildlife. On top of that, the professor noted, wildfire releases a significant amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the exacerbation of global warming. SOARING EMISSIONS Canada's unprecedented wildfires have already emitted 724 million tons of carbon dioxide by July 1, Liu Zhihua, a researcher from the Shenyang-based Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, told Xinhua. \"This is a huge number,\" Liu said, noting the wildfire emissions have already exceeded emissions from fossil fuel consumption in Germany in 2021, which stood at around 670 million tons and ranked 7th among all countries. Liu's latest study showed that if the current trend continues, it is estimated that wildfire emissions in Canada will reach 1 billion tons in the coming weeks. The emissions will increase the atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and accelerate climate warming, the researcher said, adding that with climate warming, forest fires are becoming more frequent, more severe and larger, which will further affect Earth's climate. \"In recent years, there have been frequent extreme forest fire events, including the 2019 Amazon wildfires, the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, the 2022 Siberian wildfires, and this year's Canadian wildfires,\" Liu said. Forest fires emit around 1.5 billion tons of CO2 per year, Liu said, noting with increasing fire intensity and burned area, emissions from forest fires are increasing at a speed of around 1 percent per year. In 2021, nearly 1.76 billion tons of CO2 were released from burning boreal forests in North America and Eurasia, 150 percent higher than annual mean CO2 emissions between 2000 and 2020, a research paper published in Science magazine said. Increasing numbers of extreme boreal fires and stronger climate-fire feedback challenge climate mitigation efforts, read the paper titled \"Record-high CO2 emissions from boreal fires in 2021.\" GLOBAL COLLABORATION For individual countries, effective measures should be taken to mitigate CO2 emissions from natural processes, said Liu, adding in the case of wildfire, strategies such as fuel treatment and improved forest management can be used to limit fire intensity and subsequently reduce CO2 emissions. China, for example, has made significant progress in forest fire prevention, Liu said, noting forest fires have decreased significantly in China since 2000. \"The annual burned forest is around 750 square km between 2000 and 2022, emitting only a few million tons of CO2 per year. Considering China's vast forested area of 2.2 million square km, it is a significant contribution to global CO2 reduction,\" Liu said. Restoration after fire is also encouraged, said Hodges, because plant bodies are able to use carbon dioxide and will help remove some carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Forest fire emissions affect health and contribute to climate change globally. Therefore, addressing carbon emissions from wildfire requires international collaboration, said Liu. As forest fire has become one of the major CO2 sources, Liu said it is crucial to build better carbon emission monitoring and accounting systems, which include CO2 emissions from both human activities and natural processes, such as wildfires. Echoing Liu, Hodges also said governments should \"get far more serious about climate change and policies that reduce fossil fuel emissions, and we need to do that globally.\" Enditem</p>", "publisher": "Xinhua General News Service", "instances": ["On top of that, the professor noted, wildfire releases a significant amount of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to the exacerbation of global warming.

Canada is seeing its worst fire season on record as hundreds of blazes rage across the country, with more than 250 burning \"out of control,\" according to the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. (BC Wildfire Service/Handout via Xinhua)</p><p><br/><br/>The Canadian wildfires that started in May have brought severe impact to Canada and even the North American region. The latest data from the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre shows that, as of Wednesday, a total of 4,774 fires have occurred nationwide in Canada, with cumulative burned areas of more than 121,000 square kilometers. This data has far exceeded the country's historical record of 76,000 square kilometers burned in 1989, surpassing the land area of South Korea, and is 7.5 times the cumulative disaster areas of wildfires in China from 2000 to 2021.<br/><br/>In addition to endangering the lives and property of local residents, the ecological damage and the emission of greenhouse gases caused by the wildfires have had an immeasurable impact on the human living environment. Recently, Chinese scientists used scientific methods to assess it and concluded that, as of Wednesday, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires have reached approximately 1 billion tons. Chinese scientists involved in this research told the Global Times that this astonishing data indicates that the carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxides emitted by Canadian wildfires have had an undeniable impact on global climate warming. This has already developed into a global environmental event, rather than just wildfires happening in Canada, the scientists warned.<br/><br/>\"Remote sensing technology is an effective method currently used to estimate carbon emissions from large-scale wildfires. It can conduct rapid and accurate assessment of carbon emissions from wildfires.\" Liu Zhihua, a researcher at the Shenyang-based Institute of Applied Ecology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who participated in this study, told the Global Times on Wednesday.<br/><br/>The scientists estimated that, as of Wednesday, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires had reached approximately 1 billion tons.<br/><br/>In addition, Chinese scientists have estimated through the emission factor method that the greenhouse effect of methane and nitrous oxide emitted from this wildfires is approximately equivalent to 110 million tons of carbon dioxide. Combined with the direct emission of 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide emissions from Canadian wildfires is equivalent to about 1.11 billion tons. Liu believes that this figure is quite astonishing, as the carbon dioxide emissions related to fossil energy in Canada in 2021 were about 546 million tons, and the carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from this year's wildfires are nearly twice that amount. 1.11 billion tons of carbon dioxide have already exceeded Japan's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions for the year 2021, according to Liu.<br/><br/>According to data from the Global Carbon Project, Japan's total energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2021 were 1.067 billion tons, ranking fifth globally.<br/><br/>However, the wildfire in Canada this time has surpassed that record. \"Furthermore, there is a concerning situation where about one eighth of the wildfires in Canada occur in permafrost areas, which could potentially promote the release of methane stored in the permafrost,\" Liu said.<br/><br/>In addition to causing serious harm to the climate through greenhouse gas emissions, this year's wildfires in Canada has also released air pollutants such as PM2.5, PM10, organic aerosols, and black carbon. This will inevitably have an impact on the environment and harm human health.<br/><br/>\"Up to now, this wildfire has had significant cross-border impacts on air quality four times, namely from May 17 to 26, June 6 to 19, June 23 to 30, and July 15 to 20.<br/><br/>During these four instances of cross-border transmission, the air quality in the US was significantly reduced, with particulate matter exceeding 50 micrograms per cubic meter, leading to flight cancellations, school closures, and severe disruptions to production and daily life.<br/><br/>Among them, the second transmission process resulted in the most severe pollution weather in New York City since 1960. The third transmission process caused Chicago's air quality index to exceed the standard by 5.6 times on June 27, which will inevitably pose significant risks to the respiratory systems of local residents,\" Liu explained.<br/><br/>What is more serious is that due to the westerly circulation and weather dynamics, the PM2.5 released from the Canadian wildfire has also been transported across long distances.<br/><br/>Wang Zhe, an associate researcher at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the CAS, who participated in this study, told Global Times on Wednesday that research shows that PM2.5 released from the wildfires reached the Scandinavian Peninsula in Europe on May 25, spread to Iceland and Greenland on June 8, and affected mainland Europe on June 26. The atmospheric transport process from June 27 to 30 contributed more than 5 micrograms per cubic meter of PM2.5 in Europe. This transport process even affected North Africa and Asia, impacting a large area in the western part of China, contributing approximately 1-2 micrograms per cubic meter to PM2.5 concentrations in the western region of China, according to Wang.<br/><br/>Wildfires in Canada are indeed a global environmental event, and their ultimate impact will certainly be much more severe than the current data suggests,\" Wang said.<br/><br/>He further stated that this research outcome is only a preliminary assessment, and a comprehensive evaluation of the wildfires will be conducted once they are over. This evaluation will include the impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate, the impact of particle emissions on the environment, and the effects on human health.<br/><br/>\"We are currently combining air pollution epidemiology to assess the impact of this wildfire on human health, because the particulate matter generated by the wildfire may be more harmful to the human body than traditional PM2.5. The impact could be 2 to 10 times greater, mainly because the small particles produced by the forest wildfires are more likely to enter our lungs and then enter our bloodstream. This not only affects the respiratory system but also the cardiovascular system. Therefore, we will also conduct a comprehensive assessment of the harm caused by this wildfire to the human body in the later stage,\" Wang noted.<br/><br/>Rapidly burning wildfires can cause extensive damage and death to vegetation, resulting in not only a loss of biodiversity but also the loss of habitat and food sources for animals. Additionally, wildfires can destroy the vegetation cover, leading to exposed soil surfaces and exacerbating the frequency of secondary disasters such as soil erosion, sediment runoff, and landslides.<br/><br/>Wang further pointed out that the recent Canadian wildfires may also have an impact on the frozen layers in the polar regions. For example, the emissions of organic aerosols and black carbon, if deposited on the surface of the Arctic sea ice, can cause rapid melting of the ice. Therefore, the impacts of this wildfire are very complex and a comprehensive assessment will be needed using more comprehensive Earth system models in the future.<br/><br/>In recent years, with the increasing impact of climate change and human activities, extreme forest fires have been occurring frequently all around the world.<br/><br/>For example, in 2019, the Amazon forest fires caused a burnt area of over 90,000 square kilometers in 10 months. In 2019-2020, the Australian bushfires led to a burnt area of 243,000 square kilometers in one year. In 2021, the wildfires in Russia resulted in a burnt area of 181,600 square kilometers.<br/><br/>The wildfire season in Canada usually lasts until October, and there is a possibility that the current wildfire will continue to spread. The academic community also believes that the scale of the disaster will further expand, surpassing the country's historical records.<br/><br/>For a long time, the Western academic community has considered fire disturbance a natural process that regulates forest ecosystems, benefiting the stability of ecosystem structure and function. However, Liu believes that in recent years, the frequent occurrence of large-scale wildfires has exceeded the range of natural variation and has evolved into a destructive disaster.<br/><br/>Frequent and severe wildfires not only rapidly deplete carbon reserves in vegetation and soil, but also alter the natural succession of forests, leading to ecosystem degradation into shrublands or grasslands, significantly reducing the carbon sequestration function of the ecosystem. Therefore, large-scale wildfires disrupt the balance of ecosystems, rather than being considered as traditional ecological disturbance processes, Liu explained.<br/><br/>\"The forest protection concept in European and American countries first focuses on the protection of people's lives and property, and secondly on important natural resource areas. As to the fires in remote areas, they preferring monitoring rather than interfering in as they believe that everything will eventually return to its original state after one or two hundred years, considering it as a natural evolutionary process,\" Liu said.<br/><br/>However, Liu noted that extreme environmental events are occurring frequently nowadays, which has exceeded the scope of natural changes and has evolved into a destructive ecological disaster. At this time, proper human intervention is needed.<br/><br/>If the fires go straight up to the tree crowns and become strong, the effectiveness of human intervention may be limited. Currently, wildfires in Canada spread very quickly and release a lot of energy, so the effectiveness of human intervention is limited.\" Liu explained to the Global Times.<br/><br/>It is worth mentioning that the forest area in China is approximately 2.31 million square kilometers, which is roughly two-thirds of the forest area in Canada. The forest coverage rate is about 24.02 percent. Such extensive distribution of forests has brought significant challenges to our country's forest fire prevention work. However, over the years, China has accumulated rich experience in forest fire prevention and control, successfully reducing the occurrence rate and disaster losses of forest fires, and significantly improving the comprehensive capacity for fire prevention and control, Liu said.<br/><br/>According to estimation, the average annual emission of carbon dioxide caused by forest fires in China from 2000-2021 was approximately 15 million tons, only account for 0.2 percent of the global forest fire emissions, demonstrating China's responsible role as a major country, Liu said.<br/><br/></p>", "publisher": "Global Times (China)", "instances": ["Wang further pointed out that the recent Canadian wildfires may also have an impact on the frozen layers in the polar regions.

Meanwhile several fires on the NSW and Victoria border edged closer to merging into a \"megablaze\" over half a million hectares in size. As of Tuesday afternoon, an online crisis map showed barely one kilometre between the fires. Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said that the phenomenon was not unusual. \"We saw that with the Gippsland fires, we started with four fires that were separated which have now joined,\" Crisp said. He added that this season crews have witnessed fires travelling as far as 30 kilometres overnight, making it vital that people in the vicinity of the blazes pay close attention to official instructions. Local defence personnel helped move supplies by air to remote communities which in many cases had lost conventional means of communication. \"Whilst there's a number of isolated communities, we are in contact with the majority of those and providing them with what they need,\" Heagarty said. Serious concerns were raised for the effect on Australia's fragile wildlife, with one University of Sydney academic, Professor Chris Dickman estimating that 480 million animals have perished in this fire season in NSW alone. In the State of South Australia, a wilderness protection area known as Kangaroo Island experienced significant animal losses, including unique species, on top of the deaths of two people.

weather disasters, the Chinese lead author of a newly released academic paper warned on Tuesday.The amount of additional heat the world's oceans have taken in over the past 25 years was equal \"to 3.6 billion Hiroshima atom-bomb explosions,\" Cheng Lijing, lead author and associate professor with the International Center for Climate and Environmental Sciences at the Institute of Atmospheric Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Tuesday.The paper \"Record-setting ocean warmth continued in 2019\" was written by 14 scientists from 11 institutes around the world and published by the international journal Advances in Atmospheric Sciences on Monday.The world's oceans were warmer in 2019 than at any other time in recorded human history, the report finds, and the authors warn more catastrophic fires like those that have ravaged the Amazon and Australia are likely.\"Global heating is one of the reasons for the increase in catastrophic fires in the Amazon, California and Australia in 2019, and we're seeing that continue into 2020,\" Cheng said.The paper concludes that the past decade has been the warmest 10 years on record for global ocean temperatures, with each of the past five years breaking successive records.According to the study, the 2019 ocean temperature was about 0.075 C above the 1981-2010 average, and the global ocean temperature is not only increasing, but rising more quickly.Ocean warming proved global warming, Cheng asserted, and since 1970, more than 90 percent of heat caused by global warming was absorbed by oceans, harming marine life, generating stronger storms, reducing fish catches and damaging ocean-related economies.The year 2019 broke records set in previous years for global warming, and the effects were already appearing in the form of more extreme weather, rising sea levels and harm to ocean animals, the authors noted.And as global warming intensifies, more disasters like the Australian bushfire will likely occur, Cheng warned.As sea levels rise, coastal cities worldwide especially in Malaysia and the Maldives will have to deal with submerged land, Cheng noted.Global climate change in 2019 amplified 15 extreme weather disasters that cost millions of dollars such as wildfires in California, Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and the European storm Eberhard, according to British charity Christian Aid report released in December, 2019.All of these disasters are linked with human-caused climate change, said the report by the British charity.</p><p/><p>Screenshot of a video

The \u201capocalyptic\u201d wildfires have killed at least 19 people and about a half-billion animals, as well as displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The whole world is watching aghast as the Australian continent is scorched by seemingly omnipresent wildfires.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Meteorologists, fire chiefs and mayors in Australia have blamed climate change for the extreme conditions, pointing to the fact that the country\u2019s fire season is becoming longer and more intense. Globally, the extent and severity of wildfires in recent years are closely linked to global warming.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Communities that have been ravaged by bushfires have criticized the Australian Government for its inaction against climate change. While the devastating fires raged across the continent, politicians traded insults on who is to blame.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Some people liken Australia\u2019s coal industry to the U.S.National Rifle Association, which has been accused of lobbying against gun control even though gun violence has claimed a large number of lives. The coal industry is regarded as so important to Australia\u2019s economy that Prime Minister Scott Morrison once even brought a piece of coal to Parliament to show his support for the industry.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Even though last year\u2019s polls showed an increasing number of Australian people supported climate action, voters in May opted for mining jobs and lower taxes, sending the conservative Liberal-National Party coalition, who offered little commitment to taking action on climate change, to power.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Australia is not the only country that has done little to curb climate change. U.S. President Donald Trump declared his country would pull out of the Paris Agreement even as dangerous bushfires brought devastating destruction to California, while Canada and South Korea are far from meeting their Paris Agreement emissions-cutting goals.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    Rational people tend to delay gratification for future benefits. Yet populism drives politicians and voters to become short-sighted. The wildfires in Australia, Chile, North America and elsewhere are a wake-up call for mankind as a whole. In this global village, no country is immune to climate change.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Some countries remain committed to dealing with the challenges posed by climate change despite the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. In 2018, China\u2019s carbon emissions intensity \u2013 emissions per unit of GDP \u2013 fell by 45.8 percent compared with 2005, and it has already fulfilled its promise that by 2020 it would fall by 40 to 45 percent compared with 2005. The European Union rolled out its Green Deal in December to make it the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Cities can also act. Shenzhen has replaced its entire bus fleet with electric buses, almost every taxi is now electricity-powered, and all new app-based cabs are required to be e-cars. In April last year, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced the city\u2019s Green New Deal, an audacious plan that includes US$14 billion in new investments, legislation and concrete action at the city level that will ensure a nearly 30 percent additional reduction in emissions by 2030. The new deal will generate tens of thousands of jobs retrofitting buildings and expanding the use of renewable energy. In London, the Ultra Low Emissions Zone policy, under which most polluting vehicles are charged a fee if they enter the city center, is a good example of addressing traffic emissions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Individuals should also do their part.

Even as the world rang in the year 2020, the Australian bushfires sparked in September continued to rage. The \u201capocalyptic\u201d wildfires have killed at least 19 people and about a half-billion animals, as well as displaced hundreds of thousands of people. The whole world is watching aghast as the Australian continent is scorched by seemingly omnipresent wildfires. Meteorologists, fire chiefs and mayors in Australia have blamed climate change for the extreme conditions, pointing to the fact that the country\u2019s fire season is becoming longer and more intense. Globally, the extent and severity of wildfires in recent years are closely linked to global warming. Communities that have been ravaged by bushfires have criticized the Australian Government for its inaction against climate change."]}, {"relevance_score": 48, "title": "At Democrats' debate, foreign policy in focus", "published": "2020-01-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By HENG WEILI in New York | China Daily Global | Updated: 2020-01-15 23:38</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The seventh 2020 Democratic presidential debate kicked off on Jan 14.

For different reasons, SARS, a different coronavirus of zoonotic origin that was also traced to China, is a public benchmark by which the scale and severity of the Wuhan outbreak is being measured in the media. But convenient side-by-side comparisons are not always accurate, nor are they safe.</p><p>I experienced this as a journalist, when during SARS I saw first-hand how rumour and misinformation replaced evidence and honesty. It triggered panic and dismantled the response effort led by health workers and health authorities. This is what I fear again for the Wuhan outbreak \u2014 compounded in a digital age, where the tools we have to communicate are greater and more immediate.</p><p>Videos on social media show chaotic and distressing scenes at hospitals, patients apparently collapsed on floors, and agitated people shouting for treatment. Some of them may be ill, but others may be drawn in by public anxiety, overwhelming exhausted health workers and putting themselves and the people around them at risk.</p><p>We can't assume that these videos are related to the Wuhan outbreak. Many of them are posted without a date, location or source. One journalist admitted on Twitter that the footage she shared was \"unverified\", a disclaimer which doesn't prevent it from being re-uploaded as fact. Other videos showing alleged consumption of exotic wildlife have also been widely posted, suggesting a link to some reports that the novel coronavirus may have originated at an unregulated food market in Wuhan. A viral video of a woman appearing to eat bat soup in China was debunked by an article published in Foreign Policy (the woman was identified as the host of an adventurist-style travel show filmed in a different country).</p><p>Words like \"dirty\", \"diseased\", and \"virus infected\" are being used to describe Chinese people. I am deeply concerned, not only because I am of ethnic Chinese descent myself, but because it evokes the painful stigma and discrimination that continues to attack people living with HIV. It is shaming and humiliating, barring them from accessing treatment, and in the case of the AIDS epidemic, contributing to significant loss of life. This is not confined to one group \u2014 we are all interchangeable as the targets of bullies.</p><p>But there is an opportunity to turn this around. Twitter now provides a pop-up message in regions like Hong Kong and countries including Australia, which when you search for 'coronavirus' invites you to \"know the facts\" and opt for verified information provided by local sources and the WHO. The commitment to engage in accurate and meaningful information surely must be driven by everyone. As consumers of content, we can shape our knowledge by investing in health stories that go beyond the miracle cure or the current outbreak. Will Wuhan become 'yesterday's news', like Ebola and the Australian bushfires before it?</p><p>The reality is that Wuhan is about the hundreds who have died, the thousands who have been infected, and the millions who continue to be impacted. It is also about the families who live in lockdown, who fear the unknown, and the health workers who risk their lives by moving to the frontlines of this outbreak. But there is proof for hope: this week, China admitted patients to two new emergency hospitals built and equipped in around 10 days. Together, they can accommodate at least 2,600 beds. Many more beds are to be made available in the sports halls and conference centers currently being converted for temporary medical use. This means Wuhan can better handle the current outbreak, and be properly prepared should it worsen.</p><p>Funding public health systems</p><p>I will finish with a memory from last September. As heads of state and government gathered at the UN General Assembly in New York, I moderated a small gathering of eminent leaders including Dr. Tedros. Together, they spoke in support of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board, an independent body that tracks progress in anticipating the next health emergency, and identifies gaps in reaching that critical point.</p><p>They warned us that the world is extremely vulnerable to disease epidemics and pandemics that will not only cause loss of human life, but will destruct our economies and create social chaos. It is not a question of \"if\" but \"when\". What unites their recommendations is a serious commitment to ensure that public health systems are adequately funded. This would ensure that we don't react to each new outbreak as it happens, but strengthen and support systems even in the absence of epidemics or pandemics.</p><p>The Board will no doubt agree that the outbreak in Wuhan is a timely reminder that many of its recommendations must be urgently taken up at the highest levels: commitment and investment by heads of government, strengthening of coordination mechanisms by the UN, increase in funding for preparedness by development partners, and linking preparedness with economic risk planning by major financial institutions. Wuhan is also a reminder that we need vaccines and that vaccines work.</p><p>It is more important now than ever to remain calm, and allow our health workers and authorities to do exactly what they are trained to do at this time. As Dr. Tedros said: \"This is a time for facts, not fear. This is the time for science, not rumours. This is the time for solidarity, not stigma.\"</p><p>James Chau is the host of The China Current with James Chau, and a Goodwill Ambassador for the World Health Organization and UNAIDS. <br/><br/>This piece was first published in The Hindu.</p>", "publisher": "China Daily", "instances": ["This is not confined to one group \u2014 we are all interchangeable as the targets of bullies.

Inside a front yard in the village, a Xinhua reporter saw burnt chairs and a table, joining the charred trees, collapsed houses and warped cars that tell the stories of homes lost overnight. Many of the residents have sought refuge under the roof of relatives or friends. </p><p>An old couple unwilling to give their names said they are in dire need of food and a place to live. \"It was pretty fast,\" Mark Wilson, captain of the Wingello Rural Fire Brigade, told Xinhua. \"Then it rained down ashes, which set everything on fire.\" EVERYONE IS AFFECTED Bushfires have been burning in Australia for nearly three months now, so far killing 28 people and destroying some 2,000 homes. Over 10.7 million hectares of land -- about the same size as Iceland -- have been scorched across the continent. Not only humans are suffering. Data by the World Wide Fund for Nature shows 1.25 billion animals have perished in the fires, including those from many native species such as the koala, kangaroo, wallaby and cockatoo. Living near the fire-ravaged tourist destination Batemans Bay in the southern state of New South Wales (NSW), Peter James, who runs a farm with 190 cattle in rural Braidwood, said his family has left town for \"a rental place\" elsewhere. \"We're waiting for it to rain so we can go back home,\" said the young farmer. Now should be the busy tourist season for the coastal region. At Lenoa Coleman's cafe, however, business has shrunk by some 30 percent from a year ago. \"This is actually our busiest time, but nobody is coming to Braidwood,\" the 32-year-old said. In big cities like Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne, people are finding themselves choking on dirty air. Canberra has been blanketed in smoke since the end of 2019, with an air quality ranked worst among the world's major cities. Amity Raymond and her family fled the southern coast on Jan. 2, and the first thing she did after moving to Canberra was to buy pollution masks. Such masks are rarely needed in the city. \"But now, all the smoke is coming from fires outside Canberra,\" Raymond said. \"And we need them for the kids mainly.\" Smoke has seriously affected her family members, particularly her nine-year-old, who \"has got a bit of a cough from it\" and her 78-year-old grandmother, who \"has to stay indoors.\" The family has installed reverse-cycle air conditioners in bedrooms to clean the air, she said. \"We have had to buy a special tape and door fittings ...to seal the doors to stop the smoke from coming inside.\" But, she sighed: \"Unfortunately, the house is so old that smoke keeps coming in through the doors.\" GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND INTERNATIONAL AID A week ago, the Australian government established the National Bushfire Recovery Agency, announcing 2 billion Australian dollars (1.38 billion U.S. dollars) in funding for relief and recovery efforts. On Sunday, it announced funds worth 52.5 million dollars for mental health services in bushfire-affected communities. \"These bushfires have been unprecedented in their scale, coverage and duration,\" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. \"They have also taken a traumatic emotional toll on our people.\" Meanwhile, the government has taken the unprecedented move of deploying up to 3,000 reservists from the Australian Defence Force to help with recovery and evacuation operations. Angus Campbell, the chief of the Defence Force, said its efforts will be \"focused on safety of life, evacuation of people seeking to leave affected areas, support and access to isolated communities, and support to state evacuation centers.\" The Australian bushfires have shocked people around the world, prompting tremendous inflows of messages of support from both government leaders and ordinary people, and assistance in the form of financial aid or even the use of aircraft. Defense and firefighting personnel have arrived from North America and nearby New Zealand to absorb some of the strain on local emergency services. To support the affected people, a special \"Rally for Relief\" event was announced for the lead up to the Australian Open tennis tournament, with many of the world's top players committing to charity matches. At Hollywood's recent Golden Globes ceremony, the bushfires were the feature of a number of acceptance speeches. Australian actor Russell Crowe, who instead of being at the ceremony to collect his award was in Australia defending his home and property from the fires, used his speech time as a platform to spread awareness. \"We need to act based on science, move our global workforce to renewable energy, and respect our planet for the unique and amazing place it is. That way we all have a future,\" he said. CAUSES AND CRITICISM David Bowman, director of the Fire Research Center at the University of Tasmania, who has over 40 years of experience in fire research, believes that the bushfires are a cause of global warming. He told Xinhua he believes that climate change is behind the unusually high temperatures, extreme drought and strong winds that are thought to be behind the fires. Official records show that last year, Australia experienced its driest spring in 120 years, with very strong winds and high temperatures on some days. Victorian State Control Center spokesman Luke Heagarty said that under these circumstances, blazes regularly become too dangerous for firefighters to even consider attending. \"They're always days that challenge us every summer, but we've had a number of them already and they're the days when we've seen the most significant fire spread occurring,\" Heagarty said. He added that when fires reach that size they will burn, possibly for months, until significant rainfall comes. Policies of the federal government were also criticized for failing to bring the bushfires under control. \"The uncomfortable truth is the government's response just doesn't pass the pub test,\" said Kevin Rudd, a former prime minister, in an opinion piece published by the Guardian. \"It's been evasive, tepid, tone-deaf and, above all, too late.\" A Guardian report on Sunday said Greg Mullins, former commissioner of NSW Fire and Rescue, along with 22 other former emergency services chiefs, had sent a letter to the federal government outlining the potential crisis and asking for more specialized equipment to deal with the hotter and longer bushfire periods. \"They were ignored,\" said the report. Australia's carbon emissions have also become a hot topic again. The country has committed to reducing its carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent from 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris climate agreement. Prime Minister Morrison has repeatedly ruled out more ambitious climate actions despite the argument that Australia, as a highly developed country, should show leadership in the area. In an interview with ABC at the weekend, Morrison finally opened the door to \"evolving\" the government's policy on climate change in the future and to reducing emissions further than has been committed to. \"What I'm saying is we want to reduce emissions and do the best job we possibly can,\" he said.
