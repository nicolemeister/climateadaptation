After losing almost half of his 1,200 hives of Ligurian bees to the blazes on the island, Davis hopes relocating the remainder to unburnt forest and a food supply of eucalypt sugar gums will save them. Kangaroo Island, about 15,000km away from the Ligurian bees' ancestral home of Italy, is believed to host the world's last genetically pure population of the species. </p><p>READ: Dust storms and giant hail batter bushfire-weary Australia The bees were imported to South Australia in 1885 and officials banned the introduction of any other bee species or honey since, making it a sanctuary for Ligurian bees. Italy's pure stock of the bees was wiped out due to interbreeding and disease. Bushfires burnt a third of Kangaroo Island over New Year, killing two people and destroying an estimated quarter of the island's 4,000 Ligurian hives as well as the eucalypts that feed that the bees. \"The main tree for food at this time of the year is the Sugar Gum, Eucalyptus cladocalyx, that grows all along the North Coast which has been devastated by fire,\" another Kangaroo Island Ligurian honey producer, David Clifford, told Reuters. \"So we are not going to get a honey supply from that this year and it will take 15 years for it to recover.\" While Clifford's bees escaped the flames, he said the insects appeared \"very disorientated\" and \"more aggressive\" than usual after they were relocated. Davis said the destruction has lost him about 20 tonnes of honey for this season alone and cost him an estimated A$500,000 (US$340,000) including lost production from the surviving hives. Ligurian honey is used to make a range of high-end products including hand creams and candles. READ: Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires Davis was only able to start moving his hives to a safer home this week, having spent the last few weeks fighting fires. \"We have been trying to protect neighbours, trying to protect houses, livestock,\" he said. Davis urged the government to lift restrictions on the island that ban farmers from reducing fuel loads in bushland areas through preemptive burning. \"We wouldn't have lost farms and houses like we have if we had been allowed to burn and use fire as a management tool,\" he said. - Reuters/aa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12295766</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1H-X5D1-JCDN-118C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><timeReceived>8:24 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

According to news reports, at least 28 people have died with more than 2,000 homes destroyed. </p><p>WRI stated unprecedented dryness, high temperatures and strong winds created a tinderbox, carrying fires over larger distances and engulfing more towns than ever before. </p><p>It got worse due to the fact that Australia has experienced rainfall deficits over the past 20 months greater than any other time on record. </p><p>The fires could result in A$5 billion (RM14 billion) in direct losses to the Australian economy. </p><p>According to WRI, based on scientists' estimates, Australia's recent fires killed roughly a billion animals, and some species may not be able to recover. </p><p>\"Fires are moving too fast for dehydrated animals to get out of the way, and they are burning too hot to leave any trees standing in their wake. Many surviving animals have no safe habitat in which to retreat,\" it said. </p><p>\"The lasting damages could be severe and irreparable for some species. We found that about 40% of the fires are burning on legally protected areas like national parks and conservation zones, areas especially important for animals that reside only in Australia's unique forest ecosystems, such as koalas and brush-tailed rock wallabies,\" it explained. </p><p>Fires are also burning in and around Australia's Alliance for Zero Extinction sites, threatening the very existence of entire species like the Wollemi pine tree and the Corroboree frog. </p><p>The US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently warned the smoke from the Australian bushfires may travel \"full circuit\" around the world, before returning to the country. </p><p>\"The smoke had a dramatic impact on New Zealand, causing severe air quality issues across the county and visibly darkening mountaintop snow. Beyond New Zealand, the smoke has now tra- velled more than halfway around the Earth, crossing South America, turning the skies hazy, and cau- sing colourful sunrises and sunsets. It is expected to make at least one full circuit, returning once again to the skies over Australia,\" he said. </p><p>\"The radiative heating from the soot particles within the smoke makes wildfire plumes particularly buoyant, meaning they will reach higher altitudes in the stra- tosphere and stay there longer than material from a volcanic eruption that reaches the same initial altitude,\" said Jean-Paul Vernier, a senior scientist at the National Institute of Aerospace at NASA Langley Research Centre and the lead of a NASA disasters team responding to the fires.  heating from the soot particles within the smoke makes wildfire plumes particularly buoyant, meaning they will reach higher altitudes in the stra- tosphere and stay there longer than material from a volcanic eruption that reaches the same initial altitude,\" said Jean-Paul Vernier, a senior scientist at the National Institute of Aerospace at NASA Langley Research Centre and the lead of a NASA disasters team responding to the fires.

Although there's no safe level of air pollution, the health hazards tend to be greatest for vulnerable groups. Alongside people with pre-existing conditions, smoke exposure presents unique risks for pregnant women. Research shows prolonged exposure to bushfire smoke increases the risk of pregnancy complications including high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, low birth weight and premature birth (before 37 weeks). READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires threaten drinking water safety. </p><p>The consequences could last decades These conditions can have short-term and lifelong effects on a baby's health, with increased risk of conditions including cerebral palsy and visual or hearing impairment. Even babies born only a few weeks early can experience learning difficulties and behavioural problems, and have an elevated risk of heart disease in later life. So it's especially important pregnant women protect themselves from exposure to bushfire smoke. WHY PREGNANT WOMEN ARE AT HIGHER RISK Pregnant women breathe at an increased rate, and their hearts need to work harder than those of non-pregnant people to transport oxygen to the fetus. This makes them particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution, including bushfire smoke. We often measure poor air quality by the presence of ultra-fine particles called PM2.5 (small particles of less than 2.5 micrometres in size). These particles are concerning because they can penetrate into our lungs, and into blood and tissue to cause inflammation throughout the body. Importantly in pregnant women, environmental pollutants can cause inflammatory damage to the placenta's blood supply. This can interfere with the placenta's development and function, which can in turn compromise the growth of the fetus. SPIKES IN PREMATURE BIRTHS AND OTHER RISKS Many studies have linked poor air quality, particularly high PM2.5 levels, to poor pregnancy outcomes. Data from 183 countries showed in 2010, an estimated 2.7 million premature births, 18 per cent of the total, were associated with PM2.5 pollution. A 2019 study of more than 500,000 pregnant women from Colorado looked at the effect of bushfire smoke on pregnancy outcomes. The authors analysed data on air quality, fire incidence and pregnancy and birth records from 2007-2015, during which time Colorado was regularly affected by smoke from fires burning in California and the Pacific Northwest. READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance The study found PM2.5 due to bushfire smoke was linked to spikes in premature birth, especially in women exposed during the second trimester. In women exposed to smoke during the \ufb01rst trimester, birth weight was lower than average. Further, exposure during any trimester increased the chance of gestational diabetes and high blood pressure. The effects were detectable even with low exposure to smoke and small increases in PM2.5. For every 1 microgram per cubic metres increase in average daily exposure to PM2.5 during the second trimester of pregnancy, the risk of premature birth increased by 13 per cent. READ: Commentary: Air pollution's nasty effects should motivate stronger action but hasn't To put this into context, in Canberra in the first week of January, PM2.5 levels averaged more than 200 micrograms per cubic metre, compared with the typical background concentration of 5 micrograms per cubic metres. Victorian environment authorities classify PM2.5 levels above 25 micrograms per cubic metres as unsafe for vulnerable people. In another large study, a 24 per cent increase in premature birth was seen after 10 micrograms per cubic metres increase in PM2.5. As well as PM2.5, bushfire smoke contains larger PM10 particles, nitric oxides, carbon monoxide and other gases and toxic chemicals. These all have potential to impair lung and heart function in the mother, activate inflammation, and directly affect fetal and placental development. READ: Commentary: We call it climate change. It's more like a global health crisis Air quality is also a factor for couples attempting to conceive or dealing with infertility. Population studies suggest air pollution compromises human fertility by reducing ovarian reserve (the number of eggs in the ovary) and affecting sperm number and movement. Direct exposure to fire, burns and fire retardant chemicals can also negatively impact fertility. PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE IF YOU'RE PREGNANT The best strategy is to reduce smoke exposure as much as possible. Recommendations include staying inside on high-risk days, sealing the house to prevent smoke infiltration and using air conditioning to keep cool. Avoid creating smoke by cigarette smoking, burning candles, or frying and grilling. Use PM2 (N95) masks and air-filtering devices if possible, and avoid exposure to ash, which contains particulate material you can inhale. Pregnant women in a fire region should carefully follow emergency services' direction. It's better to evacuate early, with an emergency supply kit containing clothes, medications, water and food you don't need to cook. Make sure your medication and prenatal vitamins are accessible, continue to take them, and stay well hydrated. Inform authorities and shelters you are pregnant and need to maintain your antenatal care. READ: Commentary: Miscarriages affect 1 in 6 pregnancies - but is rarely caused by anything the mother did Be aware of the signs of premature labour including abdominal cramps or contractions, a heavy vaginal discharge, loss of fluid or vaginal bleeding, pelvic pressure and low backache. Seek help if you think you may be going into labour. Given what we know about the consequences of poor air quality on pregnancy outcomes, it's critical pregnant women are given top priority when it comes to bushfire relief and health care support.

Elephants and their mahouts held up placards saying \"Pray for Australia,\" with pictures and cartoons of animals at the event organized by the Ayutthaya Elephant Palace &amp; Royal Kraal, a local tourist attraction. \"Today I want to send my support to all wild animals in Australia. I want all the animals to hang in there, and I want all of them in Australia to stay alive,\" said primary school student Laksaporn Loetpiriyakamol. The Australian government has called the bushfires crisis engulfing the country \"an ecological disaster\", with up to a billion animals killed or at risk in the aftermath. Those affected include populations of koalas and rock wallabies, along with critically endangered species including the regent honeyeater bird and the western ground parrot. \"The elephants are really sad what's happening for their cousins in Australia,\" said Michelle Reedy, an Australian volunteer at the camp. Elephants are culturally significant in Thailand. They are the Southeast Asian kingdom's national animal and are important in its history and literature.

The Animal Rescue Craft Guild said on Monday (Jan 6) it has been deluged with offers of help after putting out a call for volunteers to make bat wraps, joey pouches, birds nests, possum boxes, koala mittens and other snuggly homes for marsupials. Donations to the volunteer-run group have come in from as far afield as the United States, Britain, Hong Kong, France and Germany. </p><p>READ: Wildlife ravaged by Australia fires could take decades to recover \"It's been going crazy,\" Belinda Orellana, a founding member of the guild, told Reuters. \"The response has been amazing.\" Blazes across Australia in recent weeks have scorched through 8 million hectares of bushland, an area the size of Austria. Some experts estimates put the number of animals, including domestic pets and livestock, killed as high as half a billion, with potentially hundreds of thousands of injured and displaced native wildlife. \"It's the poor little souls that survived where we come in,\" said Orellana. \"Our group creates and supplies items to rescue groups and carers around the country who take in and care for the wildlife.\" READ: SAF working with Australia to identify support options over bushfires: Australian PM <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/arfsncrafts/posts/116145636510628?__tn__=-R\">https://www.facebook.com/arfsncrafts/posts/116145636510628?__tn__=-R</url> Orellana said the guild supplied thousands of rescue groups around the country and demand was growing, adding there was urgent need for fabric donations. Originally formed a few months ago to make dog and cat beds and coats for animal pounds, the guild's Facebook page has 75,000 members. READ: Australian bushfires hit businesses, damage still being assessed Many of the crafters have crocheted, knitted and sewed a range of items including koala mittens for burned paws and pouches for infant \"joey\" kangaroos who have lost their mothers. Lara Mackay, a new volunteer who lives in New Zealand, has just made her first makeshift joey pouch, which she enlisted her cat to test out at home.

Closer to the fires, Simone Watts in the Blue Mountains outside of Sydney, saw the plea for help and set to work turning pillow cases into beds for bats or flying foxes. \"I looked at the list of what is most needed versus my fairly basic sewing capability and decided I could contribute the bat wraps,\" Watts said.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159174296527678&amp;set=g.2414894225229792&amp;type=1&amp;ifg=1\">https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10159174296527678&amp;set=g.2414894225229792&amp;type=1&amp;ifg=1</url> - Reuters/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12237288</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXB-BHP1-JCDN-146P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><timeReceived>7:38 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Led by Bear, a border collie and Australian cattle dog cross, Detection Dogs for Conservation saved more than 100 koalas in the country's worst summer of fires in decades from late 2019 to early 2020. About 6,000 koalas were killed and thousands of hectares of their natural habitat destroyed. </p><p>READ: Koala bushfire victims start to return home amid wider fears for Australia's wildlife Almost exactly a year since the first fires of that season started, Bear is back, with a focus on the northern state of Queensland. \"While it is unlikely that we will see bushfires to the scale of last year, we are still preparing for multiple fires that can impact many hectares of koala habitat during the next fire season,\" said Detection Dogs founder Romane Cristescu, an ecologist at the University of the Sunshine Coast. \"In places such as Queensland and New South Wales, where populations are already declining, every koala counts,\" she added. Fires razed more than 11 million hectares of bushland across Australia's southeast during what Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the country's \"black summer\", killing at least 33 people and billions of native animals. The Bureau of Meteorology is expecting a cooler, rainier spring for most of the country, although northern states like Queensland may experience above average temperatures. - Reuters/dv</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-13109312</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V4-G261-JCDN-1016-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"256\"/><timeReceived>9:17 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

As wildfires rage through eastern Australia, the New South Wales state fire service's Fires Near Me smartphone app has become one of the country's top ranked apps, downloaded by 1.6 million people, or 6 per cent of the population, in November and December alone. The current version of the app was developed by tech firm ARQ Group Ltd and is managed by a 55-person support team around the clock. </p><p>ARQ has already replicated the system in smaller South Australia state, but CEO Tristan Sternson said the app is up for sale amid a company-wide restructure. ARQ, which has a string of tech-related businesses, appointed Macquarie Group Ltd as an adviser in September following a fall in revenues. \"We have had quite a few interested parties with either (some) or all parts of the business, and we're just trying to work out the right path forward,\" said Sternson by phone. ARQ, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with its goal of taking the product Australia-wide and Sternson said it has been approached by other states. \"If you cross from New South Wales to Victoria, you probably shouldn't have to switch off one app and pick up the next one because you're in Albury or Wodonga,\" he said, referring to cities 8km apart but in different states. A spokeswoman for South Australia's Fire and Emergency Services Commission, which launched its app in December, said it \"welcomes the opportunity for a more consistent approach\". Victoria state's Emergency Management Victoria, which has an emergency app, was not immediately available for comment. Australia's devastating bushfire season has been fanned strong winds, high temperatures and three years of drought. Halfway into summer, fires have destroyed 10.3 million hectares, killed 28 people and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. Sternson, who had a family member lose a farm in the fires, said his support team risked exhaustion due to \"the time it's been going for\", particularly since some staff were personally affected. \"You can see out there how communities have come together and how different people are trying to support the (fire) fighting and the rebuild,\" he said. \"This is our way of being able to support the service.\" - Reuters/jt</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12260670</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y01-4951-DYWP-R3YV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

On Saturday (Jan 4), the New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) warned that a fire on the coast was generating its own weather system 287 km south of Sydney. READ: 'Too late to leave': Bushfires out of control across southeast Australia READ: First Australian bushfire evacuees land in Melbourne \"A fire-generated thunderstorm has formed over the Currowan fire on the northern edge of the fire near Nowra. </p><p>This is a very dangerous situation. Monitor the conditions around you and take appropriate action,\" the RFS said on social media. The weather conditions are the results of the formation of pyrocumulonimbus clouds. They have been recorded all over the world but as the global climate changes, they may become a more frequent occurrence for Australians, the country's Climate Council said in a 2019 report. A RFS firefighter was killed on Monday by a fire tornado caused by the collapse of a pyrocumulonimbus cloud formation that rolled over the fire truck he was in. Shane Fitzsimmons, the NSW RFS commissioner, pointed to that death when asked about the fire-induced weather patterns. \"That extraordinary event resulted in cyclonic-type base flipping over a 10-tonne truck. That is the volatility and danger that exists,\" he said. The pyrocumulonimbus clouds are essentially a thunderstorm that forms from the smoke plume of a fire as intense heat from the fire causes air to rise rapidly, drawing in cooler air, according to information from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. As the cloud climbs and then cools in the low temperatures of the upper atmosphere, the collisions of ice particles in the higher parts of the cloud build up an electrical charge, which can be released as lightning. These can cause dangerous and unpredictable changes in fire behaviour, making them harder to fight as well as causing lightning strikes that could ignite new fires. The rising air also spurs intense updrafts that suck in so much air that strong winds develop, causing a fire to burn hotter and spread further. - Reuters/ic</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12233238</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XX0-1Y31-DYWP-R46F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><timeReceived>3:29 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The death toll is rising, thousands of buildings have been destroyed and whole communities displaced. This scale is like nothing before, and the national response must be like nothing that has come before. Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday (Jan 5) somewhat acknowledged the need for unprecedented action. </p><p>He took the extraordinary step of calling up 3,000 Australian Defence Force reservists and mobilising navy ships and military bases to aid the emergency response. This has never before happened in Australia at this scale. But it's not enough. As this horrific summer of disaster continues to unfold in coming weeks, we clearly need to overhaul our emergency management plan with a workforce that's large, nationally mobile, fully funded, and paid - rather than using under-resourced volunteers. READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance The United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction says weather and climate related disasters have more than doubled over the last 40 years. Although expensive, the cost of not acting on disaster risk, planning and preparation will be greatly outstripped by the cost of future climate and weather catastrophes. DISASTER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM NEEDS UPGRADING The states and territories are primarily responsible for disaster preparedness and response. Typically, the federal government has no direct responsibility, but lends a hand when asked through a variety of programmes, policies and initiatives. This may have worked in the past. But with ever larger and more complex disasters, these arrangements are no longer fit for purpose. Australia's national emergency management workforce is largely made up of volunteers, who are stretched to the bone, exhausted and some say, under-resourced. What's more, experts led by former Fire and Rescue New South Wales (NSW) commissioner Greg Mullins have called for significant changes in Australia's disaster management preparedness and response. They've signalled the need for new resources, policies and processes to tackle more frequent and complex disasters. We've also seen how consultation and collaboration between Australia's federal and state governments are not working smoothly. NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons only learned that Defence reservists would be deployed when it was reported in the media. And it wasn't immediately clear how new reservists would be integrated into existing response activities. FINDING A BIPARTISAN WAY FORWARD The decade-long ideological battle between the left and right of Australian politics has paralysed climate policy development. This cannot continue. Well-funded disaster preparedness and response inevitably builds resilience to climate change and extreme weather events like bushfires. This is something both sides of politics agree on - in fact, it was noted in the federal government's own recent report profiling our vulnerability to disasters and climate change. READ: Commentary: Bushfires in Australia and adapting holidays to a hotter, drier world Aside from needing bipartisanship, an overhaul of Australia's disaster management will require money. While Australia is lucky to have a dedicated, paid and exceptional set of state and territory disaster and emergency management agencies such as the NSW Rural Fire Service, most heavy lifting is done by agency volunteers. But with fire seasons starting earlier and lasting longer, we can no longer rely for months at a time on volunteers who must also work, pay their bills and feed their families. We need a larger, paid, trained, professional emergency management workforce. I reject claims that such a workforce would stand idle most of the year. Severe weather seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer, so these professionals will be busy. The workforce could be divided in to areas of expertise to tackle specific disaster types, and focus on different aspects of the disaster cycle such as prevention and preparation. These continue year-round. Alternatively, volunteers could be compensated through direct payments for lost income, tax offsets for volunteers and their employers, or rent or mortgage assistance. READ: Commentary: How data-sharing by Big Tech can save lives in disasters, solve new problems What's more, a new national disaster management approach must intersect with state and local governments to help reduce disaster risk. These might include contributing to land-use zoning plans, building design and standards for construction in at-risk areas, or building partnerships with the private sector. FUNDING DISASTER PREPAREDNESS All this will cost money. Australia must accept that taxpayers will pay for future disaster preparedness, response and recovery. We need a bucket of cash for when disasters strike. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced A$2 billion (US$1.4 billion) for recovery, but disaster funds should be ongoing. This would be no different to the national Medical Future Research Fund - a A$20 billion fund to focus on solving nationally important medical issues funded through savings from the health budget. There are several ways the money could be gathered. Commonwealth, state and territory governments could rethink their insistence on achieving budget surpluses, and instead spend money on a disaster fund. A \"disaster levy\" could be applied to household rates bills, a tax on carbon introduced, or planned tax cuts for middle and high income earners abandoned. The public could also contribute to the fund directly. The ABC's recent Australia Talks survey found on average, Australians would be willing to chip in A$200 each per year to pay for adaptation to climate change. READ: Commentary: How effectively can Singapore adapt to sea level rise? If every Australian contributed, there's another A$5 billion per year for the fund. Future disaster management will require Australia to step up. It means making hard choices about what we want the future to be like, how we'll pay for that, and what level of risk we are prepared to tolerate. It also means demanding that our leaders deliver meaningful climate change adaptation, including disaster planning.

They can damage water supply infrastructure and water catchments, impeding the treatment processes that normally make our water safe to drink. Several areas in New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria have already been issued with warnings about the quality of their drinking water. SHORT-TERM RISKS Bushfires can damage or disrupt water supply infrastructure as they burn. </p><p>And the risks can persist after the fires are out. A loss of power, for example, disables important water treatment processes such as chlorine disinfection, needed to kill microorganisms and make our water safe to drink. Drinking water for the towns of Eden and Boydtown on the NSW south coast has been affected in this way over recent days. Residents have been advised to boil their water before drinking it and using it for cooking, teeth brushing, and so on. READ: Australia issues new evacuation alerts as monster bushfires regenerate Other towns including Cobargo and Bermagui received similar warnings on New Year's Eve. In some cases, untreated water, straight from a river supply, may be fed directly into drinking water systems. Water treatment plants are bypassed completely, due to damage, power loss, or an inability to keep pace with high volumes of water required for firefighting. We've seen this in a number of southern NSW towns this week including Batlow, Adelong, Tumbarumba, and the southern region of Eurobodalla Council, stretching from Moruya to Tilba. Residents of these areas have also been urged to boil their drinking water. READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance Untreated river water, or river water which has not been properly disinfected with chlorine, is usually not safe for drinking in Australia. Various types of bacteria, as well as the parasites giardia and cryptosporidium, could be in such water. Animals including cattle, birds and kangaroos can excrete these microorganisms into river water. Septic tanks and sewage treatment plants may also discharge effluents into waterways, adding harmful microorganisms. Human infection with these microorganisms can cause a range of illnesses, including gastrointestinal diseases with symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting. LONG-TERM RISKS Bushfires can damage drinking water catchments, which can lead to longer term threats to drinking water. Drinking water catchments are typically forested areas, and so are vulnerable to bushfire damage. Severe impacts to waterways may not occur until after intense rainfall. Heavy rain can wash ash and eroded soil from the fires into waterways, affecting drinking water supplies downstream. For example, bushfire ash contains nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorous. Increased nutrient concentrations can stimulate the growth of cyanobacteria, commonly known as \"blue-green algae\". READ: Australian authorities warn bushfire reprieve will be over soon Cyanobacteria produce chemicals which may cause a range of water quality problems, including poor taste and odour. Some cyanobacteria can produce toxic chemicals, requiring very careful management to protect treated drinking water. Many water treatment plants include filtration processes to filter small suspended particles from the water. But an increase in suspended particles, like that which we see after bushfires, would challenge most filtration plants. The suspended particles would be removed, but they would clog the filters, requiring them to be more frequently pulled from normal operation and cleaned. This cleaning, or backwashing, is a normal part of the treatment process. But if more time must be spent backwashing, that's less time the filters are working to produce drinking water. And if the rate of drinking water filtration is slowed and fails to keep pace with demand, authorities may place limitations on water use. BOILING WATER NOT ALWAYS ENOUGH In order to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal and other illnesses, water suppliers and health departments may issue a boil water alert, as we've seen in the past week. Bringing water to a \"rolling boil\" can reliably kill most of the microorganisms of concern. In cases where water may be contaminated with chemical substances rather than microorganisms, boiling is usually not effective. So where there's a risk of chemical contamination, public health messages are usually \"do not drink tap water\". This means bottled water only. Such \"do not drink\" alerts were issued this week following bushfire impacts to water treatment plants supplying the Victorian towns of Buchan and Omeo. Impacts to catchments from bushfires and subsequent erosion can have long-lasting effects, potentially worsening untreated drinking water quality for many years, even decades. Following these bushfires, many water treatment plant operators and catchment managers will need to adapt to changed conditions and brace for more extreme weather events in the future.

The warning from the world's biggest miner underscores how an unusually long bushfire season that has scorched an area one-third the size of Germany is damaging the world's No. 14 economy. Australia's tourism and insurance industries have already foreshadowed they face a AUS$1 billion (\u00a3528.76 million) hit each from the fires. \"Smoke from regional bushfires and dust have reduced air quality at our operations, which has impacted December 2019 production,\" BHP said in a trading update, referring to its energy coal plants in New South Wales state where hundreds of fires have raged. </p><p>\"If air quality continues to deteriorate then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year,\" it added. The fires have killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares of wilderness since September. Even with thunderstorms and rain in recent days, scores of fires are still burning on the east coast. The disruption has extended to the capital, Canberra, and its two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, all of which have been repeatedly blanketed in thick smoke that has earned them air quality ratings among the worst in the world. Last week, a tennis player collapsed during a qualifying round at the Australian Open tournament in Melbourne due to inhaling bushfire smoke, although the competition has continued in more moderate weather this week. The Bureau of Meteorology forecast rising temperatures in the state of Victoria on Wednesday, combined with strong winds, creating a new risk of bushfires. The New South Wales Rural Fire Service issued a high fire danger rating for Tuesday on the state's south coast. The NSW state government, meanwhile, said it was increasing a grant for primary producers affected by the fires to AUS$75,000, from AUS$15,000 previously. \"Putting money back in people's pockets as soon as possible will allow affected communities to focus on rebuilding and repairing crucial infrastructure, treating, euthanising or burying livestock, as well as buying much-needed fodder,\" said Minister for Agriculture Adam Marshall. Here are key events in the bushfire crisis: * Early on Tuesday, 86 fires were burning across New South Wales, none above the lowest warning level. There were 27 emergency warnings in Victoria, including one flash flood warning. * The Bureau of Meteorology warned the East Gippsland region to expect strong winds after thunderstorms rolled through a day earlier. Earlier this month, people in East Gippsland were evacuated by Navy ships as bushfires destroyed whole towns. * The Australian Open tennis tournament continues in Melbourne. The city's air quality was rated as \"good\", according to the Air Quality Index, having been \"hazardous\" less than a week earlier. * The tennis community has raised more than AUS$50 million for bushfire relief, according to Tennis Australia. - Reuters/de</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12294160</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1G-XKB1-JCDN-10MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><timeReceived>11:49 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Derouin, from Sturgeon County in Alberta, began reading about the extent of Australia's bushfires in October, but as November and December passed by with an increasing amount of damage wrought by the blazes, the Canadian's heartstrings pulled him to do something about it. With no plan and despite not even telling one of his three daughters, Derouin flew to Australia on New Year's Day - all on his own dime. </p><p>\"We can send money too but rather be here on the ground and help out,\" Derouin told Reuters on Saturday (Jan 11). READ: \"Get out\" - Australians urged to flee as huge bushfires revitalise READ: Bushfires bring fears of \"new normal\" to life Down Under Derouin, who has 30 years of firefighting experience, first offered his services to the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Headquarters in Sydney, but had no luck finding a brigade. He decided to head south, where he ended up in Cooma and joined a crew, stationed in the small town of Adaminaby in the Snowy Mountains. He was immediately put to task, fighting the Adaminaby Complex bushfire in and around the Kosciuszko National Park, although he admittedly said he stumbled with the local lingo. \"There's a barrier, there's something I'm having trouble with,\" Derouin said. \"It's good and the guys are good. But firefighting, the camaraderie is great, I mean that's unequalled.\" READ: Australia fires - RSAF Chinooks to bring relief supplies, help with evacuation Bushfire conditions eased in Australia on Saturday after a gruelling night for firefighters, with authorities saying they expect at least a week of milder weather in which to step up defences against the huge blazes still burning. Cooler temperatures and rainfall had eased conditions after Friday's strong southerly wind change that packed gusts of more than 100 kph (60 mph), whipping some fires on the east coast up to the emergency warning level. The Adaminaby Complex bushfire along with several other blazes in New South Wales and across into Victoria merged across more than 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres) of land as a result of Friday's conditions. About 100 firefighters from the United States and Canada are helping across Australia, with another 140 expected in coming weeks. Derouin plans to return to Canada on Jan 14. - Reuters/hs</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12254654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYF-V6K1-JCDN-12TB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"409\"/><timeReceived>11:22 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

For nearly two days over New Year the brothers battled fierce blazes that tore through the family's farms, the flames igniting on multiple fronts and wiping out almost everything in their path. The pair's father, Robert, and brother, Patrick, died trying to defend their properties. All the family farms were burned to ashes and debris, and hundreds of cattle killed. </p><p>\"I keep saying to myself that it's not that bad, but it is that bad. It's f****** terrible,\" said Tim Salway, 42, shaking his head in disbelief at he looked at his burnt out dairy farm near the town of Cobargo in New South Wales state. Warren Salway fought back tears as he described his anguish at discovering his brother and father had died, and how other farmers donated their hay to keep his farm going. \"People have just turned up, they all want to help,\" he said. READ: Hot and dry Australia could join the ranks of 'climate refugees' The scale of the recovery facing the two fifth-generation farmers is huge. Destroyed machinery, felled trees and blackened farmland were surrounded by miles of damaged fencing on Tim Salway's farm. Metal tanks were melted and hay and cattle sheds worth tens of thousands of dollars were flattened. Salway lost 170 cows, including one that was so badly burned that it had to be shot. \"They're the only heifers I've got left,\" he said, pointing to 30 cows gathering curiously, the sky behind them blanketed by haze from fires still burning on the other side of the valley. \"I've got no heifers for the next three years, they all got wiped in the fire. Just in cattle, if I look to replace them you're looking at A$300,000 (US$207,000).\" Monster bushfires have razed bushland equivalent to the size of Bulgaria since the start of October, killing 28 people, destroying more than 2,500 homes and killing millions of animals. \"The noise of it was like jumbo jets ... It snapped trees in half,\" Tim Salway said of the fires that destroyed much of the Cobargo farms. \"I watched the flames get sucked down the hill, there was a boom, an almighty thump. It was my dad and my brother. It's like a bomb's gone off.\" Warren Salway's wife Helen, who has cancer, took refuge in a nearby town while he raced through smoke-filled lanes to get back to his cattle farm, twice running his truck off the road. \"ANNIHILATED\" The bushfires crisis deals a further blow to farmers already struggling following a three-year drought, which has been credited with fuelling the fires. \"It's just annihilated us,\" said Warren Salway. \"It's just numbness.\" READ: Australia's massive fires could become routine, climate scientists warn Salway spent more than a day using a bulldozer and excavator to bury 145 cows and 80 sheep. Many of the cows he found alive had to be shot due to their burns. \"Years and years of breeding and you see them laying in a heap just dead,\" he said. \"That's what you live for, your animals.\" Tony Allen, a former local mayor whose own farm had a lucky escape, said the crisis was a wake-up call for policy makers to support an industry already doing it tough. \"The decision is do you want to keep an industry going, do you want to feed Australians with Australian food, or do you want to let the industry just evaporate and live off imported product?\" he said. Tim Salway said quitting was not on his mind, but he doubted the family business would survive into a sixth generation. \"I've got four kids and unless it improves, none of them will be taking this over,\" he said. \"Why do you want to do that to them?\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12264810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y08-3201-JCDN-1229-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><timeReceived>7:04 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

As many as 5,850 fire-related insurance claims have been lodged since early November with insured losses estimated at A$375 million (US$260.3 million), according to the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA). However, with conditions still too dangerous in many areas, the full cost of the disaster is not expected to be known for several weeks. The fires have ripped through more than 6 million hectares of land in the two most populous states of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria, killing 24 people so far, razing thousands of buildings and leaving some towns without electricity and mobile coverage. READ: SAF working with Australia to identify support options over bushfires: Australian PM Aspen Group, which owns tourist parks in idyllic beach towns like Tomakin on the NSW south coast, said on Monday (Jan 6) it has turned away holidaymakers from its rentals as a result of the fires and expects a hit of at least A$500,000 to its revenue. </p><p>\"Fire activity along the NSW south coast has been catastrophic with significant loss of life, housing and infrastructure,\" Aspen said in a statement. \"Tourists and residents have been asked to leave the region. It is not known when trading conditions will return to normal,\" it said, although none of its properties have been affected by the fires. Vitalharvest Freehold Trust, which leases farms to Australia's largest listed fruit and vegetables grower Costa Group, said the fires had damaged a packing shed, including equipment and vehicles at one of its berry farms. The farm comprises about 6 per cent of Vitalharvest's berry plantings, it said, adding a full assessment was yet to be carried out. Kangaroo Island Plantation Timbers requested a trading halt on the stock exchange until Tuesday, pending an announcement on the \"current fire situation.\" Kangaroo Island is a popular holiday spot in South Australia where two people died as dangerous fires burned over the weekend. Last week, Insurance Australia Group said it expected to pay roughly A$400 million in natural peril claims for the six months to Dec 31. That is more than half of its A$641 million natural peril allowance for the fiscal year. Rival Suncorp said it had received more than 1,500 claims since the fires began in November. \"However, the full impact will not be known for several weeks until areas are safe to access.\" FIRE HIT KEY DIARY REGIONS, ADD WOES FROM DROUGHT Bushfires across Australia's east coast are set to pile on more pain for the country's dairy industry, already hurt by a prolonged drought, as processors in one of the world's largest exporters face tightening milk supplies. The fires have swept through major dairy areas along the New South Wales south coast, where many producers have faced a three-year drought, and East Gippsland in Victoria. Bushfire-affected regions account for about a third of the country's milk output, data from industry group Dairy Australia shows. \"It isn't yet possible to get a full picture,\" said Phin Ziebell, agribusiness analyst, National Australia Bank. \"Hundreds, perhaps thousands of cattle will have been lost. We have to wait for the full assessment but the impact will be devastating.\" Australia is the world's seventh-largest dairy exporter, supplying mainly Asian markets with products such as fresh milk, butter and cheese, as well as milk powder. Dairy is the country's fourth-biggest rural industry, worth A$3.3 billion (US$2.3 billion), according to government figures. Even before the fires, Australia's milk production was set to fall to a 22-year low due to drought, according to country's chief commodity forecaster, leaving processors scrambling for sufficient supplies to meet demand. \"The processors were already under pressure beforehand as Australian milk production falls,\" said Michael Harvey, a dairy analyst at Rabobank. Many farmers are now struggling to secure feed for their cattle, which could affect both milk production and breeding. \"Many roads are closed so we can't get fodder to farmers who need feed,\" said Paul Mumford, a dairy farmer in Won Wron, 210 km east of Melbourne. \"The fires have primarily killed the youngest in the herd. It will take years to rebuild,\" he added. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday nearly 4,000 livestock had been killed by the fires. Bega Cheese, the biggest Australian-owned processor, said on Monday the fires had not directly affected its production facilities, but had hurt some suppliers. \"We are working closely with our employees, dairy farm suppliers and freight providers to ensure milk can be delivered and processed,\" said chief executive Paul van Heerwaarden. Bega shares fell as much as 10 per cent on Monday. Other big processors include Murray Goulburn, owned by Canada's Saputo, and New Zealand's Fonterra. - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12236846</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXB-BHP1-JCDN-146S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"834\"/><timeReceived>4:55 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Already more than 1,500 homes have been destroyed - with months still to go in the bushfire season. Compare this to 2009, when Victoria's \"Black Saturday\" fires claimed more than 2,000 homes in February, or 1983, when the \"Ash Wednesday\" fires destroyed about 2,400 homes in Victoria and South Australia, also in February. The 2020 fire season could end up surpassing these tragedies, despite the lessons learned and improvements in preparedness. </p><p>READ: Australia fires: RSAF Chinooks to bring relief supplies, help with evacuation One lesson not really learned, though, is that home insurance is rarely sufficient to enable recovery. The evidence is many people losing their homes will find themselves unable to rebuild, due to lack of insurance. We know this from interviews with those affected by the October 2013 Blue Mountains bushfires (in which almost 200 homes were destroyed). Despite past disasters, more than 65 per cent of households affected were underinsured. Research published by the Victorian government in 2017, meanwhile, estimated just 46 per cent Victorian households have enough insurance to recover from a disaster, with 28 per cent underinsured and 26 per cent having no insurance. The consequences aren't just personal. They potentially harm local communities permanently, as those unable to rebuild move away. Communities lose the vital knowledge and social networks that make them resilient to disaster. MISCALCULATING REBUILDING COSTS All too often the disaster of having your home and possessions razed by fire is followed by the disaster of realising by how much you are underinsured. As researchers into the impact of fires, we are interested why people find themselves underinsured. Our research, which includes interviewing those who have have lost their homes, shows it is complicated, and not necessarily due to negligence. READ: Australia prepares for renewed bushfire threat as economic costs mount READ: Commentary: Bushfires in Australia and adapting holidays to a hotter, drier world For example, a woman who lost her home in Kinglake, northeast of Melbourne, in the 2009 fires, told us how her insurance calculations turned out to bear no resemblance to the actual cost of rebuilding. \"You think okay, this is what I paid for the property,\" she said. \"I think we had about A$550,000 (US$380,000) on the house, and the contents was maybe A$120,000.\" It was on these estimates that she and her partner took out insurance. She told us: You think sure, yeah, I can rebuild my life with that much money. But nowhere near. Not even close. We wound up with a A$700,000 mortgage at the end of rebuilding. AN EXTRA MORTGAGE A common issue is that people insure based on their home's market value. But rebuilding is often more expensive. For one thing there's the need to comply with new building codes, which have been improved to ensure buildings take into account their potential exposure to bushfire. This is likely to increase costs by 20 per cent or more, but is rarely made clear to insurance customers. READ: Australian bushfire cloud visible in Chile and Argentina Construction costs also often spike following disasters, due to extra demand for building services and materials. A further contributing factor is that banks can claim insurance payments to pay off mortgages, meaning the only way to rebuild is by taking out another mortgage. \"People who owned houses, any money that was owing, everything was taken back to the bank before they could do anything else,\" said a former shop owner from Whittlesea (about 30km west of Kinglake and also severely hit by the 2009 fires). This meant, once banks were paid, people had nothing left to restart. She told us: People came into the shop and cried on my shoulder, and I cried with them. I helped them all I could there. That's probably why we lost the business, because how can you ask people to pay when they've got nothing? UNDERMINING SOCIAL COHESION In rural areas there is often a shortage of rental properties. Insurance companies generally only cover rent for 12 months, which is not enough time to rebuild. For families forced to relocate, moving back can feel disruptive to their recovery. Under-insurance significantly increases the chances those who lose their homes will move away and never return - hampering social recovery and resilience. Residents that cannot afford to rebuild will sell their property, with \"tree changers\" the most likely buyers. Communities not only lose residents with local knowledge and important skills but also social cohesion. Research in both Australia and the United States suggested this can leave those communities less prepared for future disasters. This is because a sense of community is vital to individuals' willingness and ability to prepare for and act in a threat situation. A confidence that others will weigh in to help in turn increases people's confidence and ability to prepare and act. In Whittlesea, for example, residents reported a change in their sense of community cohesion after the Black Saturday fires. \"The newer people coming in,\" one interviewee told us, \"aren't invested like the older people are in the community.\" Australia is one of the few wealthy countries that heavily relies on insurance markets for recovery from disasters. But the evidence suggests this is an increasingly fraught strategy, particularly when rural communities also have to cope with the reality of more intense and frequent extreme weather events. If communities are to recover from bushfires, the nation cannot put its trust in individual insurance policies. What's required is national policy reform to ensure effective disaster preparedness and recovery for all.

His dog is safe and so is a small jar of soil, collected from his grandfather's vineyards. \"It's a bit silly. But these are the things that matter,\" he says. The winemaker in the Snowy Valley of New South Wales has lost a lot over the past few weeks. </p><p>The region has been punished by a devastating bushfire season that has had local communities on edge, and under siege, for weeks. Tumbarumba, a historic timber town, found itself wedged between two large fire fronts that slowly but destructively merged together into a mega fire that on Monday (Jan 20) was still more than 332,100 hectares in size and uncontrolled. Brayne's 10-hectare vineyards are just a small fraction of the vast swathes of bushland and forest - as well as more than local 100 homes - that have burned since the blaze ignited last month. But for the 35-year-old, the personal loss is shattering. \"It ripped up the back of the farm, came through, took out my house and then pushed at the winery. Basically any equipment that wasn't in the main building is gone. All my possessions, the house, it's all gone up,\" he said. The gentle hills of eucalypts that surround his vineyards now resemble a crude and blackened moonscape. The fire came through with such intensity and heat that Brayne's tractors have been left as piles of melted metal. \"The vineyard is heavily fire impacted to the point of being unsalvageable. To resurrect this is to start again, replant and go from there. It's about five years for this site to be back to reproduction,\" he said. Brayne's operation - called Obsession Wines - is boutique. He is one of a handful of cool climate growers in the area, producing and cellaring a variety of grape varieties, uniquely including tempranillo. Many of the vines on the property were planted in the early 1990s but have been completely destroyed. He predicts that he has been left with only about five per cent of his crop. Promising harvests of chardonnay, pinot gris, viognier, and pinot noir planned for February are no more. \"Things were looking really good actually. We'd put a lot more work into here. It was a lot of time, a lot of money and a lot of love that's gone into the site. And to have it ripped out like that, it's pretty hard to take.\" Official wine industry groups have been at pains to emphasise the limited impact of bushfires and residual smoke on Australia's wine production. But while only a small fraction of the country's vineyards have been impacted, those affected have been hit hard. In the Adelaide Hills, a premier wine growing area, bushfires in late December have left many growers reeling. In one night, about one-third of the entire region's vineyards - approximately 1,000 hectares - were hit as some 200 different fires burnt across South Australia. \"Some individuals, businesses and communities have suffered dreadful losses and this must not be downplayed. However, the actual fire footprint to date covers less than one per cent of the total vineyard area in Australia,\" a spokesperson from Wines Australia, a government body responsible for wine research and development, exports and marketing. \"The extended exposure to smoke is a concern - however the geographic spread of the wine sector means that while some areas have been affected the majority has not. Even though smoke haze looks and smells bad, the greater risk to vineyards comes from fresh smoke close to a fire,\" the spokesperson said. Grape growers throughout fire affected areas will be encouraged to have their grapes tested for smoke exposure before they are used for winemaking. But the process is currently lengthy, expensive and comes late in the season for growers, leading to potentially long periods of uncertainty before their grapes can be passed as useable. Smoke taint is damaging; the cost to the industry is assessed at about US$275 million since 2003, according to Wines Australia. \"Laboratories are already braced for an unprecedented level of testing,\" the spokesperson said. Vineyards like Cathy Gairn's Courabyra Wines in Tumbarumba are among those unclear about this season's harvest. A \"beast of a fire\" forced Gairn and her husband to evacuate their property, but the flames skirted the fringes of their property, only scorching fruit on the perimeter of the 27-year-old plantation. \"The fire was coming right over the back and we could see it coming. It was pretty horrific actually. I am absolutely terrified of fires and when we saw that coming I panicked a little bit,\" she said. \"We don't know if we'll even pick anything this year. We're hoping. Our income has been greatly affected. We've got 10 staff who are all out of work at the moment. \"That's going to be a long road back for us.\" The worsening effects of climate change have also posed extra challenges to those in the industry; trying to reestablish vines throughout a prolonged drought will be tough. \"If we're in drought, the whole country is just about buggered,\" Gairn said. \"We've had good irrigation so our wines are good at this stage but in the future, who knows. Water supply is getting harder and harder.\" While the federal government has pledged some financial support and mental counselling to those affected, growers like Adrian Brayne says it is local communities, under strain but in solidarity, that are helping ease the burdens for now. \"We've all had losses of various degrees but there's always someone that's had it worse than you,\" he said. \"Everyone is so generous and we're all about that. Because without a community, why have a business?\" A proud man, he says having to reach out for help - for even the most basic items - has been one of the most difficult obstacles of this episode. He has no home right now and sleeps on a couch with a blanket inside his winery building. \"I'm not one to ask for help. To ask for a handout is pretty tough and probably the hardest thing was going into one of the disaster centres to get a shirt on my back. I didn't think I'd experience that in my life. \"Not having a place, not having a sense of going home. That's a hard one.\" Communities right through the Snowy Valley are hurting, with industry, agriculture and tourism coming to an abject halt. The fire threat continues to hang over to an exhausted population. But when safety and some normality returns to what is a spectacular part of the country, locals hope visitors will too. \"As soon as the people can come in, come. Come spend money in the town, experience what's here. The biggest thing is the air. It's so fresh and clean. It's a beautiful part of the world,\" Brayne said. As he speaks, rain starts to steadily fall on the ashen fire ground. It is a small moment to savour after weeks of pain. He looks to the skies, smiling. \"That's unreal.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12289556</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1G-XKB1-JCDN-10MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1149\"/><timeReceived>10:19 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Over the past few months the bushfires have razed an area roughly a third the size of Germany, killed 29 people, and destroyed more than 2,000 homes. Some 100 fires are burning across the east coast, and authorities battling to contain them reckon most will stay alight until they doused by sustained rain. </p><p>READ: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance READ: Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said there is a 50 per cent chance that the bulk of the country's east will receive average rainfall from Mar 1 through to May 30. Even then, the bureau warned more rains would be needed to end three years of drought on the east coast. \"While outlooks for drier than average conditions have eased compared to those issued for late 2019, several months of above average rainfall are needed to see a recovery from current long-term rainfall deficiencies,\" the bureau said in an emailed statement. The wetter outlook provided some hope for firefighters, who were helped on Thursday by downpours on the east coast. \"Although this rain won't extinguish all fires, it will certainly go a long way towards containment,\" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Twitter. The relief, however, is expected to be temporary, with hot weather forecast to return in coming weeks. - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12267990</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0G-26P1-DYWP-R019-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"259\"/><timeReceived>7:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

While not in any imminent danger from fire, Canberra sits between blazes ravaging the east coast and others inland, and its skies have been darkened by smoke this week.

Many businesses and government departments, including the Department of Home Affairs, ordered non-essential staff to stay home, media reported. Air quality readings show the smoke was at hazardous levels early on Monday - and the worst among all major cities - before wind dispersed some of it during the day. NASA images have shown smoke billowing from Australia's east coast drifting over New Zealand and even reaching South America in less than a week. - Reuters/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12237584</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXB-BHP1-JCDN-146N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><timeReceived>8:22 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Fires have razed more than 8 million hectares of land across Australia, an area nearly the size of Austria, killing 25 people and destroying or damaging thousands of homes. The Insurance Council of Australia increased its estimate for damages claims from the fires to more than A$700 million (US$485.59 million) on Tuesday, with claims expected to jump further when more fire-hit areas are accessible. READ: Australian bushfires hit businesses, damage still being assessed READ: Singapore to send Chinook helicopters to help fight Australian bushfires Thousands of people have been left homeless, while many in rural towns have spent days without electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, drinking water. </p><p>Military-coordinated rescue and support efforts were ongoing. Morrison, who has been criticised for his handling of the crisis, on Monday pledged A$2 billion to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency, a commitment that could threaten his election promise to deliver the first budget surplus in more than a decade this financial year. \"There's going to be a very significant economic impact, but ... we want to get money out into these communities as fast as possible,\" Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told the Australian Broadcasting Corp ahead of planned meetings between Morrison and financial bosses.

The ANZ gauge of consumer confidence fell last week to its lowest level in more than four years, while its job advertisement data recorded the biggest monthly drop in seven months in December. Australia's military were deployed on Tuesday to help bury an estimated 4,000 dead sheep and cattle, a process authorities want to complete quickly to prevent rotting carcasses from spreading disease. Authorities said the number of people calling for urgent medical care in Victoria jumped 51 per cent on Monday as hazardous smoke covered the state. There are 137 fires ablaze across New South Wales state, but all were back at the \"advice\" level, the lowest alert rating. Victoria state had 39 fires with 13 \"watch and act\" alerts. All missing people across the country have been accounted for, authorities said. Almost 1,600 homes have been destroyed in NSW, Australia's most populous state, authorities said. In Victoria state, authorities believe 300 homes have been destroyed. Insurers have received 8,985 bushfire-related claims in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland since the Insurance Council of Australia declared a bushfire catastrophe on Nov. 8. The claims are estimated to have a loss value of A$700 million. The council recorded the destruction of 1,838 residential properties so far. A backbencher in PM Morrison's government was criticised for an appearance on the \"Good Morning Britain\" ITV program during which he said there was no link between climate change and the bushfire crisis. \"There is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment,\" lawmaker Craig Kelly said. - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12239412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXH-B2H1-JCDN-14VM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

A forest fire near the airport in Canberra, which had triggered evacuation warnings in the capital's eastern suburbs on Wednesday, was under control with no properties under threat, the Australian Capital Territory's emergency authority said.

Last week, a player collapsed in a coughing fit from bushfire smoke during qualifying rounds at the tournament. Since September, hundreds of wildfires in Australia have killed 29 people as well as an estimated 1 billion native animals, while incinerating 2,500 homes and a total area of bushland one-third the size of Germany. READ: 'A long road back from here': Small winemakers feel the pain of Australian bushfires The disaster hit the Christmas and summer holiday season, emptying out caravan parks and hotels, devastating peak earnings for businesses dependent on domestic and foreign tourists. \"It has certainly been the worst summer in living memory and arguably it's been the worst summer ever for Australian tourism,\" Australian Tourism Industry Council director Simon Westaway told The Australian newspaper. The Council estimated the immediate loss of revenue at AU$2 billion (US$1.4 billion), including forward sales and the physical damage to tourism facilities across regions ravaged by bushfires. NSW firefighters were tackling 79 incidents, all at advice level, meaning no immediate danger. In Victoria there were 18 blazes, with one of those, in the state's northeast, at the \"watch and act\" warning level. Sydney was set for a hot and windy day, with a high temperature of 41 degrees Celsius, while the capital Canberra was forecast to hit 33 degrees Celsius, facing windy conditions and dust haze, the Bureau of Meteorology said. A Reuters analysis shows that Australian animals living in specific habitats, such as mountain lizards, leaf-tailed geckos and pear-shaped frogs, are battling the threat of extinction after fierce bushfires razed large areas of their homes. - Reuters/nc</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12306956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1X-VYF1-JCDN-1367-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><timeReceived>11:14 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The full extent of the devastation is still unfolding as the authorities work to contain the massive blazes,\" said Mr Benjamin William, secretary-general and CEO of SRC. \"The crisis is expected to escalate in view of the strong winds and persistent drought,\" he added. Mr William said that the Australian Red Cross has been providing support to evacuees in 35 centres across New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. It is also providing psychological first aid, distributing food hampers, water pallets, hygiene items and other essential supplies to the affected communities. \"We continue to be in communication with our counterparts in the Australian Red Cross to ascertain needs and consider further support where needed,\" said Mr William. In Jakarta, the SRC will be sending S$50,000 to support relief and recovery operations by the IndonesianRed Cross, which is also known as Palang Merah Indonesia. The funds will be used to purchase family kits, hygiene kits, diapers, sleeping bags, blankets and clean water for the evacuees, SRC said. \"It's been a challenging time for our neighbours since New Year's Eve. They have endured monsoon downpours, mudslides and power outages,\" said Mr William. \"Even as the current floodwaters subside, the city expects heavy rain and thunderstorms in the days ahead. The search for missing persons is still ongoing, and there is a lot of work to be done,\" he added.

Firefighters have used the break from extreme heat and high winds to strengthen containment lines around several major fires, as the military continued efforts to provide supplies to thousands of people who have been left homeless. Complicating the recovery effort, authorities have forecast another temperature spike as soon as Friday, with little rain, meaning a return to hazardous conditions. \"We are going to see some widespread severe fire danger, we are asking people to be ready,\" New South Wales (NSW) state Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told Sky News. More than 10.3 million hectares of land - an area the size of South Korea - have been razed by bushfires that have killed 24 people in recent weeks. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NujlffsgBs\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NujlffsgBs</url> Ecologists at the University of Sydney on Wednesday doubled their estimate of the number of animals killed or injured in the fires to 1 billion, as the UN World Meteorological Organisation confirmed that smoke from the blazes has drifted as far as South America. READ: Australia prepares for renewed bushfire threat as economic costs mount The three major cities in Australia's southeast, Sydney, Melbourne and the capital Canberra, were all blanketed in thick smoke, putting them among the most polluted cities in the world. In rural areas, many towns were without power and telecommunications and some were running low on drinking water supplies. The bushfires crisis follows a three-year drought that experts have linked to climate change and that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and vulnerable to fires. READ: Australian bushfires reveal a national crisis of under-insurance, a commentary Following are some highlights of what is happening in the Australian bushfires crisis:Prime Minister Scott Morrison was visiting the popular holiday destination Kangaroo Island, of which a third has been burned, where is expected to announce a A$11 million relief package.Around 70 firefighters from the United States and Canada were due to land in Australia on Wednesday, joining scores of their compatriots already on the ground.In Victoria state, telecommunications company Telstra was working to reconnect several communities.Smoke from wildfires has drifted across the Pacific and affected cities in South America, and may have reached the Antarctic, the UN World Meteorological Organization said.The fires have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and produced harmful pollutants, the EU's Copernicus monitoring programme said.Moody's Analytics said the cost of the fires could easily surpass that of the deadly 2009 Black Saturday fires that destroyed 450,000 hectares of land, which cost an estimated A$4.4 billion.There are 127 fires ablaze across NSW, with around 50 uncontained. All the fires were at the \"advice\" level, the lowest alert rating. Victoria state had 39 fires with 13 \"watch and act\" alerts.Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged A$2 billion (US$1.37 billion) to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.More than 100 military personnel were being deployed to help with clean-up efforts across the state.Emergency services have dismissed claims the fires are caused by environmentalists stopping controlled burn-offs.

At the same time, Rachel Yeo drove her car in the opposite direction - towards the inferno. The 31-year-old Singaporean ignored the emergency evacuation instructions issued by fire authorities on New Year's Eve, as an out of control bushfire threatened to overwhelm the community. Instead she went to work - at the Mogo Wildlife Park where she would spend a harrowing day trying to save the zoo's animals from the unfolding disaster. \"The first thing I thought of was to come to the zoo and check on the animals. </p><p>I had to make sure they were safe and that was just my priority,\" she said. \"It was the loneliest car drive of my life because as I was driving to the zoo, everyone else was driving the opposite direction. \"We were basically bracing ourselves for the approaching fire. And it was honestly the most terrifying day of my life. The way you see the fire coming. It felt like a titan, it felt like a monster. READ: Australian bushfires hit businesses, damage still being assessed READ: Singapore to send Chinook helicopters to help fight Australian bushfires \"You can smell the smoke, you feel the heat coming and you just see this red inferno approaching. And there was so much tension in the air and just a lot of nerves going,\" she said. Mogo Wildlife Park is home to about 200 animals, including lions, giraffes, zebras and rhinos. Many were either too large or too dangerous to evacuate safely. While the staff did all they could to protect, shelter and prepare them, they were vulnerable to the unprecedented fury of the fire, which would eventually destroy more than 176 houses and kill two people in Mogo, a devastating loss in a town of little more than 300. READ: Australian bushfire cloud visible in Chile and Argentina READ: Bushfires bring fears of 'new normal' to life Down Under This fire is just one of many which have devastated many parts of Australia in recent weeks, destroying vast areas of bush and laying waste to entire communities. Yeo had only joined the zoo's team in early December. Still, she treated the animals - particularly the primates she cares for on a daily basis - like family. \"We have such a bond with our animals. It's not a meerkat, it's not a gibbon, it's a friend of ours. We're very personal with them. They can't get out of this. We're not going to let them suffer.\" READ: Wildlife ravaged by Australia fires could take decades to recover READ: Australian animals face extinction threat as bushfire toll mounts She and a group of 14 other staff positioned themselves around the zoo and prepared themselves for a fight against the flames. As spot fires broke out, they extinguished them - at one point a blaze began on the complex's gibbon island, forcing the staff into desperate action to put it out. As day appeared to turn to night in the heavy smoke, even the zoo's director Chad Staples, who had made the protection preparations in the event of a fire threat, began to fear the worst. The park was cornered. \"I never knew that anything could be like that. There were about three hours when it was at its worst. Watching the fire roll in ... it was pretty full on,\" he told CNA. \"I cannot explain how terrifying it was,\" Yeo said. \"The smoke, the ash, the debris, the winds swept it all up and it felt like a blizzard. It felt like midnight at 10am. The feeling was like, you felt all alone. It was indescribable. \"Every biological instinct tells you to run. I can only imagine what the animals were going through.\" Eventually as a wind change swept through, the danger was finally averted. The Mogo staff had managed to prevent damage to the zoo, as well as keeping every single animal out of harm's way. READ: Brave as lions: Zoo heroics save animals from Australia's raging fires READ: Australian bushfires threaten drinking water safety. The consequences could last decades While the good outcome for the zoo was widely celebrated, the destruction of many parts of the historic town, and large swathes of the south coast region, has left the community reeling. The summer period is essential for the local tourism business. \"We can now be at the front of getting people to come back to the south coast of NSW. This is the busy time. People are going to hurt from this. This is something that's going to hurt for a long time,\" Staples said. And while the zoo's animals were safe, wild creatures left to fend for themselves in the inferno suffered huge losses. The staff's veterinarians have been tending to injured wildlife since the fire came through. \"It's an understatement to say it's devastating. I have cried over just the thought of so many animals being lost. So much area has been lost and the ones that are still alive are starving because they've lost their homes, they've lost all their food,\" Yeo said. A GoFundMe page was started to assist the zoo in the aftermath of the disaster, and has raised more than US$60,000 so far. Staples says the money will be used to establish a veterinary hospital to treat the vast numbers of wild animals that are \"injured, sick, dying, starving\". He also plans to help regrow trees in the surrounding area to assist wildlife left without their natural habitat. Yeo's \"trial by fire\", as she describes it, was not the way she thought her first working month in Mogo would go. Despite the trauma and ongoing concerns about new fires reigniting, she has found strength in the closeness of the small community and their bravery in the face of calamity. READ: Australian bushfire cloud visible in Chile and Argentina \"You read about it in the news, you see it on television, but it's another thing when you're faced with it, face on. It's absolutely terrifying and the aftermath was really quite sad and devastating,\" she said. \"The team that we have at Mogo Wildlife Park are wonderful people, selfless people. A lot of them came to work not knowing whether their house was going to be safe, not knowing if their families were going to be safe. \"Everyone is trying to pitch in. Everyone is trying to help. These people are really resilient. This is truly the strong Aussie spirit.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12260316</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y01-4951-DYWP-R3YT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1040\"/><timeReceived>1:11 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

At a press conference on Sunday (Jan 5), Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters the Australian Defence Force (ADF) was engaging with the SAF and the New Zealand Defence Force after offers of support from both countries. READ: Rain brings brief respite in Australian bushfire crisis READ: Actors, popstars raise funds to support victims of Australian bushfires \"The ADF is currently engaging with the New Zealand Defence Force and the Singapore Armed Forces to identify options for the kind offers of military support ... they have generously put forward,\" said the prime minister. </p><p>Papua New Guinea's prime minister has also made \"similar offers\" to him and this has been passed on to the ADF, added Mr Morrison. Raging bushfires have killed more than 20 people across southeastern Australia. More than 60,000 sq km have been burnt across the country in the months-long crisis. The bushfire season started earlier than normal this year following a three-year drought that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and vulnerable to fires. Mr Morrison on Saturday issued an unprecedented call-up of army reservists to support firefighters. The announcement faced criticism from the head of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, who said he had heard about the decision through local media, adding Mr Morrison had shown a lack of \"fundamental professional courtesy\". READ: Firefighters hit out at Australia PM over bushfire response On Sunday, the prime minister said the call-up was an unprecedented step taken as a consequence of the \"sheer scale\" of the disaster. \"That step was taken as a consequence of the sheer scale that had moved beyond what is the reasonable expectation of any agency or state or territory authority,\" he told reporters. \"It is a statement of the scale of the need, not a statement of the response of any agencies up until that point in time.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12236592</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXB-BHP1-JCDN-146T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"342\"/><timeReceived>3:34 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Australia, famous for its pristine beaches and wildlife, has been fighting bushfires since September, with fires killing 29 people and millions of animals, and destroying more than 2,500 homes while razing an area roughly a third the size of Germany. READ: Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, three of the most affected states, saw heavy downpours of rain which is forecast to continue through the weekend. </p><p>Fire services said that while the rain will not extinguish all the blazes, it will help greatly to contain them. \"Our fingers are crossed that this continues over the coming days,\" New South Wales fire services said on Twitter on Friday. While the wet weather brings relief to fire fighters and drought-hit farmers, it also comes with dangers, such as flash flooding and falling trees, many structurally destroyed by the intense bushfires.

The smoke haze that has plagued Australia's major cities for weeks has been tracked by NASA circumnavigating the globe and the space agency satellites showed on Thursday there is also a large concentration of lower smoke over the Pacific Ocean.

A strong southerly wind change on Friday night, with gusts of more than 100kph recorded, whipped up a number of fires to the emergency warning level, but by Saturday morning conditions had eased. One person in New South Wales (NSW) had suffered serious burns defending a property and was taken to a Sydney hospital. </p><p>\"It would appear that we have got at least a week, it will probably be the best seven days we have had without a rise of very dangerous fire ratings,\" NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told a media briefing. \"So, some reprieve. An opportunity for firefighters and affected communities to consolidate and allow us to try and get the upper hand on all these fires.\" READ: Commentary: Australian bushfires threaten drinking water safety. The consequences could last decades But authorities were clear the risk was far from over and people should not be complacent, with two months of summer still left, and an unexpected weather change could see fires flare up again. Across NSW, nearly 150 fires were still burning, more than 60 of which were not contained, but none were at emergency level. One fire was still burning at emergency level in Victoria. Authorities in the state were also looking to use the expected week-long break from severe conditions as an opportunity to prepare for the remainder of the fire season. A number of fires burning in the Snowy Mountains region in NSW and across into Victoria have merged. The fires that combined have more than 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres) of land in total. READ: Wildlife ravaged by Australia fires could take decades to recover Thousands of Australians took to the streets on Friday to protest against government inaction on climate change, and were supported by protesters in London. Since October, 27 people have been killed and thousands subjected to repeat evacuations as huge and unpredictable fires scorched more than 10.3 million hectares of land, an area roughly the size of South Korea. - Reuters/nc</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12253332</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYC-6XW1-DYWP-R0SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"377\"/><timeReceived>11:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The plane flew over fires raging in Victoria and New South Wales, taking it through a pyrocumulus cloud, according to ABC News. A pyrocumulus cloud forms due to intense heating of the surface by phenomena such as wildfires or volcanic eruptions.

Matt McIntyre, a passenger on the flight, told ABC that \"it just got greyer and greyer\" as the airplane approached the cloud and added that he saw passengers vomiting.

Morrison is under intense pressure for his government's handing of a bushfire crisis that has killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares of wilderness - an area one-third the size of Germany. The scores of fires follow three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change, but Morrison said late on Tuesday (Jan 21) that his critics are too focussed on carbon emissions. </p><p>\"Hazard reduction is as important as emissions reduction and many would argue, I think, even more so because it has even more direct practical impact on the safety of a person going into a bushfire season,\" Morrison told Sky News Australia. Australia is one of the largest carbon emitters per capita due to its reliance on coal-fired power plants, and Morrison is a firm supporter of the industry. READ: Australian bushfires fires hit coal output, conditions to worsen Morrison's comments came as Australian authorities braced for a return of soaring temperatures and strong winds - conditions that firefighters fear will fan dozens of blazes still burning. Temperatures in Victoria state are expected to top more than 32 degrees Celsius, leading officials to declare \"extreme fire danger\" in some areas. Australia's most populous state, New South Wales has enjoyed several days of cooler weather in recent days, but temperatures on Thursday will hit 40 degrees C, the country's weather bureau said. Read: Rain offers hope in Australian bushfire fight Sydney and Melbourne have been repeatedly blanketed in thick smoke that has resulted in air quality ratings among the worst in the world. Here are today's key events in the bushfire crisis: - As of Wednesday, 79 fires were burning across New South Wales, none above the lowest warning level. There were 25 emergency warnings in Victoria. - Australian animals living in specific habitats, such as mountain lizards, leaf-tailed geckos and pear-shaped frogs, are battling the threat of extinction after fierce bushfires razed large areas of their homes, a new Reuters analysis shows. - Former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott downplayed the link between the bushfires and climate change in a speech in Washington. - The Australian Open tennis tournament continues in Melbourne. The city's air quality was rated as \"good\", according to the Air Quality Index, having been \"hazardous\" less than a week earlier. - Reuters/de</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12299086</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1P-WWG1-JCDN-11XJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><timeReceived>10:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

READ: SAF working with Australia to identify support options over bushfires: Australian PM The Chinooks took off from Oakey, Australia with 42 Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) soldiers bound for the Royal Australian Air Force base in East Sale, Victoria, said Singapore Defence Minister Dr Ng Eng Hen in a Facebook post on Tuesday (Jan 7). Singapore soldiers will work alongside the Australian Defence Force to help with relief efforts, Dr Ng added. \"Our Chinooks will bring in firefighting and relief supplies and also help evacuate residents from the affected areas,\" the minister said. </p><p>His announcement comes a day after Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Singapore would deploy two Chinook helicopters to help tackle the bushfire crisis. Dr Ng said: \"Australia has welcomed SAF troops to train there for decades, and in their time of great need, it's only natural that the SAF do our best to help their people and communities affected by this unexpected natural disaster.\" READ: Firefighters hit out at Australia PM over bushfire response READ: Rain brings brief respite in Australian bushfire crisis Raging bushfires have killed more than 20 people across southeastern Australia. More than 60,000 sq km have been burnt across the country in the months-long crisis. The bushfire season started earlier than normal this year following a three-year drought that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and vulnerable to fires. \"Still raging, the bushfires have already destroyed more than 6 million hectares - 80 Singapores! - and killed half a billion animals, not to mention the tragic loss of human lives,\" Dr Ng said. Forty-one United States firefighters are in Victoria with another 70 from Canada and the US expected to join on Jan 8, the Victoria Country Fire Authority said on Twitter. In the biggest-ever call up of reserves, military teams were deployed across eastern Australia to help emergency services assess the damage, restore power and deliver supplies of food, water and fuel to cut-off communities. For the first time in Australian history, the government also deployed its medical assistance team - normally sent to other nations to lend support in the aftermath of their disasters - to help evacuees. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ngenghen/posts/2742450382514870\">https://www.facebook.com/ngenghen/posts/2742450382514870</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12239798</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXJ-9KY1-DYWP-R1HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"419\"/><timeReceived>3:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Then it will stabilise. If that is the case, then possibly we will reach between 3.5% and 4% (GDP growth),\" he told reporters at an outlook briefing in Kuala Lumpur yesterday. </p><p>China has also been the biggest source of economic growth for the global economy for the last 15 to 20 years, he added. </p><p>\"If China's economy recovers faster, that will likely provide a boost to Malaysia's GDP,\" Tan said. </p><p>Malaysia's economic growth sank to a decade-low of 4.3% for the full year of 2019, mainly dragged by external challenges, commodity disruptions and slower public investment activity, Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) said last week. </p><p>Domestic growth will also be hit by the coronavirus particularly in the first quarter this year, BNM governor Datuk Nor Shamsiah Mohd Yunus had said. </p><p>The government is expected to announce an economic stimulus package to battle the impact of the outbreak next Thursday (Feb 27), which should help boost growth to a certain extent. </p><p>\"In this kind of situation, everything helps, especially for the hospitality industry, the tourismrelated industry - those that are in the frontline,\" Tan said. </p><p>However, he believes the highly anticipated stimulus package merely functions to tide the economy over in the shorter term, while GDP growth has already been \"slowing down quite drastically even before the coronavirus outbreak\". </p><p>\"There are other issues at hand. </p><p>Yes, you can launch whatever amount but we cannot afford that much because we have a budget deficit. Also, how long can it last? Six months? Then what is beyond that?\" Tan said. </p><p>Rather than a single cause for the decline in the FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI or national economic growth, he said the slowing numbers could be attributed to the US-China trade war, Brexit, the Hong Kong riots, Australian bushfires, the South Korea-Japan quarrel, and now, the virus outbreak. </p><p>More needs to be done to draw greater confidence from foreign investors, Tan opined, suggesting that further clarity be provided on the country's political future and long-term economic policies. </p><p>Moving forward, the country will still see positive growth for the year despite facing domestic and global challenges which could still affect the economy. </p><p>\"It also depends on the sectors. </p><p>Some sectors that are more exportoriented - they are still okay, like gloves. Other than that, restaurants are not doing well,\" Tan noted. </p><p>On equities, he described the situation as a \"stock-picking season\" which requires investors to be highly selective and choose individual stocks rather than sectors. </p><p>\"For example, within the glove sector itself, some are doing well, some are not doing well. If you look at export-oriented, some are doing better than others. </p><p>\"The same goes for semiconductors. </p><p>If you look at counters like ViTrox Corp Bhd and Pentamaster Corp Bhd, they seem to be doing well. But if you look at KESM Industries Bhd andElsoft Research Bhd, they have dropped quite a lot, despite being in the semiconductor industry,\" he said.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MYSRSV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MYSRSV2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7S-6R41-DYBF-M1MS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TMR Media SDN BHD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Malaysian Reserve</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21342\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 20, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000550</classCode><className>ECONOMIC GROWTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000816</classCode><className>GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00090NT</classCode><className>ECONOMIC CONDITIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Two Bills will be introduced during the sitting for the first time, The Hindu Endowments (Amendment) Bill and the Economic Expansion Incentives (Relief from Income Tax) (Amendment) Bill. Six will be tabled for a second reading, including the Singapore Convention on Mediation Bill and the Active Mobility (Amendment) Bill, which seeks to extend the e-scooter ban on footpaths to all motorised personal mobility devices (PMDs). MPs have submitted more than 50 questions on a range of issues, with several MPs such as Desmond Choo, Rahayu Mahzam and Liang Eng Hwa asking about the Government's measures to deal with the Wuhan coronavirus should the outbreak worsen in Singapore. READ: Singapore has 'done well' in handling Wuhan coronavirus situation, but must remain vigilant: PM Lee READ: Nearly 1,000 students, staff on leave of absence after returning from China, says MOE The virus, which originated in China's central Hubei province, has killed more than 200 people and infected nearly 10,000, mostly in China. The Ministry of Health on Friday announced confirmed 16 cases in Singapore, including one Singaporean, as authorities widened travel restrictions to combat the spread of the coronavirus. </p><p>SINGAPORE'S EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS Singapore's medical preparedness is also in the spotlight after the Lucky Plaza car accident, where the victims were taken to Tan Tock Seng Hospital instead of the nearby Mount Elizabeth Hospital, which was not equipped to handle severe trauma patients. READ: Driver in Lucky Plaza accident had licence immediately suspended, police reveal READ: Lucky Plaza accident: CCTV footage emerges of moments before fatal crash MP Joan Pereira is asking if the Government will consider requiring all private and public hospitals to be equipped and manned to handle severe and multiple trauma cases in their accident and emergency departments as part of Singapore's emergency preparedness plan. Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) Daniel Goh will ask whether the emergency departments of private hospitals should be upgraded for a tiered national accident and emergency system. As Australia declares a state of emergency over the bushfires threatening large parts of the country, climate and other environmental issues are some of the issues that will be discussed. MP Seah Kian Peng will ask if the Australian bushfires have threatened Singapore's environment and food security. NCMP Dennis Tan will ask if the Government has any plans on reducing greenhouse emissions from Singapore's oil refining industry, while MP Louis Ng will ask if the Government could publish its collection of the 2019 carbon tax payments. On other issues, NCMP Leon Perera will ask about the reasons for the discoloured tap water in the Basic Military Training Camp (BMTC) on Pulau Tekong last year and what measures are being taken to reduce the risk of such an incident in future. He will also ask what the Government is doing to address attitudes of students and educators towards the sexual objectification and harassment of women, in light of concerns over voyeurism cases at institutes of higher learning.

MP Christopher de Souza will also ask about the rise in piracy and robbery cases in the Singapore Strait and its surrounding waters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12373820</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3R-7W81-DYWP-R0DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"628\"/><timeReceived>2:08 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

By family, he means giraffes, rhinos, lions and gorillas among the 200 residents of Mogo Zoo, which he and 15 staff battled to defend last week from raging bushfires that ravaged dozens of homes and vehicles across the tiny tourist town on New Year's Eve. When they knew the fires were coming, Staples and his team made a plan to keep flames at bay and save the 26.3 hectare private zoo and its 40 species, including shifting some primates into their own living quarters.

The survival of the zoo's six zebras, two rhinos, six giraffes, four gorillas, three tigers and six lions, among others, is among the few positive stories to come out of a devastating fire season that has so far killed 26 people. At Mogo Zoo, staff spent New Year's Eve dousing the grounds with hundreds of thousands of litres of water as the fires approached, shifting quickly as winds changed. Flaming trees collapsed close to animal enclosures as the fire jumped over a stream on two sides of the grounds. The sky turned red and Mogo was in darkness by noon, Staples said. A local fire service official stopped by at the zoo and told them no one would be able to come rescue them.

The zoo animals were among the lucky ones. University of Sydney ecologists on Wednesday doubled their estimate of the number of animals killed or injured in the fires to 1 billion.

Gayle Smith, 68, who runs an organic nursery, described her astonishment that her wooden home had survived having defended it from multiple small fires before eventually fleeing. \"It was mindbending. I felt relief and disbelief seeing it was still here,\" she said.

Huge wildfires have razed more than 11.2 million hectares, nearly half the area of the United Kingdom, destroying or severely damaging the habitats of several native animals. Some estimates suggest as many as a billion animals, including livestock and domestic pets, have either died in the blazes or are at risk in their aftermath due to a lack of food and shelter. WATCH: Singaporean zookeeper rescues wildlife from Australia fires \"This has been an ecological disaster, a disaster that is still unfolding,\" Treasurer Frydenberg told reporters on Monday as he visited the Port Macquarie Koala Hospital, where 45 koalas were being treated for burns. </p><p>\"We know that our native flora and fauna have been very badly damaged.\" Images of burned kangaroos, koalas and possums, along with footage of people risking their lives to save native animals have gone viral around the world. Knitters around the world have responded to a call to create thousands of protective pouches and blankets for injured wildlife. READ: Australian animals face extinction threat as bushfire toll mounts The Australian division of the Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF) has advised the government of 13 animals whose habitats have been either destroyed or severely damaged. They include three critically endangered species: The southern corroboree frog, the regent honeyeater bird and the western ground parrot. READ: Koala mittens and joey pouches: Australian bushfires spark global knitting frenzy \"Huge proportions of globally significant areas like the Gondwana Rainforestand Blue Mountains World Heritage Areas along with the Australian Alps and Western Australia's Stirling Ranges have suffered catastrophic burns,\" WWF said in an emailed statement. Other animals at risk include koala populations across the southeast, the Kangaroo Island dunnart, glossy black cockatoo, long-footed potoroo, western ground parrot, Blue Mountains water skink, eastern bristlebird and the brush-tailed rock wallaby. CARROT DROPS In a mission dubbed Operation Rock Wallaby, national park staff used helicopters to air drop thousands of kilos of carrots and sweet potatoes to brush-tailed rock wallabies in remote areas of New South Wales state. \"The provision of supplementary food is one of the key strategies we are deploying to promote the survival and recovery of endangered species like the brush-tailed rock wallaby,\" NSW environment minister Matt Kean said. READ: Brave as lions: Zoo heroics save animals from Australia's raging fires \"The wallabies typically survive the fire itself, but are then left stranded with limited natural food as the fire takes out the vegetation around their rocky habitat.\" Frydenberg said the \"iconic\" koala would be a focus of national government funding, adding that the full extent of the damage would not be known until the fires are out - something experts say could be months away. READ: Famous rescue dog Bear continues to help find koalas in Australia bushfires Threatened Species Commissioner Sally Box said an estimated 30 per cent of koala habitat - eucalpyt woodlands, which they use for both food and shelter - in NSW state may have been lost. The koalas' heavy fur and tendency to climb higher when threatened are severe disadvantages in fast-moving bushfires. Federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley said reviews would be brought forward on whether certain koala populations should be listed as \"endangered\" rather than \"vulnerable\". \"Everything that can be done to rescue and recover koala habitat, will be done, including innovative approaches that look at whether you can actually put a koala in an area that it hasn't come from,\" Ley said. - Reuters/zl</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12258346</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYV-4TS1-JCDN-14PY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><timeReceived>7:43 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

His house, car, sheds and work tools were wiped out by the ferocious New Year bushfires that swept through the Australian town of Cobargo, killing three of its residents and destroying dozens of homes, farms and vehicles. Though he has lost everything, he counts himself lucky. \"We live in the best place in the world,\" he said, nodding his head with certainty. </p><p>\"This has united people like you'd never have imagined.\" READ: Australia's bushfire-stricken east welcomes drenching rain READ: Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires Standing outside a shabby caravan with plastic chairs and dogs roaming around, Dunn recalls how a friend risked his life to rescue him from his blazing property, and how strangers from a town 70km away gave him and his wife a tent to sleep in. \"That tent saved us,\" said Dunn, a 62-year-old with an unkempt white beard that reaches his chest. \"I'm totally overwhelmed by what we've seen here, the generosity of mankind.\" READ: Flights cancelled at Melbourne Airport as Australia bushfire haze limits visibility Wildfires on a massive scale have killed 29 people since September in Australia, fuelled by record temperatures and tinder-dry conditions, turning swathes of farms and woodlands black, and blanketing the sky in haze. While residents of many of the fire-threatened towns and villages heeded advice to leave and head to evacuation centres elsewhere, Cobargo's less than 1,000 people chose not to abandon their town. A handful of fleeing locals set up their caravans and tents at Cobargo's showground, defying orders by police to move to designated locations outside the town in New South Wales state. 'WE STAY AS A COMMUNITY' Word quickly spread that a commune was forming. Caravans in tow, more evacuees arrived, among them farmers, some bringing horses. A kitchen, laundry facilities and a food bank were set up, and medics, a counsellor and a chaplain joined to support the displaced. Meetings were nightly and trucks rolled up daily, bringing water, food, animal feeds and huge hay bales for farms. \"We made the call that we stay as a community,\" said Tony Allen, a former mayor in the district. \"We knew then that was a big risk, it's breaking every rule in the book, but this is the way to do this. We keep the community together.\" In Cobargo, a town known for its bookstores, century-old buildings and its annual folk festival, shops opened to accept donated goods, putting up signs that said \"open to everyone\" and offering clothes, linen, blankets and \"free hugs\". A set of amber-coloured firefighter overalls was hung on the fence of one house, with a sign saying \"thanks guys\". Volunteers from elsewhere in Australia helped to clean solar panels, repair farmers' fences and clear debris from rural roads. \"There has been so much help and support. Everybody looks after each other. There are so many good people here,\" said Philippe Ravanel, a Swiss blacksmith, standing in the rubble of a 150-year-old home that he bought in 2006, of which only the fireplace remains. Hundreds of people flocked to a fundraiser at the local pub, The Cobargo Hotel, cheering and embracing firefighters as army personnel opened their vehicles to children and former sports stars mingled with evacuees and farmers. Homes are already becoming available. Peter Hisco is moving to Sydney, Australia's largest city, and will rent his two-storey house to two displaced families. \"My wife has a new job in Sydney so we'll rent both floors out at a reasonable price.\" Former butcher Barry Parkes, 68, who lost his house, two vehicles and his Harley Davidson motorcycle, said friends had asked him to house-sit for them. \"We've had a lot of people offering us places,\" he said. Rod Dunn, the builder, said a friend had kindly offered him use of his property, rent-free for a year. \"It's a good place too,\" he said, smiling. \"I should know, I built the bloody place.\" - Reuters/de</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12270298</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0N-2191-DYWP-R196-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"676\"/><timeReceived>11:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Twenty-seven people have been killed and thousands have been made homeless as the monster fires scorched through more than 10.3 million hectares of land, an area the size of South Korea. As temperatures begun to rise, authorities in Victoria state pleaded with people to move to safer areas. \"We sent out an emergency alert, so text messaging to 240,000 people, basically across the east of the state. </p><p>If you can get out, you should get out, you shouldn't be in the remote and forested parts of our State,\" Andrew Crisp, emergency management commissioner for the state of Victoria, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. READ: Australian bushfires threaten drinking water safety. The consequences could last decades, a commentary Temperatures are expected to shoot well above 40 degrees Celsius in several parts of Australia on Friday, threatening to inflame a bushfire season that has already destroyed nearly 2,000 homes. More than 150 fires remain alight across the country, and authorities fear a southerly shift in winds due later in the day will fan the flames and change the direction of many fires. READ: Australia calls for another mass evacuation as monster bushfires return The winds themselves are strong enough to be classed as \"damaging\" and are expected to sweep across the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. Parts of Kangaroo Island, a wildlife-rich tourist spot off the southeastern coast, were again evacuated and a town cut off as fire closed the only road. A third of the heavily forested island has already been turned to ash. Australia's wildfires have dwarfed other catastrophic blazes around the world. Combining 2019 fires in California, Brazil and Indonesia still amount to less than half the burnt area in Australia. Ecologists at the University of Sydney have estimated 1 billion animals have been killed or injured in the bushfires. READ: Brave as lions: Zoo heroics save animals from Australia's raging fires READ: Wildlife ravaged by Australia fires could take decades to recover Australia's government has maintained there is no direct link between climate change and the devastating bushfires. \"We don't want jobs destroying, economy destroying, economy wrecking targets and goals which won't change the fact that there are bushfires or anything like that in Australia,\" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told 2GB Radio on Friday. Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis:There are 46 fires ablaze across New South Wales, with around 18 uncontained.All other fires were at the \"advice\" level, the lowest alert rating.Victoria state had 43 fires, two of which are so severe that evacuation orders have been issued. Two more fires are at emergency levels.In South Australia state, nine fires are ablaze, one of which is at a emergency level.Climate protests were planned for Melbourne on Friday targeting Prime Minister Morrison, who has been slammed for his handling of the bushfires and his government's position on climate change.Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall. The weather agency said there was no sign of that for months.Moody's Analytics said the cost of the fires could easily surpass that of deadly 2009 Black Saturday fires that destroyed 450,000 hectares of land, which cost an estimated A$4.4 billion (US$3.02 billion).Morrison has pledged A$2 billion to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.About 100 firefighters from the United States and Canada are helping with another 140 expected in coming weeks.The fires have emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide and produced harmful pollutants, the European Union's Copernicus monitoring programme said.Smoke has drifted across the Pacific, affecting cities in South America, and may have reached the Antarctic, the UN World Meteorological Organisation said. - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12248676</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY5-7NT1-DYWP-R04V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><timeReceived>11:57 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Volunteers and veterinarians tend to the animals, all victims of damaging bushfires that swept through South Australia in late December. This makeshift emergency triage centre for wounded koalas has been a site of both tears and triumph over the past few weeks. Death has never been far away as the team at Adelaide Koala Rescue (AKR) has responded to hundreds of calls to help animals burnt, displaced and starving as a result of the fires. But for dozens of the koalas left here now, home is calling. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqAB9kt4ZB4\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqAB9kt4ZB4</url> There have been staggering losses to Australia's wildlife this summer, as bushfires ripped through more than 10 million hectares of land. Experts predict that some 1.25 billion animals, including mammals, birds and reptiles, have been killed nationwide. The number reaches into the trillions when insects and other invertebrates, all essential to delicate ecosystems, are counted. And still, the blazes rage. READ: Australia's bushfire danger returns as Sydney faces scorching heat While the casualty rates and long term impact on the environment are hard to fathom, those working tirelessly to save and recuperate the survivors have been left holding onto small positives. For AKR, it comes in the form of paper signs at the entrance to their triage centre. On it is listed the names of all of the koalas who have successfully \"graduated\" back to the wild. Each of them - like Spud and Janet and Alice Cooper - is a \"cause for celebration\", according to director Jane Brister. \"I think more than anything, it's important for the morale for our volunteers,\" she said. \"It's been a really traumatic time for a lot of the team members, especially the ones that go out in the field. I've certainly seen things that I can't unsee.\" READ: 'A long road back from here': Small winemakers feel the pain of Australian bushfires Brister estimates that AKR has retrieved more than 300 koalas from scorched areas within the past three weeks, and cared for up to 120 wild animals at any one time. Each animal has different medical treatment needs - from burnt paws to singed ears and dehydration - but all of them require housing, food and a bit of love, during what is a traumatic and confusing period. \"What people love about them the most and what upsets people the most when it comes to bushfires is their innocence and their vulnerability. They can't fly away, they can't run away,\" she said. \"They're stuck there up a tree and they're really defenceless. They have to rely on us to fight for them, to fight for their habitat and I think that's in part what makes them so endearing.\" Despite the easing of the worst fire conditions in South Australia, here and right across bushfire affected areas, finding relocation refuges for rehabilitated or dislocated wildlife is proving to be a difficult challenge. For those survivors hanging on in burnt out areas, the situation is desperate too. READ: 'The most terrifying day of my life': Singaporean zookeeper at centre of dramatic animal rescue during Australia bushfires 'THEY'RE ALL BASICALLY GONE' In Majors Creek, a small rural community close to Canberra, Bill Waterhouse and his wife Lesley run a wombat refuge, which has quickly transformed into a rescue operation for a menagerie of wildlife. \"This morning a little baby wombat was brought to us, I was called out for a kangaroo hanging in a fence and on the way home I brought home a magpie,\" Waterhouse said. The couple have been responding to rescue requests since bushfires reared up in their area in early December. The danger has not passed and they constantly live in fear of another evacuation from their property, which is home to several injured animals. \"We feel like we're under siege, personally here, but we also feel like all the animals we've cared about for so many years are now being burnt to death and now our release sites and their carers are under attack,\" he said. \"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't feeling a sense of anguish about it.\" READ: Forget a 'new normal': Experts say Australia's worst bushfires still lie ahead Local areas that used to be safe havens for the animals they released back into the wild are now affected by fire. There are few safe places left. On the back of donations, Waterhouse is attempting to mobilise local landowners to try and provide much needed food on the edges of the fireground where wild animals are coming to scavenge. But he has been left saddened by the lack of animals that appear to be in need of help. \"There have been very few animals brought to us, burnt or not. In general, with the amount of damage that's taken place, we were expecting many more but it's been so hot and so devastating that they're all basically gone,\" he said. \"We think the animals are increasingly going to be hungry, they'll be desperate. There's no flowers out there, there are no leaves, there are no nests. \"The canopy, if it wasn't burnt, it was scorched. You really notice the silence. The habitat's had it. There's pockets left but the fire is indiscriminate. I think it's just too late for the vast majority. READ: Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires Lesley paces through the couple's home with a tiny baby wombat tucked into her chest. With electricity still out in the area, the heat pads used to keep the small creatures warm are not working. Little Jack, as he has been dubbed, was found in the pouch of his dead mother, who had been struck by a car, a common accident during this period of prolonged drought and fire. \"The nature of the road is it's warm and water runs off it. So there's almost always a little bit of greenery on the roadside and animals are drawn to it,\" Waterhouse said. \"He's a little pinkie and has no fur yet. He's the size of a sweet potato with little legs and wriggly bits. It has a very good chance of surviving all the way through. It's a two year program for him.\" Waterhouse and other rescuers are bracing for the long haul care of wildlife amid the widespread habitat destruction. But while koalas, wombats and other generalist Australian species will inevitably bounce back, there are greater fears that lesser known, critically threatened species may have already been lost. READ: Thousands evacuated from Australian tourist haven as bushfires rage FACING EXTINCTION Analysis by the Australian Department of Environment and Energy shows that 49 threatened species have had more than 80 per cent of their likely or known distribution area affected by fire. A further 65 species have had at least half of their habitats burnt. \"If the habitat of those species is removed, then there are real fears for whether they can persist. These would be species extinctions, things that occur here uniquely that won't occur anymore,\" said Chris Dickman, a professor of ecology at the University of Sydney. \"It's clearly a really emotional time for anyone associated with the native fauna. It's awful to see the pictures and it's awful to know there's a whole lot more behind them,\" he added. READ: Koalas, native animals rescued from flash floods as rain pours over Australia bushfire Prof Dickman says while iconic, charismatic animals are important for raising awareness about the damage to natural environments, there are many, many others that are essential to ecosystem balance that have suffered major losses. \"It may be ecologically important species that carry out functions like pollination or moving seeds around in the forest environment, or are important because they move fungal spores, or digging the topsoil. If these are lost, then it means the ability of the forest ecosystem to regenerate in the future will be slowed down or compromised,\" he said. But the Australian bush is known to be resilient and he says in some areas, especially if rain has fallen, the recovery of habitats could be \"rapid\". The federal government has pledged A$50 million (US$34m) for a Wildlife and Habitat Recovery Package that will be used to try to prevent species extinction and enable the work of local wildlife rescuers. But opposition figures, like Senator Mehreen Faruqi from the Australian Greens, says that money \"is just a drop in the ocean\". \"Really what we need at this time is an open chequebook from the government because that is the only thing that will ensure the survival of our species and our native species into the future,\" she said. \"Wildlife carers have been working around the clock to save the animals, to protect the animals and to rehabilitate animals but you know this is really expensive work, it is time consuming work and it is absolutely emotionally draining work.\" READ: Threatened species hit hard by Australia's bushfires The tired eyes of the volunteers at the koala triage centre are testament to the fatigue and stress inflicted upon them these past weeks. But for each koala carried out in their hamper - their name added to the list on the door - destined for a return to a eucalyptus tree somewhere in the Adelaide Hills, a feeling of optimism infectiously hovers over the gym. It comes even though there is a deep understanding that thousands of others have died. It is the small positives that matter right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12302962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y24-V6G1-JCDN-153T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1549\"/><timeReceived>10:28 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

This year, Eden is anything but a paradise for Baxter and other business owners on the town's smoke-filled main street. Just days after the entire town, including tourists, was evacuated in the face of fierce wildfires, most shops remained shuttered. Dead birds and burnt leaves littered the beachfront. </p><p>\"It's a seasonal town,\" Baxter told Reuters from behind the counter of her shop, adding that income was down 85 to 90 per cent. \"This money, through this time of year, gets us through winter and we don't have it now. Don't know what we're going to do.\" READ: Firefighters hit out at Australia PM over bushfire response The situation in Eden is playing out in other towns across Australia where huge bushfires have burnt through more than 10.3 million ha of land, killed 25 people and left thousands homeless. Weeks into the crisis, the economic costs are mounting, potentially wrecking the central bank's hopes for a \"gentle turning point\" of renewed growth in gross domestic product this quarter. \"The fires have come at a time when there was already a lot of uncertainty about Australia's economic outlook,\" AMP's Sydney-based head of investment strategy Shane Oliver said in a telephone interview. Oliver estimated a minimum 0.4 per cent hit on gross domestic product (GDP) in the March quarter, which could mean growth stalled completely in the period and prompt a further interest rate cut as early as February. \"The impact on tourism is expected to be more lasting while the impact on consumer spending is the biggest unknown,\" Oliver said. Australia's AUS$1.95 trillion economy is already limping after 28 years of recession-free expansion as cash-strapped consumers shun everything from clothes to cars while a three-year drought has hurt the farm sector. READ: Australia prepares for renewed bushfire threat as economic costs mount READ: Australian bushfires hit businesses, damage still being assessed The downturn prompted three rate cuts by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last year to an all-time low of 0.75 per cent. Financial futures now imply a 50-50 chance of a fourth easing next month. In signs of the early impact of the fires, data released on Tuesday showed a gauge of Australian consumer confidence slumped last week to its lowest level in more than four years. Job advertisements suffered their largest monthly drop in seven months in December, a fall that ANZ senior economist Catherine Birch linked to the bushfire crisis. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said he expected the full economic impact of the fires to be \"very significant\". \"All those businesses in those communities who have been impacted, been hit at exactly the wrong time of the year, when they're the busiest time,\" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. SMOKE ON THE WATERFRONT In Eden, the reopening of the town following the weekend evacuation and the fact that it escaped any major fire damage has made little difference to businesses. At least two cruise ships have bypassed the port in the past week as smoke blankets the waterfront. Eric Wolske moved to the town with his partner two years ago, buying an antiques shop as an investment. \"Well compared to last year this time, business obviously is down,\" Wolske told Reuters, adding he was banking on a cruise ship due to berth later this month. Tourism accounts for more than 3per cent of Australia's annual GDP and many hotels and resorts have suffered extensive damage, while many national parks are closed. In the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra the smoke has dented the country's clean and green image and led to the cancellation of some entertainment events. Agricultural businesses have also been affected, with the sizeable dairy industry struggling to secure milk supplies. Insurers have received 8,985 bushfire-related claims in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland since Nov 8. The claims are estimated to have a loss value of AUS$700 million. Still, Oliver said there was light at the end of the tunnel. \"We can see a revival from June quarter as rebuilding activity kicks in helped by insurance payouts and welfare payments,\" said Oliver, who still expects two RBA rate cuts this year. - Reuters/ga</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12240668</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXK-YSP1-JCDN-108S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"738\"/><timeReceived>9:22 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Speaking in his Chinese New Year message on Friday (Jan 24), Mr Lee said the Government is \"well-prepared\" to deal with the new coronavirus, which has killed at least 17 people in China and sickened hundreds. On Thursday, the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced that a 66-year-old Chinese man from Wuhan - who is in isolation and in a stable condition - was tested positive for the new coronavirus. READ: Singapore confirms first case of Wuhan virus Wuhan virus - confirmed cases Speaking from Davos, where he was attending the World Economic Forum, Mr Lee said he has been closely tracking Singapore's preparations against the virus. </p><p>\"We have just had our first cases in Singapore. This was to be expected, given the high volume of international travel here,\" Mr Lee said. \"But we are well prepared, because we have been gearing up for such a situation ever since we dealt with SARS in 2003. \"MOH has now activated plans to counter the spread of the virus, which so far does not appear to be as deadly as SARS was. Singaporeans should be calm but watchful as we implement measures to keep everybody safe and healthy.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3XdTyDaUl8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3XdTyDaUl8</url> He also asked those who are taking a break during the public holiday to remember the personal sacrifices of those who are still working, including law enforcement officers, hospital staff, cleaners, transport, port and airport workers. \"Many of our Malay, Indian and Eurasian friends will be working, covering for their Chinese colleagues. We owe them our thanks,\" the Prime Minister said. READ: PM Lee says Singapore 'better prepared' for another virus after SARS outbreak STRONG FAMILIES MAKE FOR STRONG NATION This year's Chinese New Year festivities come amid \"anxiety around the world\", said Mr Lee, citing examples of floods in Jakarta, drought in Thailand, the Australian bushfires, turbulence in the Middle East, protests in Hong Kong and France, and the new coronavirus in China. \"We wish these societies well as they heal and recover,\" he said. \"We also give thanks that Singapore enjoys peace and stability that lets us ... gather, as we do every year, to celebrate Chinese New Year in the warm company of friends and family.\" Strong families make for a strong nation, the Prime Minister added. \"Singapore should be a society where families are celebrated and supported, especially young families starting out.\" Recent government initiatives have been made with this aim in mind, he said. These include increasing pre-school subsidies to lighten the financial load of raising a child, promoting flexible work arrangements and the introduction of full subject-based banding in secondary schools to reduce stress on students and parents. READ: Additional subsidies for pre-schools to increase from January 2020 READ: Full subject-based banding an 'important' move to maximise students' talents: Ong Ye Kung The Prime Minister said he hoped these moves would encourage more young couples to start new families or add to existing ones. \"Choosing a life partner or having a child is a deeply personal decision,\" he said. \"But from my own experience, there is no greater joy than hearing the laughter of our children and grandchildren, especially on festive occasions like Chinese New Year.\" He talked about the importance of family and the role family members play in each other's lives. \"When times are hard, we turn for comfort and support to our parents, spouses, siblings and later our children,\" he said. \"Even if our extended families do not all live together, most of us still keep close ties with uncles and aunts, cousins and nephews, and of course grandparents and grandchildren.\" Mr Lee said he would celebrate Chinese New Year with the Singaporean community in Zurich before he makes his way home from Davos. \"I look forward to seeing familiar faces and hearing familiar accents, thousands of miles away from home,\" the Prime Minister added. \"No matter where in the world we may be, there is something special and heart-warming that bonds Singaporeans together, and a special place in our hearts for Singapore.\" \"The Year of the Rat begins a new cycle of the Chinese zodiac,\" he said. \"We look forward to the opportunity to refresh ourselves and start anew.\" \"I wish all Singaporeans a very happy and healthy Chinese New Year,\" Mr Lee added.

If policy and politics are about managing competing interests and prioritising different constituencies, the varied national COVID-19 responses point to the acute challenges of getting this balance right. How do we balance the economic implications of movement restrictions against the public health risks of increased infections? How do we weigh individual freedoms against community protection?</p><p> And if we shut down elements of our economy, do we protect affected people and businesses? All of them? How much support should we give them? And for how long? LISTEN: The COVID-19 vaccine will be the biggest product launch in history. Can we pull it off? READ: Commentary: More bold measures needed to protect against the job losses heading Singapore's way Almost every country has answered these questions differently, with measures ranging from total lockdown to contact tracing, widespread testing to business as usual. These have seen varying degrees of success, of course, and varying degrees of public support for those measures. There has been consistent and robust debate about policies enacted in many countries, including movement restrictions and the closure of schools, borders and businesses. Who would want to be a policymaker trying to get this balance right, and trying to sell it politically? Climate change, however, makes the policy and political challenge of responding to COVID-19 look like a picnic, by comparison. In at least five ways, climate change is much tougher. 1. WORST-CASE SCENARIO UNCLEAR With COVID-19, the public has a sense of what a worst-case scenario looks like. It makes justifying extraordinary measures a lot easier for politicians if they can, for example, point to dramatic scenes from a country hit hard by the pandemic to say: \"These are people and societies much like ours, and that's our future if we do nothing.\" The same is more difficult to say of climate change - or at least with any degree of certainty. We can point to the devastating effects of disasters like the 2019 to 2020 Australian bushfires or the drought that preceded it. We know that climate change means an increase in the frequency and severity of such events. But we can't definitively say that climate change caused these disasters - and plenty of voices contest any attempt to link them. The threat of climate change in this sense is a different one, and emergency measures are just a bit harder to sell. READ: Commentary: This new Ministry of Sustainability and Environment looks pretty promising 2. A SUITE OF POSSIBLE MEASURES With COVID-19, we have a clearer idea about the effectiveness of different responses. We can see from other states - and from sophisticated modelling - what measures will lead towards what range of outcomes, and in what timeframe. The same does not apply to climate change. Ecosystem functions are far more complex, and the suite of possible measures - from mitigation to adaptation to geoengineering - make this a much more complicated policy challenge. READ: Commentary: The wonder of clear skies and returning wildlife is our new climate problem 3. UNILATERAL ACTION INSUFFICIENT With COVID-19, unilateral national action can work. Quickly closing off borders is actually possible, and if New Zealand's experience is anything to go by, can be effective. With climate change, the nature of the atmosphere as a global commons obviously makes such actions impossible. We can focus on adaptive measures to try to insulate ourselves from the effects of climate change, but we can't prevent disasters from happening in the first place. So we need mitigation, but one country can't achieve necessary goals on its own. We need sustained international cooperation, with many states doing their part - which has proved to be elusive in practice. READ: Commentary: The coronavirus could take climate action with it And if we think - or we're led to think - that others aren't doing their part for international response, major domestic mitigation efforts are that much harder to sell domestically. 4. OUT OF SIGHT, OUT OF MIND With COVID-19, we're protecting ourselves and those closest to us. COVID-19 can immediately and directly affect us, family members and fellow citizens, which is how extraordinary policy measures can be justified and sold. Those most immediately and directly vulnerable to climate change, though, are seen as something other - they're people in the developing world, other living creatures, or future human generations. We're seldom encouraged to orient our moral - or political - concerns to these constituencies. Again, this makes mobilising and sustaining extraordinary measures harder than with COVID-19. READ: Commentary: We have much to learn from COVID-19 and the lockdowns 5. NO 'FOR NOW' SACRIFICES A return to something approaching life as normal beyond COVID-19 seems possible. Sacrifices are politically easier to sell if it looks like a \"for now\" scenario, with effective measures in place and the chance of a vaccine on the horizon. That won't be the case with climate, where we'll likely be facing a world that has changed irrevocably. READ: Commentary: Rising temperatures, fires and floods highlight importance of understanding weather extremes A MORE PROFOUND CHALLENGE In all these ways, climate change poses more profound challenges for policy and politics than COVID-19. That's even assuming that policymakers have the political will to try to address climate change. More positively, what the COVID-19 experience tells us is that the public and policymakers have a capacity to listen to and follow the guidance of experts. We seem to recognise that prevention is much better than cure. And when we recognise an issue as a crisis, we appear capable of enacting and accepting extraordinary measures. Whether a country's public - and in particular its leaders - can accept that climate change is a crisis is, of course, another thing altogether.

Their small acreage is close to the beach and a haven for local wildlife. \"The birds, the surroundings and just a different lifestyle. I couldn't bring my kids up anywhere else,\" she said. But for the past few weeks, the realities of a life surrounded by nature have brought little but danger and displacement. </p><p>Bushfires have ripped through the area, turning the skies black with ash and leaving indelible marks not only on the landscape, but on the psyche of small rural communities. READ: From Australian bushfire ashes, a community rises in solidarity The intensity and scale of Australia's bushfire crisis this summer has been unprecedented. Already more than 10 million hectares of land - about 140 times the size of Singapore - have been left scorched, 27 people killed, a billion plus animals suspected dead and some 2,000 houses destroyed. But the worst is still yet to come, according to experts forecasting more extreme fire seasons as the effects of climate change become more apparent on the dry continent. READ: Hot and dry Australia could join the ranks of 'climate refugees' On New Year's Eve, Rochelle Ethell was meant to be ushering in 2020 with friends. The celebrations had already been muted by the looming threat and a deep orange sky that hung over Long Beach. They had been forced to evacuate their home earlier that month as the risks intensified. The community had emerged relatively unscathed on that day, and were able to return home. But what was coming at them now was a beast. Up and down the coast and into the hinterland, different fire fronts were tearing through sections of bush that had not burned for decades. The family was at risk and ordered to leave again. They did so, with Ethelle fleeing with her husband, two children, dog, cat, two birds and three chickens in tow. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfFIxRyUDk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWfFIxRyUDk</url> \"It was a very stressful day not knowing if we were able to go home. It's not something I'd ever want to put my children through or experience again myself,\" she said. As they cowered, sweltering in the heat, soon the bad news came flowing in. Ethell was getting condolence messages she did not initially understand. Her business, a small tea salon in the historic town of Mogo, had been destroyed in the flames. \"There was nothing left. It was all gone.\" It took two days for her business neighbour and close friend Lexie Dunn to discover the same fate had befallen her shop, a fashion boutique. \"It's just devastating. I've lost my dream, a place that I used to come every day. I've been telling people, you know, I've loved this shop as much as I love my kids,\" she said. \"I just presumed it was going to be okay, and didn't think that this could happen to me. But it has.\" The fire's intensity and speed on that day and night shocked even one of Australia's most experienced fire officials - former New South Wales fire commissioner turned fighting volunteer, Greg Mullins. \"I've seen lots of fire over nearly 50 years of firefighting. I've never seen anything quite like this: The heat of the flames, the distance that new fires are starting ahead of the main fires because of sparks that were blown by very strong winds,\" he told CNA. \"As firefighters, we had to run for our lives on a number of occasions. There were streets we simply just couldn't go into because of the intensity of the fires. There were many, many homes that caught on fire and there was no way that we could put them out.\" READ: 'Too late to leave': Bushfires out of control across southeast Australia It is these type of fire events, unparalleled in Australia's history, that experts confidently predict will return in the near future. Last year was the country's driest and hottest in known history. It is not a record expected to stand for long. A FUTURE YOU REALLY WANT? The rise in temperature that Australia experienced in 2019 - more than two degrees above the 1960-1990 baseline - was \"extraordinary\", according to Professor Mark Howden, the director of the Climate Change Institute at the Australian National University and Vice Chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. And the science indicates that the only trajectory for heat in the country is up. \"We're likely to see that go up and up and up under the current emission commitments and actions that are taken globally. That will continue to drive things like extreme fires,\" Prof Howden said. READ: Authorities warn Australian bushfires developing their own weather systems He says there will be no time to get used to this hotter, drier environment. More intense, prolonged and damaging weather systems are on the way. \"In a constantly changing environment, there is no new normal. The new normal is continuous change. As soon as we start to think we're on top of climate change, new things will happen that we're not able to manage,\" he said. Historical climatologist Dr Linden Ashcroft researches past weather patterns and events to help better understand our climate future. And it is scary, she says. \"It was the hottest and driest and not by a little bit. We truly knocked it out of the park,\" she said. \"Scientifically, we know that these events are going to happen more often. But how common, how frequent and how devastating they are comes down to how much more we let the world heat up. \"It's not to say there won't be a future, but is that a future you really want? Where you have to wear a mask every day in the summer to walk your dog because every mountain is on fire. If you're afraid to go out into nature because a fire could start any time, then that's a weird world to be in. I think we can do better than that.\" READ: UN warns more extreme weather ahead after hottest decade on record READ: Extreme weather events in 2019 - Killer typhoons, Venice floods and the Sydney smoke crisis The Australian government has been reticent to draw direct comparisons between these bushfires and climate change. In fact, scepticism of the global crisis among influential members of the ruling party has stymied even modest changes to Australia's economy, energy use or major industry. The country overwhelmingly relies on mineral extraction, including coal, and exports as a source of national prosperity, as a result making it one of the worst polluters, per capita, in the world. Even throughout this disaster season, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has proven reluctant to answer probing questions about the impacts of climate change and worsening future fire seasons. He has suffered in public opinion polls in recent weeks. \"You cannot link any individual, single emissions reduction policy of any country, whether it's Australia or anyone else, to any specific fire event,\" Morrison told the ABC during an interview on Jan 10. \"I mean, that's just absurd.\" 'THE TIPPING POINT IS VERY NEAR' The government has committed to reducing its national emissions by 26 per cent to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030 under the Paris Agreement, a lowly objective compared to many other developed nations. But it is unclear whether the very limited climate policies currently in place will get the country close to achieving that target. \"The policies currently are flatlining our greenhouse emissions. They're not heading them downwards,\" Prof Howden said. \"There are ways of moving ahead on this issue but it does require a change of mindset and it does require leadership.\" The Australian Greens, a minor but vocal party on the national and state level, has been escalating its calls for \"a wholesale shake up of our political, economic, and social systems\". \"Australia has sadly become an embarrassment on the world stage. Not only are we not taking enough action on climate change but we have been trying to wreck climate change action globally as well,\" said NSW Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi. Commentary: Climate change needs better storytelling to address severe threats Other experts have highlighted the potential for Australia to refashion mining-dependent towns into renewable energy hubs and invest in new innovative technology. The potential political cost of such dramatic or expensive actions have long proven a barrier. Yet despite a polarised national debate, powered by government rhetoric and prominent media outlets, a 2019 survey by independent think tank Lowy Institute showed Australians overwhelmingly accepted the challenges and risks that lay ahead. With shocking images of bushfires destroying the environment around the country and toxic smoke hanging for weeks in major cities - and even spreading around the globe - there is a growing sense that change and action is required. \"It's really captured the world's imagination about what a scary apocalypse looks like. It's so visual. It's so graphically terrifying,\" Dr Ashcroft said. \"The community obviously has been going through a rollercoaster of emotions: distress, sadness, anxiety and anger. A lot of anger,\" Faruqi added. \"The community is definitely demanding strong actions and I do feel that the tipping point is very near, if it is not here already. We need to make sure that business as usual is no longer what we do,\" she said. Greg Mullins says he and other former fire chiefs tried to warn Prime Minister Morrison months ago about the fire threat this year and for the years to come. After being \"fobbed off\", now he sees victims angrily demanding more from their leaders. \"People in Australia want to know why these were the worst fires ever experienced and why we can't seem to do much about it. And that's because it has been supercharged by climate change. Therefore, action must be taken.\" Business owner Lexie Dunn is one of those suffering, her beloved Mogo store a pile of burned rubble and facing tens of thousands of dollars of losses. She is questioning strategies from authorities to keep people safe. \"This is too big now to be just sweeping the ash under the mat and forgetting about it. They can't afford to screw up again,\" she said. READ: Relief as rain falls over Australian bushfires READ: Rain to bring relief, risks to fire-stricken Australia As adaptation and resilience emerge as political buzzwords in the aftermath of the very worst fires this season, tough questions also loom for bush communities and the viability of rebuilding houses, businesses and lives in increasingly vulnerable locations. Because regardless of national policy, relief will not be coming anytime soon. READ: Australia seen waiting till March for sustained rains to douse bushfires Unimaginable swathes of blackened bush and forest now dominate the landscape of southeast Australia. Land that is fortunately still green today could burn next summer. \"There is no guarantee that this won't happen again. And the way the climate change is affecting our everyday lives, it will happen again,\" Rochelle Ethell said, reflecting on her long-term future in their Long Beach home, surrounded by nature. \"We built in this beautiful environment, surrounded by birds and wildlife to give our children an upbringing so they get to enjoy those things. And we might lose that next summer. \"Until we make some significant changes, we're always going to have this prospect of bushfires. It's heartbreaking and you just feel so helpless. No one is leading us in the right direction. It gets me upset. And it's scary.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12270996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y0W-13X1-JCDN-1187-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1909\"/><timeReceived>10:11 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Just as the Sino-American trade spat took a breather, a transatlantic trade war appears to have flared. The US threatened to whack US$2.4 billion in duties on French champagne, beauty products and handbags as tit for tat for the proposed French digital tax on American tech firms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And just as the Australian bushfires were being dampened by torrential downpours, after having scorched a land area equivalent to Scotland, taking the lives of 30 people and over a billion animals, and torching over 2,600 homes, another black swan \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a sudden and unpredictable misfortune \u00e2\u20ac\u201d has erupted in China.</p><p>It is the untreatable Wuhan coronavirus. A close relative of SARs (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) that terrorised the world in 2002-2003, the coronavirus has caused over 130 deaths and more than 7,000 infections in China alone.</p><p>Some 30,000 are under observation. The virus has spread to all provinces in China. This is despite the harsh lockdown of Wuhan and 13 other cities \u00e2\u20ac\u201d combined home to 36 million people. The virus has also spread to other countries. Malaysia and Singapore have a number of confirmed cases, too.</p><p>On the political front, one segment of the country is predisposed to banning Chinese tourists from coming into the country. An online petition to do so has garnered 300,000 signatures. The intention is a noble one but a blanket ban on Chinese tourists may not be politically palatable on three counts.</p><p>First, the virus is already in the country. So a blanket ban may only delay the spread but not stop it. Second, such a move might cast an aspersion on the Chinese government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s resolve to contain the scourge. As Colette, a French author, once said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It is wise to apply the oil of refined politeness to the mechanism of friendship.\u00e2\u20ac</p><p>China has already suspended local and international travel in and out of Hubei province, the origin of the Wuhan virus. In an attempt to shunt a disproportionate amount of resources to tackle this novel virus, the government has sent 2,500 medical workers to Wuhan. It is also building apace two prefabricated hospitals with 1,000 beds each to treat the infected.</p><p>Third, Malaysia has also taken the pre-emptive step to ban tourists from Hubei. The Health Ministry has fortified health screening at all entry points and 26 hospitals are being prepared to handle any spike in cases. As Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Dr Wan Azizah Wan Ismail has rightly pointed out, Malaysia will be justified in imposing an outright ban should the World Health Organisation declare the contagion as a global pandemic.</p><p>Stock markets around the world are reeling from this crisis. Travel restrictions by both countries are hurting the economy. It is being acutely felt by travel and transport operators, hoteliers and F&amp;B operators. If the situation persists, it may well eat into our business and consumer confidence. Singapore and Japan are also beginning to feel the impact on these sectors given their popularity with Chinese tourists.</p><p>Last year, Malaysia received close to three million Chinese tourists, spending an estimated RM15 billion. We are the sixth most popular tourism destination for the Chinese after Thailand, Japan, Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia. And Chinese-tourist arrivals have been surging since 2014.</p><p>True, life cannot be measured in ringgit and sen. But we do not want to lose out to neighbouring countries by our overreaction in imposing a blanket travel ban. It does not say much for Visit Malaysia Year 2020.</p><p>Here are five suggestions to overcome the political and economic anxiety caused by the outbreak. First, the government should issue a contingency plan and a protocol as to how it and the public should respond to this outbreak should it be declared a pandemic. This will include the allocation of resources \u00e2\u20ac\u201d human and financial. Quarantine facilities should be made available.</p><p>Second, the government should be transparent, and it has been so far, about its actions to contain the pathogen. It should post regular bulletins as more details surface about this virus, the extent of the contagion and the steps taken to redress it.</p><p>Similarly, the government should constantly post information on how it is working with the Chinese government to contain this outbreak. This will allay people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fears for their health and that of their family. And it will surely stem panic among them.</p><p>Third, the government should ease the pain of the affected businesses.\u00c2\u00a0It should work closely with related trade associations to assess the impact of this outbreak and lend support to the businesses by reducing their costs, helping them to retain workers. Fourth, for the long term, the government will have to accelerate its economic and market diversification plans to toughen our economic resilience.</p><p>Fifth, prevention is better than cure. The public has an important role to stay safe by taking precautions, including the regular washing of hands, staying away from crowded places and wearing face masks and gloves, especially in handling livestock. Obviously, it will also include refraining from eating wild animals. Better vigilance by the government and the people should help contain the outbreak.</p><p>( END )</p><p>CALAMITY after calamity seems to dog the New Year. Just as the Sino-American trade spat took a breather, a transatlantic trade war appears to have flared.

But for some Australians involved in the coal-mining industry, the fires seemed to mainly be a natural catastrophe: Australia has had bushfires, even serious ones, since time immemorial and so there is no reason to put the blame on the exploitation of fossil fuels. So, is anthropogenic climate change real? Or is it be a matter of personal opinion? BIG HISTORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE Let us start with a simpler question: has the climate really changed?</p><p> The weather varies from day to day and season to season. These changes tend to reverse so that the environment never strays far from a stable, mean condition. This stable condition is what we refer to conceptually as the climate. Climate refers to both the physical and chemical state of the environment. It characterises not just the air but also the land, sea and ice on the planet. Therefore, a change in climate is a fundamental shift in the environment, unlike changes in weather, which is shorter term. Since the late 19th century, instruments documenting the average temperature of the Earth's surface show that the temperature has gone up by about 1 degree Celsius. Over the same period, the global mean sea level has climbed by nearly one-quarter metre at an increasing pace. This is because oceans expand thermally and because ice-caps and glaciers melt and flow into the sea. The chemical composition of the air is also a telling marker for our changing climate: carbon dioxide concentration has risen from around 290 ppmv (parts per million by volume) in 1880 to 400 ppmv in 2020. Today's elevated level of carbon dioxide is alarming because ancient air bubbles trapped in Antarctica's ice reveal that the level never exceeded 300 ppmv for the past 800,000 years. The big history of climate change has arrived. READ: Commentary - The wonder of clear skies and returning wildlife is our new climate problem HOW DOES CLIMATE CHANGE AFFECT US? When the climate warms, extreme hot, dry weather becomes more severe and last longer, thus increasing the occurrence of forest fires that destroy life and property. This is what happened in Australia's case. Smoke from widespread fires creates haze which irritates the eyes and exacerbates respiratory illnesses. A regional haze episode can last for weeks to months. Meanwhile, unreliable water supply from rain catchment compels cities to rely more on costly desalination and water reclamation technologies. Just recall the dry spell in Singapore from July to September last year. As the sea level rises, agriculture in low-lying river deltas takes a hit: the Mekong delta has suffered from seawater seeping into precious paddy fields. As food prices tend to rise whenever food production falls, a populous, rice-importing nation like Indonesia is vulnerable to rice production cut-backs in Vietnam. There are many other examples that illustrate how climate change impacts negatively our lives and the economy. But the consequences go beyond human society as ecosystems are sensitive to environmental changes too. Warmer seas have bleached coral from the Great Barrier Reef in Southwest Pacific to the Maldives in Indian Ocean, for instance. UNDERSTANDING THE ROOT CAUSE Nowadays, many climate change sceptics no longer deny the reality of climate change. However, they argue that climate change is due to natural causes like an increase in the Sun's radiation. So how do we know that the scientists are right when they say that climate change is mainly caused by emissions of greenhouse gases? \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b The science of how greenhouse gases lead to global warming is no mystery: a greenhouse gas (GHG) is an atmospheric constituent that is effective in absorbing and emitting infrared radiation - a kind of light that has a longer wavelength than is visible to our eyes. Water vapour, carbon dioxide and methane are the three most abundant naturally occurring GHGs. The Earth's surface emits mainly infrared light upwards which is mostly absorbed by GHGs. Then GHGs re-emit the infrared light, some eventually escaping upward into space while the rest goes back downward. The Earth's surface re-absorbs the downward infrared light converting some of it into heat. This radiative transfer naturally keeps the Earth warm enough for life to exist. But from the time of the industrialisation, humankind has burnt much coal, oil and natural gas for energy, producing excessive carbon dioxide that has accumulated to the unprecedented levels today. Fossil-fuel mining, cattle farming and rice cultivation have also released much methane into the environment. The increased concentration of GHGs leads to greater absorption and re-emission of infrared light, causing the Earth's surface to be excessively warm and hence the sea level to rise. READ: Greener and cleaner - Reimagining our cities in the wake of COVID-19 REFUTING THE CLIMATE SCEPTICS There is an important fact which refutes the sceptics' argument that the Sun's radiation has simply increased. It is a little known fact that the temperature of the atmosphere does not change uniformly. Observations made by satellites from space show that around 15 to 25 km above the Earth's surface, in a layer of the atmosphere called the \"lower stratosphere\", there has been a long-term cooling trend since the late 1970s. The existence of global cooling refutes the climate sceptics' simple explanation that today's climate change is due to the Sun warming the Earth more. At the same time, this reinforces our understanding of the GHGs' effect. When GHGs absorb infrared light, they re-emit the radiation both downwards and upwards. As the downward infrared light warms up the Earth's surface, the upward infrared light simultaneously carries energy away into space. It is the increase in escaping energy from higher GHG concentration that cools the lower stratosphere. The distinctive pattern of warming-below-and-cooling-above is the fingerprint that identifies the culpability of GHGs. FAST-FORWARD TO THE FUTURE The climate has been changing for more than 100 years because of man-made GHG emissions. Projecting into the future, if we continue our business as usual, carbon dioxide levels are expected to exceed 900 ppmv before the year 2100. Scientists estimate that global average surface temperature will warm by about 3 to 5 degrees Celsius and global mean sea level will rise by about half to one metre over the 21st century. Changes in rainfall patterns are harder to predict but in Southeast Asia, droughts will likely worsen. Today, Singapore's daily temperature varies on average between 25 and 31 degrees Celsius. This spans 6 degrees Celsius. If we fast-forward to the decade 2091 - 2100, Singapore may be confronted with the possibility that its normal night-time temperature would be as high as today's normal day-time temperature! By 2100, about half the land in the Mekong delta of Vietnam could be lost to seawater intrusion. The risks posed to water and food resources will be grave if we continue to emit GHGs while ignoring climate change. READ: Capacity of drains 'overwhelmed by intense rainfall' during Apr 30 flash floods in parts of Singapore, says Masagos ACT TODAY, LIVE BETTER TOMORROW The anticipation of dire consequences of anthropogenic climate change in the lifetimes of our children and grandchildren should spur us into action today in reducing GHG emissions and adapting to climate change. There are four sets of actions that individuals can resolve to: One, to conserve energy because most fossil fuel today is burnt to provide energy. For example, enjoying fewer hot showers and raising temperature settings in air-conditioners, or using more public transport and taking the stairs instead of the lift, all contribute to mitigate the emissions of carbon dioxide. Two, to save water and reduce food wastage. The purification or reclamation of freshwater and the production, processing and transport of food expends energy, indirectly emitting carbon dioxide. Moreover, when food supply matches closely food demand, less methane is released unnecessarily in food production. READ: Commentary - Climate change in Singapore and what the future brings Three, to avoid the use of plastics whenever possible. Plastics are mainly manufactured from petrochemicals derived from crude oil. When incinerated after disposal, plastics convert to carbon dioxide too. Four, to pay attention to and pick out scientifically reliable information on climate change. This would foster an enlightened and responsible attitude in supporting climate action policies. While the above actions are not going to stop climate change, because the current-day elevated levels of GHGs are already warming the Earth's surface, they help to alleviate future impacts and ease adaptation to the new climate. Anthropogenic climate change is real. We have to act now.

The heavy winds also hit flights into Sydney, the country's busiest airport, where one runway was shut for three hours on Monday morning, Air Services Australia said. READ: More than 100 Australian bushfires omen of severe summer fire season: Authorities Bushfires have started earlier than normal in the states of Queensland and New South Wales, in the southern hemisphere spring, prompting fire service warnings for the summer, which runs from December through February. </p><p>\"This early in the season is unprecedented,\" said Neil Gallant, deputy commissioner of the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services, following two years of drought that have left extensive parts of the country parched. \"But if this is what it's like now, we really are concerned that over the next few months we're going to get no respite from these sorts of bushfire conditions,\" he told Australian Broadcasting Corp TV. As of Monday, five properties had been confirmed destroyed, with five damaged in New South Wales (NSW), while more than 200 homes fires were saved from the flames, the NSW Rural Fire Service said. The Bureau of Meteorology warned of damaging winds, with peak gusts of about 90 kilometres an hour, along the east coast of New South Wales for Monday. The wind was expected to ease on Tuesday. Winds are being driven by a deep low pressure system over the Tasman Sea between Australia and New Zealand and a high pressure system off the south coast in the Great Australian Bight, the bureau said. - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11887052</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0Y-N1R1-DYWP-R436-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"282\"/><timeReceived>5:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Cooler conditions were expected to ease the danger in the state of New South Wales, where 83 fires were still burning, however changes in wind direction in the northeastern state of Queensland were expected to whip up flames there. \"We were fortunate the catastrophic ranges were not sustained for the long durations that were originally expected,\" New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons told reporters in Sydney on Wednesday morning. </p><p>Dense smoke that blanketed the northeastern part of the state on Tuesday had actually prevented strong winds from aggravating the fires, he said. Firefighters were battling blazes over a more-than-1,000km perimeter on Wednesday, with more than 1.1 million hectares of land either burnt or burning. \"We're talking an enormous proportion of the landscape, particularly in northeastern New South Wales that remains at risk and continues to be damaged and devastated as a result of these fires,\" Fitzsimmons said. Police were investigating some fires that they suspected had been deliberately lit in Queensland and New South Wales. Four people in New South Wales were charged with breaching a total fire ban order, sparking fury from the state's police minister. \"You must have arrived on Mars in a bubble if you didn't know yesterday that the state was in severe danger,\" he said at the same media conference. One resident of the mid-north coast area of New South Wales, speaking from an evacuation centre in Taree, said her husband had stayed overnight at their home battling to keep a raging fire at bay. \"It was just chewing up everything,\" Karen Weston told Australian Broadcasting Corp. \"I've survived two other bushfires before this but never anything like this. I've never seen anything like this.\" Officials warned that while conditions were easing on Wednesday, a blast of hot air next week meant conditions would remain tough for firefighters. \"It's going to be a long effort yet. Many days, many weeks, indeed many months if we don't get rain before we properly bring these fires under control, establish consolidation and declare them safe,\" Fitzsimmons said. - Reuters/de</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12088496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGS-XYT1-JCDN-14BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"393\"/><timeReceived>10:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The accident occurred when the truck crashed into a tree then rolled off the road during an operation late on Thursday at Buxton, about 100km southwest of Sydney, the NSW Rural Fire Service said. \"This is an absolutely devastating event in what has already been an incredibly difficult day and fire season,\" the RFS said in a statement. The RFS named the dead volunteer firefighters as Andrew O'Dwyer, 36, and Geoffrey Keaton, 32 - both fathers to 19-month-old children. </p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison paid tribute to the firefighters, saying their sacrifice would always be remembered. \"They were bravely defending their communities with an unmatched spirit and a dedication that will forever set them apart amongst our most courageous Australians,\" he said in a statement. READ: Australia beats hottest day record by full degree READ: Australian state declares emergency as wildfires approach Sydney Shortly after the pair's deaths were announced, Morrison also issued a statement saying he would return as soon as possible from a family holiday in Hawaii, a trip that has drawn sharp criticism in recent days as the wildfires crisis deepened. Morrison's conservative Liberal-National coalition government has been under sustained pressure to defend its climate change policies as it has downplayed links to the unprecedented early arrival and severity of this year's bushfire season. \"I deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\" Morrison said in the statement. Morrison later told 2GB radio that the trip had been planned as a surprise to his young daughters to replace leave originally scheduled for January that he had cancelled because of official trips to Japan and India. READ: Toxic Sydney bushfire haze a \"public health emergency\" READ: Extreme weather events in 2019: Killer typhoons, Venice floods and the Sydney smoke crisis Hundreds of protesters had gathered outside his Sydney residence on Thursday. One protestor, wearing a Hawaiian shirt, carried a sign reading, \"ScoMo, where the bloody hell are you?\" referencing the leader's nickname and a well-known international advertisement for Tourism Australia. NSW has declared a state of emergency as an unprecedented heatwave fans bushfires that have destroyed homes and smothered huge areas with toxic smoke, including Australia's largest city Sydney. Thousands of firefighters are trying to contain the blazes amid record temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius in places. Morrison warned conditions were set to worsen. \"These fires and heat conditions are horrendous, and there are still difficult days ahead, with Saturday predicted to be the most severe day, with extreme temperatures and wind making conditions very difficult for fire crews,\" he said. - Agencies/de/ad</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12198838</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XSN-VP11-JCDN-13V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"506\"/><timeReceived>9:51 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Bear, a Cattle Dog cross-breed, is trained to find both koalas and and quolls, another small Australian marsupial, in the wild. \"This is the first year that we have been involved in the fires,\" Romane Cristescu, his minder and ecologist at The University of the Sunshine Coast, told Reuters. \"It is a bit more dangerous than what we usually do.\" READ: Smoke haze blankets Sydney as bushfire threat rises Bear, who usually looks for sick or injured wildlife for conservation and research purposes in calmer conditions, has been wearing protective socks on his paws to search through areas scorched by fire. Bushfires have ravaged about 1 million hectares of farmland and bush across Australia's east coast in recent weeks, killing four people and destroying hundreds of homes. The country's koala populations have also been a major victim of the flames, with more than 350 of the marsupials feared killed in a major habitat.

On Saturday morning, there were six emergency-level fires burning in NSW, with more than 70 fires across the state in total. Further north in Queensland, thousands of residents from the Sunshine Coast region spent the night in evacuation centres, after fire authorities told them to leave.
