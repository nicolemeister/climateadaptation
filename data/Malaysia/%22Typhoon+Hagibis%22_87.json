Olympic organisers have rescheduled rowing and archery over concerns about high winds from Tropical Storm Nepartak, which is packing gusts of up to 108 kmh. The storm, currently around 190km east of Choshi city, was originally headed for Tokyo, but has shifted north and is now expected to make landfall around the Miyagi region early on Wednesday. </p><p>Miyagi and neighbouring Ibaraki are hosting several Olympic events - some of the few that fans are allowed to attend, but organisers said they would not be affected by the storm. \"Games in Miyagi and Ibaraki will be held as scheduled. We expect spectators to come watch too,\" Tokyo 2020 spokesman Masa Takaya told reporters. On Tuesday, the approaching storm was already bringing wind and rain to parts of Japan's east coast, making for challenging conditions at the women's triathlon in Tokyo. The event started 15 minutes late because of the weather and the wet roads slipped up several athletes during the cycling section. But conditions were better at the surfing competition, taking place east of Tokyo in Chiba. Organisers decided to squeeze the quarter-finals, semi-finals and medal events of the men's and women's competitions into Tuesday to take advantage of the waves. Japanese government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told reporters on Tuesday that the storm was moving very slowly and already producing strong winds and rough seas along much of the northeast coast. He warned of \"heavy rain through tomorrow\" in the areas around Tokyo, as well as the Tohoku region to the northeast and the Hokuriku region to the northwest, where the storm will head after making landfall. Kato urged local residents to \"pay attention to the latest information about the weather and evacuation orders\". Some train services in the area where the storm will hit have been cancelled, and non-mandatory evacuation orders have been issued around the town of Atami, where heavy rain earlier this month caused a landslide that killed 21 people. Japan's typhoon season runs from around May to October, peaking in August and September. In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis hit as Japan hosted the Rugby World Cup, killing more 100 people. - Reuters/dv</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-15306252</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637F-M4S1-JCDN-11HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"394\"/><timeReceived>4:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The loose forward, 36, was set to retire after Italy's World Cup campaign in Japan last year but was denied his chance to play a potential farewell match when Typhoon Hagibis forced the cancellation of their final pool game against New Zealand. </p><p>Parisse, who has been capped 142 times - third in the all-time rankings behind All Blacks' great Richie McCaw (148) and Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones (143) - said he would not play the entire Six Nations tournament after discussions with interim head coach Franco Smith. \"I told Smith my desire to end my international career in Rome in front of my family, my friends and our fans,\" Parisse told Corriere dello Sport. \"He agrees that I cannot end with that match cancelled by the typhoon. I will face Scotland, England or both, but I will certainly not play the entire Six Nations.\" Italy begin their Six Nations campaign with a trip to Wales on Feb. 1 followed by a second away game in France a week later. Their first home game is against Scotland on Feb. 22 and they host England in their final game on March 14.

Elsewhere in the gym, cardboard partitions separate the 233 evacuees' sleeping areas and another sign instructs them to check their temperature each morning, then sterilise the thermometers. The measures show what a thorny issue it is for Japan to deal with natural disasters in the time of coronavirus. READ: Japan issues fresh rain disaster warnings as toll hits 54 Japanese authorities have been warning local officials for months to include coronavirus measures in their disaster preparations. </p><p>Residents have been urged to seek shelter with friends or relatives if possible to avoid overcrowding evacuation centres. But coronavirus contagion was the last thing on the mind of 78-year-old retiree Aiko Ishimura when neighbours knocked on her door on Monday to tell her about evacuation orders. Ishimura, who lives alone, had planned to shelter at home. \"So we just came as we were. We were in such a rush to come here, we didn't bring anything,\" Ishimura, who fled with neighbours, told Reuters. \"I wasn't worried at all about coronavirus, not at all.\" \"We don't have many cases here in the first place. We don't really do the whole mask-wearing thing,\" she added, although she said she keeps a mask in her pocket. READ: Rain hampers rescue efforts after deadly Japan floods Kumomoto prefecture, where Yatsushiro is located, has had only 49 of Japan's more than 20,000 coronavirus cases, according to public broadcaster NHK. That compares with close to 7,000 in Tokyo, where cases are on the rise again among its 14 million residents. Misa Matsuda, a 48-year-old nurse, accustomed to the annual floods in the region, had also intended to remain at home. But she was stunned early Monday when she opened her door and found the river flowing just a few feet from her house. \"I thought, there's no way the water would come up here to our house, where it's a bit of a hill,\" she said. Extreme weather disasters have become increasingly common in Japan recently. Last year, Typhoon Hagibis killed nearly 100 people, a year after more than 200 died in western Japan in the worst flooding in decades. Matsuda said she wasn't too concerned about coronavirus because basic steps were being taken, but did worry residents would congregate to chat, creating just the sort of crowded conditions authorities say increase infection risk. City official Takanobu Ono said the evacuation centre was limited to 300 people despite a capacity for 500. But he said the priority for evacuees was escaping with their lives. \"Some of have just been saved by the skin of their teeth,\" he said. \"The reality is that coronavirus is less of a concern for them ... So we're taking the measures we have to, but haven't been so strict about it.\" READ: Japan's household spending drops at record pace as COVID-19 hits economy About 60 people have died or were feared dead from floods and landslides triggered by torrential rains that have pounded the southwestern island of Kyushu, including Kumamoto prefecture, since Saturday. Extreme rain warnings were issued for parts of central Japan on Wednesday. Disaster experts said persuading people to evacuate early and find alternative shelters was vital, but agreed that convincing people to plan ahead was often tough. \"We kept saying, 'Check your hazard map,'\" said Masako Yoneda of the Japan Academic Network for Disaster Reduction, which issued an urgent warning on the topic in May. \"But still, there are people who don't check.\" BOOKMARK THIS: Our comprehensive coverage of the coronavirus outbreak and its developments Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: <url normalizedValue=\"https://cna.asia/telegram\">https://cna.asia/telegram</url> - Reuters/aa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12912246</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609J-TPV1-JCDN-118M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"655\"/><timeReceived>3:36 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The decisive Pool A match had been in doubt after two Saturday fixtures were cancelled due to safety concerns surrounding Typhoon Hagibis which killed at least 11 people as it left a trail of destruction in central Japan. </p><p>READ: Canadian players help typhoon recovery efforts in Japan READ: Japan sends in thousands of troops after Typhoon Hagibis hammers Tokyo Wales beat Uruguay 35-13 to confirm a quarter-final with France, and Tonga overcame USA 31-19 in the two other games given the all-clear after Saturday's storm, one of the worst to hit Japan in recent years. A poignant moment's silence was held before both games to remember the victims of Hagibis, whose \"unprecedented\" heavy rain triggered deadly landslides and caused rivers to burst their banks. Sunday's game between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi was called off because of damage caused in the area by the storm. Cancellation was a blow for the northern town of Kamaishi, whose hosting of World Cup games was a potent symbol of recovery from a 2011 tsunami disaster when it was nearly wiped off the map. It also robs Namibia of a chance to grab their first World Cup win and end their record run of 22 games at the tournament without a victory. Canada are without a win in their last 10 World Cup matches. The cancellation means that only one game was held at the Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium - Uruguay's stunning, 30-27 upset of Fiji in Pool D. READ: Tokyo, central Japan left devastated by Typhoon Hagibis READ: Typhoon Hagibis kills 7 in Japan as rescue efforts intensify Fifteen people remain missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades paralyzed Tokyo, flooding rivers and leaving almost half a million homes without power. Authorities lifted rain and flood warnings for the Kanto region around a becalmed Tokyo before dawn as the typhoon plowed up Japan's northeast coast. Warnings for areas north of the capital began to be lifted by Sunday morning. Hagibis made landfall on Saturday evening and barrelled across the country, bringing fierce winds and torrential rain. It was a direct hit on Tokyo and Yokohama, a city of some three million just south of the capital. Typhoon Hagibis was expected to head out to sea on Sunday evening after churning its way up the northern island of Hokkaido. It was the first time in the 32-year history of the Rugby World Cup that games had been scrapped, and raised criticism of the decision to hold the tournament during Japan's typhoon season. - Reuters/mn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11995788</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X87-CNH1-DYWP-R17S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"482\"/><timeReceived>2:08 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The typhoon is predicted to be one of the most violent tropical storms to hit the region in recent years and is expected to strike the Tokyo area this weekend. Rugby World Cup organisers are expected to announce that England's game against France on Saturday has been cancelled and that Sunday's game between Japan and Scotland is in doubt due to the potential impact of the typhoon. \"The FIA (Formula One's governing body), Formula One, Suzuka Circuit and the Japanese Automobile Federation are closely monitoring Typhoon Hagibis and its potential impact on the 2019 FIA Formula One Japanese Grand Prix,\" organisers said in a statement on Thursday. \"Every effort is being made to minimise disruption to the Formula One timetable, however the safety of the fans, competitors and everyone at the Suzuka Circuit remains the top priority,\" it said, adding that updates would be provided in due course. The Suzuka circuit, which is set to host Sunday's race, is about 300 kilometres south west of Tokyo.

All practice and qualifying sessions on Saturday were cancelled as the storm approached, with the track closed to the public and media. </p><p>Having battened down the hatches on Friday evening in preparation for the coming storm, with the entire broadcast centre, circuit TV screens, starting lights and even the podium taken down and stowed away, it was all systems go on Sunday morning. The rescheduled qualifying session, which will decide the starting grid for the race was set to go ahead as planned at 10 a.m. local time (0100 GMT), with the race on schedule for its 2:10 p.m. (0510 GMT) start. Typhoon Hagibis, which also forced the cancellation of two rugby World Cup matches, may have largely spared Suzuka, about 300 kilometres southwest of Tokyo. But it exacted its toll in other parts of the country. Four people were killed and 17 were missing after Hagibis, the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades, paralysed the capital Tokyo, flooded rivers and put millions under evacuation warning before it ploughed up the northeastern coast. The storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas.

Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan on Saturday night, with heavy rain causing landslides and dozens of rivers to burst their banks. By Tuesday night, Japanese media reported that at least 72 people had died, with about a dozen missing. </p><p>The government's tally was lower, but it said it was still updating information. More than 200 people were injured in the storm, whose name means \"speed\" in the Tagalog language. In a letter to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Mr Lee said: \"I was saddened to learn of the tragic loss of life, and the injury and destruction caused by Typhoon Hagibis. \"On behalf of the Government of Singapore, I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those affected. Our thoughts are with you and the people of Japan during this difficult period.\" READ: Typhoon Hagibis: Tokyo, central Japan left devastated About 110,000 police, coast guard, firefighters and soldiers are involved in the rescue operations, Mr Abe said. His office added that more than 3,000 people have been rescued in the wake of the disaster, which affected 36 of the country's 47 prefectures. Mr Lee added: \"I am confident that Japan will, with its usual resilience, recover from this disaster quickly and emerge stronger. \"Please let us know if Singapore can be of any assistance in the relief efforts.\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6BzaK9tq3Y\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6BzaK9tq3Y</url>Japanese government officials warned that more rain was expected throughout the day on Tuesday in several parts of the country affected by the typhoon. \"We ask people not to drop their guard and to remain fully alert,\" chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters. Hagibis crashed into land, packing gusts up to 216kmh, but it was the storm's heavy rain that caused the most damage. At least 176 rivers burst their banks, including in central Nagano, where a levee breach sent water from the Chikuma river gushing into residential neighbourhoods and submerging bullet trains in a depot up to their windows. By Tuesday morning, around 34,000 households were still without power, and 133,000 homes had no water. Tens of thousands of people spent Monday night in government shelters, with many unsure when they would be able to return home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12002702</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-7HN1-JCDN-135C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><timeReceived>11:39 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Typhoon Hagibis is due to make landfall on the main island of Honshu on Saturday (Oct 12), and is expected to bring record rainfall and gusts of up to 216kmh, said Japan's meteorological agency. Singapore Airlines (SIA) said several of its flights have been affected, with four flights departing ahead of schedule before the typhoon makes landfall. </p><p>Affected SIA flight routes include Los Angeles-Narita, Singapore-Kansai, Kansai-Singapore, Singapore-Nagoya and Nagoya-Singapore.

The airline's low-cost arm Scoot said it has cancelled eight flights and retimed another seven. Flights to and from Tokyo and Osaka were cancelled, with customers re-accommodated to flights scheduled on Sunday and Monday. Some of its flights to Kaohsiung and Taipei in Taiwan have also been delayed or cancelled. Scoot said it is monitoring the situation for subsequent flights, and will notify customers by SMS or email for updates. \"As the situation remains fluid, customers are encouraged to prepare for possible contingencies in their travel plans, including purchasing travel insurance, during this period,\" the airline said. The storm is expected to cause transport chaos over a holiday weekend in Japan, with many forced to cancel travel plans.

Bullet train services and local rail lines have also been suspended. The storm has also disrupted a Formula One Grand Prix and rugby's World Cup. Japan is hit by around 20 typhoons a year, though the capital is not usually badly affected. Hagibis is bearing down on the region just weeks after another powerful storm, Typhoon Faxai, hit the area with similar strength, killing two and causing major damage in Chiba, east of the capital. More than 36,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Chiba, and the local government has urged those in damaged buildings to take shelter elsewhere during the storm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11991612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-BTC1-JCDN-1116-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"434\"/><timeReceived>8:33 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Authorities lifted rain and flood warnings for the Kanto region around a becalmed Tokyo before dawn but imposed them on areas further north after Typhoon Hagibis blasted through the capital. The four deaths were reported in Chiba, Gunma, Kanagawa and Fukushima prefectures surrounding Tokyo, public broadcaster NHK. Among them was a man in his 60s who was found with no vital signs in a flooded apartment in Kawasaki, NHK said. </p><p>Attention focused on Fukushima, where Tokyo Electric Power Co overnight reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant, which was crippled by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. In parts of Fukushima and Nagano prefectures, heavy rain caused rivers to flood their banks, submerging houses and rice paddies and forcing some people to climb onto their roofs for safety. Houses along the Chikuma river in Nagano were nearly under water and at least one person was rescued from the roof of a house by helicopter, NHK said. Part of a road was swept away in flooding. Authorities issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Some 100 injuries have been reported so far, while more than 270,000 households lost power, NHK said. The storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm (37 inches) of rain over 24 hours. READ: Typhoon Hagibis kills 4 in Japan as rescue efforts intensify Hagibis, which means \"speed\" in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan's main island of Honshu on Saturday evening. A magnitude 5.7 earthquake shook Tokyo shortly after. Major shinkansen bullet trains from Tokyo would begin on schedule Sunday, NHK said, while the Tokyo subway system was also operating. One expert, Nobuyuki Tsuchiya, director of the Japan Riverfront Research Center, had earlier told Reuters that further flooding could occur as several surrounding prefectures began releasing water from dams, letting it flow downstream. About 1.5 million people in Tokyo live below sea level. The Japan Meteorological Agency issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of potential for once in decades rain totals. It lifted the alerts early Sunday. Just last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR5F48n-RsU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR5F48n-RsU</url> READ: Magnitude 5.7 earthquake strikes off Japan's Chiba prefecture The capital's main airports, Haneda and Narita, stopped flights from landing and connecting trains were suspended, forcing the cancellation of more than a thousand flights. Many people in and around Tokyo took shelter in temporary evacuation facilities early, before the worst of the storm arrived. Yuka Ikemura, a 24-year-old nursery school teacher, was in one such facility at a community center in eastern Tokyo with her 3-year-old son, 8-month-old daughter and their pet rabbit. She said she decided to move before it was too late. \"I've got small children to take care of and we live on the first floor of an old apartment,\" Ikemura told Reuters. \"We brought with us the bare necessities. I'm scared to think about when we will have run out diapers and milk.\" The Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada on Sunday in Kamaishi was cancelled. Two matches were cancelled on Saturday. Formula One Grand Prix organisers had cancelled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday. - Agencies/mn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11995730</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X85-NM31-DYWP-R0KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Typhoon Hagibis moved away from land on Sunday morning, but while it largely spared the capital, it left a trail of destruction in surrounding regions. At least 40 people were killed in the typhoon that left vast sections of towns in central and eastern Japan under water, with another 16 missing and 189 injured, public broadcaster NHK said. READ: Japan sends in thousands of troops after Typhoon Hagibis hammers Tokyo READ: Typhoon Hagibis - Tokyo, central Japan left devastated Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called for urgent support to those affected. \"There still are many residents who have yet to be accounted for. Our people in uniform are working day and night in search and rescue operations,\" Abe told an emergency meeting of ministers. \"Damage has been made in an extremely wide range of areas, and more than 30,000 people are still being forced to remain in the state of evacuation. It is our urgent task to offer meticulous support to those who have been affected.\" </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hb2VA79nf0\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Hb2VA79nf0</url> Groups of rescuers wearing goggles and snorkels searched for survivors while making their way in waist-high water in Nagano, central Japan, where the Chikuma River inundated swaths of land. More than 110,000 police officers, fighter fighters, soldiers and coastguard personnel, as well as some 100 helicopters were mobilised for Monday's rescue operations, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR5F48n-RsU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR5F48n-RsU</url> Military and fire department helicopters winched survivors from roofs and balconies in several locations, but in Fukushima one rescue went tragically awry when a woman died after falling from a chopper cradle. Elsewhere, rescue workers carried out an hours-long boat operation to evacuate hundreds of people from a retirement home in Kawagoe, northwest of Tokyo, which was flooded up to its top floor. One elderly woman wearing an orange life vest was brought out from a boat on the back of a hard-hat wearing rescuer. Others were hoisted onto wheelchairs and pushed along a muddy shore on arrival by boat. Hagibis smashed into the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday night as one of the most violent typhoons in recent years, with wind gusts of up to 216kmh. The destruction forced the Rugby World Cup being hosted by Japan to cancel several games, but the \"Brave Blossoms\", as the national team is known, lifted spirits with a stunning 28-21 victory over Scotland on Sunday that puts them into the quarter-finals of the tournament for the first time. MORE RAIN EXPECTED Later in the day, strong rain is forecast in some parts of central and eastern Japan, where soil is already loosened by record-breaking rain from the typhoon, prompting Suga to urge residents to keep their guard up. \"Rain is expected in affected areas today. Because of the rain we have seen so far, levels of water are high in some rivers and soil is loose in some areas,\" Suga said. \"Please remain on your guard for landslides and river overflows.\" Typhoon Hagibis claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver. Landslides and flooding took more lives overnight, and the toll climbed higher after sunrise on Sunday, as the scale of the devastation wrought by Hagibis became clear.

Five Chinese have been found dead,\" a coastguard official told AFP. He said four other crew, from China, Myanmar and Vietnam, had been rescued and search operations resumed at daybreak for the remaining three members. \"We plan to dispatch 11 boats, two helicopters and a dozen divers to the site. We are trying our best,\" he added. At the storm's peak, more than seven million people were placed under non-compulsory evacuation orders. The storm prompted the Japan Meteorological Agency to issue its highest-level rain disaster warning, saying \"unprecedented\" downpours were expected. 'I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO START' More than 92,000 households were still without power early on Monday, a national holiday, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said. The disaster left tens of thousands of people in shelters, with many unsure when they would be able to return home. \"Everything from my house was washed away before my eyes, I wasn't sure if it was a dream or real,\" a woman in Nagoya told national broadcaster NHK. \"I feel lucky I'm still alive.\" READ: Japan's capital braces for what could be worst typhoon in 60 years READ: SIA, Scoot flights to Japan affected ahead of Typhoon Hagibis \"The water came up higher than my head in the house,\" Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP. He moved to his family's home nearby, but that flooded too and they had to be rescued by boat. In Saitama's Higashi Matsuyama city, northwest of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses, with water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested produce. \"We never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,\" said one farmer, who declined to give his name. \"I don't know where to start cleaning this mess.\" The storm brought travel chaos during a long holiday weekend in Japan, grounding flights and halting local and bullet train services. By Monday, most subway trains had resumed service, along with many bullet train lines, and flights had also restarted. The storm also brought havoc to the sporting world, forcing the delay of Japanese Grand Prix qualifiers and the cancellation of three Rugby World Cup matches. But a crucial decider pitting Japan against Scotland went ahead, with the hosts dedicating their win to the victims of the disaster. \"To everyone that's suffering from the typhoon, this game was for you guys,\" said Japan captain Michael Leitch. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres on Sunday said that he was \"saddened by reports of loss of life and extensive destruction\" caused by Hagibis, and extended his \"deep condolences to the families of the victims\". - Agencies/de</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11997244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8D-MCG1-JCDN-11WT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><timeReceived>9:22 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Born in New Zealand but a resident of Japan since he was 15, Leitch captained a multicultural squad that represented a nation often perceived, by the Japanese as much as anyone, as monocultural. Three straight wins over Russia, Ireland and Samoa set the World Cup alight and triggered a mania that engulfed Japan for a few glorious weeks. Central to their success, Leitch says, was the 'One Team' ethos, bringing together players born in seven different countries to present an entirely new face of Japanese sport. </p><p>\"One thing we did well as a team was base our team in Japan and brought different ways of thinking and cultures ... into the team,\" Leitch told Reuters in an interview last month. \"This made it the team we had. \"There are a lot of things that Japanese society can take out from what we accomplished at the World Cup.\" Monday marks six months to the day since Japan's final pool fixture against Scotland, a match almost blown away by a super typhoon that caused the unprecedented cancellation of three other World Cup matches. Typhoon Hagibis threatened to wreak havoc with the tournament as it bore down on the Tokyo region. The Scots, who would have been eliminated had the match been cancelled, trained in the confines of their hotel while their union boss issued threats of legal action. Japan, by contrast, trained outside during the quieter moments of the typhoon and were raring to go when the match was given the green light a few hours before kickoff. \"We addressed it, said we weren't going to change anything, it is going to be raining but we are going to be training,\" Leitch recalled. \"We were fully focused on us beating Scotland. If we flip the coin and look at Scotland, they were very, very nervous. Which they should have been. \"For us to focus on ourselves and go out there and bounce Scotland was a very good feeling.\" It is hard to imagine much more going right for Japan on an emotional and unforgettable night at Yokohama Stadium. Scotland scored an early try but Japan soon hit their stride, replying with four of their own en route to a 28-21 win and a place in the last eight of a World Cup for the first time. At the final whistle, the home fans erupted in a frenzy that would have stirred the most stoic of neutrals. Leitch's first words were, typically, for those suffering from the typhoon. MASSIVE PRESSURE While the victory over Scotland looked nerveless, there had been some jitters in coach Jamie Joseph's squad a few weeks earlier when four years of hard work were put on the line in the tournament opener against Russia. \"The pressure was massive, we expected it and I thought we dealt with it very well,\" reflected Leitch. \"There was a period of 15 minutes where we were a bit flustered, but collectively I think we re-grouped.\" Japan eventually overcame their opening-night nerves, recovering from conceding the first try of the tournament to beat Russia comfortably. Next up were Ireland, who had run up 50 points against the Japanese at the same Shizuoka Stadium two years previously and were ranked number one in the world coming into the tournament. Although seen as a free hit for Japan, they were still expected to pick their strongest team for their toughest pool match and there was shock when Leitch was dropped to the bench. \"That was a very interesting week,\" Leitch said with a smile. \"It definitely wasn't a surprise. If the team was to win then the best team needed to play and the way I was playing that wasn't me. \"I had to take it on the chin and prepare the team like I usually do ... One thing I appreciate about Jamie too is that is he not going to beat around the bush and say it nicely. He will say it straight. That is what makes him such a good coach. \"But I had an opportunity to gain his trust again in that second test.\" Leitch did just that, coming on after 30 minutes with Japan trailing 12-3 and inspiring a comeback that left the Irish clinging on to a losing bonus point at the end. \"We knew, as a team, if we got everything right and played to our gameplan, everyone did their individual roles, then we would come away with what we wanted,\" said Leitch. That victory over Ireland would have gone down as the biggest upset at a World Cup had Japan not beaten South Africa at the 2015 tournament. Four years later the Springboks had their revenge, however, defeating the tired Japanese 26-3 in the last of the 2019 quarter-finals before going on to win the tournament. \"If we had played any other team we would have had a different outcome I think,\" said Leitch. \"I wouldn't have done anything differently. I think we prepared very well for that game but credit to South Africa, they brought their 'A' Game - the old scrum and maul. \"We were overwhelmed by the power of the South African scrum.\" - Reuters/nc</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12636342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YN7-9VR1-JCDN-11TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"829\"/><timeReceived>3:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

No country is fully prepared for epidemics or pandemics, and every country has important gaps to address.\" Just a couple of months later, a new coronavirus emerged in Wuhan, China - and quickly demonstrated the accuracy of the report's assessment. The virus, now called COVID-19, was first discovered in China's Wuhan municipality, but was not taken sufficiently seriously by the authorities in the early weeks. Multiple mistakes being made, including the failure to comprehend the virus's speed of transmission, compounded by the delay in informing the public about the outbreak. </p><p>In fact, some who first warned of the disease - most notably the ophthalmologist Li Wenliang - were reprimanded by local authorities. (Li subsequently died of the disease.) It was not until Jan 20 that the government acted, after another doctor, Zhong Nanshan - a hero in China's fight against the 2003 outbreak of another coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) - alerted the public of the seriousness of the new virus. Explore our interactive: All the COVID-19 cases in Singapore and the clusters and links between them Wuhan and neighbouring cities in Hubei province - with a total population of some 58.5 million people - are now in complete lockdown. Across China, as many as 700 million people are largely confined to their homes. AN UNPRECEDENTED RESPONSE China's government subsequently mobilised more than 200 medical teams from around the country, including from the military, to help contain the disease. It also built three new hospitals, and nine temporary hospitals, with unprecedented speed. And it gave provincial, municipal, and county-level governments strict instructions on improving public hygiene, isolating possible victims, and sharing experience and expertise. China's unprecedented response appeared to have slowed the spread of the disease domestically. But densely populated Wuhan is a transportation hub, home to central China's biggest airport, from which roughly 30,000 people, on average, depart daily. This means COVID-19 can and has spread around the world rapidly, testing the public health response capacity of countries far and wide. MORE COUNTRIES NOW FACE THE SAME TEST As of Feb 25, the World Health Organization reported over 80,000 cases in at least 33 countries, and 2,700 deaths (a 3.4 per cent mortality rate). Hubei province accounted for the most cases, and 95 per cent of fatalities so far. South Korea is now second to China for COVID-19 infections, with over 1,200 confirmed cases. The government has placed the country on the highest possible alert - a move that allows for lockdowns and other containment measures. The southeastern city of Daegu, where cases are concentrated, has essentially been under a state of emergency. Japan, with over 800 cases (if you count around 700 from a single cruise ship) is third on the list. READ: Commentary: Three scenarios if the COVID-19 outbreak gets worse READ: Commentary: Japan shows how not to deal with a COVID-19 outbreak The virus is also gaining ground in Europe, with 325 cases confirmed in Italy. The country has now quarantined more than 50,000 people. Even Iran is facing an uptick in infections. Hopes that a pandemic can be averted are dwindling fast. A SERIOUS ECONOMIC TOLL All of this is taking a serious economic toll, as global supply chains are disrupted and services halted. Moreover, Japan's economy - already under pressure from another consumption-tax hike and the fallout from Typhoon Hagibis - seems likely to contract even further. In South Korea, a key hub in global supply chains, Samsung Electronics has suspended smartphone plant operations in Gumi after an employee tested positive for COVID-19. After Apple warned that its quarterly revenues will take a hit, owing to slowed iPhone production and the closure of Apple stores in China, global investors are getting nervous. In the United States, the S&amp;P 500 dropped nearly 3 per cent at the start of trading on Feb 24. With the outbreak still escalating, the global damage will run deeper than supply-chain disruptions. The sudden reduction in production and services is driving a shift in consumption patterns and business operations in China toward e-commerce and tele-commuting - a trend that may be mirrored in other affected countries as the virus spreads. A HUGE BELIEF IN CHINA SHAKEN The economic effects of this shift - including changes in Chinese demand for travel, tourism services, and luxury goods - will reverberate globally for months to come. But the more profound effect of the COVID-19 lockdown is on Chinese social dynamics. READ: Commentary: In Hong Kong, the COVID-19 outbreak sent shockwaves but could reinvigorate protests READ: Commentary: Hit hard by COVID-19, Singapore Airlines may need to pursue deeper capacity cuts An unprecedented number of Chinese, up to half of the population, have been trapped indoors for more than a month, with time to reflect on the disease's consequences for life, family, and society. However difficult the lockdown has been, they have been able to count on their government to deliver power, water, and online services reliably. Of course, the government has also faced plenty of criticism on social media for its early attempts to suppress critical information. But it has since allowed more open debate and feedback, as in-depth reports by Caixin magazine have shown. The COVID-19 crisis has shaken the belief that economic prosperity can compensate for social well-being. Death in one-child households terminates the whole generational lineage, something unprecedented in Chinese family history. As a result, the Chinese may reorient themselves toward health, home, and family, after years of rising travel and offline consumption. The global media frenzy, some tinged with coronavirus-fuelled xenophobia, could reinforce China's self-reflection and self-strengthening impulses, particularly in sorting out domestic public health, social security, and governance issues. Already, COVID-19 has led to swift domestic damage control and a massive re-orientation of priorities, such as innovative ways of dealing with business cash flows, survival of SMEs, job disruptions, and restoring key supply chains. A FOCUS ON RESILIENCE NEEDED But even when the virus is contained, escalating geopolitical rivalries, technological disruption, climate change, and the likelihood of new pandemics loom. So, beyond tackling the current crisis, China's government should be working on long-term resilience-building reforms in education, health care, the social safety net, and internal feedback mechanisms. The public expects no less. The same is true worldwide. At a time of unprecedented global interconnectedness, our biggest challenges are shared. Every country must work to build its resilience, or no one will be safe.

This was done through his brand of economics, known as Abenomics, aimed at addressing Japan's low inflation problem, decreasing worker productivity and the challenges raised by an ageing population. Abe has also been credited for restoring relations with China after a bilateral maritime dispute soured relations from 2012 to 2013. That is why there was a wave of concern in the international media recently when PM Abe was admitted to the Keio Hospital for check-ups on Aug 24 and Aug 17, drawing attention to his health. Due to the open transparency requirements of political office holders in Japan, his previously disclosed ailment of chronic colitis is not a new issue. It was the main cause of his resignation during his first term in office from 2006 to 2007. The ailment was managed well in his second term with the use of a new drug. Nevertheless, the visits were sufficient to trigger media speculation over leadership succession within the party. </p><p>CONCERNING TIME FOR LEADERSHIP SUCCESSION If any potential leadership change takes place hypothetically, there are two narratives about its timing. For one, critics of the administration consider these medical check-ups to be an honourable way for the Prime Minister to leave office based on legitimate health reasons. This year alone, Abe has come under criticism from the opposition parties for his plan to raise the retirement age of prosecutors. Critics charged that his government has reacted too slowly to COVID-19. A poll by Nikkei TV in May showed that 55 per cent of the respondents did not agree with Abe's handling of the crisis though the NHK poll released on Aug 12 showed that 58 per cent of those who support the Cabinet said it is better than other ministerial line-ups. READ: Commentary: How many times must Japan be urged to step up COVID-19 testing? However, many Abe allies and their Japanese supporters do not see the need to change leadership in the middle of an economic crisis and a pandemic. They have argued political continuity will be key in this battle. As of Aug 27, Japan has recorded 63,822 confirmed COVID-19 cases with 1,209 deaths. At 45th highest number of cases overall in the world, these are relatively low numbers in advanced economies. It has suffered its worst economic growth in the post-war period, as its second quarter GDP dropped at an annualised rate of 27.8 per cent though its 7.8 per cent drop from the previous quarter makes it the best performing economy among G7 economies. Despite criticisms, there is also a tacit acknowledgement that Abe is probably Japan's best bet to engineer a credible response to the COVID-19 pandemic. He has after all provided a strong economic policy response to the post-bubble economy since coming into office. READ: Commentary: Japan sure is smug about beating COVID-19 There is also concern and recognition that many of his potential successors may not have the necessary factional support of leading the country out of economic difficulties yet. THE CONTENDERS FOR THE POST Contenders being highlighted by the media include younger members of Abe's cabinet: Toshimitsu Motegi, who is a trusted Abe confidante, negotiator for the US-Japan free trade agreement and now the country's Foreign Minister; Health Minister Katsunobu Kato, Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, Defence Minister Taro Kono who is also a Washington insider, former Foreign Minister and the son of veteran China-hand and former Speaker of the House Yohei Kono. In terms of dark horse candidates, another name floated in the media is that of former economy, trade and industry minister Yuko Obuchi - the daughter of former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi who was replaced in 2000 due to a stroke while Yuko stepped down due to a scandal. She stands out as the only female candidate in this race mentioned in the media though current Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's name was momentarily also mentioned. READ: Commentary: Yuriko Koike, the woman who may be Japan's first female prime minister Besides these younger politicians, two veterans have also been touted as potential candidates: Yoshihide Suga, a trusted Abe ally and Chief Cabinet Secretary, and former LDP Secretary General Shigeru Ishiba who was formerly also Abe's main rival and contender for prime ministership. Since 2019, Japan's media has scrutinised these candidates. At various points, different candidates have enjoyed more attention since speculation that Abe may call for a snap election to renew his mandate was afoot, even though his current term lasts until September 2021. JAPAN'S BEST BETS FOR SUCCESSION That speculation continued this week as news of Abe's illness broke. This time, it was Foreign Minister Motegi's turn to enjoy the media spotlight. Presently, Motegi is also the favourite to succeed Abe. Motegi's success in building factional support, especially from the powerful Taro Aso - the current Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Finance Minister - faction could prove useful in the current pandemic and economic scenarios. This is an essential step for any would-be PM aspirant as the consensus seeking nature of the Japanese political system requires its leader to be a skilful aggregator of the different interests of all stakeholders, rather than behave like an authoritarian leader. His dine-in meeting with Aso on Jul 31 was highly publicised and has positioned him as a strong and driven leader who can mobilise factional support to manage the multiple crises facing Japan. Motegi's biggest obstacle is perceived to be the faction of Wataru Takeshita, the former Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) General Council Chairperson, which previously split along the lines of support for Abe in the 2018 LDP Presidential election. In the last two years, Fumio Kishida, former Foreign Minister and now chairman of the LDP's Policy Research Council, enjoyed media attention as a candidate for political succession. But, due to the pandemic, Kishida's clout has weakened in 2020 as his COVID-19 relief plan was dropped in favour of an alternative plan advocated by LDP's coalition partner, the Komeito Party. READ: Commentary: The road to a COVID-19 vaccine is long and narrowing He also carries the image of a dovish peacetime leader rather than a strong crisis leader who has to handle severe ongoing China-US tensions, challenging bilateral relations with South Korea, as well as managing the devastating economic impact of COVID-19. In fact, before the emergence of Motegi as frontrunner, veteran Suga was floated as an alternative candidate since he enjoys factional support inside the party and has a positive working relationship with LDP Secretary-General Toshihiro Nikai. Another who has impressed in recent times is Koike. In addition to providing gender diversity, the Tokyo Governor has been heralded by the media for her skilful management of the COVID-19 mitigation measures in Tokyo. Her success in doing so may convince Japan's lawmakers that she could replicate that formula on the national level too. As for future leaders-in-waiting, 2019 witnessed the emergence of a young and rising political star - Koizumi. He is the second son of charismatic former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi and the third youngest individual to assume a cabinet-level post in Japanese political history. Koizumi's ministerial portfolio is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it has given him much-needed crisis management experience. As Environment Minister, he has to manage the fallout from the damaged Fukushima nuclear reactor, given domestic and international concerns over its leakage. Barely a month into his ministerial post in 2019, Koizumi was already put to the test in the public eye when Japan was hit by a series of typhoons, including Typhoon Hagibis, the deadliest typhoon to have directly hit Tokyo in half a century. Many consider Koizumi to be a Washington insider as he is well-acquainted with Washington DC's corridors of power as well as top Japan specialists and academics in the US. Koizumi graduated with a Masters in Political Science from Columbia University and interacted with top US-based Japan specialists while he also worked in the well-known US think-tank Center for Strategic and International Studies. His political pedigree as the fourth generation in his family to be in politics, US education and familiarity with Washington hands are advantageous to his future political ambitions, putting him in good stead for managing international relations in a future leadership role. His charismatic popularity with the Japanese public is another plus point. If he becomes prime minister, he can help win back support for the government, which according to opinion polls stands at 49 per cent. JAPAN'S POLITICAL FUTURE APPEARS BRIGHT While having a competent and experienced prime minister could be crucial, Japan's population can take heart knowing that, regardless, the leader of their country will have access to a highly-competent bureaucracy that not only enjoys wide public support and legitimacy but also provides sound and experienced policy advice. While it is yet unclear if Abe will or need to step down, at least the attention on his health issues has opened up a conversation on what Japan's political future after Abe may look like. Even if there is no change in the prime minister appointment, it seems a whole new generation of younger leaders have emerged to take over the baton in any post-Abe scenario. The state of Japanese leadership succession is energetically competitive with no lack of credible candidates. That may be a bright spot in an otherwise challenging period for the nation.

Average temperatures for the last five years were the highest on record for most of the planet. Land-based global temperature from January to October 2019 was approximately 1.1 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial period, according to the World Meteorological Office. In Singapore, 2019 was our joint hottest year on record, on par with 2016 temperatures. The island state is heating up at about 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade - twice as fast as the rest of the world, according to the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS). READ: Commentary: That low-carbon future for Singapore isn't so far-fetched Worse, our planet's oceans, which act as a buffer by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide, continue to heat up far more quickly than previously thought. </p><p>Recent research has estimated the oceans are heating up 40 per cent faster on average than estimated five years ago. At our coast, the rate of sea level rise continues to accelerate primarily due to the melting of ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, driven by rising greenhouse gas concentrations. Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere hit a record 411.85 parts per million (ppm) in December 2019. Carbon dioxide we emit into the atmosphere stays there for centuries, and carbon dioxide taken into the ocean stays for even longer, thus locking us into further climate change and global warming. HOTTER DAYS Our planet continues to heat up on average. Singapore's hottest day in 2019 was Apr 17, with 36.4 degrees C measured in Paya Lebar, according to the MSS. Our hottest days are likely to get even hotter. Hotter days are not only unpleasant for humans and many animals, but they will likely place greater strain on human health and our health system in Singapore. An increase in the number of days over 36 degrees will place tremendous stress on our vulnerable elderly and those that work outdoors. Singapore and much of Southeast Asia already experience relatively hot temperatures and high humidity year-round. High humidity means perspiration doesn't evaporate as quickly placing stress on your body as it is harder to stay cool. If the temperature continues to rise and humidity remains high then there will likely be an increase in the number of people who experience heat exhaustion and heat stroke. READ: Climate change, floods and drought: Here's how badly Singapore could be affected READ: Commentary: Jakarta, the fastest sinking city in the world faces the biggest flooding challenge This problem is not unique to Singapore. Many other regions across Asia are likely to feel the pressures of extreme heat and its effects on ageing populations and the economically disadvantaged. ABNORMAL WEATHER EVENTS While the average climate change indicators continue rising, the day-to-day impact of climate change on our lives are felt through extreme or \"abnormal\" weather events. One of the main impact of climate change is erratic rainfall patterns. Such variability in rainfall threatens agriculture and crop yields, which combined with population increase, pose considerable food security challenges to vulnerable countries in the region. In mid-2019, Thailand saw a significant drop in rice production as reservoirs dried up. Australia, a net exporter of wheat, faced the unique case of needing to seek imports to supply its domestic demand. Other events in 2019 also demonstrated the importance of understanding extreme events such as floods and droughts, as much of Asia received abnormally high or low rainfall. In India, the onset and withdrawal of the Indian Monsoon was delayed, causing a dry spell and water stress in June. The dry spell was followed by extreme rainfall that generated a series of floods in late July and early August 2019. The floods killed at least 200 people and displaced more than a million. People were going from having no water in a drought to too much water in floods in the space of a few weeks. Exceptionally dry conditions prevailed in Asia Pacific over 2019, especially Indonesia and the Mekong basin in the second half, which led to the most significant fire season since 2015, with haze spreading across the region, including Singapore. READ: Commentary: Air pollution's nasty effects should motivate stronger action but hasn't Commentary: Typhoon Mangkhut destroys rice, corn and fish - but what has this got to do with Singapore? Drought conditions in Australia also highlighted this peril to the world. Much of inland eastern Australia had been experiencing drought through 2017 and 2018, and in 2019, the drought expanded and intensified. Australia just experienced its worst fire season in recent memory, but as some fires ended, the rains came. Much of fire-ravaged eastern Australia is now experiencing dramatic flood events. There should be no doubt the Australian fires are linked to climate change. A warmer, dryer atmosphere coupled with prolonged drought were a catastrophe waiting to happen. The Australian government was warned repeatedly and accurately. The Garnaut Climate Change Review of 2008 said projections of fire weather \"suggest that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later, and generally be more intense\", further stating that \"this effect increases over time, but should be directly observable by 2020.\" Other climate extremes that made the news several times in 2019 were tropical cyclones or typhoons, with Typhoon Hagibis barely missing Tokyo in October, but still causing severe flooding and significant economic losses. Toward year-end, the people of the central Philippines experienced yet another damaging typhoon, as Typhoon Phanfone battered the Philippines on Christmas Day, bringing a wet, miserable and terrifying holiday to millions. With continued warming of our oceans, the future of cyclones and storms remains a topic of considerable debate. Here too, there is much more to do to answer questions about the future of cyclones in our region. READ: Commentary: I care about climate change. I don't wish to live in a Waterworld like Kevin Costner THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE RESEARCH Climate researchers are always examining the likelihood of changes in how often extreme weather and climate events will occur and whether or not they will become larger and more damaging. Unfortunately, our understanding of the dynamic processes in the tropics remains rather poor. We have very little data on the comparative frequency and intensity of past events. However, the extreme climate events of 2019 have generated a groundswell of activity calling for a new wave of climate impact research. In July 2019, for instance, Malaysia's Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources commissioned a national audit on the water industry in anticipation of the longer droughts expected due to climate change. Such research would inform and facilitate efforts by industries and governments to improve the way they interpret and manage risks around extreme climate events. What we do know is that extreme events are commonly the result of a combination of driving factors. Multiple hazardous events cascade when they act as a series. For example, droughts can lead to increased risk of wildfires, which then heighten the risk of landslides. This rising risk posed by extreme events is very real in the tropics and Asia's emerging cities. We urgently need to dig deeper for detailed investigations of likely changes in storm systems, dry periods, extreme rainfall or heat in the context of a rapidly changing climate. READ: Commentary: As ice caps melt, Singapore a hot spot for sea-level rise READ: Commentary: How effectively can Singapore adapt to sea level rise? CORE ISSUES FOR SINGAPORE'S FUTURE Climate change and climatic extremes are a core issue for Singapore's future. Not only do hotter days strain public health, but prolonged droughts or dry spells will almost certainly stress our water supply. This will force Singapore to consider further investment in relatively expensive water recycling and desalinisation engineering. Moreover, flooding events are all likely to affect the everyday lives of many Singaporeans by disrupting transport and business. READ: Commentary: As time runs out on the climate crisis, Singapore prepares to address the cost of adapting Against the backdrop of rising sea levels, Singapore faces an increased risk of compound flooding as flood waters reach our coast. In his Budget 2020 speech, Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced a new Coastal and Flood Protection fund with an initial injection of S$5 billion. Being that climate change adaptation might cost S$100 billion or more over 100 years, Singapore is beginning to set aside resources for it. As we keep an eye on climate change, it's crucial that we understand how it can manifest as extreme weather, with adverse impact on Singapore and the region.

At least 30 people were killed in the typhoon that left vast sections of towns under water, public broadcaster NHK said. Another 15 were missing and 177 injured by Typhoon Hagibis, which paralysed Tokyo on Saturday and dumped record levels of rain around Japan. About 100,000 homes were left without power. Rescue efforts were hindered after more than 20 rivers in central and northeastern Japan burst their banks and dozens more overflowed although their banks were still in tact, NHK said, adding that flooding rivers could cause more damage. Evacuation centres filled with residents, while some people perished as they sought shelter, NHK said, adding a 77-year-old woman fell about 40 metres to her death during an airlift. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsia/posts/10156763861527934\">https://www.facebook.com/ChannelNewsAsia/posts/10156763861527934</url> Some of the worst damage hit Nagano city, central Japan, where the Chikuma River burst its banks, inundating large swaths of land in brown water and forcing military helicopters to airlift stranded people from homes. At one evacuation centre there, Kiyokazu Shimokawa, 71, said he waited all night with his wife and mother until they were finally rescued around 3pm (2pm Singapore time) on Sunday. \"I made the mistake of figuring that as long as we were on the second floor of the house, we'd be fine,\" he told Reuters. \"When we realised that maybe we should evacuate, it was too late - the water rose very quickly.\" Rie Hasegawa, a woman in her 30s, said she never imagined her landlocked town would face a water-related disaster, recounting how shocked she was at how fast it all happened. \"The force of the water was incredible. It was dark, frightening, and I thought this might be the end,\" she said.       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR5F48n-RsU\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR5F48n-RsU</url> 27,000 RESCUERS DEPLOYED Hagibis, which means \"speed\" in the Philippine language Tagalog, made landfall on Japan's main island of Honshu on Saturday evening and headed out to sea early on Sunday, leaving behind cloudless skies and high temperatures across the country. The storm sank a Panama-registered cargo ship that had anchored near Tokyo. The sunken ship was located early on Sunday. A newspaper reported that at least five of the 12 crew were dead and three were missing. READ: Typhoon Hagibis - Tokyo, central Japan left devastated       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/MichiyoCNA/status/1183170610068721665\">https://twitter.com/MichiyoCNA/status/1183170610068721665</url> Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened an emergency meeting of relevant ministers and sent the minister in charge of disaster management to affected areas. \"The government will do everything in its power to cooperate with relevant agencies and operators working to restore services as soon as possible,\" he said. The government set up a task force to deal with the damage. \"I extend my condolences for all those who lost their lives and offer my sympathy to all those impacted by Typhoon No.19 (Hagibis),\" Abe said. \"With respect to blackouts, water outage and suspension of transportation services, we intend to exert all-out efforts for the earliest recovery ... we ask the public to remain vigilant of landslides and other hazards,\" he said. Some 27,000 members of Japan's self-defence forces as well as firefighters, police and coast guard members were sent to rescue stranded people in central Japan's Nagano prefecture and elsewhere, the government said. Some came in helicopters who winched people from the roofs and balconies of flooded homes. FLOODS, LANDSLIDES NHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels. With thousands of homes without power, Japanese feared a repeat of the weeks-long power outages after last month's typhoon that hit east of Tokyo. In Fukushima, north of the capital, Tokyo Electric Power reported irregular readings from sensors monitoring water in its Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant overnight. The plant was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Tepco spokeswoman Emi Iwasa said the typhoon triggered 11 leak alerts at the plant. Of those, eight were confirmed as being triggered by rainwater and the rest were still being investigated. Iwasa said the operator had so far not confirmed if any radioactive water leaked into sea. Landing restrictions at Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports were lifted but more than 800 flights were cancelled for the day, NHK said, as were some Shinkansen bullet train services to the worst-hit areas.

The storm claimed its first victim even before making landfall, when high winds flipped a vehicle, killing its driver. The first floor of a large aged care home in Nagano city was shown under water. Rescuers took residents from another flooded aged care facility by inflatable boats and carried them on their backs to safety. They also searched for survivors in homes destroyed in landslides near Tokyo's suburbs and in Fukushima prefecture, NHK showed. \"GREAT IMPACT\" Bodies were retrieved from homes and vehicles submerged by floodwaters, from raging overflowing rivers, and from buildings buried in landslides. NHK said overflowing rivers could inflict more damage as waters had reached dangerously high levels. \"We continue to see a great impact on people's life,\" Mr Abe said. \"The government will do its utmost,\" he added, pledging to deploy more troops and emergency officials if needed. Authorities at one point issued evacuation advisories and orders for more than 6 million people across Japan as the storm unleashed the heaviest rain and winds in years. Close to 150 injuries have been reported so far, NHK said. The storm, which the government said could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958, brought record-breaking rainfall in many areas, including the popular resort town of Hakone, which was hit with 939.5 mm of rain over 24 hours. \"The water came up higher than my head in the house,\" Hajime Tokuda, a finance professional living in Kawasaki near Tokyo told AFP. He moved to his family's home nearby, but that flooded too and they had to be rescued by boat. In Saitama's Higashi Matsuyama city, northwest of Tokyo, rice and flower farmers were counting their losses, with water submerging warehouses full of freshly harvested product. \"We never had a flood like this before in this neighbourhood,\" said one farmer, who declined to give his name. \"We cannot even go into the flower warehouse due to the water. I don't know where to start cleaning this mess.\" The Japan Meteorological Agency had issued the highest alert level for 12 prefectures, warning of the potential for once-in-decades rain totals, but lifted them early on Sunday. Just last month, another strong storm, Typhoon Faxai, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses in Chiba, east of Tokyo, and caused extensive power outages. The Rugby World Cup match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi on Sunday was cancelled. The crucial Japan-Scotland match went ahead, with the home team beating Scotland 28-21, sending them to their first quarter-finals in history.

The Namibia-Canada match, which had no bearing on the rest of the tournament with both sides out of contention for the quarter-finals, will be recorded as a draw. It is only the third World Cup match to have been cancelled. Two of Saturday's matches, the Pool C decider between England and France and the Pool B match between world champions New Zealand and Italy, were scratched on Thursday when it became clear the typhoon would make landfall in central Honshu. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11995612</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X85-NM31-DYWP-R0NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"240\"/><timeReceived>9:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Canada, without a win at the tournament, had been due to play Namibia in Kamaishi but tournament organisers decided on Saturday that the match would be cancelled because of the expected impact of the typhoon. The storm hit Kamaishi, on Japan's north-east coast, early on Sunday. </p><p>Typhoon Hagibis has killed at least 23 people, leaving vast swaths of low-lying land in central and eastern Japan inundated and cutting power to almost half a million homes.

We've been hosted so well. We want to give back all we can,\" he added. World Cup organisers chose to hold two matches in the remote town of Kamaishi in a bid to aid the region's recovery after it was devastated by the 2011 earthquake and tsunami.

Canadian coach Kingsley Jones said losing out on playing against Namibia was a blow for his team as it was their best chance to win a match at the World Cup. \"Right now it is a bit of an empty feeling,\" said the Welshman. \"I felt today against the opposition that are a good team, that performed well in the World Cup, about the same level as us, we could see where we stand and I believe we would have won today. \"I think that would have given us a sense of an outcome. This feels like there's no outcome at the moment.\" Canada have appeared at every Rugby World Cup with their best showing being a quarter-final berth in 1991. - Reuters/jt</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11996284</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-9531-DYWP-R1WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"399\"/><timeReceived>10:28 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Nine people are missing and 346 are injured. Fukushima has seen the highest number of casualties from the typhoon, with at least 28 dead as of Thursday.

Fukushima is no stranger to disaster. In 2011, the area was struck by an earthquake that unleashed a tsunami on the coast and destroyed the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant. But as Japan's population ages, the resilience of residents to deal with hardship in the disaster-prone country appears to be eroding. </p><p>\"Elderly people have told me that they are ready to give up,\" said Kenichi Bamba, the head of Bridge for Fukushima, a volunteer group that had come to help with the clean-up. \"As Japan grows older, social networks that support communities will begin to break down. Something needs to be put in its place,\" he said. READ: Japan allocates millions in aid for typhoon-hit regions READ: Japanese rescuers continue search for typhoon survivors as toll reaches 74 Hiromi Nagasawa, a social welfare official in Date city in Fukushima prefecture, near where the Abukuma river burst its banks, said nearly all of the 170 people left in evacuation centres were old. The death toll from Typhoon Hagibis rose to 74 on Wednesday, public broadcaster NHK said, many of the victims having drowned after scores of rivers were inundated. Fukushima prefecture has seen the highest number of casualties, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged 710 million yen (US$6.5 million) to help fund recovery efforts. 'DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING TO COPE' Bamba's group and city officials are recruiting volunteers to help the elderly clear mud and debris from their homes. Ten high school students working with Bamba's group helped 78-year-old Iseno Taniguchi and her daughter, Yumi Okazaki, tidy up three days after her house in Date city was nearly submerged, with floodwaters reaching as high as the second floor. Wearing masks to guard against dust blowing up from drying mud, the volunteers carried out bags of sodden rubbish to growing piles of debris along the town's narrow streets.

Everything I have has been destroyed.\" Taniguchi doesn't think her house can be salvaged, and said she will likely knock it down, and may even move out of the area. As many as 300 households in the neighbourhood would need help from volunteers over coming weeks, says Bamba. \"It will take 10 people about three days to clean each house,\" he said. But with Typhoon Hagibis aftermath stretching responders in other parts of Japan, including Tokyo, volunteers able to help in Fukushima may be in short supply, he said. - Reuters/nh</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12006090</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8X-6VP1-JCDN-14F6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><timeReceived>10:28 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The parade was scheduled for Oct 22 as part of a series of events marking the official proclamation of Emperor Naruhito's enthronement. The religious rites and imperial banquet associated with the event are still expected to go ahead, national broadcaster NHK said. </p><p>READ: Hundreds of dignitaries to attend as Japan's new emperor declares enthronement \"The government has begun coordinating in the direction of postponing a celebration parade that had been planned for Oct 22 ... so as to make sure they do everything they can to deal with the issues of typhoon-hit areas,\" NHK said. Contacted by AFP, the imperial household agency and the government committee organising the event declined to comment on the reports. Naruhito officially succeeded his father Akihito in May but a series of ceremonies and rites celebrating his enthronement are scheduled this month and later this year, including the parade and the official enthronement ceremony originally planned for next Tuesday. Japan is still carrying out search and recovery operations after powerful Typhoon Hagibis slammed into the country on Saturday.

Tournament organisers on Tuesday (Oct 15) said Scottish Rugby would be referred to a disputes committee after chief executive Mark Dodson threatened legal action to enforce a postponement rather than a cancellation of the match, which was due to take place after Typhoon Hagibis hit Tokyo. READ: Scotland on the offensive over Typhoon cancellations Dodson also said organisers would have taken action to ensure the match, which was vital to Scottish hopes of staying in the tournament, went ahead at some stage if it had involved world champions New Zealand. \"Following receipt of correspondence yesterday from World Rugby, Scottish Rugby confirms that it has received a notice of complaint from Rugby World Cup Ltd,\" a Scottish Rugby official said in a news release on Wednesday. </p><p>\"Scottish Rugby is querying whether the matter is an appropriate one for the bringing of misconduct charges. \"If misconduct proceedings are to proceed, Scottish Rugby looks forward to receiving a fair hearing in this matter. No further comment would be appropriate at this time.\" READ: Rugby: Brilliant Japan beat Scotland to reach World Cup quarters for first time In the event, the match went ahead in Yokohama a few hours after the typhoon ripped through the region. The host nation won 28-21 to qualify for the quarter-finals and send the Scots home. The death toll from Hagibis, one of the worst typhoons to hit the country, on Wednesday rose to 74, many drowned by flooding after scores of rivers burst their banks. \"Scottish Rugby once again expresses its sincere condolences to the people of Japan and all those affected by Typhoon Hagibis which struck last weekend,\" the official added. \"We have been able to convey our best wishes directly to the Mayor of Yokohama and the Chairman of the Japanese Rugby Union. We stand with the great people of Japan.\" - Reuters/ga</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12004996</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8V-JRG1-DYWP-R3W9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"343\"/><timeReceived>5:35 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The weather was so bad that it delayed the squad's arrival at Yokohama Stadium - 30 miles from their hotel base in Tokyo's Disneyland - then provided testing conditions for their last session of preparation. Scrum coach Neil Hatley said they might review their travel plans for Saturday, when the forecast is for dry conditions, but that everything went smoothly on the sodden pitch. </p><p>\"We did everything - lineout, restarts, set piece, we've got everything done,\" he said. \"A lot of us are used to playing in those conditions. \"We've prepared for all conditions. When we had warm-weather training in Treviso and Miyazaki, we used wet balls to make sure that we were prepared for the conditions here.\" The Yokohama pitch came through Typhoon Hagibis in remarkably good condition when Japan played Scotland in their final pool game. Fullback Elliot Daly said after several dry weeks, it was \"quite fun to have a bit of a splash around.\" \"It was pretty wet but not windy though, so not too bad,\" he said. \"We've not trained in that sort of rain for a while but I think the weather is supposed to be okay for tomorrow, so it was tricky today, but fine.\" Daly has yet to attempt one of his famed long-range penalties in the tournament but said he had been working on his technique just in case. \"I've practised them all the time though I haven't got one for a while,\" he said. \"But I'm always willing to take one if everything's right.\" He said there was a really positive feeling through the squad as they approach crunch time after around three months together in various training camps. \"We're just having fun on the pitch and hopefully that showed up in games,\" Daly said. \"The good thing about last weekend is that we built really nicely towards the game and individually we got ourselves ready. So if that's taking yourself away or that's doing something else, I think everyone in the team at the moment knows what they need to do to get to that level because we don't let anybody down so we want to be ready, come what may at game time.\" Saturday's game kicks off at 1700 local time (0800GMT).

Staff at the evacuation centre at a school in Tokyo's Taito ward refused to let the two in on Saturday because they did not have addresses in the area, a ward official said. Staff told them the shelter was only for ward residents, he said. </p><p>\"The wind was strong and it was raining, and I wanted them to let me in,\" a 64-year-old man homeless man told the Asahi newspaper. READ: Japan rescuers still scrambling as typhoon toll nears 70 READ: Japan sends in thousands of troops after Typhoon Hagibis hammers Tokyo He said he had arrived at the evacuation centre in the morning and was asked to write down his name and address. When he said he had an address in the northern island of Hokkaido, he was refused entry because he was not a resident of the ward. The man spent the night under a plastic umbrella, partially shielded beneath the eaves of a building, the newspaper said. Another homeless man was also turned away when he visited the centre in the afternoon, the newspaper said. No deaths were reported in Tokyo but Typhoon Hagibis, which made landfall on Saturday evening, killed at least 66 people elsewhere, with the death toll expected to rise as rescuers searched for the missing. Social media lit up with criticism of the ward, with many people denouncing its actions as a violation of human rights. \"Is this a country that's going to host the Olympics in Tokyo?\" one man with the handle @G_takatoshi asked on Twitter. \"People from abroad would see this and think this is a terrible country.\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, asked by an opposition member of parliament about the incident, said evacuation centres should welcome everyone. \"Evacuation centres should let anyone in who has come to evacuate,\" he told parliament. \"We will look into the facts and take appropriate measures.\" Taito ward said it would review its procedures to help people without addresses. \"We deeply apologise that we dealt with people without addresses insufficiently so that they could not stay at the shelter,\" the mayor of the ward, Yukuo Hattori, said in a statement on its website. \"We will cooperate with related parties and consider measures to support all the people at the time of a disaster.\" - Reuters/ad/ec</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12000956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-KKW1-DYWP-R35D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"406\"/><timeReceived>3:17 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The Asian nation's staging of the event, which kicked off on Sept. 20, has been a huge success. </p><p>Here are five of the more memorable moments. The 'V' Some teams are already psychologically beaten by the time the All Blacks reach the end of their haka. Not England, not this time. At the start of their semi-final the English players embraced the traditional Maori ceremonial challenge with a v-shape formation of their own before kickoff. All Blacks coach Steve Hansen described England's response as both brilliant and imaginative, but World Rugby were less impressed, fining the English 2,000 pounds (US$2,589.40) as some players had crossed the halfway line in breach of protocol. Incredible JapanJapan's group-stage victory over the Irish was another incredible win in the mould of their 2015 'Miracle of Brighton' felling of South Africa. But beating Scotland to reach the quarter-finals was next level. On an emotional night at Yokohama Stadium, the Brave Blossoms scored four tries to beat a team they had lost against in all seven of their previous meetings, reaching the knock-out stages for the first time. The victory was one for the ages, and lifted a nation still reeling from the deadly impact of Typhoon Hagibis. David and Goliath There have been few more stark mis-matches than the sight of the diminutive Faf de Klerk squaring up to man-mountain Jake Ball in South Africa's semi-final against Wales. A dire game sparked into life in the 45th minute when simmering tensions briefly boiled over leaving the 1.72m Springbok leaning up into his 1.97m opponent who grabbed De Klerk's collar. The pair were quickly separated, but the image spawned dozens of memes, some set to romantic music. Canadian gents Canada left Japan without a win on the rugby field, but they won over an entire nation by helping to clean up flood-ravaged parts of Kamaishi following Typhoon Hagibis. The Canadians' last game against Namibia was cancelled due to the typhoon with landslides and flooding affecting the area near the stadium. Instead the Canadian team visited places hit by the typhoon and helped sweep streets and clean out elderly residents' flood-damaged homes. Kabuki roar The comically blood curdling Kabuki roar... imitated by many, mastered by few, the loud, prolonged shout was a firm favourite with fans inside stadiums. The scream, heard at every restart, was accompanied by a cartoon head peeping up from the bottom of the scoreboard. The traditional Japanese taiko drumming at the beginning of each match also contributed to the very Japanese flavour of this tournament.

Typhoon Hagibis, which means \"speed\" in the Philippine language Tagalog, is due to make landfall on Japan's main island of Honshu on Saturday, a month after one of the strongest typhoons to hit the country in recent years destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses and caused extensive power outages. The storm could be the strongest to hit Tokyo since 1958 and people should also prepare for high waves and storm surges, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. \"The typhoon could bring record-level rainfall and winds,\" an official at the agency told a news conference, also citing the risk of floods and landslides. </p><p>READ: Super typhoon approaches Japan, weather agency warns of 'grave impact' Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered his cabinet ministers to do their utmost to ensure the safety of the public. Authorities began issuing evacuation advisories to areas particularly at risk, including the coastal city of Shimoda in Shizuoka, around 100 kilometres (60 miles) southwest of Tokyo, according to public broadcaster NHK. Tokyo Electric Power said it would have around 17,000 staff standing by to help cope with possible outages, NHK said. Officials in Chiba prefecture east of Tokyo, which was hit hard by typhoon Faxai a month ago, have told people to prepare supplies of food and water for up to three days. Some supermarkets ran out of bottled water and batteries. Twitter users posted photographs of bare shelves and traded tips on how to prepare for disruptions to water and power cuts. Many of more than 30,000 houses Typhoon Faxai destroyed or damaged in Chiba last month have yet to be repaired. FORMULA ONE, RUGBY WORLD CUP AFFECTED Japanese Formula One Grand Prix organisers cancelled all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday, adding that the qualifying round would be held on Sunday, before the final race takes place as planned. The approaching super typhoon has already forced the cancellation of two matches of the rugby World Cup on Saturday, while a Sunday match between host Japan and Scotland is in doubt. Airline ANA Holdings cancelled all domestic flights to and from Tokyo's two main airports from Friday afternoon. It and rival Japan Airlines Co cancelled some flights to and from airports servicing the major cities of Osaka and Nagoya. Most flights operating to and from those airports will be cancelled on Saturday, both airlines said on their websites. READ: SIA, Scoot flights to Japan affected ahead of Typhoon Hagibis Train operators said they would suspend bullet trains between Tokyo and Nagoya in central Japan and most operations between Nagoya and Osaka, in western Japan, from Saturday morning. Train and subway lines in Tokyo are also due to be shut down. Tokyo Disneyland said it would close its theme park on Saturday, its first weather-related closure since a snowstorm in 1984. Retail giant Seven &amp; i Holdings said it would shut its supermarkets and department stores in metropolitan Tokyo. Toyota Motor Corp announced it was suspending production at three factories. Storm surges are expected along the Pacific coast of Honshu on Saturday and Sunday, as is torrential rain, raising the risk of floods and landslides. Typhoon Ida, known as the \"Kanogawa Typhoon\" in Japanese, killed more than 1,000 people in 1958. - Reuters/ga/ec</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11991362</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-PV81-JCDN-10C1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><timeReceived>3:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Parts of Japan are still recovering from a devastating typhoon that struck a month ago, as the new storm, Typhoon Hagibis, headed north over the Pacific towards Japan's main island. It could make landfall on Saturday, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. </p><p>\"Regardless of whether this typhoon makes landfall or not, it will have a grave impact,\" an agency official told Reuters. People should prepare for torrential rain, fierce winds, high waves and storm surges, he said. Rugby World Cup organisers have cancelled Saturday's game between England and France as well as New Zealand's match against Italy due to the risk from the typhoon, while a Sunday game between hosts Japan and Scotland is in doubt. The sport's governing body, World Rugby, and tournament officials said the decision had been taken due to the expected disruption, particularly to transport. The Japanese airline ANA will cancel all domestic flights to and from Tokyo's Haneda airport and Narita airport in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, on Saturday, it said on its website. Japan Airlines has also cancelled more than 90% of domestic flights to and from those airports on Saturday, public broadcaster NHK reported. East Japan Railway Co, which serves eastern Japan including Tokyo, said it might have to suspend operations on conventional lines as well as the Shinkansen bullet train service over the weekend. Operations of the Shinkansen linking Tokyo and the western city of Osaka could also be cancelled over the weekend, Central Japan Railway Co said. Organisers of the Japanese Formula One Grand Prix said they were keeping a close eye on the typhoon and were working to minimise any disruption to this weekend's schedule. The Suzuka circuit, which is set to host Sunday's race, is about 300 km southwest of Tokyo. Typhoon Hagibis is expected to pass over or close to Chiba prefecture, which was hit hard by typhoon Faxai a month ago. Faxai, one of the strongest typhoons to hit Japan in recent years, destroyed or damaged 30,000 houses and caused long power cuts. An official at the prefectural government's disaster response headquarters urged people to get ready. \"In particular, we want them to store up at least three days' worth of food and water,\" said the official, Naoto Hayashi. In Tokyo, which is also in the likely path of the storm, 1.5 million people live below sea level in eastern parts of the city. Experts have warned that as many as 5 million people would have to be evacuated if massive dikes and levees in low-lying areas were to be overwhelmed by surging floodwaters. Japan's navy, or Maritime Self Defense Force as it is known, has cancelled two preview days of a fleet review and may have to abandon the main event on Monday as well. The review, last held four years ago, is due to include 46 naval vessels, including a helicopter carrier, destroyers and submarines, and 40 aircraft. - Reuters/ec</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11988558</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7M-CMW1-DYWP-R3NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"518\"/><timeReceived>9:32 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Imahira was in sublime form at Phoenix Country Club as he signed for a five-under-par 66 on Saturday and set a clubhouse target of 10-under after 54 holes, two shots clear of closest challenger Hwang Jung-gon of South Korea. </p><p>It proved to be enough as the organisers were unable to resume play in difficult weather conditions on Sunday. As a result, Imahira collected 30 million yen (US$276,000), or three-quarters of the winner's prize money, boosting his chances of finishing at the top of the money list for a second consecutive season. Imahira's only other victory of the season came at the Bridgestone Open, which was also cut short to 36-holes due to impact of Typhoon Hagibis in Chiba last month. Hideki Matsuyama, who won the Miyazaki event in 2014, finished at five-under in a group which also featured American power-hitter Cameron Champ. U.S. Open champion Gary Woodland struggled to cope with windy course conditions as he finished tied-20th, eight shots behind Imahira.

Wing Kenki Fukuoka led the way with two tries, while Kotaro Matsushima and Keita Inagaki also scored as the hosts held off a fierce second-half assault from a team they had lost against in all seven of their previous meetings. When Japan beat South Africa four years ago - having won only one of their previous 24 World Cup matches - it was considered the greatest shock in rugby history. This time, having already beaten Ireland three weeks ago, it did not even feel like a real surprise. They were faster, sharper, more inventive and, roared on by the vast majority of the delirious red-clad 72,00 crowd, absolutely relentless in everything they did as they became the first tier-two team to reach the last eight since Fiji in 2007. Having won all four of their matches to top Pool A, they will face the Springboks again in the quarter-finals and the twice-champions will be taking absolutely nothing for granted. </p><p>The result also meant that Ireland, through as runners-up, will play New Zealand. \"Tonight we went another level,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"They wanted it as much as the Scots and gave as much as they could. This is what it takes to win big test matches.\" The match was given the go-ahead only on Sunday morning after an inspection of the damage caused by Typhoon Hagibis and proved a wonderfully uplifting occasion for the country after the death and destruction wrought by the storm. \"Whilst we are celebrating tonight there are a lot of people who aren't,\" Joseph said. Captain Michael Leitch said that the victory owed more to heart than skill and while that might be true of their mighty defensive effort in the final quarter, no team in the tournament so far has come close to matching the pace and directness of Japan's first-half assault. READ: Japan-Scotland match goes ahead after Typhoon Hagibis EXPLOSION OF NOISE Scotland were first on the board with a Finn Russell try after seven minutes but Japan hit back with a brilliantly-worked, high-tempo score that set the tone for the night. Fukuoka tore down the left and as he was tackled to the floor, slung a one-armed pass into the arms of the supporting Matsushima to go over and detonate an explosion of noise. If that was good, their next score was a contender for try of the tournament. Fukuoka and Matsushima again put on the afterburners and then a mesmerizing series of off-loads and side-steps ended with Shota Horie presenting supporting prop Inagaki with an unmissable opportunity. Japan were playing with a speed and intensity that the Scots just could not live with and got a third try at the end of the half when Tim Lafaele slipped through a deft grubber that bounced perfectly into the arms of the Fukuoka. It was then bedlam two minutes into the second half when Fukuoka stripped Chris Harris and galloped clear for a fourth and bonus-point clinching try. The Scots, who came from 31-0 down to draw 38-38 with England in the Six Nations in March, dredged up that Twickenham spirit from somewhere as WP Nel and Zander Fagerson scored to get back within seven points with 25 minutes to go. It was relentless Scottish pressure and desperate, at times demented, Japanese defending from then on, but the hosts held out for another famous victory in what became a deafening cauldron of noise. It was only the second time Scotland have failed to reach the last eight - the other coming in 2011 - but they can have few complaints, bookending wins over Russia and Samoa with defeats by Ireland and the hosts. \"We had a mountain to climb after that first half but we started climbing it and I thought the effort the players put in to get back to within seven points was excellent,\" said Scotland coach Gregor Townsend. \"We were obviously aware that this was huge for the home nation. The atmosphere was absolutely fantastic and you didn't want to be the team that was losing in that atmosphere.\" - Reuters/jt/hm</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11996378</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X88-9531-DYWP-R1WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"692\"/><timeReceived>12:58 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Also note updated situation in Pool A should three teams finish level on points at the top. POOL A Tournament organisers will decide on Sunday whether the Japan v Scotland game scheduled for later on Sunday will go ahead in Yokohama, having inspected the damage from Typhoon Hagibis and checked the transport situation. If it is called off, each team will be awarded two points and the match will be recorded as a 0-0 draw, with no bonus points available. </p><p>That would guarantee Japan (currently on 14 points) top place and Ireland (11 points) would take second place with a win, or even a losing bonus point, in their game Samoa on Saturday. Scotland (currently 10 points) would be eliminated. Ireland (11 points) can guarantee progress with a bonus-point victory over Samoa (5). An Irish win without a bonus point could open the way for a three-way tie at the top on 15 points if Sunday's game goes ahead. In that scenario, the deadlock would be initially settled by total points difference, which currently stands at Scotland (+71), Ireland (+52) and Japan (+46). If Scotland still have the higher difference after the last two matches, they would top the group. For second place and the other ticket to the quarter-finals, the process reverts to head-to-head results and would send Japan through thanks to their win over Ireland. Should Ireland end with the best overall points difference, they would top the group and Scotland would go through in second place after what would be their win over Japan. If Scotland beat Japan with no bonus points for either side, they would pip the hosts on the head-to-head result and progress. Depending on the Ireland result, Scotland could also advance with a bonus point win - assuming Japan do not collect two bonus points in defeat. If Japan gain a losing bonus point and Scotland fail to claim a bonus point, Japan would finish above the Scots and advance to the knockout stage in first or second place. Victory or a draw for Japan would seal top spot, but they would also go through as pool winners if they lose to Scotland by seven points or less but score four tries, delivering a rare two bonus points. Four years ago Japan won three games but finished third in their pool because of bonus points, pipped to qualification by Scotland and South Africa - the only time a team has won three pool matches and not progressed. Likely outcome: Ireland to qualify with bonus-point victory over Samoa. Too close to call on who joins them. POOL B After the cancellation of New Zealand's game against Italy, the top three places are settled. New Zealand (16) top the group, with South Africa (15) runners-up. Italy (12) finish third. New Zealand will play the Pool A runners-up, with South Africa playing the Group A winners. POOL C Things are also settled here after England v France was cancelled. England (17) and France (15) are through to the last eight. Group winners England will play the runners-up from Pool D, probably Australia, with France likely to play Wales. POOL D Australia (16) and Wales (14) are guaranteed a place in the last eight but the pool's final match - Wales v Uruguay (4) on Sunday - could also still fall foul of the weather. If it is cancelled, Wales would collect two points to finish level with Australia but would get top spot due to beating them earlier in the tournament. If the game goes ahead, any sort of win for Wales would also put them top, although they would still top the group in the unlikely scenario of them picking up two losing bonus points. Fiji (7) finished third to secure automatic qualification for the 2023 World Cup. Likely outcome: Wales to win last game against Uruguay, top the group and play France in last eight. Australia would then play England.

Three World Cup pool matches were cancelled and Scotland's decisive game with the host nation was in doubt for several days due to the impact of the typhoon, which led to the deaths of more than 80 people and caused massive flooding. SRU chief executive Mark Dodson had threatened legal action if the match did not go ahead, saying that the decision \"was not just\". He also suggested that New Zealand might have been treated differently in the same situation and said that Scotland were \"winners in the court of public opinion\" on the matter. </p><p>A World Rugby independent disputes committee ruled on Thursday that the comments constituted misconduct, fined the SRU, formally reprimanded the union and said it should issue a \"meaningful apology\" to World Rugby. \"World Rugby strongly believed the comments, which suggested an unfair and disorganised treatment of all teams, to be inappropriate and ill-judged at a time when Japan was preparing for the largest and most destructive typhoon in decades,\" the game's governing body said in a statement. \"The international federation believed that such comments brought the game into disrepute, not only in relation to World Rugby's handling of an extraordinary situation, but also in the message that it sent to the Japanese people.\" World Rugby said that it had tried to settle the issue but that SRU refused to issue an apology and instead wanted to agree to a \"mutual expression of regret.\" The match did go ahead, with Japan claiming a famous 28-21 victory that sent them into the quarter-finals and eliminated the Scots. The fine will be donated to the Childfund Pass it Back charity, assisting with the relief effort in the area hit by the typhoon. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12073326</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFK-RC81-DYWP-R3X3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"323\"/><timeReceived>12:50 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Both games were in the projected path of the large and powerful typhoon, which currently has a \"violent\" rating - the highest category by Japan's weather bureau - and is due to hit the Tokyo area on Saturday. Sunday's four games, including the key Pool A shoot-out between hosts Japan and Scotland in Yokohama, near Tokyo, remain under review, said tournament director Alan Gilpin. \"We've taken the very difficult decision to cancel certain matches in the affected areas,\" Gilpin said. </p><p>\"While it's regrettable, we've made, we believe, the right decision with everyone's safety as the priority,\" he added. READ: England boss thanks 'typhoon gods' after World Cup game axed Tens of thousands of fans, many of them visitors from abroad, will be affected by the cancellations - the first in the tournament's 32-year history. Their tickets will be fully refunded, Gilpin said. Japan, whose capital Tokyo hosts the Olympics next year, is battered by around 20 typhoons per year and is one of the world's most seismically active countries. But Gilpin stressed he had \"no regrets at all\" about bringing the World Cup to Japan, the first Asian country to host the tournament. \"I think what you've all seen over the last three weeks absolutely in every respect vindicates the right decisions to be hosting a World Cup here in Japan,\" he said. \"We always knew there were going to be risks. It's rare for a typhoon of this magnitude to cause this impact this late in the typhoon season.\" He added that World Rugby had looked \"pretty exhaustively\" at other options for the games, including switching venues, but \"we couldn't guarantee consistent contingency plans across all those games safely for all the teams and fans involved\". Seven games were slated for the final weekend of the pool stage, when matches are tightly packed and cannot be rescheduled. Cancelled games are recorded as 0-0 draws, with both teams awarded two points. IMPACT ON FINAL PLACINGS England and France have already booked a spot in the quarter-finals but the decision to cancel Italy's match eliminates them from contention. A win over the All Blacks in Toyota could have taken the Italians through. New Zealand now top the group, ahead of South Africa. With hosts Japan and Scotland still locked in battle for a place in the knockout round, any decision to cancel that game will have a huge impact on the final placings. That decision will be taken on the day of the game. If Japan's match in Yokohama is cancelled, the hosts would go into the quarter-finals for the first time. Organisers received immediate criticism for the cancellations, with former World Cup winner Francois Pienaar telling Sky Sports: \"Everybody has worked so hard. Why, if you work that hard and prepare yourself, let weather influence the outcome of the match? It shouldn't.\" Simon Learey, a British fan here, said he had flown out for the England-France game after getting the tickets as a birthday present. \"Very disappointed, we're only here four days, only to see that game,\" said Learey. But World Rugby's Gilpin said safety had to be the determining factor in these decisions. \"We fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first,\" he said. Japan's Meteorological Agency said Hagibis was currently \"a large and violent typhoon\" and while it will weaken before hitting the mainland, it will \"remain very strong\" and have a \"significant impact over large areas\". Hagibis is currently forecast to clip the southeastern corner of Japan near Tokyo and Yokohama but given its size, the impact will be felt across wide swathes of the country. Formula One organisers also said they were \"closely monitoring\" the potential impact of Hagibis ahead of this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, southwest of Tokyo. READ: F1 monitoring Typhoon Hagibis ahead of Japanese Grand Prix In 2014, Marussia driver Jules Bianchi crashed in bad weather conditions caused by a typhoon, and remained in a coma until his death the following July. Many people in Chiba, east of Tokyo, are still recovering from Typhoon Faxai, which struck Japan in early September and caused widespread disruption, leaving two people dead and cutting power to half-a-million homes. Hagibis is taking a similar trajectory to Faxai but is nearly three times bigger in terms of area. - Agencies/ga</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11987130</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7J-RP11-DYWP-R321-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"776\"/><timeReceived>1:30 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

With the huge storm set to potentially devastate parts of Japan, Italy's game against New Zealand in Toyota and England's match versus France in Yokohama on Saturday have been cancelled while Japan's game against Scotland on Sunday is also in doubt. Italy could have qualified for the quarter-finals with a shock win over double defending champions New Zealand and star player Sergio Parisse said the decision would have been different if the All Blacks had been facing elimination. Host nation Japan would advance to the quarter-finals for the first time if their game in Yokohama is called off. </p><p>The sport's governing body World Rugby and tournament officials told a news conference the decision had been taken due to the huge disruption expected from the typhoon, predicted to be one of the most violent to hit the region in recent years. \"While making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday's matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon,\" said tournament director Alan Gilpin. Super Typhoon Hagibis is expected to bring torrential rain, high winds, storm surges and high waves on Saturday. Other events are also being hit. Organisers of Sunday's Japanese Formula One Grand Prix, obviously mindful of the fact that driver Jules Bianchi died after a crash at Suzuka in 2014 when the track was soaked by Typhoon Phanfone, are closely monitoring the situation, while a 2020 Olympics BMX cycling test event has been brought forward. Gilpin defended the decision to hold the tournament, the first to be hosted in Asia, at this time of year. \"We always knew there would be risks but it's rare for there to be a typhoon of this size at this stage of the year,\" he said, adding that he did not feel the integrity of the tournament had been compromised. \"We have no regrets.\" CANCELLED GAMES Tournament regulations state that cancelled games are ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points going to each team. That would be enough to ensure Japan reach the quarter-finals if their game falls victim to the typhoon, which might look like some sort of sporting karma to their supporters. Four years ago Japan beat South Africa in the biggest upset in rugby history but then became the first team to fail to reach the knockout round after winning three pool games, being edged out on bonus points by Scotland. A decision on whether that match will be played is set to be made early on Sunday and the Scottish Rugby Union said it expected the game to go ahead. \"Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch and will be flexible to accommodate this,\" the SRU said on Twitter. Coach Gregor Townsend added: \"I hope everyone involved in the tournament wants the game to be played and will do their utmost for the game to be played. We have got to believe, and have faith in the organisers, even if it is behind closed doors or played at a different venue.\" Ireland are due to play their final game against Samoa on Saturday knowing a bonus point victory would ensure progress. A win without a bonus point, or even a bonus point in defeat, would also send the Irish through if Japan's game is called off. Italy finished third behind New Zealand and South Africa after their match against the All Blacks was cancelled leaving an angry Parisse to question the tournament regulations. \"If New Zealand needed four or five points against us it would not have been cancelled,\" said the man who has been the backbone of Italian rugby for years. \"It is ridiculous that there was no Plan B, because it isn't news that typhoons hit Japan. \"Sure, everyone might think that Italy v New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team.\" Coach Conor O'Shea said the players' reaction to the news was \"horrible.\" \"Their World Cup has ended on the training pitch, when it should be on the playing field,\" he said. New Zealand finish top of the group with South Africa going through as runners-up. Thursday's decision marks the first time a World Cup match has been cancelled since the tournament started in 1987. The 1995 semi-final between hosts South Africa and France was delayed by an hour due to a waterlogged pitch, but famously went ahead after a team of cleaning ladies took to it with brooms. If bad weather strikes again in Japan, tournament rules allow for knockout stage games to be rescheduled.

The decisive Pool A match had been in doubt after two Saturday fixtures were cancelled due to safety concerns surrounding Typhoon Hagibis. Sunday's game between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi was also called off because of damage caused in the area by the storm. </p><p>Sunday's other two pool games between the United States and Tonga in Osaka and between Wales and Uruguay in Kumamoto will also go ahead after passing safety inspections. \"The decision was taken following a comprehensive assessment of the venue and associated infrastructure on Sunday morning in partnership with the Host City,\" organisers said in a statement. \"World Rugby and the Japan Rugby 2019 Organising Committee would like to thank everyone involved for their significant efforts to enable the match to be played as scheduled following one of largest and most powerful typhoons to hit Japan in recent years.\" They also said fans should expect a significantly reduced level of spectator service and as a result are allowing them to bring in their own drinks - but non-alcoholic only. Ireland beat Samoa on Saturday to secure qualification from Pool A with 16 points and Scotland must win Sunday's game to have any chance of joining them. A win or draw for Japan, who have lost all seven of their previous games against the Scots, or a bonus point for losing within seven points if Scotland don't get a bonus point, would send the host nation into the quarter-finals for the first time. If Scotland win with a bonus point they would progress other than in the unlikely, but possible, scenario of Japan losing by seven or less and scoring four tries, to take two bonus points. The group winners will face South Africa in the quarter-finals, while the runners-up will take on double defending champions New Zealand.

The wind and persistent rain presaging Saturday's arrival of Typhoon Hagibis made for an untidy contest at Shizuoka Stadium but the Wallabies did just enough to ensure they will top the pool if Wales slip up against Uruguay on Sunday. That is highly unlikely but with England therefore looming as Australia's quarter-final opposition, a run-out against a big physical tier-two team was as good a preparation as coach Michael Cheika could have wanted. </p><p>England will have little to fear from the Wallabies on this evidence, however, as the twice World Cup winners stumbled rather than cantered into the knockout stages. Their hopes of a first fast start of the tournament were quickly quashed by a steely Georgia defence which had already made 100 tackles before scrumhalf Nic White nipped over the line to open the scoring in the 23rd minute. No more tries were to follow before the break but Australia's problems with the high tackle did return in the 35th minute when number eight Isi Naisarani was sent to the sin bin for an arm into the face of Georgian lock Giorgi Nemsadze. Soso Matiashvili and Matt To'omua exchanged penalties to give Australia a 10-3 halftime lead but their frequent handling errors hampered their efforts to break clear at the start of the second half. In the end, it took a dazzling individual effort from Marika Koroibete to make the second-half breakthrough with the big winger weaving his way past four defenders to touch down on the hour mark. Georgia were not done yet, though, and winger Alexander Todua got the biggest cheer of the night from the rain-drenched crowd when he tore down the left wing to score 10 minutes from time. Loose forward Jack Dempsey and scrumhalf Will Genia crossed for tries in the last five minutes to earn Australia a bonus point they did not need and add a bit of respectability to the scoreline. Australia's win means Georgia's totemic flanker Mamuka \"Gorgodzilla\" Gorgodze heads into retirement without the win over a tier one team he so desired. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11992884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-BTC1-JCDN-113X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"371\"/><timeReceived>12:45 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Vettel, outqualified by Leclerc for the last nine races, lapped the 5.8-kilometer track in a record time of one minute, 27.064 seconds to pip his 21-year-old Monegasque team mate by 0.189 seconds. Valtteri Bottas, who had topped every session of track action until the final top 10 qualifying shootout was third ahead of team mate Lewis Hamilton with the Mercedes pair locking out the second row of the grid. </p><p>Hamilton, who has won five times in Japan including four at Suzuka, leads Bottas by 73 points in the overall standings with five races to go. The pole was the 57th of Vettel's career and only second this season. It also hands Ferrari their fifth pole in a row with Leclerc starting the last four races from the front. Qualifying took place at a sunny Suzuka on Sunday morning after being postponed from its usual Saturday slot due to the approach of Typhoon Hagibis. Drivers and teams will now face a quick turnaround with the race set to start as planned at 2.10 pm local time (0510 GMT). Vettel, who has come under pressure from the younger Leclerc, has won four times at Suzuka and will be hoping to carry his formidable form into the race later on Sunday. Ferrari will be hoping to avoid a repeat of the last race in Russia where tensions between their drivers threatened to boil over while they were running first and second. Mercedes, who have started from pole and won the last five races in Suzuka, have a shot at clinching a record-equalling sixth constructors' title later on Sunday. But, needing to score 14 points more than Ferrari to get the job done, the battle will stay alive until the next race in Mexico if they finish as they qualified. Max Verstappen will start fifth for Red Bull ahead of team mate Alexander Albon with the Red Bull drivers starting engine supplier Honda's home race from the third row of the grid.

Leitch will lead an experienced side, which includes the recalled hooker Shota Horie and veteran lock Luke Thompson, for the 32nd time against Scotland in the final game of the World Cup pool phase. The winner is likely to advance to the quarter-finals from Pool A, which could potentially end up with three teams on 15 points. </p><p>Coach Joseph had handed the armband to Pieter Labuschagne for the last two games against Ireland and Samoa to help take some of the spotlight off Leitch during Japan's unbeaten run. \"We all see him and feel just how much things he has to do,\" Joseph told reporters. \"He can't go outside the hotel without signing autographs. \"(But) he is the most appropriate leader. And he is the leader for this game.\" The match is still in jeopardy due to Typhoon Hagibis, which has already forced the cancellation of Saturday's games between England and France in Yokohama and New Zealand v Italy in Toyota City. Joseph said he had chosen his side for their big match experience, bringing back Kenki Fukuoka, who scored the match-winning try against Ireland, for Lomano Lemeki on the left wing. Lemeki was man-of-the-match in Japan's 38-19 win against Samoa last weekend. Full-back William Tupou comes in for Ryohei Yamanaka, who is now on the bench in the only other change to the starting side that beat Samoa. \"We feel that we are in a good position with three wins ... (and) this is not a coincidence, it is because of hard work,\" Joseph added. \"This will be the most important test match. \"We feel that the whole nation is backing us.\" Team: 15-William Tupou, 14-Kotaro Matsushima, 13-Timothy Lafaele, 12-Ryoto Nakamura, 11-Kenki Fukuoka, 10-Yu Tamura, 9-Yutaka Nagare, 8-Kazuki Himeno, 7-Pieter Labuschagne, 6-Michael Leitch (captain), 5-James Moore, 4-Luke Thompson, 3-Jiwon Koo, 2-Shota Horie, 1-Keita Inagaki Replacements: 16-Atsushi Sakate, 17-Isileli Nakajima, 18-Asaeli Ai Valu, 19-Uwe Helu, 20-Hendrik Tui, 21-Fumiaki Tanaka 22-Rikiya Matsuda, 23-Ryohei Yamanaka - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11991932</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-PV81-JCDN-10FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"365\"/><timeReceived>7:26 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Here's a snapshot of some of the extreme weather events around the world this year. BUSHFIRES IN AUSTRALIA Australian bushfires have caused unprecedented pollution along the country's east coast, blanketing cities from Sydney to Brisbane in smoke for weeks on end. At least six people have died and more than 700 homes destroyed. </p><p>In early December, a spokesperson for the New South Wales department of environment declared that the bushfires and dust have caused \"some of the highest air pollution ever seen\" in Australia. READ: Sydney smoke crisis \"longest on record\" READ: Australians protest as bushfire haze sparks health concerns The region \"has experienced other periods of poor air quality that lasted several weeks\", but \"this event ... is the longest and the most widespread in our records\", she said. Bushfires are common in Australia, but scientists say this year's season has come earlier and with more intensity due to a prolonged drought fuelled by climate change. The fires have spawned numerous headlines, putting the spotlight on everything from the fate of golf's prestigious Australian Open to that of the hundreds of koalas living in the fire zone. Earlier this week, up to 20,000 protesters rallied in Sydney demanding urgent climate action from Australia's government, as smoke from the bushfires choking the city caused health problems to spike. READ: Hundreds of rare koalas feared dead in Australia bushfire READ: \"Bear\" the dog helps find koalas injured in Australian bushfires CYCLONES IN SOUTH ASIA At least two major cyclones smashed into the coasts of India and Bangladesh this year, wreaking havoc with its fierce gales and torrential rains. In May, Cyclone Fani made landfall, killing at least 34 in India and five in Bangladesh. One of the most powerful storms to hit the area in years, the cyclone destroyed houses, ripped off roofs and cut off power, water and telecommunications. Later in November, the destruction from Cyclone Bulbul killed at least 20 people in Bangladesh. More than 2 million were evacuated from their homes. Bangladesh's low-lying coast, as well as India's east are regularly faced with clones. In recent decades, at least hundreds of thousands of people living around the Bay of Bengal have been killed. HEATWAVE IN EUROPE A ferocious heatwave smashed records across Europe in the middle of the year, with the temperature in France surpassing 45 degrees Celsius for the first time on record. The country, along with Spain, Italy and parts of central Europe were particularly hit by the soaring temperatures. Belgium, Germany and the Netherlands all saw new temperature records as well. READ: Europe's record-setting heatwave to spike even higher The extreme temperature caused about 1,500 more deaths than usual in France over June and July, up 9.1 per cent on average for the period according to the country's health ministry. The World Meteorological Organisation said the heatwave in Europe was \"absolutely consistent\" with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions. FLOODING IN VENICE On top of sweltering summer temperatures, Venice was also hit with bouts of intense flooding as it neared the end of the year. The UNESCO World Heritage Site was hit by multiple major floods in less than a week, with water levels hitting their highest in half a century, at one point leaving about 80 per cent of the city submerged. READ: Devastated Venice braced for third major flood The crisis led to the government releasing (EURO)20 million (US$22 million) to tackle the devastation to churches, shops and homes. \"On behalf of the whole team, we stand close to the city of Venice,\" said Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma. He was speaking on behalf of the country's football team, which had travelled to Venice in a show of solidarity. TYPHOON HAGIBIS Typhoon Hagibis slammed into Japan in October, killing more than 70 people across the country and triggering landslides, fierce wind and rain, and causing dozens of rivers to burst their banks. Tens of thousands of households suffered electricity blackouts and more than 100,000 households were without running water. READ: Japanese rescuers continue search for typhoon survivors as toll reaches 74 Rescuers were working round the clock to help those affected, with the defence ministry calling up several hundred reserve troops for the first time since the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The crisis led Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to announce a 710 million yen (US$6.5 million) package to help areas affected by the typhoon. TYPHOON KAMMURI More recently, the deadly Typhoon Kammuri pounded the Philippines earlier this month, killing at least 13 people, toppling trees and flattening homes. The country's Ninoy Aquino International Airport was closed for half a day as a precaution, affecting hundreds of flights, while the SEA Games 2019 saw some programming postponed. The passage of the typhoon also intensified monsoon rains in the country's north, leaving the region hit by some of its worst flooding in decades and forcing tens of thousands from their homes. READ: Philippines floods force 66,000 from homes HURRICANE DORIAN Although the Bahamas sees multiple hurricanes a year, the strength of Hurricane Dorian took people by surprise. At least 63 people were killed and hundreds went missing. Thousands lost their homes and schools as about 75 per cent of buildings were destroyed in the areas where the hurricane passed through. READ: Dorian forces Bahamas to find new schools for 10,000 displaced students READ: Red Cross scrambles to address surging climate-related risks Red Cross officials had thought the island nation was well-prepared, but the mammoth effect of the storm was not anticipated. \"We were prepared for hurricanes as we knew them to be ... (but) we could not have anticipated the strength of Dorian,\" said the head of BahamasRed Cross. She called the incident a \"climate change disaster\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12179328</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR2-PR11-JCDN-10MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><timeReceived>11:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

One person was killed in a landslide in Chiba prefecture, just east of Tokyo, with two other people missing, according to public broadcaster NHK. Authorities warned of the chance of further landslides and floods, especially in areas hit by levee breaks that have yet to be repaired after Hagibis lashed central and eastern Japan with heavy rains and high winds this month. </p><p>That typhoon killed at least 82 people, nearly a dozen are still missing and more than 300 were injured. READ: Mercy Relief launches public fundraising appeal for typhoon-hit Japan READ: Japanese flood disaster frays resilience of elderly victims \"It has been two weeks since the disaster caused by Typhoon 19 (Hagibis) and the rain has continued to fall intermittently so people to need to take the necessary caution,\" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in a tweet. Evacuation orders were issued for at least 80,000 people in Chiba, where rivers were rising precariously close to their banks. Most trains services in Chiba were halted, leaving travellers stranded at stations, according to NHK. Parts of Chiba were drenched by 86mm (3.4 inches) of rain in an hour on Friday morning, with some areas receiving more than a month of rain in one day. It was the third natural disaster to hit the area in the past six weeks. Much of Chiba lost power, in some cases for weeks, in Typhoon Faxai in September and then were hit by heavy rains due to Hagibis. The government also asked 340,205 people to evacuate their homes in Fukushima prefecture because of a threat posed by possible landslides. The rain pounded the Tokyo area for much of the day before moving north. Total rainfall in the area around Tokyo was likely to reach around 200 to 300 mm (8-12 inches) by evening, the Japan Meteorological Agency said. Some flights to Tokyo were diverted because of the downpour, NHK said. Tropical storm Bualoi, which battered the Ogasawara islands south of the main Japanese archipelago on Thursday while still at typhoon strength, was heading out into the Pacific and expected to weaken to a tropical depression later on Friday. - Reuters/zl/ec</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12033536</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBS-9K41-JCDN-135H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"395\"/><timeReceived>2:37 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Japan's Meteorological Agency is monitoring Typhoon Hagibis, which is expected to lash southern Honshu over the weekend and could put matches in the area in jeopardy. Scotland's bonus-point victory over Russia at Shizuoka Stadium on Wednesday ensured that their clash with Japan will determine who qualifies for the quarter-finals. </p><p>\"It does look like it is heading into Tokyo this weekend,\" Townsend told reporters after his team's 61-0 victory. \"It is a few days away and it could miss the Tokyo area or could still go there.\" Tournament rules state that any pool game which cannot be played will not be rescheduled and instead be recorded as a 0-0 draw, with bonus points unavailable. That would ensure Scotland fail to reach the quarter-finals for just the second time in the tournament's history. Townsend said he was unsure whether World Rugby had back-up plans, with media reports suggesting they were considering shifting games to other cities or to other dates. \"We will be getting updates from World Rugby over the next two days over what the contingencies are,\" he said. \"I am sure that alternative venues or arrangements are being looked at. Not just our game, but England and France play in the same stadium the night before. \"I don't know if that's getting looked at for the Ireland-Samoa game (on Saturday) as well, with it being first forecast as (hitting) Fukuoka.\" Townsend said he felt his players had done what was required on Wednesday to put themselves in position to dash the hopes of the tournament hosts of reaching the knock-out stages for the first time. \"It was a tough game,\" Townsend said. \"The scoreline doesn't suggest that, but the effort that went into getting that scoreline by putting pressure on the Russian defence to open up spaces was huge from my players. \"Getting the bonus point ... we knew that if we hadn't got that, Sunday would have been difficult, so getting that was excellent. \"Getting a big score will also keep things interesting for Saturday, as well with the Ireland-Samoa game. \"But also for the confidence - the players know that for two games now we haven't conceded a point, that's very encouraging.\" (Editing by Tony Lawrence) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11985696</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7D-DFB1-DYWP-R1W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><timeReceived>11:36 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Four people died and 17 are missing after the most powerful typhoon to hit Japan in decades hammered the Tokyo area on Saturday, causing widespread flooding and leaving almost half a million homes without power. England had been due to play France in Yokohama on Saturday night but the game was cancelled as the serious threat posed by the huge storm became apparent. </p><p>To avoid it the squad decamped for a \"beef and beer\" break at the holiday resort where they had their pre-tournament training camp and well away from the Typhoon's path. From there they will have a three-hour coach trio to Oita on Monday, where they will continue the build up to their quarter-final in a week's time - likely to be against Australia. After a full-on training session on Saturday, Vunipola said: \"It's worrying, but we're lucky - we're pretty sheltered from a lot of that. I didn't realise how big or how bad the typhoon was going to be until we got told the news. \"Obviously you're focused on rugby but you know it's not the be-all and end-all.\" Vunipola's father Fe'ao, a former captain of Tonga, was in Tokyo for the France game, along with other members of his extended family. \"You worry for people's safety in typhoons and you hope and pray that nothing serious does happen,\" Vunipola said. Vunipola is in the running for his first start of the tournament as he battles back to fitness from a serious hamstring injury sustained in May. His brother Billy is also expected to be fit after twisting an ankle and having to come off at halftime in the win over Argentina. \"He's in good spirits and confident he'll be available for selection, which is good for him,\" Mako said of the number eight. \"He's done all his bits with icing and he's under good care with the physios.\" Winger Jack Nowell, who made his first appearance since May coming off the bench against Argentina, is the only other member of the squad to be a fitness doubt for the quarter-final but it is expected he will be available for selection.

Abe visited Fukushima and Miyagi prefectures, which suffered heavy damage in the storm.

Fukushima has seen the highest number of casualties from the typhoon, with at least 28 dead as of Thursday. Abe said the government would spend 710 million yen (US$6.53 million) to help with disaster relief.

With winter approaching and some parts of Fukushima seeing below-average temperatures, concern is rising about the health of those in evacuation centres, some of whom lost everything in the floods. The Ministry of Land and Transportation said on Thursday that levees had broken in more than 100 places, and authorities warned that with heavy rains forecast for the weekend, more flooding could occur. The government was considering postponing the parade celebrating the emperor's Oct. 22 enthronement so it could devote attention to coping with the aftermath of the typhoon, which damaged or destroyed 1,600 houses, the state broadcaster NHK reported. Other events connected with the enthronement are going ahead as planned, it added. There has been no announcement by the government. Emperor Naruhito is set to proclaim his enthronement in a centuries-old ceremony attended by some 2,500 people, including heads of state and other dignitaries from nearly 200 countries. The emperor, 59, acceded to the throne in May after his father, Akihito, became the first monarch to abdicate in two centuries. - Reuters/nr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12008746</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X94-5VN1-DYWP-R538-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"408\"/><timeReceived>7:57 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Formula One's governing body said earlier on Friday that race promoters and the Japanese Automobile Federation had decided to cancel all practice and qualifying sessions scheduled for Saturday due to the typhoon's approach. The hour-long qualifying session that decides the grid order for the race will now be held at 10 a.m. (0100 GMT) on Sunday, while the final practice session, which would normally take place before qualifying, has been scrapped. </p><p>Friday's second session assumed greater importance as it could decide the starting order for the race if conditions have not sufficiently improved for qualifying to go ahead. That prompted some drivers, most notably Ferrari pair Charles Leclerc and Sebastian Vettel, to fit fresh tyres in a bid to set a fast lap towards the session's end. Bottas had led Hamilton in the opening 90 minute session and was again quickest around the Suzuka circuit, posting a time of one minute 27.785 seconds, beating the Briton by 0.100. Max Verstappen, fifth in the morning for Red Bull, vaulted ahead of the Ferrari's to end the day third, 0.281 behind the Finn, making a solid start to engine-supplier Honda's home race weekend. Ferrari, who have started the last four races from pole and converted three of those to victory, were fourth and fifth with Leclerc (1:28.141) ahead of Vettel (1:28.376). Alexander Albon was sixth for Red Bull ahead of McLaren's Carlos Sainz and Racing Point's Sergio Perez. Pierre Gasly, who gave up his seat in the opening session so Naoki Yamamoto could drive his Honda-powered Toro Rosso in front of his home crowd, was ninth. McLaren's British rookie Lando Norris rounded out the top 10. Mercedes, who have won every race at Suzuka going back to 2014, can seal a record-equalling sixth successive Formula One constructors' championship on Sunday by scoring 14 more points than Ferrari. Hamilton, 73 points clear of Bottas in the overall standings with five races to go, is also well on his way to clinching a sixth title.

Officials said the typhoon was being tracked by the Japan Meteorological Agency and they projected that it could bring high winds and heavy rain to southern Japan on Saturday and Sunday, the final two days of pool play in the tournament. Scotland are scheduled to face Japan in the final match of pool play at Yokohama on Oct 13 and depending on the result of their Pool A clash against Russia in Shizuoka on Wednesday, it could determine the final composition of the quarter-finals. </p><p>Reid, however, was not all concerned about the possibility of the typhoon striking at a time when they would need a bonus-point victory against Japan to advance to the quarter-finals. \"We're from Scotland. Rain. Hail. It doesn't matter. We've coped with a lot more,\" he told reporters in Hamamatsu on Monday (Oct 7). \"We're from Ayrshire and Glasgow and Edinburgh, well they're a bit posh in Edinburgh but ... rain, shine, snow, whatever, it doesn't matter.\" Hagibis, which Scotland coach Gregor Townsend said he initially thought was named 'Haggis', is the third typhoon to concern World Cup organisers. They informed France and the United States of their \"contingency options\" for their Pool C match in Fukuoka last Wednesday if the game was affected by Typhoon Mitag, which ultimately passed by Japan. Organisers also issued a warning about Tropical Storm Tapah, that threatened to upset the first weekend's matches although it had little impact and all the games went ahead as planned. Townsend said Hagibis would likely have little effect on the match against Russia, but it could have an impact on their game in Yokohama and possibly Ireland's match with Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday. Under World Rugby's tournament rules if any matches are abandoned due to the weather then the game is declared a draw and both teams awarded two points. Townsend, however, said his side, who are in third in Pool A on five points behind Japan (14) and Ireland (11) would not be worried about other game's ramifications. \"We just have to win our next two games to qualify,\" he said. \"That would not change if the Ireland and Samoa game ended up in a draw.\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11978754</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X70-G2J1-JCDN-11V7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"398\"/><timeReceived>12:00 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

The unbeaten tournament hosts lead Pool A on 14 points and are within sight of their first World Cup quarter-final spot, while Scotland are in third on 10 and need to beat Japan to give themselves any chance of advancing to the knockout phase. Second-placed Ireland are on 11 and play the already eliminated Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday in their final pool game. </p><p>The Japan-Scotland match, which is scheduled to kick off at Yokohama Stadium at 7:45 p.m. (1045 GMT) on Sunday, however, could still be abandoned, with Hagibis expected to make landfall on Saturday and bring destructive wind and rain. Should the Yokohama match be cancelled, Scotland and Japan would receive two points each, meaning Japan and Ireland would finish as the top two in Pool A and reach the quarter-finals, providing the Irish beat Samoa. Scotland coach Gregor Townsend, who resorted to his first-choice line-up for the game by making 12 changes from the side that beat Russia 61-0 on Wednesday, made no secret of the fact that he thought the game should go ahead, no matter what. That could mean postponing it until Monday, or even shifting it to another venue, he said, something World Rugby said it was not prepared to do. The Scottish Rugby Union, however, have gone on the attack against organisers and SRU chief executive Mark Dodson said their side was not going to be \"collateral damage for a decision that was taken in haste.\" Scotland have never lost to Japan in seven previous matches, but the gap between the two sides is reducing with their last game producing a 21-16 victory in Tokyo in 2016. It is that improvement by the Brave Blossoms and their performances at the World Cup that prompted coach Jamie Joseph also to launch a blistering attack about the match. \"The media reports that I've read, I feel they undermine the achievements of the Japanese national team,\" said Joseph, who restored the inspirational Michael Leitch to the captaincy after trying to take some pressure off him over the last two games. Joseph said his side also wanted the match to go ahead. \"What is important for us is waking up on Monday morning and understanding we're a worthy top-eight team or we're not,\" he said. \"My team is motivated by achieving something great, not (by) avoiding embarrassment.\" - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-11992764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-BTC1-JCDN-113Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"410\"/><timeReceived>11:41 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Schedule changes have been debated by teams and stakeholders as part of measures to improve the show and cut costs while reducing the burden on staff who face travelling to an unprecedented 22 races from 2020. The sport has also talked of experimenting at three rounds next year with plans for sprint races to be held on the Saturday afternoon to decide Sunday's starting grid instead of traditional qualifying. Last Sunday's Japanese Grand Prix added to the discussion with qualifying delayed to Sunday morning due to Typhoon Hagibis. </p><p>\"It was a Super Sunday in Suzuka and that naturally reopened the debate about the shape of an F1 weekend,\" Brawn said in a Formula One review. \"This is an aspect of the sport we have focused on in some detail as we work towards the rules that will govern Formula One over the coming years. \"I'll be honest and say that there has been strong consensus, especially among the organisers, for maintaining the three-day format of track activity, although with a different timetable.\" Brawn said Sunday had offered a great show packed into a few hours but that had a knock-on effect on the support series, which would be limited to the previous days. Promoters are also keen to retain a format that allows them to sell more tickets. \"After careful analysis we have concluded that the best solution is to keep the event over three days, revising the Friday format but leaving the rest untouched, with qualifying on Saturday and the race on Sunday,\" said Brawn. The former Ferrari technical director and ex-Mercedes team boss said Formula One had taken into consideration the increased demands on teams and drivers so that they could arrive a day later than at present. Thursday has traditionally been the media day, with no track running but drivers attending news conferences and available for briefings with reporters while mechanics prepare the cars for Friday practice. This year has 21 races around the world, with Vietnam the latest all-new entrant due to debut in 2021 and additional races waiting in the pipeline. Brawn said more details about the weekend format would emerge at the end of the month, when the new regulations are due to be published. The 10 Formula One teams, governing body and commercial rights holders Liberty Media are meeting in Paris on Wednesday to try and agree a package of rule changes from 2021. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12002742</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8P-7HN1-JCDN-137G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"429\"/><timeReceived>11:36 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.

With their final pool game against England cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis, France will have had two weeks to prepare for Sunday's showdown in the southern Japanese city of Oita. \"We've had more time than expected to study our opponents and to work,\" Alldritt told reporters on Wednesday. </p><p>\"We will have had two weeks without a match but we had high-intensity training sessions at the end of last week and on Monday. \"We tried to replicate match conditions so as to get the best out of it. It wouldn't be correct to say we've had too much time before this match. I'd be more inclined to say that we've had enough time. I hope we'll be ready for this weekend.\" Alldritt made his debut as a late replacement against Wales in the infamous Paris Six Nations game in February when his side blew a 16-0 lead to lose 24-19. Sunday will be his 11th cap and he said he is still struggling to believe he is in Japan playing in a World Cup and not only that, but that his mobility and work-rate mean he has become the starting number eight ahead of the mighty Louis Picamoles. \"It probably still hasn't sunk in what a journey I've been on,\" he said. \"Perhaps it will once the tournament is over when I see my family and friends. Two years ago I was playing in a reserves final in Federale 1 (for Auch in the French third division).\" Everyone in the French squad is painfully aware of their recent record against the Welsh - one win in their last eight matches - and Alldritt says there is no secret formula behind Warren Gatland's team's success. \"Every time we talk about Wales we say the same thing - this team have a clinical game, they do things simply but very well,\" he said. \"They never give up, they always maintain the same intensity for 80 minutes in big games. \"They also have good players in the back-row who can really impose their intensity. Justin Tipuric is the brains of that team towards the end of a match. He never gets tired. \"We're not afraid, but we are wary.\" (Reporting by Mitch Phillips; Editing by Christian Radnedge) - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12006712</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8X-6VP1-JCDN-14H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"383\"/><timeReceived>2:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 MCN International Pte Ltd.
