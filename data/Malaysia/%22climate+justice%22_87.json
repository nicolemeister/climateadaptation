But the international community isn't paying enough attention. It appears that developing nations, as a group, need to drive climate action. This is one reading of Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim's strong call to the European Union to do more for Southeast Asia during a keynote address at the College of Europe in Bruges, Belgium. Developed and developing nations must be treated differently as far as climate action is concerned. In the view of Malaysia, a view shared by many vulnerable nations around the world, climate justice would only come about if the responsibilities of the two are differentiated according to development levels, historical contributions to emissions and current capacities, a principle that comes labelled as \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR). Or, put differently, first emitters pay more principle. Makes good sense as industrialised nations are historically responsible for emitting planet-heating pollution. But the funding from the industrialised polluters of old to flesh out this CBDR principle is very slow in coming. After 29 years of the United Nations climate summits \u00e2\u20ac\u201d officially known as the Conference of Parties (COP) \u00e2\u20ac\u201d only US$200 billion was provided for climate adaptation and mitigation when what is needed is US$3 trillion. Small wonder, COPs are labelled cop-outs.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Newly installed United States President Donald Trump has got emissions right and wrong at the same time. Call it the Trump paradox. Signing the executive order to withdraw the US from the Paris climate treaty, he is reported by The Guardian to have told his supporters on his first day as president thus: \"The United States will not sabotage its own industries while China pollutes with impunity. China uses a lot of dirty energy, but they produce a lot of energy. When that stuff goes up in the air, it doesn't stay there\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 It floats into the United States of America after three and a half to five and half days.\" Similarly, Mr President, the stuff that goes up in the air in the US doesn't stay there either. It floats into Mexico, Canada and the rest of the world, may be not in so many days, but in weeks for sure. But the first victims of the \"dirty energy\" will be Americans. In this sense, what is not good for the US is also not good for the rest of the world.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Knowing that dirty energy doesn't stay where it originates, Trump shouldn't shred the world's climate agenda as he did. Energy transition will suffer. Developed and developing countries have invested a lot in renewable energy to stabilise the climate. More funding is needed to transition from \"dirty energy\" \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to continue the Trumpian phrase \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to clean energy. Wildfires, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts and other climate calamities are no longer country- or continent-specific. And they would only get worse if the Paris treaty target is ignored. Adverse weather has its own momentum. No country can afford to be caught unprepared. Being prepared means investing a lot in stabilising the climate, not less. Vulnerable countries, like those in Southeast Asia, are not at an economic development stage like the industrialised ones to self-fund climate stabilising measures. Industrialised nations must do more to help.</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DYR-FS83-RRSP-F0P6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"560\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 24, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Main Section</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

In too much of the world, life expectancy remains shaped not by biology, but by income.</p><p>The fact that a childs chance of surviving past the age of five is still largely determined by GDP per capita represents a failure for us all,he said during his intervention at the Environment, COP30 and Global Healthsession of the 17th BRICS Leaders Summit here today.</p><p>Malaysia, he said, welcomes the launch of theBRICS Partnership for the Elimination of Socially Determined Diseases.</p><p>It reflects a clear understanding that disease cannot be meaningfully addressed without tackling the conditions that entrench it,said Anwar.</p><p>The premier voiced Malaysias support for deeper collaboration between BRICS and ASEAN to strengthen surveillance, accelerate knowledge transfer, and build resilience across borders.</p><p>He also reaffirmed Malaysias commitment to a credible and just low-carbon transition, highlighting the countrys pledge to reduce emissions intensity by 45 per cent by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>These targets are grounded in law and embedded across public policy, he said, noting thatMalaysias approach is anchored in the National Energy Transition Roadmap andsupported by efforts to introduce a carbon pricing mechanism and regulatory reforms across key sectors.</p><p>Anwar said that Malaysia is also assessing the role of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) in decarbonising industry, with policy frameworks currently being developed.</p><p>However, he stressed that policy alone is not enough -transition requires capital.</p><p>At present, international climate finance stands at roughly US$300 billion per year.

Even Trump will have to fork out for preserving his golf course whether or not he acknowledges the ill effects of climate change.</p><p>Malaysia, and in particular its Bornean states, is acknowledged to provide a great global public good because its rainforests are a gigantic carbon sink.</p><p>While advocates of climate justice argue that rich nations must pay their share for this public good, we must seek other ways to defray the cost of preserving such biodiversity, such as through the promotion of ecotourism until such a time that humanity collectively realises it needs to cough up.</p><p>The writer views developments in the nation, region and the wider world from his vantage point in Kuching</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6B-WX83-RRMM-H3V0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"516\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 22, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Main Section</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Universities are, and always have been, deeply political actors.</p><p>Their decisions about funding, curriculum, faculty hiring, and student activism are shaped by political and economic interests. More importantly, they do not just reflect the world; they shape it.</p><p>Denying this reality does not make universities apolitical. It simply allows those with power - governments, corporations, and ideological groups -to dictate the direction of higher education without challenge.</p><p>The question is not whether universities are political, but what kind of political actors they choose to be.</p><p>Do they act as defenders of truth, critical thought, and academic freedom? Or do they become instruments of state control, corporate influence, and ideological conformity?</p><p>Knowledge is power and power is always political</p><p>At the core of every university is knowledge production, and the production of knowledge is never neutral.</p><p>Decisions about what is taught, which research is funded, and whose perspectives are prioritised are deeply political.</p><p>In an ideal world, universities would be spaces where diverse ideas flourish, where knowledge is pursued for the common good, and where academics are free to challenge prevailing wisdom.</p><p>But in reality, knowledge production is shaped by state interests, corporate influence, and the political economy of higher education.</p><p>One of the clearest examples of this is the way research funding is allocated. Governments direct funding toward research that aligns with national priorities - whether in security, economic growth, or technological innovation - while discouraging work that challenges state narratives.</p><p>In many countries, research on human rights, social justice, and government accountability struggles for funding, while studies on economic development, counterterrorism, and technological advancement thrive.</p><p>This is not an accident. It is a political decision that determines which ideas receive legitimacy and which remain in the margins.</p><p>The curriculum itself is another battleground. Universities shape public understanding by deciding whose knowledge is taught and whose is excluded.</p><p>Calls to \"decolonise\" the curriculum - by incorporating indigenous knowledge, feminist perspectives, and Global South scholarship - are met with fierce resistance in many institutions, revealing just how deeply entrenched traditional power structures are in academia.</p><p>A refusal to revise curricula in response to these critiques is not a neutral stance - it is an active decision to preserve historical hierarchies in knowledge production.</p><p>Universities as extensions of state power</p><p>Universities are not just centres of knowledge; they are also institutions of governance, often operating under direct or indirect state control.</p><p>Public universities receive government funding, and even private universities function within national regulatory frameworks.</p><p>This creates significant vulnerabilities, making universities susceptible to political interference.</p><p>One of the most obvious ways this plays out is through the politicisation of university leadership. In many countries, governments appoint university vice-chancellors, rectors, and board members based on political loyalty rather than academic merit.</p><p>These appointments often come with an unspoken expectation: protect the state, silence dissent, and ensure that universities do not become hubs of political resistance.</p><p>This influence extends to the suppression of academic freedom and student activism.</p><p>Historically, universities have been hotbeds of political movements, with students and faculty at the forefront of struggles for democracy, civil rights, and social justice.</p><p>But state authorities often view universities as threats rather than partners in democratic development.</p><p>As a result, student protests are met with heavy-handed crackdowns, and academics who criticise the government risk losing their jobs or facing legal action.</p><p>The repression of academic freedom is particularly evident in countries where authoritarianism is on the rise.</p><p>In Turkey, thousands of academics have been dismissed from their positions for expressing political dissent.</p><p>In Hong Kong, university administrators have been pressured to discipline students involved in pro-democracy protests.</p><p>In Thailand, student-led movements advocating for monarchy reform have led to arrests and academic penalties.</p><p>These are not isolated cases. They illustrate a broader trend in which universities serve as enforcers of state control rather than spaces of critical inquiry.</p><p>The corporate takeover of higher education</p><p>If state influence is one side of the coin, corporate influence is the other. The rise of neoliberalism in higher education has transformed universities into profit-driven institutions, prioritising market demands over intellectual exploration.</p><p>Universities now compete for international students, climb global rankings, and seek lucrative partnerships with private industry - all of which come at a cost.</p><p>One of the clearest signs of this shift is the commodification of education. Universities increasingly operate like businesses, treating students as customers and faculty as service providers.</p><p>Adjunct faculty work under precarious conditions, while tenured positions become harder to secure.</p><p>The humanities and social sciences, which foster critical thinking, receive less funding and institutional support than STEM disciplines, which attract corporate and government investment.</p><p>Research, too, is shaped by corporate interests. Pharmaceutical companies fund research that favours their patented drugs.</p><p>Fossil fuel companies sponsor university programs while downplaying climate change concerns. Big tech firms partner with universities to develop artificial intelligence and data surveillance technologies, often with little public accountability.</p><p>This growing corporate influence raises serious ethical concerns about the independence of academic research.</p><p>When universities become financially dependent on private industry, who gets to decide which research is conducted and which questions are worth asking?</p><p>Universities as sites of resistance</p><p>Despite these challenges, universities remain powerful spaces for resistance. Throughout history, students and academics have been at the forefront of social and political change.</p><p>Universities played crucial roles in anti-colonial struggles, civil rights movements, and pro-democracy uprisings.</p><p>In recent years, student-led movements have pushed for climate justice, racial and gender equality, and ethical labour practices within universities themselves.</p><p>Universities cannot afford to remain passive. The idea that they can exist outside of politics is an illusion - one that benefits those who seek to control knowledge rather than expand it.</p><p>The real question is: Will universities serve as tools of state and corporate power, or will they reclaim their role as spaces of truth-seeking, debate, and transformation?</p><p>We, as students, faculty, and citizens, also have a choice. We can accept the increasing restrictions on academic freedom and allow universities to become institutions of conformity, or we can fight for them to remain spaces of critical inquiry, resistance, and societal progress.</p><p>Universities are political actors. The only question left is what kind of political actors they will choose to be.</p><p>* Khoo Ying Hooi, PhD is Associate Professor in the Department of International and Strategic Studies, Universiti Malaya.</p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

These treaties address twin threats that are intricately linked.</p><p>For instance, climate change accelerates biodiversity loss, while nature-based solutions are key to climate change mitigation and adaptation.</p><p>Fast forward 30 years: the Intergovernmental Platform on Science-Policy Advice on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services has warned that about one million species are at risk of extinction due to human activities.</p><p>Alarmed by this crisis, the global community pledged in December 2022 to halt biodiversity loss by 2030 under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF), an ambitious goal to be realised within just five years</p><p>Meanwhile, global temperatures continue to rise due to the reliance on fossil fuels.</p><p>Despite progress since the 2015 Paris Climate Accords, the consequences are severe. Recent reports declared 2024 the hottest year in recorded history.</p><p>The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns of a new era of climate chaos, marked by floods, storms and wildfires.</p><p>This has been most vividly illustrated by wildfires in Southern California that have destroyed thousands of buildings, claimed dozens of lives, and caused US$250 billion to US$275 billion in damage.</p><p>Malaysia has also faced climate-induced disasters. The December 2021 floods resulted in 54 deaths, displaced more than 71,000 residents, and affected more than 125,000 people.</p><p>Damage to homes, infrastructure and businesses totalled RM6 billion.</p><p>UN Secretary-General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres said: \"It is essential to act now to prevent chaotic climate breakdown\", calling for greater coordination on the interlinked environmental crises.</p><p>This is the challenging landscape Nik Nazmi entered as minister, and he has risen to the occasion in remarkable fashion.</p><p>His book documents his efforts, including his advocacy for climate justice through the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" (CBDR).</p><p>This principle acknowledges that while all nations share a responsibility to combat climate change, their obligations differ based on development levels, historical contributions and current capacities.</p><p>Nik Nazmi has emphasised the need for industrialised nations \u00e2\u20ac\u201d those historically responsible for much of global warming \u00e2\u20ac\u201d to provide financial support to developing countries that disproportionately bear the brunt of climate disasters.</p><p>Malaysia has long championed CBDR, a principle introduced at the Earth Summit.</p><p>However, it remains hard to implement, as evidenced by the relatively paltry US$200 billion provided for climate adaptation and mitigation in developing countries, far short of the US$3 trillion needed annually.</p><p>Throughout his book, Nik Nazmi shares examples of engagement with global leaders on environmental sustainability.</p><p>For example, while Malaysia accounts for just 0.77 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, it has been a responsible global citizen.</p><p>The country aims to reduce its economy-wide carbon intensity by 45 per cent against GDP by 2030 (compared with 2005 levels) and aspires to net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>Nik Nazmi's strength lies in his ability to build on the positive policies of his predecessors.</p><p>He has introduced new, forward-thinking initiatives, recognised by Guterres himself, who commended Malaysia for being one of the first countries to integrate the GBF into its National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans.</p><p>As a long-time advocate for environmental sustainability, I am confident that under Nik Nazmi's tenure, Malaysia will reclaim its prominent role on the global stage.</p><p>The writer is the founding director of the International Institute of Science Diplomacy and Sustainability at UCSI University</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Powerful forces oppose progress, but the challenges confronting humanity \u20ac\u201c whether climate catastrophe or poverty \u20ac\u201c can only be solved collectively. No nation can do it alone,\u20ac\u00a0he said.</p><p>To make the world a fairer place, he noted that Malaysia and like-minded nations will need steadfast and credible partners standing beside them.</p><p>\u20ac\u0153This is why Malaysia has worked to forge stronger ties with champions of multilateralism, guided by a renewed foreign policy rooted in inclusion and justice,\u20ac\u00a0he said.</p><p>Anwar said the Global South faces challenges shaped by policies made without its full participation, and that\u00a0climate impacts, conflicts, economic instability, and cycles of debt have all been worsened by this exclusion.</p><p>The Prime Minister also highlighted four key areas that urgently need reform, namely the international financial architecture, the international trading system, climate finance and climate justice, and the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>\u20ac\u0153The time for half-measures and incremental changes has passed. The choice before us is clear;\u00a0continue with a system that marginalises most of humanity, or build a new order founded on genuine partnership, shared prosperity, and sustainable development,\u20ac\u00a0he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MALNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MALNWS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJN-WHT1-JC8S-644D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">210555</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Pertubuhan Berita Nasional Malaysia All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Malaysia General News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 2, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

By 2030, 600 million people may face hunger. At current rates, ending extreme poverty will take decades,\" he said in his keynote address at the 2024 Common Action Forum.</p><p>Anwar added that these outcomes were not coincidental, but rather the result of a global system that was not designed to be inclusive.</p><p>\"The Global South faces challenges shaped by policies made without its full participation. Climate impacts, conflicts, economic instability and cycles of debt have all been worsened by this exclusion.\"</p><p>Anwar said the International Financial Architecture was one of the areas that urgently needed reform.</p><p>\"The current financial system still favours wealthy countries, leaving developing nations at a disadvantage. Developing nations face worse market access and higher borrowing costs despite having similar risk profiles.</p><p>\"During times of crisis, they struggle to access essential liquidity, while debt repayments siphon away resources needed for vital public services. The system refuses to change.\"</p><p>Anwar said during the Covid-19 pandemic, the International Monetary Fund released US$650 billion in Special Drawing Rights.</p><p>\"However, two-thirds of that amount flowed to wealthy nations, leaving those in greatest need with the scraps. This is how global governance fails by entrenching inequality instead of dismantling it.\"</p><p>Anwar said the second area demanding urgent reform was the international trading system. He said despite the World Trade Organisation, unfair trading practices, protectionist measures, and non-tariff barriers continue to hurt developing countries, with the 2023 global trade decline especially impacting them.</p><p>\"Trade no longer offers developing nations a ladder up the value chain. Export markets have become concentrated and dominated by large corporations and digital platforms.</p><p>\"They have driven down global labour incomes and worsened inequality. Geopolitical restrictions, inward-focused industrial policies and unilateral climate actions add further obstacles to the green transition.</p><p>\"In light of this, it behoves me to reiterate that international trade must not only be free, but it must also be humane and equitable.\"</p><p>Another area, Anwar said, was climate finance and climate justice.</p><p>\"The climate crisis continues to intensify, with the consequences, from devastating storms, floods and droughts, falling most heavily on the poor. The cost of climate disasters now is more than double what it was three decades ago.\"</p><p>Anwar said effective climate action depended on adequate financing.</p><p>\"Without sufficient funds, energy transition and climate adaptation will remain out of reach for many developing countries. Despite longstanding commitments, developed nations have consistently fallen short in providing adequate climate finance.\"</p><p>He said the current climate finance flows paled in comparison with the wealth that had moved from the Global South to the North.</p><p>\"To eliminate poverty and achieve climate resilience for all, we must work towards a more balanced flow of resources that supports those in greatest need.\"</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJN-31C1-DYR7-6017-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"576\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 3, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Main Section</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000CA2H</classCode><className>POVERTY &amp;

Its funding heavily relied on the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which is responsible for administering the country's civilian foreign aid and development assistance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Weeks after the funding tap was turned off, the Manushya Foundation has seen some of its most critical functions halted or scaled back. Most at risk are the activists across Asia that the organisation helps keep safe, a function that is mostly hidden from public view, she explained.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The foundation supports environmental defenders, climate justice groups, indigenous peoples groups and political activists \"being targeted\", typically by governments, across the region including most of Southeast Asia, Pakistan and Mongolia.</p><p>\"We have nine safe houses in Bangkok where we can hide families and activists that come to hide in Thailand, hoping to be resettled to a third country and we also provide a lot of rapid response grants,\" she said. Many activists can find themselves in imminent danger and need assistance at short notice, she explained. \"(The public doesn't) know that we are protecting activists, hiding them, providing grants, because that's the work that we didn't want to be that visible to be able to do it well.\"</p><p>Manushya Foundation, according to Pradichit, saw its 2025 funds worth US$560,000 for such projects disappear.</p><p>Its five-year project is all but over; the organisation has been forced to downsize its operations, cut staff and let go of safe houses. Only the most at-risk activists are still receiving support while others will now have to fend for themselves.</p><p>\"It's not a funding crisis. It's a question of life and death. The activists that we were hiding, tomorrow, they can be killed because they're no longer in our safe houses,\" she said.</p><p>The US is the world's largest donor of aid, allocating US$54 billion in fiscal year 2024, according to partial reporting figures on ForeignAssistance.gov, the federal government's official foreign aid website.</p><p>US development assistance has been in the crosshairs of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) led by Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a close adviser to Trump.</p><p>A US federal judge ruled on Mar 19 that DOGE likely violated the US constitution by shuttering USAID, ordering that the Trump administration reverse some of its actions.</p><p>But in the midst of legal battles, USAID staff were forced to leave their foreign postings and cut communications with their field partners. This has created general confusion in Thailand, Malaysia and elsewhere in the region, causing operational work that supports vulnerable communities to run aground.</p><p>Stakeholders also told CNA reforms to humanitarian aid are needed, even as governments worldwide increasingly reduce foreign aid budgets and are more willing to offer concessional loans instead.</p><p>Globally, USAID is set to slash 5,200 of its 6,200 programmes, a move designed to cancel the spending of \"tens of billions of dollars\" in ways that hurt or did not serve the core national interests of the US, Secretary of State Marco Rubio wrote on the social media platform X.</p><p>For fiscal year 2024, the US allocated about US$4.1 billion in foreign aid to East Asia and Oceania, which includes Southeast Asia. The Sub-Saharan Africa region was the largest beneficiary with an allocation of almost US$14 billion.</p><p>Of the US$4.1 billion allocated to East Asia and Oceania, more than half - or US$2.3 billion - was managed by the Department of State.</p><p>USAID oversaw US$1 billion of the total allocation, while the rest was managed by agencies that include the Millennium Challenge Corporation and Department of Agriculture. A CNA tally of figures on ForeignAssistance.gov indicated that USAID allocated US$837.3 million to eight of the 10 member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations last year. Singapore and Brunei did not appear to be allocated funds managed by USAID.</p><p>These include US$237.6 million for Myanmar, US$151.3 million for Indonesia, US$135.4 million for Vietnam and US$20.45 million for Thailand.</p><p>Throughout Southeast Asia, the dismantling of USAID has left small grassroots organisations like Thailand's Manushya Foundation reeling.</p><p>That's because a percentage of USAID's funding typically trickles down to smaller groups doing hands-on work in communities, from malaria prevention to anti-human trafficking, health support for refugees and clean energy.</p><p>\"The world has crumbled around us, at least as far as foreign assistance to development in Southeast Asia goes,\" said Phil Robertson, the director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates (AHRLA) at a panel discussion in Bangkok last week.</p><p>\"It's a tremendous upheaval. People are in shock, People are depressed. People are dismayed,\" he said at the event organised by SEA Junction, a non-profit that aims to foster greater sociocultural understanding of Southeast Asia.</p><p>For fiscal year 2024, Indonesia (US$791.4 million) received the highest allocation of overall US foreign aid among Southeast Asian nations, followed by the Philippines (US$695.1 million) and Vietnam (US$264.1 million), according to ForeignAssistance.gov.</p><p>Thailand and Malaysia were allocated US$38.7 million and US$2.6 million respectively.</p><p>These sums include allocations from various US agencies, including USAID.</p><p>Reuters reported on Feb 6 that Indonesia's health partnerships with USAID were on hold with no indication of whether they would resume, straining Jakarta's efforts against HIV and tuberculosis, which replaced COVID-19 to become the top cause of infectious disease-related deaths globally in 2023.</p><p>A key USAID initiative in Indonesia is the Together Towards Elimination and Freedom From TB (USAID BEBAS TB) programme, launched in July 2023, news outlet Jakarta Globe reported this month.</p><p>The five-year US$70 million initiative aims to improve detection, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of TB, supporting Indonesia's goal of eliminating the disease by 2030.</p><p>The Indonesian government has said it has the financial resources to sustain development efforts without relying heavily on foreign aid.</p><p>\"All this time, the Indonesian government has always considered international funding - regardless of where (the funds) come from - as something that is supplementary. The main source of funding has always been our state budget,\" Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Rolliansyah \"Roy\" Soemirat told a press briefing this month.</p><p>In the Philippines, USAID cuts have threatened the fight against rising HIV cases, with the country's LGBTQ rights groups forced to find new financing strategies and sources of funding.</p><p>As for Vietnam, the Associated Press reported on Mar 20 that USAID cuts have halted a rehabilitation programme for war victims as well as efforts to clear unexploded American munitions and landmines.</p><p>In addition to exposing thousands of people to health hazards, the cuts risk jeopardising the US' diplomatic gains with Vietnam, a country Washington could seek support from to counter an increasingly aggressive China, the report said. HEALTH SERVICE IMPACTS</p><p>Frontline healthcare for the LGBTQ community is one area where the aid cuts have hit hard and fast in Thailand.</p><p>According to an analysis by the Service Workers IN Group Foundation (SWING Thailand), there are close to 700,000 people in Thailand receiving services related to HIV under a policy called the Reach-Recruit-Test-Treat-Retain approach. It is part of a national strategy to eliminate HIV/AIDS in Thailand by 2030.</p><p>But the analysis, based on data from the National Health Security Office, found that 85 per cent of those receiving related care was through civil society groups rather than the national health system.</p><p>Some 60 per cent of those receiving pre-exposure prophylaxis to prevent HIV infection also do it through NGOs. Without this medication, individuals face higher HIV transmission risks.</p><p>\"The NGOs provide care for vulnerable groups and for groups that are not able to get access from other sources ... let's say if you don't have documents, you're a migrant or have a feeling of being discriminated against by a care provider,\" said Kaona Saowakun, vice-president of the Isaan Gender Diversity Network Foundation.</p><p>\"So that's why they're impacted a lot. It could take the lives of people. It's the sudden decision. No one could prepare for that. Meaning they (the US government) don't care about the impact,\" he added.</p><p>Chamrong Phangnongyang, the deputy director of SWING, said his organisation had a mandate under USAID to provide free services to people of five nationalities: Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia and Thailand.</p><p>Now, while they won't deny service to migrants, the services are no longer fully covered, unlike for Thais who could receive assistance through the National Health Security Office.</p><p>It could impact tens of thousands of people annually and the response from Thai authorities has been muted so far on this issue, he said.</p><p>\"Does the country (Thailand) not realise this? Why is the country so silent, acting like nothing has happened? Can we really just let community organisations collapse without doing anything?\"</p><p>Kaona estimated that among the dozens of organisations in Thailand working in the LGBTQ health space, some would have lost just a-tenth of their total funding, while for others it is as high as 60 per cent.</p><p>\"Right now the impact is predictable. It's either suspend activities, close the project, shut offices, cut staff benefits or cut the staffing itself,\" he said. The impact on Thailand will be two-fold as US funding is directed both to the Thai government's health programmes and civil society groups.</p><p>Small media organisations are also impacted. The Irrawaddy, a news website founded by Burmese exiles living in Thailand, was also a recipient of USAID funding until it was frozen.</p><p>It has conducted detailed reporting in recent years about political upheaval in Myanmar, human rights issues, the ongoing civil war and security situation and chronicled the struggles of marginalised communities.</p><p>Its editor-in-chief Aung Zaw said at the SEA Junction event that it remains unclear if all 65 staff members can be retained, or how many might need to be let go.</p><p>\"We are thinking about what we can cut or suspend to keep our core team working. This is what we are thinking for the long term to survive,\" he said.</p><p>For the frontline organisations in Thailand struggling to stay afloat, finding new sources of funding presents a steep challenge.</p><p>Those that CNA spoke with had different ideas - from looking domestically at what national governments could cover to forging new relationships with philanthropy groups.</p><p>There was an acceptance, however, that America's money was probably not coming back anytime soon.</p><p>\"We have to accept the fact that many of us have to downsize. So, our goal is not to get bigger, but our goal is to focus on what we are doing well and prioritise that,\" Pradichit of Manushya Foundation said.</p><p>\"We have to rethink how we get funded. And we have to be innovative.\" SITUATION IN MALAYSIA</p><p>Over in Malaysia, the executive director of North South Initiative, a migrant rights group, said the USAID funding cuts have affected its partners - usually regional NGOs - and caused it to lose about 40 per cent of its \"core funding\".</p><p>\"Certain projects were directly terminated by our partners. So that means staff in those terminated projects will either need to be laid off or repositioned in another project if there are sufficient funds,\" Adrian Pereira told CNA.</p><p>One such project is a shelter for male migrant workers who are pursuing legal action concerning their employment and are thus unable to work.</p><p>While North South Initiative does not get USAID funds directly, Pereira estimated that his NGO was granted USAID-funded projects worth between US$100,000 and US$150,000 last year.</p><p>\"Sadly, this scenario (of reduced foreign aid) has pushed us to a corner. In the next one or two days or even hours, I will have to make decisions - very painful decisions - regarding these shelters or safe homes,\" Pereira said.</p><p>Pereira said the lack of lead time before US foreign aid was pulled had caught many NGOs in Malaysia by surprise, noting that donors usually give advance notice of about six months to a year before exiting.</p><p>\"I think a lot of NGOs will be in trouble ... What is worrying is the (impact on) vulnerable communities that we have been protecting for many years,\" he added, referring to grassroots beneficiaries like migrant workers and refugees.</p><p>\"What happens to them when organisations have to shut down their shelters? What happens to them when medical aid is cut?\" Arlina Ghani, co-founder of Justice for Wildlife Malaysia, a wildlife conservation group focused on building legal capabilities, told CNA that the US foreign aid cuts have forced her partners to suspend three projects.</p><p>These projects involve capacity building for wildlife law enforcement officers in Sabah and peninsular Malaysia, as well as adding more wildlife case trackers across the country.</p><p>The US Department of State, which funded these projects, issued the NGOs a stop-work order in January, Arlina said, effectively suspending all grants for 90 days pending a review.</p><p>This meant Arlina had to break the news to colleagues who had been freshly hired under these projects, including one who had moved back to Kota Kinabalu in Sabah from Kuala Lumpur for the new role.</p><p>\"Now I have to tell them, 'Look, guys, you might not be getting your salaries for three months. The projects might be cancelled, so you might have to look for other jobs.' That's the most difficult bit,\" she said.</p><p>The plan now, Arlina said, is to look for alternative sources of funding, including starting a formal crowdfunding programme.</p><p>\"We also plan to reach out to companies, the corporate sector mostly, and we are also thinking of getting law firms to assist with the funding as well,\" she said.</p><p>\"So right now, it's just a matter of ironing out the details in terms of, okay, if they fund us, how do we deal with the conflict of interest.\" Both Arlina and Pereira acknowledged that some causes are not as appealing as others when it comes to getting funding from brands, companies or politicians.</p><p>For instance, human trafficking is typically \"not so attractive, or doesn't give the PR image that a lot of donors are looking for\" compared to, say, sustainability, Pereira said.</p><p>Pereira hopes the US reverses its suspension of foreign aid, warning that it could \"backfire\" on the country's crucial supply chains if there are not enough labour rights groups safeguarding migrant workers' welfare.</p><p>\"It's not that we are over-dependent (on US aid); it's just the nature of how the development world works,\" he said, calling on Asian and African governments to fill the gap by funding their own civil societies.</p><p>HOW FOREIGN AID COULD CHANGE</p><p>Pereira and other experts say reforms are needed in the international humanitarian aid system for it to function sustainably in the future.</p><p>At the moment, most foreign aid is \"sucked up\" by United Nations (UN) organisations and regional NGOs, with little trickling down to smaller counterparts on the ground, Pereira highlighted.</p><p>The existing system has far too much wastage and too little money reaching small civil society groups, added Rosalia Sciortino, the founder and director of SEA Junction.</p><p>\"We need to recognise that there was a need to give more to local societies and local organisations,\" she told the panel event in Bangkok.</p><p>\"And all of us as civil society, we need to learn about saving and we need to learn about reducing waste in our spending. So it's not only the money we get but how we use the money, ensuring it's used for the sustainability of our organisation.\"</p><p>John Luke Chua, part of the USAID-funded Asia Counter Trafficking in Persons project, said reform would be difficult in an environment of blanket cuts.</p><p>\"I've heard calls for localisation, more flexible funding and stronger support for grassroots. Instead of that, what we have right now is a sharp rightward turn that prioritises political expediency over evidence-based impact,\" he told the panel.</p><p>\"Funding decisions are no longer driven by whether programmes actually achieve what they set out to achieve, but by whether or not they align with short-term political calculus.\"</p><p>Sara Piazzano, an independent consultant and project manager, noted greater shifts happening as governments worldwide increasingly reduce their foreign aid budgets and are more willing to offer concessional loans instead.</p><p>These types of loans, which reached record highs in value globally in 2023, are usually low- or zero-interest and can be funnelled from governments through specialised programmes and partnerships with international institutions, including multilateral banks.</p><p>\"Japan is doing that. They shifted almost all the development aid there. China, of course, has always used this approach. Maybe this is the future that we are going to see,\" Piazzano said, highlighting that major recipients in Asia include Indonesia, Vietnam and India.</p><p>\"I was thinking Bangladesh would have a big impact, not having USAID. But actually, if you compare what they are getting from the World Bank, USAID is nothing,\" she said.</p><p>Data shows Bangladesh's World Bank financing was five times that of USAID in 2023.. \"JUST\" CONDITIONS NEEDED IF OTHER COUNTRIES FILL FUNDING VOID</p><p>Beyond the type of aid, the Trump administration's dismantling of the US foreign aid apparatus has created a vacuum that China is rapidly filling, argued Joshua Kurlantzick, a senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, a US-based think tank.</p><p>China has begun to identify places with potential projects in countries where USAID is now gone or all but gone, increasing its influence and soft power in regions like Southeast Asia, Kurlantzick wrote in a blog post for the think tank on Feb 26.</p><p>\"Beijing seems to be considering increasing a range of humanitarian aid projects in health, education, and sanitation in mainland Southeast Asia, in some of the region's poorest states,\" he wrote.</p><p>For instance, China has assumed the cost of a high-profile de-mining project in Cambodia that the US used to fund.</p><p>\"Suppose other donors, like the Gates Foundation or major donors like Japan, cannot fulfill projects USAID abandoned. In that case, China will likely begin providing more outright aid, not loans, to continue some of these initiatives, especially in states of strategic importance to Beijing,\" he added. Under the auspices of the UN, China, together with 135 countries from the Global South, have also crafted a \"South-South agenda\" that aims to strengthen collective self-reliance among developing nations.</p><p>An August 2023 study on the evaluation of international cooperation efforts noted that South-South cooperation was gaining momentum, as its stakeholders rejected more developed countries' \"imposed ways of working\".</p><p>This refers to a top-down approach of donors setting the agenda for aid recipients.</p><p>Instead, South-South cooperation promotes \"horizontal interaction\" using demand-driven models of cooperation to influence project design, resource allocation and evaluation methods, said the study, which was commissioned by the Ford Foundation.</p><p>Already, some countries have sought to pick up the slack.</p><p>Australia announced this week that it will redirect more than A$119 million (US$73.5 million) in Canberra's official development assistance budget for 2025-2026 from multilateral programmes to fight poverty and disease toward those in the Indo-Pacific region that it funds directly to support economic, health, humanitarian and climate responses.</p><p>While Australia Foreign Minister Penny Wong did not mention Washington's cuts in explaining Australia's change in focus, she said: \"We've had to make hard strategic decisions and focus on where our development assistance can have the greatest impact.</p><p>\"In these uncertain times, we are ensuring more of Australia's development assistance is going to the Pacific and Southeast Asia, where Australia's interests are most at stake.\"</p><p>North South Initiative's Pereira, who was involved in the Ford Foundation study, told CNA that \"sooner or later\" global powers like China or Russia would seek to \"tell their side of the development agenda\".</p><p>He admitted that foreign funding for NGOs has always been a \"very sensitive\" issue because governments could look at it as a matter of national security.</p><p>Pereira said he would consider accepting funding from Chinese or Japanese sources equivalent to USAID for his NGO, as long as the terms and conditions are \"just\".</p><p>\"When we negotiate with our funders, we make sure they don't impose unnecessary or irrational stipulations,\" he added.</p><p>In the meantime, NGOs in the region continue to bleed from the US' funding suspension.</p><p>\"Trump and Musk are treating USAID like a hospital full of patients in which they pulled out all the doctors and the nurses, they shut off the electricity and the water, and they locked the doors on the way out,\" said Robertson at the SEA Junction event.</p><p>\"Then in a couple months, they're going to wander back in to see if there are any survivors.

component of the Paris Agreement, will be reached during the 29th Conference of the Parties (COP29) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p>Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability (NRES) Minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad emphasised that this decision is vital as the 2025 deadline approaches, offering hope to the world, particularly developing nations, and driving progress in climate negotiations.</p><p>\"While COP29 has seen positive developments, especially concerning Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, financial commitments remain a point of contention, particularly with the obligations of developed countries to developing ones,\" he said.</p><p>\"We wish for a decisive agreement that will offer hope to the world, which is watching us and seeking progress in climate negotiations,\" he told Bernama here today.</p><p>Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, Article 9 reiterates that \"developed countries must provide financial resources to support developing countries\" and ensure an allocation of USD100 billion before 2025 to address climate-related challenges.</p><p>The Paris Agreement was signed by 169 countries during COP15 in 2015, with a commitment to limit global warming to below 2 degrees Celsius, aiming for 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Nik Nazmi said that the climate crisis continues to be a growing global challenge, marking the hottest years on record, stressing the urgent need for collective action to address climate change.</p><p>\u20ac\u0153Despite being a small, developing nation, Malaysia\u20ac\u2122s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 is a bold step in fulfilling the country\u20ac\u2122s responsibility towards this global issue,\u20ac he said.</p><p>He highlighted Malaysia's unique position in addressing climate change, noting its natural treasures, such as ancient rainforests, which serve as key carbon sinks, and its location in the Coral Triangle, rich in biodiversity, making these resources crucial for both climate adaptation and mitigation.</p><p>Nik Nazmi added that multilateral platforms like the United Nations\u00a0and COP are the most effective means to tackle the climate crisis globally, with a significant impact on the world.</p><p>He emphasised, therefore,\u00a0that developed countries must be more committed to helping\u00a0developing nations tackle the urgent climate crisis.</p><p>He also criticised countries that allocate substantial funding to conflicts, such as those in Gaza and Lebanon, but fail to respond positively when developing nations seek financing for climate action.</p><p>This, he noted, reflects a clear imbalance in priorities, which must be corrected to ensure climate justice.</p><p>Nik Nazmi further pointed out that Malaysia, as a recipient of international funding from sources like the Green Climate Fund, Global Environment Facility, and Adaptation Fund, has been able to advance green initiatives without solely relying on government funds.</p><p>He stressed that developing countries like Malaysia still need international support in financing, technology, and capacity building to meet the net-zero target by 2050.</p><p>He stated that Malaysia should not be equated with developed countries that have benefitted from the wealth generated by the industrial revolution, largely driven by fossil fuels, and have\u00a0contributed to high carbon emissions.</p><p>Malaysia's participation in COP29 from Nov\u00a011 to 22 at the Baku Stadium aims to strengthen its commitment to a green economy, as outlined in the Budget 2025.</p><p>Nik Nazmi led a delegation of 200 Malaysians to the event.</p><p>The Malaysian Pavilion at COP29, themed \"Shift for Sustainability: Climate Action Now!\", is a collaboration between the NRES and Malaysia Green Technology and Climate Change Corporation as the implementing agency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MALNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source

When required, a warning is issued to evacuate people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This system was used to alert officials about flood risk in Punjab province last year, enabling authorities to move over 150,000 people to safety.</p><p>Barely two years in operation, it was set up in response to the South Asian nation's painful lessons from the devastating 2022 floods which submerged a third of the country, killing 1,700 and impacting about 33 million people.</p><p>Such climate catastrophes have become increasingly frequent, leaving vulnerable communities little time to recover. CALLS FOR THE WEST TO HELP</p><p>Pakistan ranks as the world's fifth-most vulnerable country to climate-induced disasters, despite contributing less than 1 per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Islamabad has said the Global South should come together to demand funds from the West, and that mitigation efforts in vulnerable countries should be funded by the developed world.</p><p>The federal government last year unveiled an ambitious National Adaptation Plan to build climate resilience as well as address income inequality and social disparities.</p><p>This week, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif joined world leaders at the annual United Nations-led climate summit COP29 in Azerbaijan's capital Baku, where he called for US$6.8 trillion in climate funding for developing countries such as his by 2030.</p><p>Speaking at a climate finance roundtable hosted by Pakistan, he stressed that developing countries face huge climate challenges but are often left without adequate resources to meet them.</p><p>According to World Bank estimates, a comprehensive response to Pakistan's climate and development challenges could cost about US$348 billion by 2030.</p><p>Ms Romina Khurshid Alam, coordinator to the prime minister on climate change, said: \"It's a human rights issue as well.</p><p>\"It's a climate justice (that needs) to be done because the countries that are developing - they are struggling so much and they need to be heard.\" DEFORESTATION AMONG MAN-MADE FACTORS</p><p>Man-made factors have contributed to Pakistan's climate-induced problems, according to experts.</p><p>In the southeastern province of Sindh, for instance, deforestation has been rampant for decades and eroded the surrounding region's ability to withstand extreme rainfall.</p><p>Environmental researcher David Fugazza from the University of Milan pointed to evidence that with climate change, the intensity of monsoon rains has increased over the years.</p><p>\"If there is no proper land management, these devastating rains can cause floods,\" he stressed.</p><p>To increase its green cover on the ground, the Sindh provincial government has implemented strict measures.</p><p>Forest guards now regularly patrol the Pai Forest area, which has suffered illegal land grabs and large-scale logging to make way for agriculture.</p><p>Mr Ramiz Raja, assistant commissioner of the Sakrand Division in Sindh's Nawabshah city, noted that the Pai Forest - which is a reserved forest - has now banned the cutting down of trees.</p><p>\"We have established a nursery from where we get the plants and plant them,\" he said, referring to reforestation efforts. \"NO ONE CAME TO OUR AID\"</p><p>Pakistan's extreme vulnerability to climate disaster is made more acute by high levels of poverty across the country.</p><p>Waterborne diseases have been on the rise after the 2022 floods, particularly affecting children, while the country is still struggling to rebuild homes. Crops were inundated by flood waters and irrigation systems were also destroyed.</p><p>Mother-of-six Naseem Khatoon is still trying to piece back her life after the floods left her family homeless and destitute.</p><p>\"No one came to our aid - neither our landlord nor the government. They took votes from us, but nobody came to help us. We helped each other,\" she told CNA.</p><p>Beyond immediate worries of shelter and food, however, is the overwhelming uncertainty over what lies ahead.</p><p>Ms Khatoon said her community lives in constant fear of the next time a disaster strikes.</p><p>\"Whenever it rains and the floodwaters rise, our homes get flooded too, and that brings snakes and other insects into our homes. It is all very terrifying, especially since we have children at home,\" she added.

A look at recent US Pacific Islands policies might provide some clues.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND PACIFIC ISLAND COUNTRIES</p><p>The Biden administration released its Indo-Pacific Strategy in February 2022, the framework for countering Chinese influence, maintaining America's traditional strategic dominance, and signalling its desire to play a greater role in the region. One tool was to strengthen overlapping minilateral alliances, such as AUKUS and the Quad. Others were newly created, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).</p><p>After the shock of the China-Solomon Islands security deal in May 2022, the Biden administration increased its diplomatic and economic engagement with Pacific Island countries. President Joe Biden twice hosted Pacific Island Forum (PIF) leaders at the White House for US-Pacific Summits in 2022 and 2023. The US also announced the US-Pacific Partnership Strategy, a roadmap for strengthening cooperation.</p><p>Over the past four years, there have been an unusual number of high-level political visits to Pacific Island countries, including visits by Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Vice President Kamala Harris, and Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who was in Fiji in early December. The Biden administration also increased its diplomatic presence, opening embassies in Tonga, Kiribati, Vanuatu and Solomon Islands, and a US Agency for International Development (USAID) office in Fiji.</p><p>After aid cuts in the years before, Biden announced a US$810 million aid package over 10 years, including US$130 million for climate change projects. This funding still has not received full congressional approval and its future under Trump 2.0 remains unclear.</p><p>In March, Biden renewed the Compact of Freely Associated States (COFA), announcing an unprecedented package of US$7 billion over 20 years for the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. The US has a long-standing special relationship with these three strategic countries in the Western Pacific, which receive the lion's share of US Pacific aid and investment. COFA will continue to allow the US to provide defence, deploy forces and operate bases there. CLOSE ALLY AUSTRALIA ASSISTING</p><p>America's ally, Australia, has also been doing the heavy lifting in the South Pacific. Already the biggest aid donor to the Pacific Islands countries, Australia has further increased assistance in the last two years.</p><p>To counter China's influence with its neighbours, Australia has concluded several security and aid deals, among them the recent security agreement with Tuvalu which gives Australia a veto power in Tuvalu's foreign and security affairs.</p><p>In December, Australia concluded a rather controversial agreement with Nauru which gives it veto power of pacts that Nauru might want to conclude with third countries. The five-year deal continues to secure Australia's detention facility for Australia-bound refugees and comes with a A$140 million budget (US$87 million) and police support for Nauru.</p><p>The Australia-Solomon Islands security arrangement, announced recently on Dec 20, will fund A$190 million into the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force and set up a new police training centre in the capital Honiara. This deal is a major achievement of the Labour-led Albanese government to counter the China-Solomon Islands security agreement. THE SECOND TRUMP ADMINISTRATION: WHAT TO EXPECT?</p><p>Trump is likely to focus primarily on the security aspects.</p><p>Fiji and Papua New Guinea had become the main beneficiaries of the Biden administration's strategy over the past two years, with landmark defence and security agreements.</p><p>Increased economic ties between Papua New Guinea and China will loom large over any potential US disengagement or trade sanctions. The Trump administration can be expected to honour previous agreements, so as not to create loopholes for potential Chinese security-related engagement.</p><p>But the new administration must also be mindful of the growing discontent over the use of the Pacific as a strategic theatre for the US and China.</p><p>Pacific Island leaders have voiced concerns about ongoing intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) testing in the Pacific, complaining about an American ICBM test in November that flew over the Marshall Islands and a Chinese ICBM test in the South Pacific in September.</p><p>PIF Secretary General Baron Waqa recently said: \"Geopolitical manoeuvring mean nothing to Pacific peoples who have cyclones on the horizon [and] are focused on building resilience, peace and prosperity for our families, communities and nations.\" The three COFA nations may also come into focus again. Trump's first administration regarded the ability to use US military installations in these three island nations as an important part of his Indo-Pacific strategy. He hosted the leaders of the three countries at the White House in May 2019. This view of their \"usefulness\" to the US is likely to prevail.</p><p>However, a longstanding practice has been to allow citizens of the three COFA states to live and work in the United States and access federal benefits like food stamps and healthcare. This may be at odds with the proclaimed immigration agenda of the second Trump administration. A partial US revision of the COFA articles is unlikely to be acceptable to the three partner countries.</p><p>There is a strong possibility that the second Trump Administration will leave Biden's 14-member economic initiative IPEF. Fiji, being the only Pacific Islands member, will probably search for alternative trade agreements. CLIMATE ACTION THE BIGGEST OBSTACLE</p><p>The biggest obstacle to the relationship between the US and Pacific Island countries will be climate change, as their positions are diametrically opposed.</p><p>Trump is expected to withdraw from the Paris Agreement a second time and focus US energy policy on oil and gas.</p><p>Pacific Island countries have become leaders in the global fight against climate change, such as in two United Nations groups - the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS).</p><p>Tuvalu's prime minister has called on major polluters to make concrete commitments to phase out fossil fuel production. Current policies - leading to new coal, oil and gas projects - are a \"death sentence\", he insisted.</p><p>Samoa rallied UN member states to press for more progress on \"loss and damage finance\". And it was Vanuatu that brought about a landmark UN resolution, backed by 130 countries, on climate justice and countries' obligations to address climate change.</p><p>Under the second Trump administration, there will be difficult discussions at the UN between AOSIS, SIDS and the US. Expect also the Biden climate change package for Pacific Island countries to be reduced or scrapped. PRAGMATIC COOPERATION FOR A LOUDER VOICE</p><p>The second Trump administration will have to take into account that Pacific Island countries have become more pragmatic and have more options than in the past. Geopolitical wrangling has also meant that other donors, both governmental and non-governmental, are willing to step in.</p><p>PIF countries have shown that they can overcome some of their internal regional divisions, coordinate their positions and work with like-minded countries outside the Pacific. This pragmatic \"New Pacific Diplomacy\" has strengthened their climate voice in UN negotiations.</p><p>The geopolitical power competition has provided Pacific Island leaders the opportunity to leverage their unique position to advance some of their most pressing issues, climate emergency and infrastructure investment.</p><p>No doubt, they will use it in the next four years.

Adding to this dynamic is the geopolitical weight of the US itself.</p><p>Former US president Donald Trump, for example, threatened retaliation against nations that seek to undermine the dollar's supremacy, a posture that future US administrations could adopt as well.</p><p>For Malaysia, which values its strategic economic partnerships with both the West and East, the challenge will be to advocate for a multi-polar financial system while mitigating the risk of economic sanctions or backlash.</p><p>As Malaysia assumes Asean's chairmanship, it will be a key moment to advance the Global South's agenda in the evolving global landscape.</p><p>The Global South's influence is expected to grow, driven by demographic changes and economic development.</p><p>Yet, for Malaysia, leading this shift will require deft diplomacy \u00e2\u20ac\u201d balancing Asean centrality with Global South ambitions, engaging with BRICS without provoking Western ire, and navigating the difficult waters of de-dollarisation.</p><p>If Malaysia can strike this balance, it could emerge not only as a regional leader but also as a critical voice shaping the global order in the decades ahead.</p><p>In terms of global influence, the Global South is on the rise.</p><p>Over the next few decades, countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America are set to become key drivers of global growth, buoyed by demographic shifts and a burgeoning middle class.</p><p>Malaysia, with its strategic location in Southeast Asia, could play a key role in shaping this trajectory, helping to forge alliances that reshape global governance, trade and finance.</p><p>Whether advocating for climate justice or leading on new technological frontiers, Malaysia could push the Global South to leapfrog traditional development pathways and carve out a stronger position in global forums.</p><p>But with this potential come real challenges. The Global South is anything but a cohesive bloc \u00e2\u20ac\u201d different countries have different interests, and navigating these complexities will require deft diplomacy.</p><p>While Malaysia's ambitions in leading the Global South are clear, its ability to fully exert influence depends on managing its ties with the North. Many nations in the Global South, including Malaysia, remain economically intertwined with Western markets and investment flows.</p><p>There's also the ever-present spectre of climate change. Nations like Malaysia are vulnerable to environmental shocks and their ability to push for broader global reforms could be undermined by the economic fallout from climate disasters.</p><p>Nonetheless, if Malaysia can harness the energy of the Global South while maintaining its strategic ties with the West, it will be in a position to not only shape Asean's future but also influence the global agenda for years to come.</p><p>In a world where geopolitical realignments are reshuffling the deck, Malaysia's role in amplifying the voice of the Global South could be a game-changer.</p><p>With the Global South's influence set to increase, the next decade could see Malaysia and its fellow nations on the front lines of reshaping the rules of global engagement.</p><p>It's about finding the balance between opportunities and challenges, between advocating for equity and navigating economic dependencies.</p><p>And if Malaysia plays its cards right, it could emerge as a central player in a more inclusive, more dynamic global order.</p><p>The writer is an economist, adjunct lecturer at Universiti Teknologi Petronas, international relations analyst and a senior consultant with Global Asia Consulting.

The nays are 50. The Senate being equally divided, the vice-president votes in the affirmative and the Bill as amended is passed,\" Ms Harris declared to healthy applause and some enthusiastic whooping.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That legislation unleashed hundreds of billions of dollars into building clean energy and electric car capacity. Building on that with support for clean energy could be her biggest contribution if elected,\" said Dr Thomas, a visiting senior fellow at ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and former senior vice-president at the World Bank.</p><p>The act, aimed at investing in domestic energy production while promoting clean energy, was one of the largest investments in the American economy, energy security, and climate that Congress has made in the nation's history.</p><p>The steep divide that existed in the Senate that day to pass a landmark piece of legislation aimed at powering up the green technology sector in the US was emblematic of the fractious political landscape that still exists today on climate issues.</p><p>Among Democrats, 82 per cent see climate change as a critical threat, based on a 2023 Chicago Council Survey, compared to just 16 per cent of Republicans.</p><p>The election result will be revealed just days before key United Nations-led climate change negotiations at COP29 in Azerbaijan, which begins on Nov 11.</p><p>The outcome could have profound impacts on both the direction and success of those talks, and for the general direction of global action in the years to come, experts told CNA. The world is watching the US, one of the world's major oil and gas producers, and its policy decisions, closely.</p><p>\"The Harris campaign offers action on the climate front in sharp contrast to (Donald) Trump's climate denial. Choosing one over the other would have existential consequences,\" Dr Thomas said.</p><p>\"But it is fair to say that responding to global warming\u202fis not a priority in the elections. The clean growth agenda is not catching on fast enough as a winning political formula. This needs to change, most importantly in the US.\"</p><p>Yet, the impacts of climate change have been on full display in the US, with twin disasters providing a stark warning about the ongoing dangers of a heating planet at the eleventh hour ahead of the vote. SUPERCHARGED STORMS</p><p>Powerful hurricanes Helene and Milton made landfall in Florida within days of each other, killing over 256 people and causing tens of billions of dollars of damage across multiple states.</p><p>Scientists confirmed in the aftermath that climate change had supercharged these storms.</p><p>\"All aspects of this event were amplified by climate change to different degrees. We'll see more of the same as the world continues to warm,\" said Dr Ben Clarke, a researcher at Imperial College London.</p><p>Dr Clarke co-authored a report that found Helene's winds were 11 per cent stronger, and rainfall 10 per cent heavier, because of the warming climate.</p><p>Despite those findings, Mr Trump continued to express his ongoing scepticism of climate change, calling it \"one of the greatest frauds in history\", during a speech in Manhattan after the disaster.</p><p>\"Storms are getting stronger and stronger,\" President Joe Biden said at a briefing in North Carolina, while surveying damage from Helene.</p><p>\"Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis anymore. They must be brain dead if they do,\" he said.</p><p>Still, for observers, Ms Harris has failed to re-capture the image of being a strong advocate on climate issues throughout her period of campaigning to be president.</p><p>She made only a passing reference to her party's green agenda while being nominated as the Democratic presidential nominee in August.</p><p>In fact, debate or discourse about climate change, even as part of the IRA, has barely featured in either candidate's election campaign.</p><p>The IRA directs some US$400 billion toward clean energy initiatives, as part of the country's goal to achieve a net-zero carbon economy by 2050. This includes tax incentives, infrastructure funding and community support and projects to create up to 1 million new jobs by 2030.</p><p>Yet despite the vast sums of public funding already being allocated towards industries installing wind turbines and solar panels, building electric vehicles and assembling batteries, Ms Harris has appeared reluctant to lean into a pro-planet stance on the hustings.</p><p>That is in part due to fears of a public backlash against an overly green agenda perceived to threaten certain communities reliant on the fossil-fuel industry in key battleground states, and the powerful lobbyists behind the industries themselves, according to Dr Carolyn Kissane, the founding director of the SPS Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab and associate dean at the NYU Center for Global Affairs.</p><p>\"It's a very fine line in the United States for a politician when it comes to energy and climate,\" she said.</p><p>\"Harris is viewed more climate-forward and has historically been harder on big oil. However, as the nominee, it would be a mistake for her to come out as an ardent opponent of big oil and gas, because one, they are a very large lobby, and two, it's very scary for most Americans to imagine that their energy prices will be higher.</p><p>\"I think her campaign has to balance being an advocate for addressing climate change while not coming across as being very anti-hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon production in the United States,\" Dr Kissane said.</p><p>According to analysis by Open Secrets, an independent group tracking money in US politics, in 2022, the oil and gas industry spent approximately US$124.4 million on federal lobbying.</p><p>The industry's combined lobbying, political contributions and advertising efforts to oppose climate change legislation outspent climate advocacy groups by 27 to 1 between 2008 and 2018, the Pennsylvania Capital-Star news site has found. A \"RED STATE\" BOON</p><p>Mr Trump meanwhile has continued to promote US dominance in fossil fuel production, namely oil and gas, even pledging to revive the limping coal industry. He has positioned himself as a strong opponent of current climate policies, threatening to repeal the IRA, which he described as a \"green new scam\" if he is elected.</p><p>Dr Kissane said that would be unlikely, given that much funding has been directed to \"red states\" typically controlled by the Republican party.</p><p>\"These are states that generally have a lot of land and then they are very ripe for energy production. So there's actually been general political support for the IRA. However, like many large pieces of legislation in the United States, it's also been politicised,\" she said.</p><p>\"He uses the very strong rhetoric of being hard on renewables and soft on oil, gas and coal ... and we're going to make it harder for China to get its renewable energy technologies - solar panels, wind technology, batteries, electric vehicles - into the United States.\"</p><p>Following the devastation of the hurricanes, Mr Trump appeared at fundraising events in Texas organised by fossil-fuel industry leaders.</p><p>As president from 2017 to 2021, he pulled out of the Paris Agreement. During his campaigning for this year's presidential race, he has repeatedly said he plans to withdraw again, recently on Oct 20, when he described the agreement as a \"ridiculous one-sided deal\", as quoted by NBC news.</p><p>The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change that came out of 2015's COP21. The US officially rejoined the accord under Mr Biden.</p><p>However, analysis from Rystad Energy, an independent energy research and business intelligence firm, found that both the domestic renewable energy and cleantech sectors \"will continue to thrive, even in the event of a Republican victory\".</p><p>Cleantech refers to companies and technologies that aim to improve environmental sustainability.</p><p>It noted a surge in job creation in key conservative states such as Florida, Texas, Iowa and Oklahoma, on the back of substantial investments in manufacturing and other infrastructure.</p><p>By 2030, these states will account for 57 per cent of all US battery cell manufacturing capacity, 59 per cent of solar PV cell and module production, 95 per cent of all hydrogen production capacity and 83 per cent of carbon capture capacity, the analysis found, cementing these parts of the country as powerhouse regions for clean energy.</p><p>\"Cleantech is increasingly becoming a bipartisan success story in the US,\" Mr Lars Nitter Havro, head of Energy Macro Research at Rystad Energy said in a statement.</p><p>The analysis found that investments in clean technologies were consistent and healthy throughout Mr Trump's previous presidency, suggesting that prevailing economic conditions could have more influence than White House policy.</p><p>\"These sectors are poised to continue expanding, whether we see a red or blue outcome in November,\" Mr Havro said.</p><p>But the Trump administration could look to reduce environmental regulations and streamline permissions for new fossil fuel projects, Rystad Energy reported, which could hamper the country's overall climate and decarbonisation goals. \"FALSE SOLUTIONS\" AND COMPROMISED PATHWAYS</p><p>If investments were repealed under a Trump presidency, it would be a \"disaster for good projects just getting off the ground\", said Ms Allie Rosenbluth, the US campaign manager for Oil Change, a nonprofit organisation dedicated to addressing the environmental and social impacts of fossil fuels.</p><p>But she was also critical of some parts of the IRA itself, including subsidies for \"false solutions\" including carbon capture and storage and fossil-based hydrogen that are built into the legislation and \"concerned by the backtracking we've seen on the campaign trail, especially Harris's support of fracking\".</p><p>Ms Harris, who had previously urged a fracking ban, has confirmed she will not ban the extraction technique if she wins the White House.</p><p>Even with the IRA in place, the US has continued to expand its oil and gas production, which has reached record highs under President Joe Biden. It means the country will fall short of its climate goals without even more drastic emission reduction measures.</p><p>Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific project that tracks government action on reducing greenhouse emissions, rates the US climate targets, action and climate finance as \"insufficient\" to a pathway where global temperatures are kept within 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The country has achieved about one-third of its 2030 emissions reduction target, but prolonged reliance on fossil fuels is comprising its green transition, the tracker states.</p><p>\"The US has a long way to go to become the climate leader the world needs. It's the largest producer of oil and gas in human history and it plans to expand fossil fuels far beyond what's compatible with a liveable climate,\" Ms Rosenbluth said.</p><p>\"The world is watching.\" AMERICAON THE GLOBAL STAGE</p><p>The election being held so close to COP29 in Baku puts more focus on American leadership on the global stage at a critical moment, experts agreed.</p><p>Ms Harris represented the Biden administration in the president's absence at last year's summit in Dubai and would be expected to maintain policy continuity if elected.</p><p>Mr Trump has not attended such talks.</p><p>The Baku summit has been dubbed a \"finance COP\" where momentum could be gathered to mobilise the enormous amounts of climate-linked public and private funds needed around the world.</p><p>The US is central to designing and controlling multiple financial mechanisms. For example, the American-led World Bank is the holder and trustee of the Loss and Damage Fund, which was set up last year to assist developing countries impacted by climate change.</p><p>If it was to largely step away from the multilateral process, as Mr Trump has been wont to do in the past, it could ease the pressure on others to act and contribute.</p><p>The US typically holds great influence over the multilateral climate negotiating process, and its economic might is a powerful driver of investments in clean energy infrastructure and innovation.</p><p>US-China relations are an important bellwether for global progress and will again be tested under new leadership in Washington.</p><p>\"Cooperation between the two countries plays an important role in spurring other countries to step up their climate action,\" said Ms Erica Downs, a senior research scholar at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University.</p><p>She added that US policy has been increasingly directed to even the playing field related to key decarbonisation technologies and reel in China's dominance in producing them, including electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels, noting that happened under both Democrat president Joe Biden and Mr Trump.</p><p>\"I expect that a Harris administration would continue the efforts of the Biden Administration to look for ways the US and China can work together bilaterally and multilaterally to address climate change,\" Ms Downs said.</p><p>She added that the main barriers to better climate cooperation are the \"geopolitical tensions\" that have resulted from competition in those clean energy supply chains.</p><p>\"The US wants to provide some protection to US clean energy industries while they are being developed via tariffs. Allowing Chinese companies in these industries to wipe out their US competitors is not an option,\" she said.</p><p>But she says she sees China working towards its 2030 carbon peaking and 2060 carbon neutrality goals regardless of US policy shifts in key areas.</p><p>\"Intense work and financing need to be deployed now. There is no time to waste. It is this reality where a Harris administration stands in stark contrast to Trump. This is where the US would give global leadership,\" Dr Thomas said.</p><p>\"Put simply, the climate stance of America's leadership this decade will shape the chances for a liveable planet.\" INITIAL: jb(ao)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-4706991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DBF-XTT1-JCDN-13Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2350\"/><timeReceived>6:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Ms Carla Denyer, co-leader of the left-wing Green Party, said it has been \"very concerning how little\" the issue of climate change has come up in the election.</p><p>\"The decisions the UK government makes over the next five years will be absolutely pivotal in the direction the UK takes, and whether we manage to decarbonise - not only whether we managed to meet our targets in terms of dates, but if we manage to do it in a way that also makes this country fairer,\" Ms Denyer added.</p><p>\"When you have got the cost-of-living crisis, you've got underfunding in the NHS (National Health Service) and schools, universal basic income and everything else - has that meant that actually, these incredibly important climate policies are starting to be almost forgotten about?</p><p>LETTER ON CLIMATE ACTION</p><p>Hundreds of UK-based scientists and academics have signed a letter urging all parties to make ambitious pledges on climate action. They warned that a failure to act would make the UK and the rest of the world more dangerous and insecure.</p><p>Among these scientists was Dr Alix Dietzel, who rejects the idea that green policies should be put on the backburner when money is tight.</p><p>\"You can always say things are unaffordable if you're putting the money elsewhere,\" said the senior lecturer in climate justice at the University of Bristol.</p><p>\"I think it's more unaffordable to not be ambitious because long-term, it's going to affect GDP (gross domestic product) across the world, including in the UK and it's going to make us poorer overall,\" she added. COSTS TO CONSUMERS</p><p>The issue of costs to consumers was why the Conservatives pushed back the ban of the sale of new petrol and diesel cars.</p><p>Both Labour and the Conservatives say they will be able to hit the UK's current target of reaching net zero by 2050.</p><p>On the other hand, the Liberal Democrats say more action is needed so that the target can be hit by 2045. The Greens want to get there by 2040 at the latest, promising to spend US$50 billion a year to do so.</p><p>The centrepiece of the Labour Party's renewables policy is a new publicly owned Great British Energy Company to invest in clean energy sources.</p><p>The Conservatives are pledging to treble offshore wind capacity and fast-track small nuclear power stations.</p><p>Polls suggest that the environment is one of the top concerns among voters - some of whom told CNA about their concerns.</p><p>\"I've moved from voting Labour to voting Green Party because I think that the environment's a really important policy that we need to be thinking of when voting,\" said one voter.</p><p>Another questioned the source of funds to support a green agenda.</p><p>\"On the one extreme, you've got the Green Party (which) understandably is making a lot of promises and expectations. But it comes with a very, very high cost,\" he added.

Their unwavering commitment to safeguarding lives and promoting the well-being of women and newborns is nothing short of heroic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indispensable in routine healthcare, midwives are evermore important during emergencies.</p><p>Amidst increasingly frequent natural disasters across Asia and the Pacific, midwives stand as lifelines, ensuring safe childbirth and maternal well-being for millions of women. In the face of adversity, they ensure health services are more accessible and can quickly reach women in need. In low resource settings, midwives as frontline workers often serve as the only source of help for a woman to give birth safely.</p><p>Consider the story of Shakila, a midwife serving in a remote village in Bangladesh prone to major flooding. Despite the looming threat of disasters, Shakila remains steadfast in her mission to help mothers and babies in her community. When non-stop rain caused flooding in her village, the maternity ward, pharmacy, and storage room were submerged by water. She still continued to deliver babies, without electricity, even supporting emergency cesarean sections as needed with the doctors on call. During disasters, Shakila is a beacon of hope, offering critical assistance to women in labor despite the chaos and destruction. Through her resilience and resourcefulness, she embodies the spirit of midwifery, serving in the most challenging of circumstances.</p><p>Wading through water or the rubble of earthquakes, midwives save lives. Standing by the side of a woman before, during, and after childbirth, midwives offer critical support and provide life-saving care during complicated deliveries. They can help prevent fistula by identifying and managing prolonged or obstructed labor promptly, and promoting timely access to emergency obstetric care when needed. Midwives also provide essential sexual and reproductive health services and information, including family planning, and often serve as the sole healthcare provider for women and girls in hard-to-reach communities. In fact, in any given setting, skilled midwives can provide 90 per cent of all essential sexual, reproductive, maternal and newborn health services.</p><p>Recognising the lifesaving role of midwives is not just a moral imperative; research suggests that facilitating universal access to midwives is a strategic investment that represents the most effective and cost-efficient solution to end preventable maternal and newborn deaths.</p><p>Yet, there is a global shortage of close to 1 million midwives, including a shortage of 200,000 midwives in the Asia and Pacific region - a reflection of the systemic undervaluation of their critical role in healthcare.</p><p>With 66,000 women dying in pregnancy or childbirth every year across Asia and the Pacific, the need for more trained and qualified midwives is crucial. By closing the deficit in the number of midwives, the world could prevent two thirds of maternal and newborn deaths, saving millions of lives, especially in the face of climate disasters.</p><p>The evidence is clear. Investing in midwifery is not just a matter of healthcare; it is a cornerstone of climate and disaster adaptation and resilience. By strengthening midwifery education, training, and support systems, governments and stakeholders can bolster the resilience of communities facing the impacts of climate change. Equipped with the knowledge and skills to navigate emergencies, midwives can ensure continuity of care even in the most challenging of circumstances, saving lives and mitigating the impact of disasters on maternal and newborn health.</p><p>Midwives also serve as advocates for climate justice, highlighting the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on women and girls. By amplifying the voices of midwives, we can advance gender-responsive approaches to climate adaptation and resilience, ensuring that the needs and rights of women are central to our efforts to build a sustainable future.</p><p>As we confront the realities of a changing climate, let us pay tribute to the pivotal role of midwives in safeguarding the health and well-being of communities across Asia and the Pacific, and beyond. On this International Day of Midwives, we urge for increased recognition of their contribution to society and greater investments in their education, deployment and empowerment as we celebrate their achievements. For in the hands of midwives lies the power to build a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable future for all.</p><p>* Opinion-Editorial by Mr. Pio Smith, UNFPA Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific on the International Day of the Midwife 2024</p><p>The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is an agency under the UN that aims to deliver a world where every pregnancy is wanted, every childbirth is safe and every young person's potential is fulfilled.</p><p>To find out more log onto: <url normalizedValue=\"https://asiapacific.unfpa.org/en\">https://asiapacific.unfpa.org/en</url></p><p>** This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of Malay Mail.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

More than US$400 million has been pledged collectively from sources including COP host, the United Arab Emirates, the European Union and the United Kingdom.</p><p>But exactly who would receive the assistance, when it would be delivered and in what form remain key questions. How the funds would be replenished over a proposed four-year cycle has also not been addressed.</p><p>These uncertainties leave communities and organisations in Southeast Asia that have pushed for a focus on loss and damage wary. \"Actually we have a mixed reaction about the adoption of this, but still we are very thankful because loss and damage is moving forward. We can say that indigenous peoples are not totally left behind,\" said Mr Nicky Batang-ay, a member of the climate and biodiversity programme at Tebtebba Foundation, a Philippines-based indigenous rights group.</p><p>The agreed text makes clear that indigenous peoples have the right to be active observers of the fund's board meetings and to directly access finances through a small grants programme.</p><p>How the World Bank can operationalise funds directly to such groups, though, remains unclear.</p><p>\"I don't have full faith in these things,\" said Mr Muhammad Arman from the Indigenous Peoples' Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN), an Indonesian organisation.</p><p>Without clearer mandates for climate mitigation and the end to extractive activities in indigenous domains, sending more money would not amount to much, he said.</p><p>\"The analogy I use is that the right hand might be doing something good ... while the left hand continues to do bad things,\" he said.</p><p>Ms Alexandra Matei, the Asia regional advocacy advisor for CARE, a humanitarian agency, said the loss and damage fund \"must not remain an empty promise\".</p><p>While a landmark day for climate justice, the agreement has many shortcomings, she said. \"It enables historical emitters to evade their responsibility. It also fails to establish the scale of finance needed and ensure that the fund is anchored in human rights principles,\" she added. The United States, the biggest carbon emitter in history, pledged US$17.5 million and insists contributions should be on a voluntary basis.</p><p>The sums pledged so far are purely \"symbolic\" and just a fraction of what is actually needed to make a difference to communities already facing extreme weather and suffering intangible losses of culture and heritage, according to Dr Aditi Mukherji, director of the Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Impact Action Platform at CGIAR, the world's largest global agricultural innovation network.</p><p>\"One of the fears is that it does remain a symbolic fund,\" she said. \"Or does it rise up to the actual challenge that there is with climate justice at the heart of it?\"</p><p>Scientific research has become a powerful tool for communities to be able to prove that climate change had caused certain events and to be able to quantify many of the losses suffered, she said.</p><p>But there is still a lack of it, including for Asia, hindering communities' ability to seek redress.</p><p>Helping developing countries most impacted by climate change is more urgent than ever. A 2022 report by the Climate Vulnerable Forum found that 20 per cent of the wealth of the most vulnerable nations in the world, including the Philippines, Vietnam, Timor-Leste and Cambodia, has been eliminated because of climate change over the last two decades.</p><p>Ms Lien Vandamme, a senior campaigner at the Center for International Environment Law (CIEL), said wealthy nations had failed for years to take the appropriate actions to prevent such harm to their poorer counterparts.</p><p>She argued that the fund, as it has been designed and agreed upon so far, will not redress climate harm. In fact, she said it is far from what impacted communities have been asking for and what developed nations are obligated to do under international law.</p><p>\"There are many limitations to what was agreed. I would just consider this a small step,\" she said.</p><p>\"As long as there's not hundreds of billions of dollars flowing through the fund, that affected communities aren't in the driver's seat and that there aren't policies in place to ensure that the funds in all respects promote and protect human rights, we cannot really call this a major success,\" she said.

No one is setting the ambitious target needed to handle the climate crisis,\" Mr Leonard Simanjuntak, the Indonesia director of environmental group Greenpeace, told CNA.</p><p>Besides being out of line with efforts to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, some plans announced by the candidates may, in fact, do more harm than good to the environment, experts said.</p><p>Under Mr Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, Indonesia has pledged to cut its emissions by nearly 32 per cent on its own, or by 43.2 per cent with international support by 2030. These targets, announced in 2022, are slightly higher than its earlier Paris Agreement pledge.</p><p>Indonesia has also pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2060 or earlier, which means it will absorb as much carbon as it emits. It plans to do so by retiring all its coal-fired power plants by 2050 and deploying more clean energy sources like solar farms and wind turbines. The country - Southeast Asia's largest economy and the world's largest coal exporter - currently derives 57 per cent of its energy from coal, which is the dirtiest fossil fuel. Indonesia's energy sector emitted 600 million tonnes of carbon-dioxide in 2021.</p><p>How Mr Widodo's successor continues to steer Indonesia's energy transition will have a far-reaching impact.</p><p>REACHING NET-ZERO</p><p>All three candidates - former Jakarta governor Anies Baswedan, defence minister Prabowo Subianto and former Central Java governor Ganjar Pranowo - have said they will remain committed to the goals set by Jokowi if they become Indonesia's next president. However, their plans to achieve these goals differ.</p><p>Mr Anies and his vice-presidential running mate Muhaimin Iskandar plan to closely monitor the carbon emitted by factories, smelters and power plants. They have pledged to retire coal power plants, especially those in Java and Bali, early.</p><p>Although they have promised to increase the share of renewables in Indonesia's energy mix, they have not specified a target. Indonesia's current goal is for renewables to make up 23 per cent of its electricity mix by 2025, up from 14 per cent in 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.</p><p>They have also promised incentives to encourage communities to participate in clean electricity generation, which could be on-grid or off-grid.</p><p>Their two rival teams have also announced net-zero targets.</p><p>In addition, Mr Ganjar Pranowo and his vice-presidential pick, Mr Mahfud MD, have set a target for renewables in Indonesia's energy mix - 30 per cent by 2029. The Ganjar-Mahfud plan to achieve this involves thousands of \"energy self-reliant villages\" across Indonesia. These villages will generate their electricity solely or partially from the sources available in their regions, which could range from geothermal and solar, to natural gas and hydropower.</p><p>Although some climate activists agree with a focus on community-based clean energy programmes over large-scale projects, Mr Leonard said the Ganjar-Mahfud team's \"energy self-reliant villages\" plan is, in itself, not enough to get Indonesia to net-zero.</p><p>\"The big consumers of electricity are in the big cities,\" he said. \"We need a more ambitious strategy because we are heading to a climate catastrophe.\" SOVEREIGNTY THE FOCUS FOR PRABOWO-GIBRAN</p><p>Mr Prabowo Subianto and his running mate, Mr Gibran Rakabuming Raka, have affirmed climate targets made under Jokowi's administration, including early retirement of coal power plants.</p><p>The pair's climate and environment proposals are generally focused on Indonesia's sovereignty, such as self-sufficiency in energy, food and water. They believe Indonesia has the potential to become the world's \"superpower\" in biofuels and renewable energy.</p><p>\"By increasing our biofuel production, we can reduce (oil) imports, increase the production of our palm oil and it is more environmentally friendly,\" Mr Gibran said on Jan 21 during a vice-presidential debate on environment, energy and food security.</p><p>The pair also want to promote the use of bioplastics, which are made from biomass sources like vegetable oils and fats. Bioplastics have been touted as an eco-friendly substitute for plastic, but experts caution they are not a real solution as they can be composted only in carefully controlled conditions. If bioplastics end up in landfills, they could cause environmental harm, as plastics do. Boosting Indonesia's biofuel production could also mean more deforestation, benefiting big palm oil companies at the expense of the environment, noted Mr Anggi Putra Prayoga, a campaign manager at Forest Watch Indonesia.</p><p>\"(The plan) will harm Indonesia's natural forests,\" Mr Anggi told CNA. Indonesia produced 18.4 million tonnes of palm oil in 2022, according to the Indonesian Palm Oil Association (GAPKI), 47 per cent of which was used to produce biodiesel.</p><p>Meanwhile, Indonesia's fuel consumption was 69.7 million tonnes in 2022, which means millions of hectares of forests would have to be converted into oil palm plantations if the country wishes to boost its biofuel output.</p><p>The country is already the world's largest producer of palm oil and, according to the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture, has 16.8 million hectares of land used for oil palm cultivation.</p><p>Although there has been a downward trend in deforestation since 2018, Indonesia is still losing about 100,000 ha of forest and peatland a year, GreenpeaceIndonesia recently noted. Indonesia has the world's third-largest area of rainforest, after the Amazon and Africa's Congo Basin, which is home to many threatened plants and animals.</p><p>The current government's plan is for Indonesia's forestry sector to be a carbon sink absorbing more carbon than it releases by 2030. But in an analysis released in December, GreenpeaceIndonesia found that in areas already allocated for industrial uses, tens of millions of hectares of natural forest are at risk because of the lack of strict regulations to protect them. DOWNSIDES TO DOWNSTREAMING</p><p>Both the Prabowo-Gibran and Ganjar-Mahfud tickets have promised to continue the country's drive to be a key player in the production of batteries for electric vehicles.</p><p>Indonesia holds the world's largest nickel reserve with an estimated 21 million tonnes and Jokowi has been ramping up the mining and processing of nickel ore during his tenure to meet global demand.</p><p>Both pairs have promised to expand Jokowi's downstreaming policy, processing minerals at home rather than exporting them in their raw form, to other sectors.</p><p>But activists note that Jokowi's downstreaming policy has led to the establishment of dozens of coal-fired power plants to feed power-hungry smelters and mining operations, not to mention widespread deforestation and pollution.</p><p>\"Downstreaming is producing carbon on a massive scale,\" said Mr Fanny Tri Jambore, a campaign manager at the non-profit group, Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi).</p><p>The Anies-Muhaimin team, on the other hand, has promised to balance economic development and environmental protection in its manifesto. They pledged to bring \"climate justice\" by protecting vulnerable but underdeveloped communities against the impacts of climate change.</p><p>But they have provided no further details on turning this idea into actionable policies, activists said.</p><p>Mr Leonard of Greenpeace said Indonesia needs a leader who can deliver on promises to tackle climate change.</p><p>\"The world is watching whether Indonesia can meet its own goals delivered during COP, particularly as so many countries are providing or promising grants and loans for Indonesia to meet those goals,\" he said, referring to the annual climate talks called Conference of the Parties that review how nations are implementing their targets.</p><p>Under the Just Energy Transition Partnership, nine countries - members of the Group of Seven (G7) plus Denmark and Norway - have pledged to lend US$20 billion for Indonesia's decarbonisation efforts.</p><p>\"We need (Indonesia's next leader) to have more ambitious and concrete plans on environmental protection and transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy. We need more than rhetoric,\" said Mr Leonard.

Discuss\" is a question one would expect in a law exam. But it is also one that the 17 top judges of the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg, France, are being asked by young climate activists. Governments beware, especially the 32 European Union (EU) countries, which are being dragged to court. For the governments of other countries, the Strasbourg court's decision for the young climate activists may well pave the way for others to seek justice through legal avenues. It is very clear that most governments are dithering when it comes to taking action to arrest climate change, but are the courts the best place to stop the Earth from heating up? Obviously not the best, but certainly a good one. Climate activists have had some success, especially against private entities. Again Europe stands out as an exemplar of climate justice. In one case there, a major oil company was ordered to revise its net-zero target after activists challenged it in court. Expectedly, the company is appealing the decision, but that is beside the point.</p><p>The real point is green is eating away at greed, though only slowly. Even Latin America is doing good against \"Big Oil despoilers\" as they are labelled by climate activists. There in April 2019, Ecuador women activists managed to get their government to revoke a drilling permit that would have destroyed a million acres of pristine forest. Africa, despite being mired with corrupt governments, is setting a precedent. In September last year, South African climate activists managed to get a court order to revoke a permit that would have allowed a big oil firm to drill farms and fishing grounds of indigenous people out of existence. Other Latin American and African countries are facing similar cases. The activists' message is this: See you in court.</p><p>While the legal challenge in non-European courts are based on livelihoods, lives and limbs, in Europe, it is more about human rights. At least the challenge mounted in Strasbourg is, based on the European Convention on Human Rights Articles 2 and 8, which grant rights to life and respect for private life. According to Euronews, the climate activists' lawyers, which it quotes, will argue that the 32 governments \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 27 EU nations and Russia, Turkiye, Switzerland, Norway and Britain \u00e2\u20ac\u201d are breaching their clients' rights to be free from torture and inhuman and degrading treatment, which were included in the judges' recommendation. Obviously, this will be challenged. The ECHR doesn't enshrine any right to a healthy environment as such. This may work against the six young climate activists. But the court is treating the case as important as it has appointed its top judges to hear it. Also, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe is on the side of the activists. This is certainly not the first climate case for the Strasbourg court. In March, several Swiss women and a former French mayor also sued their governments for dithering over climate action. But no decision has been made. A decision for the plaintiffs will be a positive outcome that will make legal history. So will the six young climate activists' case against the 32 governments, which is in itself a histrionic move. To delay and dither may spell adverse legal weather for governments.</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699C-9MB1-JC85-G0PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 1, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Main Section</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>Civil Rights Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURDOUM5MEJFQUZGNEFBMDgzMkM0RTgwODdDNTMxREM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>Protected Rights</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTgyRjY1MEEwMzdFNDAwQkIwMzFGMjc4ODIxQ0YxQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDI2NTNCOTkwRTE0NEU0OUE5NTgxOEIyQThGRDY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Court Personnel</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODYzN0QyMzhDNDkyNDJDNTlGNkZBQzQzQTkzRjI0NzQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CQ</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION COURTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921100GM</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000873</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009J49</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS &amp;

It is a moment to reflect, recommit, and rejuvenate the spirit of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam', 'One Earth, One Family, One Future'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we undertook this responsibility last year, the global landscape grappled with multifaceted challenges: recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, looming climate threats, financial instability, and debt distress in developing nations, all amid declining multilateralism. In the midst of conflicts and competition, development cooperation suffered, impeding progress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Assuming the G20 Chair, India sought to offer the world an alternative to status quo, a shift from a GDP-centric to human-centric progress. India aimed to remind the world of what unites us, rather than what divides us. Finally, the global conversation had to evolve \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the interests of the few had to give way to the aspirations of the many. This required a fundamental reform of multilateralism as we knew it.</p><p>Inclusive, ambitious, action-oriented, and decisive \u00e2\u20ac\u201d these four words defined our approach as G20 president, and the New Delhi Leaders'\u00c2\u00a0 Declaration, unanimously adopted by all G20 members, is testimony to our commitment to deliver on these principles.\u00c2\u00a0</p><p>Inclusivity has been at the heart of our presidency. The inclusion of the African Union as a permanent member of the G20 integrated 55 African nations into the forum, expanding it to encompass 80 per cent of the global population. This proactive stance has fostered a more comprehensive dialogue on global challenges and opportunities.</p><p>The first-of-its-kind 'Voice of the Global South Summit', convened by India in two editions, heralded a new dawn of multilateralism. India mainstreamed the Global South's concerns in international discourse and has ushered in an era where developing countries take their rightful place in shaping the global narrative.</p><p>Inclusivity also infused India's domestic approach to G20, making it a People's Presidency that befits that world's largest democracy. Through \"Jan Bhagidari\" (people's participation) events, G20 reached 1.4 billion citizens, involving all states and Union Territories as partners. And on substantive elements, India ensured that international attention was directed to broader developmental aims, aligning with G20's mandate.</p><p>At the critical midpoint of the 2030 Agenda, India delivered the G20 2023 Action Plan to Accelerate Progress on the Sustainable Development Goals, taking a cross-cutting, action-oriented approach to interconnected issues, including health, education, gender equality and environmental sustainability.</p><p>A key area driving this progress is robust Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI). Here, India was decisive in its recommendations, having witnessed the revolutionary impact of digital innovations like Aadhaar, UPI, and Digilocker first-hand. Through G20, we successfully completed the Digital Public Infrastructure Repository, a significant stride in global technological collaboration. This repository, featuring over 50 DPIs from 16 countries, will help the Global South build, adopt, and scale DPI to unlock the power of inclusive growth.</p><p>For our One Earth, we introduced ambitious and inclusive aims to create urgent, lasting, and equitable change. The Declaration's 'Green Development Pact' addresses the challenges of choosing between combating hunger and protecting the planet, by outlining a comprehensive roadmap where employment and ecosystems are complimentary, consumption is climate conscious, and production is planet-friendly. In tandem, the G20 Declaration calls for an ambitious tripling of global renewable energy capacity by 2030. Coupled with the establishment of the Global Biofuels Alliance and a concerted push for Green Hydrogen, the G20's ambition to build a cleaner, greener world is undeniable.</p><p>This has always been India's ethos, and through Lifestyles for Sustainable Development, the world can benefit from our age-old sustainable traditions.</p><p>Further, the Declaration underscores our commitment to climate justice and equity, urging substantial financial and technological support from the Global North. For the first time, there was a recognition of the quantum jump needed in the magnitude of development financing, moving from billions to trillions of dollars. G20 acknowledged that developing countries require US$5.9 trillion to fulfil their Nationally Determined Contributions by 2030.</p><p>Given the monumental resources required, G20 emphasised the importance of better, larger, and more effective Multilateral Development Banks. Concurrently, India is taking a leading role in UN reforms, especially in the restructuring of principal organs like the UN Security Council, that will ensure a more equitable global order.</p><p>Gender equality took centre stage in the Declaration, culminating in the formation of a dedicated Working Group on the Empowerment of Women next year. India's Women's Reservation Bill 2023, reserving one-third of India's Parliament and state legislative assembly seats for women, epitomises our commitment to women-led development.</p><p>The New Delhi Declaration embodies a renewed spirit of collaboration across these key priorities, focusing on policy coherence, reliable trade, and ambitious climate action.

Ethnic cleansing, collective punishment, apartheid, sexual violence as a tool of state terror, and the deliberate targeting of health-care facilities and workers are part of multiple ongoing conflicts in 2023. The unprovoked Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, civil conflicts underway in Tigray in Ethiopia, Sudan, Myanmar, and Syria, the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and the Saudi- led coalition's bombardment of Yemen, all have in common violations of the rules of conduct in war-specifically, attacks on civilians, health-care workers, health-care facilities, and infrastructure and other violations of medical neutrality. These attacks are also violations of the right to health; through the denial of health-care access, they undermine the principle of dignity and the equal value of all human lives.</p><p>Armed conflict is an extreme domain of human rights abuses, but is only one of many settings in which human rights violations are taking place. Other concerns that undermine the right to health include the deliberate degradation of our environments and the climate for short-term profit and the widespread use of disinformation and misinformation that adversely affects people's rights to benefit from scientific progress. Disinformation related to the safety and efficacy of vaccines has led to multiple disease outbreaks and to losses of life during the Covid-19 pandemic. Political and legal attacks on the rights of sexual and gender minorities, and on the rights of women, undermine the universality of human rights and are occurring in countries as diverse as Iran, Russia, Uganda, and the USA. Indeed, in his opening address to the 53rd Council of the UN Human Rights Council in June, 2023, Volker Turk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, reaffirmed the centrality of the UDHR for our deeply troubled times precisely because of its core principle of universality.</p><p>The global community backs away from the universality of human rights at its collective peril. In 1948, the UDHR was crafted in the wake of the Nazi persecutions of Jewish people, Roma, LGBT persons, individuals with disabilities, and others deemed unfit to live by the Nazi regime.6 The relevance of the UDHR was also clear in the decades that followed World War 2, notably in the struggle against the avowedly racist apartheid regime in South Africa, which was also a struggle to realise universal rights. Equality for all must be upheld as a guiding principle for all our societies. The responsibility to protect rights cannot be left to our current political systems and human rights bodies, including the UN, because they are manifestly failing to do so in many places.</p><p>How relevant, then, is the human rights framework to health in these troubled times? How can the global health community press for universal health coverage, committed to by heads of states at the 79th Session of the UN General Assembly in September, 2023, when we see so many millions of people denied the most basic health services, including the substantial numbers of internally displaced people and refugees? And what are the possible roles and potential actions health-care workers can undertake to address these threats?</p><p>First, the tools of population-based sciences need to be used more intensively and routinely to document and measure human rights abuses; this information can be used to hold governments and other actors to account. These tools, exemplified by the use of novel satellite technologies and video surveillance in the documentation of Russian atrocities in Bakhmut and other cities in Ukraine, hold great promise for accountability for war crimes. Second, health-care workers must put human rights at the forefront of our work and become much more engaged in efforts to protect the rights of those we seek to serve. This is a pressing reality for many obstetric care providers in US states, for example, where multiple restrictions on reproductive and sexual health and rights have adversely affected the practice of medicine, endangered patients' lives, and put health-care providers in legal jeopardy for providing essential care.Third, medicine and health care must be a more active participant in advocacy for health-care access as a human right in all societies. No one should be denied health-care access by virtue of legal or immigration status-yet multiple health systems do just this, and providers must not be complicit in these denials of access to care. Fourth, common cause is needed with those advocating for inter-related rights, including the movement for addressing the climate crisis and for climate justice, anti-racist struggles, the LGBTQ+ rights movement, and the global movement for women's rights to bodily autonomy, choice, and freedom from sexual and gender-based violence, among others. Health- care workers have agency in these struggles and need to influence these social and political debates. Health-care workers cannot stay in our professional domains and expect others to address these crises.</p><p>To address the rising tide of human rights violations and their many and varied impacts on health, the International AIDS Society and The Lancet convened a multidisciplinary Commission on health and human rights in 2019.11 The Commission's report is expected to be released in early 2024. This report will aim to explore multiple domains of health and rights and will argue for a reinvigoration of the UDHR as a basis for protecting health in the 21st century.</p><p>Human rights protections are not optional, and they are not reserved for the fortunate few who are citizens of countries that now enjoy peace and prosperity. If we consider the climate crisis alone, our collective rights to enjoy a liveable and healthy environment are under existential threat. Young people worldwide know that their survival is at stake, and many have been organising and winning court cases based on their right to a liveable future. For those living under repressive regimes and trying to survive in the world's expanding zones of conflict and displacement, human rights have proven stubbornly cherished hopes for a better future. Health professionals must do everything we can to ensure that future and uphold human rights in protection of humanity's common survival.</p><p>*Adeeba Kamarulzaman and Chris Beyrer are the co-chairs and Allan Maleche is a Commissioner of the International AIDS Society- Lancet Commission on health and human rights; this Commission has been supported by the International AIDS Society and by the Desmond M Tutu Professorship at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Such mainstream thinking on climate change is most reflective of the perspective of the elite and corporations of the Global North. Developing countries of the Global South mistaking these solutions for their principal climate action may find themselves unprepared to face climate vulnerabilities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change might seem like a purely technical and scientific issue of reducing pollutants - greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide - that are presenting a threat to the environment and human life via global warming. Climate action often focuses on shifting our energy sources from fossil fuels to lower-impact alternatives such as renewable energies, and halting the loss of forests and other carbon sinks that absorb carbon dioxide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In reality, climate change is more complex. Rising global average temperatures are already causing extreme weather events such as floods, heat waves, droughts, and wildfires. These cause damage and loss to lives, livelihoods and property. Melting glaciers and sea ice lead to coastal erosion, sea level rise, storm surges, and breakdown of ocean circulation systems. Alongside efforts to stabilise the climate many communities will have to adapt to the climate changes that are already happening and will continue to happen for some time to come.</p><p>There is a third dimension of climate action that goes beyond physical causes and effects. Climate justice tackles the ethical and political distribution of responsibility for the climate crisis. Not all countries are equally responsible for causing climate change. But people who are genuinely concerned about the climate crisis sometimes assume Malaysia shoulders an equal burden to developed countries. Policies and climate action proposed based on this assumption risk being unjust if they lead to disproportionate burdens or fail to address our direct climate vulnerabilities.</p><p>Historical emissions matter because carbon dioxide persists in the atmosphere for thousands of years. Massive long-term emitters have the greatest impact on our climate. Just six nations are responsible for over 70 per cent of historical global greenhouse gas emissions. In descending order of magnitude these are the United States, the European Union, China, Russia, the UK, and Japan. Emission proportions are skewed even more to the North when we take into account China's huge population of nearly 1.4 billion, more than the other five combined. What share of global emissions is Malaysia responsible for? A mere 0.37 per cent as of 2020.</p><p>Under the United Nations' treaties, a country's responsibility and ability to address climate change is proportional to its emissions, technological and financial capability. Rapid big cuts by big emitters will stabilise the global climate more then big cuts by small emitters. Because the climate changes we are experiencing are primarily driven by global factors we need to cut emissions on a global scale in order to save Malaysia at the local level. Drastic cuts in Malaysia's own emissions will not be enough to move the needle because our emissions are comparatively small. Global factors complicate assumptions that cutting domestic emissions leads to direct reductions in domestic climate vulnerabilities.</p><p>If we want to save Malaysia from the ravages of climate change we need to link science to action that is appropriate to our circumstances.</p><p>The electric vehicle transition features prominently in Western media. Displacing Malaysia's dependence on single-occupancy fossil-fuelled cars in favour of greater public transportation and electric vehicles where appropriate would be an environmental good. But it will not stop the seas from rising, floods from worsening, and heatwaves bedevilling us because Malaysian emissions are comparatively low.</p><p>Shifting our electricity fuel mix rapidly away from coal towards renewables is environmentally desirable, but how do we ensure rising costs of electricity production don't punish the vast majority of households who are struggling with low wages, inflation, and pandemic recovery?</p><p>Mass deployment of electric vehicles, renewable energies, costly carbon capture and sequestration - the kind of solutions proposed to deliver deep cuts in the biggest polluting countries - are they appropriate for the likes of Malaysia, Egypt, Uzbekistan, Pakistan, and North Korea?</p><p>I mention the last five countries because they have emitted a comparable amount to Malaysia, though our development results have been considerably greater when considered in terms of gross national income. Malaysia's development gains have been relatively emissions efficient by comparison. Yet, we do not have anywhere near the same technological and financial capability as the 'Big Six' polluters who are also Great Powers of world diplomacy.</p><p>We need diplomatic pressure on the biggest global polluters to undertake deep cuts that will save all of us. Malaysia can't exert enough diplomatic pressure on its own, so we need to work en bloc with a critical mass of developing countries. This is a role from which Malaysia has exercised leadership in the past.</p><p>Nationally and locally, we should be focusing on climate adaptation measures: urban greening to tackle urban heatwaves, flood mitigation and better planning to minimise the impact of the great rains, mangrove restoration and engineering works to combat coastal erosion. These measures are not rocket science, we have the local expertise and technology to pull much of this off, unlike with energy transition measures. However, we need to tap into more national and international financing to bring these solutions online. It can be done. Think City in Penang has recently secured US$10 million (RM44 million) in climate adaptation financing to tackle heat and floods.</p><p>We must also conserve and expand our precious forests and coral ecosystems because the carbon they absorb allows the rest of our economy and society to keep down net emissions from using currently available energy resources - as much as 76 per cent in 2016. Selling the rights to these as carbon credits to international buyers effectively cedes our strategic development reserve to richer countries who should be cutting emissions at source with their technology and finance, not with our forests. Sustainably financing ecosystem conservation is a critical and neglected element in preserving our development policy space for future generations of Malaysians.</p><p>This is a month of national history where we look back into the past for inspiration. In order to prepare for the future we must recognise what is useful and appropriate for our national journey. In order to tackle the climate crisis we do need to cut emissions and respond to current and emerging impacts. But the biggest cuts in emissions need to happen outside of Malaysia - from the Big Six Great Polluters - and no one but ourselves will protect our communities and nature from the ravages of climate change. We will protect them best by pursuing climate justice internationally and upscaling adaptation measures locally. Our current national and corporate focus on net-zero emissions targets around 2050 and beyond do not address where either emissions and impacts are really happening. This ultimately implies a rethink of national climate strategy from the top down, combining strategic purpose with data and science, within a framework of climate justice.</p><p>* Yin Shao Loong is a senior research associate at the Khazanah Research Institute (KRI) where he focuses on climate change and industrial policy.

It urges countries to phase out fossil fuels, transition to renewable energy, improve air quality and protect biodiversity, among a list of recommendations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The extent and magnitude of the triple planetary crisis, comprising the climate emergency, the collapse of biodiversity and pervasive pollution, is an urgent and systemic threat to children's rights globally,\" the document read.</p><p>The committee received more than 16,000 submissions from children in 121 different countries to reach its conclusions, amid a wave of legal pushes from young people to hold their governments to account.</p><p>It stated that governments are responsible for ensuring the health of children now and as well as future generations.</p><p>\"States bear the responsibility for foreseeable environment-related threats arising as a result of their acts or omissions now, the full implications of which may not manifest for years or even decades,\" it read.</p><p>\"A clean, healthy and sustainable environment is both a human right itself and necessary for the full enjoyment of a broad range of children's rights. Conversely, environmental degradation, including the consequences of the climate crisis, adversely affects the enjoyment of these rights.\"</p><p>The comment outlines that states should provide access to justice pathways for children, remove barriers for children to initiate legal proceedings themselves and provide for collective complaints, such as class action suits and public interest litigation.</p><p>Dr Maria Antonia Tigre, a senior fellow in global climate litigation from the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University who was heavily involved in the Committee's deliberations, said the statement gives children the power to transform the way the world is responding to the climate crisis.</p><p>\"It really acknowledges this movement within climate litigation of so many cases that have been brought by children and youth and really shifts the narrative of them being these vulnerable groups that had no voice, no agency, to them actually being the agents of change,\" she told CNA.</p><p>A recent ruling in the US state of Montana in favour of 16 youths, who sued the state government for violating their right to a clean environment was the first success in what could prove a blueprint for other climate cases going forward.</p><p>Montana - the nation's fifth largest coal producer - has a provision in its constitution guaranteeing a right to a \"clean and healthful environment\". The group successfully argued that the state had violated the constitution and that climate change had played a role in harming their health, recreation and traditions.</p><p>It means that the state must now consider climate change when permitting energy projects, which could set a new legal precedent. \"I think we're really going to see a boom of cases,\" Dr Tigre said.A CONTENTIOUS PROPOSITION</p><p>The UN general comment supports a developing trend of growth in climate lawsuits around the world, especially in the Global South - a term used to group poor or least developed countries including many in the Southeast Asia region.</p><p>Globally, the number of climate change-linked legal cases has soared to 2,180 in 2022, up from 885 in 2017, according to data from the Sabin Center and the United Nations Environment Programme.</p><p>In China, the country's highest court in February issued a guidance that would encourage prosecutors to bring forward climate cases to pressure companies to follow environmental laws and help the nation reach its decarbonisation targets.</p><p>Despite this green light for the court to hear cases on a range of environmental matters, China - and most of the Asia region generally - is still lagging in bringing forward climate litigation.</p><p>Of the cases recorded across the world between 2017 and 2022, only a tiny fraction - 6.6 per cent - have originated in Asia, the highest in the region being 12 cases in Indonesia.</p><p>Last year, a high-profile case in the Philippines saw the country's Commission on Human Rights find that fossil fuel companies were accountable for climate damage.</p><p>It means that those companies - which the commission found knowingly contributed to climate change, \"a direct threat to the right to exist\" - could be found legally liable for climate disasters in the country.</p><p>While the Commission's decision is also not legally binding, it could set future civil liability in any action for loss and damage arising from climate change.</p><p>It was a rare success in what remains a sparse area of focus for law firms in the region.</p><p>Part of the reason could be a stigma - and lack of scientific data - that still hangs over climate change regionally. And for many governments, climate action and therefore litigation is seen as an impediment to economic development, experts say.</p><p>\"I think in Asia and Africa, mostly, the litigators prefer not to use that language of climate change specifically, because they feel like it might hurt their cases,\" Dr Tigre said.</p><p>Indeed, experts agree that launching climate litigation in Southeast Asia remains a contentious and problematic proposition for anyone, let alone children, to undertake.</p><p>\"What we're seeing now, is a lot of interest in trying to explore various pathways to hold governments and corporations accountable. But my sense is that you won't get an explosion of litigation in Southeast Asia,\" said Associate Professor Jolene Lin from the Faculty of Law at National University of Singapore, who is also director of its Asia Pacific Centre for Environmental Law.</p><p>\"Southeast Asia is not a monolithic region; every single country is slightly different in its legal conditions and the situation and the political context in which litigation will unfold.</p><p>\"By and large, climate litigation is seen as unfriendly to governments who think that they are being challenged to do more and be accountable for their failure to do so.\"</p><p>Yet, while the UN statement is not legally binding, it could further inform legal systems, national legislation and corporate behaviour, when it comes to environmental protection and children's rights, say experts.</p><p>\"It is a very encouraging development, because it opens up an additional potential pathway to bolster litigants' claims,\" Assoc Prof Lin said.</p><p>\"When we talk about the development of climate change litigation, it's important to recognise the improvement, or the creation, of additional support, like a scaffolding process. This adds to the scaffolding,\" she said.</p><p>These rulings from international organisations may not have binding effect but they are an important source of legal guidance, she explained.</p><p>\"States generally don't want to be seen as pariahs. So, they will want to at least be seen to abide by these guidelines.\" GUARDED OPTIMISM</p><p>The Mekong region - including Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam - represents one of the tougher environments for environmental litigation.</p><p>The nature of governments - and often their strong influence over the court system - means that climate protest, let alone legal action, is risky.</p><p>Mr William Schulte, Mekong Region policy and legal advisor for EarthRights International, said that is one of the main reasons why there is \"basically zero climate litigation in the Mekong region right now\".</p><p>\"I think the only country in the region where theoretically it will be possible is Thailand,\" he said, citing the nature of the country's administrative court, which has made progressive rulings in the past on environmental issues.</p><p>\"The biggest challenge is just the political challenge. You could craft the most airtight legal system on paper, but if the political will is impaired to implement it, then nothing's going to happen.</p><p>\"And if you don't have an independent court system that actually has the authority to issue decisions that are followed by the government, then it's going to be impossible.\"</p><p>Despite this, Mr Schulte has \"guarded optimism\" that small successes in Indonesia, the Philippines and China could filter into the Mekong region. Incremental change could deliver the justice that many vulnerable communities are looking for.</p><p>Movement is happening on other fronts too. The ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights is in the process of developing a regional framework on environmental rights.</p><p>Yet at the same time, there is increasingly an appetite among young people and affected groups to seek legal recourse, especially when other methods of advocacy might have failed or are taking too long, according to Ms Virginia Benosa-Llorin, the co-leader of the Make Polluters Pay Project at Greenpeace Southeast Asia.</p><p>She said her extensive direct work with communities in the Philippines reveals their increased knowledge about the connection between climate change and their everyday living and economic situation.</p><p>The Philippines - one of the most climate-impacted countries on the planet - is a leading global voice in pushing for a working loss and damage mechanism, a system where traditional polluting nations would pay for the costs incurred by developing nations that did not cause the crisis.</p><p>Ms Benosa-Llorin said seeking reparations in court is another way to make polluters accountable.</p><p>\"The challenge actually is, which area of the law? What kind of case? And how are we going to file it?\" \"Just filing a case alone will not fly. It has to be coupled with campaigning, with advocacy work, with working with communities, to get the collective strength from the people who are impacted,\" she told CNA.NO 'SILVER BULLET'</p><p>Assoc Prof Lin said it would be too simplistic to suggest that the recent UN statement could confer any direct rights to individuals taking legal action or increase their chances of litigation success in this region.</p><p>Nor would litigation alone be able to solve the climate crisis for generations of young people.</p><p>\"Litigation is only one of several options. It shouldn't be seen as the silver bullet,\" she said.</p><p>She explained that there are limitations to relying on international legal instruments, like the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. One of the general rules of public international law is that domestic legal remedies must be exhausted before international mechanisms can be turned to.</p><p>\"For many litigants from Southeast Asia, exhaustion of domestic remedies is going to be challenging. It'll be an arduous process that will take years,\" she said. Bringing such a case to a Singapore court, for example, would have \"almost zero\" likelihood of success, she said, due to the cost and lack of relevant case law for public interest litigation.</p><p>One regional environmental law expert, who asked not to be identified due to ongoing legal work, said the global climate movement could shake up the behaviour of governments and large corporations, without cases necessarily going to court.</p><p>\"I think we can expect to see potentially more actions being brought by youth, but at the very least more awareness of a long-term view on climate and the environment, which actually transcends the issue of youth alone,\" she said.</p><p>She said the trend would \"hopefully\" emphasise the need for a purposeful approach to dealing with climate change, especially in the corporate sector, where there is a growing appreciation of the financial costs of environmental neglect or inaction.</p><p>\"Institutional investors are getting worried, companies are getting worried and company directors are really worried, because of the financial impacts. I've never seen so much interest, even in Singapore,\" she said.</p><p>Experts agreed that young people frustrated with slow climate change action, especially in Southeast Asia, need to have their eyes open to both the risks and opportunities that exist in the legal space, and use their voice to try and bring about systemic, behavioural change for their respective communities.</p><p>The energy of their movement now has the backing of the world's most widely ratified treaty on human rights. But the path ahead will be fraught nevertheless.</p><p>The fight for climate justice is really not easy,\" Ms Benosa-Llorin said.</p><p>\"It's very hard. It's very complicated. It involves a lot of political will. I just don't want to see my children suffering anymore.\" INITIAL: jb(kb)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-3746991</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:693P-TH21-DYWP-R00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2127\"/><timeReceived>3:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 MCN International Pte Ltd.

We are in the fight of our lives, and we are losing. Greenhouse gas emissions keep growing. Global temperatures keep rising. And our planet is fast approaching tipping points that will make climate chaos irreversible,\" he said at the opening ceremony of the summit.</p><p>He called for a \"historic\" climate solidarity pact between developed and developing economies, \"in which all countries make an extra effort to reduce emissions this decade\" in line with the goal to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>COP27, being held at the beachside resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh, has been framed as an implementation summit, where parties are encouraged to come forward with concrete measures and actions and to deliver on past promises. The latest climate data shows the planet on track for at least a 1.7 degrees Celsius temperature rise over pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.</p><p>Negotiations in Egypt, and at the previous COP in Glasgow, have the wider ambition of keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius - seen as an important tipping point, beyond which impacts will become incrementally worse.</p><p>Mr Guterres also urged world leaders in the room to agree on a clear timebound roadmap for loss and damage, the notion that developed nations responsible for climate change should provide financial assistance to nations suffering the worst impacts and unable to adapt.</p><p>Loss and damage was officially added to the COP27 agenda on Sunday, following a push from Pakistan, the current leader of the G77 coalition of developing nations.</p><p>\"Loss and damage can no longer be swept under the rug. It is a moral imperative. It is a fundamental question of international solidarity and climate justice,\" he said.</p><p>\"Those who contributed least to the climate crisis are reaping the whirlwind sown by others.\"</p><p>Mr Guterres said that wealthier countries and international financial institutions should provide more financial and technical assistance to help emerging economies speed their own renewable energy transition.</p><p>He called for \"universal early warning system coverage\" within five years for nations continuing to be blindsided by climate impacts, and the compete global phasedown of coal by 2040.</p><p>Contrastingly, Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, president of the United Arab Emirates, spoke of the importance of his country's oil and gas industry, during his opening speech.</p><p>He framed his country as a reliable producer of energy that the world needs. The UAE will host next year's COP, to be held in Dubai.</p><p>Earlier, Egypt's president Abdel Fattah El-Sisi welcomed world leaders and delegates to COP27, calling for urgent action on climate change while \"the planet has become a world of suffering today\".</p><p>\"We have seen one catastrophe after another. As soon as we tackle one, another arises. Wave after wave of suffering,\" he said. \"Is it not high time to put an end to all of this suffering?\"</p><p>\"People around the world have thorny difficult questions, and we must address these questions,\" he said.</p><p>\"Have we faced our responsibilities, as leaders, to address climate change and protect the vulnerable? Can we achieve our goals? Can we all work together? Do we have any other choice?</p><p>\"What does the world need today to overcome today's climate change crisis and to implement the content of our agreements? Surely there is no more time to hesitate,\" he said.

They always did.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the rain never let up. It washed out the fields in her village where cotton, sugarcane and rice plants grew. It surged into houses, the mosque, schools and the office where she worked.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So much rain fell that on one night in August, Madam Zeba and the villagers of Malook Khaskheli realised their homes had become too dangerous to stay in. All 130 households fled into the dark, bringing no more than scraps of food to feed themselves. Two months later in October, Malook Khaskheli, which lies in Pakistan's Sindh province, remained uninhabitable and accessible only by boat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its place was what appeared to be a lake, its horizon broken by transmission towers and flat, grey dwellings jutting out of the water. Wavy lines on the sides of buildings marked how high the floodwaters had risen.</p><p>Before fleeing, villagers had placed belongings that they hoped to retrieve on the higher levels of their houses. But these were washed away, too, and little was left to return to.</p><p>Among those who lost their homes in the floods was Afsha, 27, the wife of a soldier and mother to a four-year-old. Her family had lived in a house built by her grandparents in the village.</p><p>She was one of the luckier ones. After the disaster, she found work as a midwife, with a monthly income of 30,000 Pakistani rupees (US$135).</p><p>This lifted her above her village's average daily income of 500 Pakistani rupees, but was not enough to give her shelter. After fleeing Malook Khaskheli, her family had to seek refuge at a relief camp along a highway. More than 1,700 people have died and 33 million have been affected this year by Pakistan's floods, which have been linked to rising temperatures.</p><p>Climate scientists from the international World Weather Attribution group found that global warming led to rainfall over the Sindh and Balochistan provinces that was up to 75 per cent more intense, and caused a heatwave that preceded the floods to be 30 times more likely to occur.</p><p>The catastrophe provides a starkly real example of the concept of \"loss and damage\" - where climate impacts can no longer be avoided by simply reducing carbon emissions, and extend beyond the limits of adaptation measures.</p><p>Pakistan's Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman told CNA that the World Bank has estimated damages of about US$40 billion from the floods.</p><p>\"We believe the loss and damage to cost a lot more as this was an unprecedented flood event, bigger than 2010 and not experienced before in Pakistan's history,\" said Ms Rehman, referring to the country's last flooding calamity. The destructive events in Pakistan have also spurred calls for compensation from those most responsible for emissions - namely, developed countries.</p><p>Having them finance loss and damage is shaping up to be a key ask of developing countries at the United Nations climate summit COP27, which convenes in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt from Sunday (Nov 6).</p><p>A decision on loss and damage will be a \"dealmaker or dealbreaker\" for COP27, said Sandeep Chamling Rai, senior adviser at the World Wildlife Fund.</p><p>\"It's a result of the moral obligation of the developed country whose economy has been built from the burning of fossil fuels,\" he added.</p><p>\"So it is their moral responsibility to address the climate crisis that they have created in the first place.\"</p><p>\"WE HAVE BEEN SET BACK 10 YEARS\"</p><p>Pakistan's breadbasket is in its central and southern regions, where the hardest-hit provinces of Sindh and Balochistan are. Across the country, more than 3.8 million ha of crops have been affected by the floods.</p><p>It only takes one missed harvest to risk trapping a farmer in a debt cycle. After water inundated Haider Ali's cotton fields, he could not repay the 53,000 Pakistani rupees he had borrowed to sow his crop.</p><p>Such loans were traditionally taken out before each sowing season, and repaid with proceeds from the harvest. With an annual interest rate of 18 per cent, Mr Ali, 50, said his remaining options were to lease his land to another farmer, sell his livestock or do labour on another farm. Mr Ali's neighbours in Majno Rind village described how their incomes have been slashed across a range of occupations, from rag-and-bone men to taxi drivers. Villagers usually worked as cotton-pickers in October, but there was no such employment after crops were killed.</p><p>Unusually high temperatures in Pakistan from early May had already caused crops to be planted outside their optimum timings, at higher cost and lower yield, said Dr Athar Hussain, head of the Centre for Climate Research and Development at Pakistan's COMSATS University Islamabad.</p><p>\"The untimely heavy rains resulted in destruction of crops that barely survived, thus causing further economic stress on Pakistan,\" he said.</p><p>With resources meant for development in other areas being diverted to flood victims, an economic slowdown at the national level would be the most dangerous long-term impact of the disaster, Dr Hussain warned.</p><p>Loss and damage covers loss of not just life, property or income, but also mobility, cultural heritage and biodiversity among others, pointing to the interconnected ways in which the climate influences every aspect of life. The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that near-term actions to limit global warming to the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold laid out in the Paris Agreement would substantially reduce projected loss and damage.</p><p>But they cannot eliminate all of it. Instead, with more warming, more human and natural systems will reach their adaptation limits. And these climate impacts are \"strongly concentrated\" among the poorest vulnerable populations, said the panel.</p><p>This is because inequity and poverty lead to \"soft\" adaptation limits - the kind that could be overcome with more money or better technology.</p><p>Ms Rehman, the Pakistani minister, said her government expects about 15.4 million people to be pushed into \"hardscrabble poverty\".</p><p>Pakistan's government has repurposed parts of its budget, including climate adaptation and resilience funds, to compensate households affected by the floods, with more than US$301 million disbursed in immediate cash relief to more than 2.6 million people.</p><p>An area of up to 46,000 sq km - larger than Switzerland - remains inundated in southern Pakistan, said Ms Rehman.</p><p>\"We have been set back 10 years. Everything from infrastructure, schools, hospitals (to) people's very lives need rebuilding,\" she said. More than 13,000 km of roads and 400 bridges were destroyed across the country. Combined with damage to more than 1,400 health facilities, healthcare has been rendered \"completely inaccessible\" in Sindh and Balochistan, said Ms Rehman.</p><p>This could not have come at a worse time, with stagnant water from the floods driving an increase in water- and vector-borne illnesses like cholera, malaria and dengue.</p><p>Gynaecologist Dr Maira Yaqoob told CNA how the floods led to her delivering about 20 babies a day - up from seven to eight previously - at Tando Allahyar Civil Hospital, after other medical facilities were destroyed.</p><p>In October, the 27-year-old also served at a medical camp that moved around to reach pregnant women and new mothers who had lost access to healthcare in the floods.</p><p>Her patients complained of weakness, and suffered fevers and diarrhoea. She looked at sores on a mother's hands and a red, inflamed bump on her three-month-old baby's abdomen - skin infections from the filthy floodwaters.</p><p>The child lay lethargically on his mother's lap. He was malnourished, said Dr Yaqoob, who then referred him to the hospital where he could be fed. \"RICH COUNTRIES MUST STEP UP\"</p><p>In September, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif asked at the UN: \"Why are my people paying the price of such high global warming through no fault of ours? We have no contribution in this.\"</p><p>At the heart of the debate over loss and damage is the tension between historical responsibility for climate change, and the disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations.</p><p>When countries signed the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, they noted that \"the largest share of historical and current global emissions of greenhouse gases has originated in developed countries\".</p><p>According to the IPCC, the least developed countries and small island developing states contributed less than 0.4 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively to historical CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry, between 1850 and 2019.</p><p>Pakistan itself reports a 0.9 per cent contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Experts told CNA that developed countries fear legal obligations to provide finance to climate-vulnerable countries. That has made loss and damage a politically charged issue.</p><p>\"It gets bogged down in terms of the developed countries seeing loss and damage as a compensation regime or reparations,\" said WWF's Mr Rai of the negotiations. As the first legally binding international treaty on climate change, the Paris Agreement enshrines the importance of addressing loss and damage. But it also explicitly states that it \"does not involve or provide a basis for any liability or compensation\". These concerns remain on the flipside of discussions.</p><p>Another reason for stalled positions on loss and damage is slow progress in larger discussions on climate finance, said Melissa Low, research fellow at the National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions.</p><p>In 2009, developed countries pledged to mobilise US$100 billion a year by 2020, for climate action in developing countries. The target was missed and extended through 2025, and remains only partially met at US$83.3 billion in 2020.</p><p>Countries have the further task of hammering out, by 2025, a new collective quantified goal from a floor of US$100 billion a year.</p><p>\"The gap lies in the undertaking of responsibility by the rich countries to not only fulfil their pledges but also provide compensations for the carbon-intensive lifestyles and investments that continue to increase emissions,\" said Ms Rehman.</p><p>As the current chair of a bloc of more than 130 developing countries at the UN, Pakistan will seek, at COP27, \"concrete and structured decisions to build a formal mechanism to finance losses\", said Ms Rehman.</p><p>\"Loss and damage has to be put on the climate finance agenda formally. It has always been the stepchild of the larger discourse, but that needs to change now.</p><p>\"As for where the money will come from, let's get real. There are plenty of funds available globally, and for attracting that, combinations of sovereign and capital market debt can be raised.\" Ms Rehman said it was \"important to not add debt to national treasuries that are already mobilising all domestic revenue to finance international debt servicing\".</p><p>\"We don't want to rely on 'disaster aid' when the big emitters are holding back on their pledges,\" she added.</p><p>\"This crisis is not our doing. The rich countries must step up and create mechanisms for compensations as part of the long-awaited climate finance.\"</p><p>Ms Low, from NUS, pointed out that countries can also choose to take the lead outside the UN process.</p><p>Over the past year, Scotland and Denmark have made their own finance pledges to address loss and damage in developing countries, circumventing the lack of a global agreement.</p><p>\"I don't know if we should place all our hopes on loss and damage decisions being made at the COP or Paris Agreement level, because it will be too late for some countries ultimately. They can't wait,\" said Ms Low, who has attended the climate conference for more than a decade.</p><p>\"We talk about the COP all the time as being like the panacea or the silver bullet, but it really isn't.\" SINGAPORE \"TOO WELL-ADAPTED\"?</p><p>Southeast Asia has also been reckoning with the climate crisis.</p><p>In September, Super Typhoon Noru swept through the Philippines, Vietnam and Thailand, killing dozens of people. Malaysia experienced flooding described as being \"once in 100 years\" last December, and repeated floods have become a source of trauma for victims.</p><p>Super typhoons - which used to be rare but have become \"very familiar\" over the last two decades - and drought are among the major climate challenges facing the region, said Dr Albert Salamanca, senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute.</p><p>The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has estimated US$91 billion to US$127 billion in average annual losses from natural disasters in Southeast Asia, with up to 4.3 per cent of the region's GDP lost.</p><p>Hotspots of drought and related diseases are expected to intensify in Cambodia, Myanmar and Vietnam, with new risk hotspots emerging in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia in a worst-case scenario, according to the commission.</p><p>Dr Salamanca said climate change could also reverse development gains. The IPCC has observed reduced food and water security, adverse socioeconomic consequences from the widespread deterioration of ecosystems, and negative effects on physical and mental health.</p><p>Around Southeast Asia, many communities that suffer climate impacts are also \"remote from centres of power\" in capital cities, said Dr Salamanca.</p><p>Civil society organisations can play crucial roles in supporting them, such as by explaining the role of climate change in causing disasters as well as providing solidarity and relief and recovery assistance, he said. Amid all this, what is Singapore's place in the debate on loss and damage?</p><p>The country reports a contribution of about 0.11 per cent to global greenhouse gas emissions. It is considered a developing country, and therefore not among the developed countries mandated to provide climate finance in the Paris Agreement.</p><p>However, there are some who think that it's appropriate for that position to be looked at.</p><p>Local environment group SG Climate Rally told CNA: \"Singapore should acknowledge the role that fossil fuels have played in its development in the past and today. The wealth obtained from the fossil fuel industry needs to be paid back to those who are suffering the consequences, evident in the extreme weather events that are happening all around the world at an alarming rate.\"</p><p>CNA approached Singapore's Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment for information on the country's position on the matter.</p><p>Meanwhile Singapore is also feeling the effects of climate change. This year the country reported its highest May temperature ever, its wettest October in 40 years and more landslides partly attributable to higher-than-normal rainfall.</p><p>The Government has sought to highlight the issue through national awareness campaigns and revamped policies, including hiking the carbon tax and rolling out a Singapore Green Plan 2030 in a concerted push towards sustainability and net-zero emissions by 2050. Notions of climate justice have also been bandied about in Singapore. Closely entwined with loss and damage, climate justice seeks to address the inequitable distribution of climate change effects on vulnerable populations contributing the least to it.</p><p>\"While white-collar workers can live in air-conditioned environments most of the time in their offices, homes and cars, construction workers, food delivery riders and rental flat tenants have little protection from the increasingly hotter weather,\" SG Climate Rally explained.</p><p>Ms Low, the researcher, said there has been some local discussion on climate justice in the context of parliamentary questions about heat stress faced by migrant workers.</p><p>But Singapore has not come to a public discourse around equity yet, she said.</p><p>This might be because many in Singapore remain insulated from the worst repercussions of climate change - ironically due to successful efforts to make the country more resilient to impacts like rising sea levels, intense rainfall and food and water scarcity. \"I think Singapore is too well-adapted to the impacts of climate change,\" said Ho Xiang Tian, founder of environmental group LepakInSG. \"People can still hide in air-conditioned areas if it's too hot, and NEWater and desalination means we can tide over dry spells without having to resort to water rationing.\"</p><p>\"This might lead to people feeling like there's no urgency in pushing for climate action,\" he added.</p><p>\"Who remembers which year PSI levels hit 401 in Singapore? Most severe drought in Singapore? Longest coral bleaching event in Singapore?\"</p><p>Citing the years of each event in turn - 2013, 2014 and 2016 - Mr Ho then wondered, wryly, if people were even aware that corals existed in Singapore's waters.</p><p>When faced with news about climate disasters in other countries, there is also \"a sense that it won't happen to us\" in Singapore, he said.</p><p>Mr Ho suggested water rationing exercises or augmented and virtual reality technologies as ways for people in Singapore to experience the harsher effects of climate change.</p><p>But for victims of climate disasters, the ongoing emergency is no simulation.</p><p>Unprecedented climate events are on the rise, and will continue to force entire communities - mostly in developing countries - to leave behind places and ways of life that have served them for generations.</p><p>For Pakistan's Ms Rehman, it is clear that the time has come for developed countries to act.</p><p>\"The bargain between the Global North and the South is not working and it needs to be fixed in order for the Global South to actually survive the oncoming train of climate change,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's not going to differentiate between borders, it's not going to know the colour of skin.

A spokeswoman for the protesters, from various environmental campaign organisations, said they were building a camp at the so-called Federal Square in the heart of Bern's political centre to highlight demands to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2030. About 40 protesters chained themselves to objects or to each other to prevent them from being removed easily by police, should authorities object, a Reuters witness said. </p><p>\"We woke up quite early and came here to the Federal Square to...demand net zero by 2030 and climate justice now,\" said Frida Kohlmann, the spokeswoman. \"We will be here from today until Friday. The crisis is so much more urgent, many people don't know that, and we really hope this is going to help toward this.\" The groups were also involved in demonstrations in Zurich and Basel in June 2019, in which dozens of activists were eventually arrested after blocking entrances to Swiss banks Credit Suisse and UBS as they demanded an end to financing of fossil fuel activities.

And there is anger.</p><p>\"Young people, myself included, feel betrayed by world leaders,\" the 22-year-old said at a climate protest ahead of the COP26 summit.</p><p>To deal with her anxiety, she campaigns.</p><p>\"Sometimes it can feel quite hopeless until I am back and organising with my community,\" she said.</p><p>In Johannesburg, clinical psychologist Garret Barnwell showed sympathy and understanding for the young people facing difficult emotions over the crisis.</p><p>\"It's a reality that children are facing this changing world. They're experiencing fear, anger, hopelessness, helplessness,\" Barnwell said.</p><p>The pressures of climate change also amplify pre-existing social injustices, he said, so younger generations are not only concerned about the environment but also, for example, healthcare access.</p><p>Yet despite this, when young people articulate their fears to adults such as teachers, often they find their feels are \"invalidated\", Barnwell added.</p><p>He welcomed the growing global awareness of climate anxiety, adding that while therapy can be helpful ultimately what is needed was political action.</p><p>'We bear the Burden'</p><p>But in the eyes of many young activists, that concrete action is lacking.</p><p>At the COP26 summit, dozens of countries this week joined a United States and European Union pledge to cut methane emissions.</p><p>The initiative, which experts say could have a powerful short-term impact on global heating, followed an agreement by 100 nations to end deforestation by 2030.</p><p>But a simmering diplomatic spat between the United States, China and Russia over their climate action ambitions showed the fragile nature of the talks.</p><p>\"The previous COP, COP25, really sort of brought out this eco-anxiety I felt,\" said eco-feminist Jennifer Uchendu, 29, in Lagos.</p><p>She said she believed climate anxiety was especially an issue for younger people growing up in nations disproportionately affected by climate change.</p><p>\"We bear the burden of climate change, even though we contributed the least to it,\" she said, a frown creasing her face.</p><p>Uchendu said that rather than bury her fears, she tries to accept them as valid.</p><p>\"It's OK to feel overwhelmed,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's OK to be afraid, scared and even anxious in the face of something so big and so overwhelming.\" - ETX Studio</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Malay Mail.

Ultimately, it is the total cumulative emissions, and not the current annual emission, that affects the global temperature rise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, in fact, establishes a near-linear relationship between the cumulative emissions from human activities and the surface temperature increase, forming the scientific basis for the global carbon budget.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A carbon budget, much like a financial budget, defines the finite quota of cumulative carbon dioxide emissions permitted over a period of time to limit the global temperature increase within a maximum threshold. Scientists agree that the world has to limit the temperature increase to well below 2\u00c2\u00b0C, or ideally below 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C, compared with pre-industrial levels to avert irreversible changes to the global climate.</p><p>The scientific consensus today is that the world has to achieve net zero emissions by the mid-century to stay within the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C temperature rise limit.</p><p>The 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP26) happening in Glasgow at the end of this month, however, will be crucial to developing a political consensus on how the world must respond to the global climate challenge.</p><p>Since the industrial revolution, the world has used up more than 80 per cent of the estimated carbon budget for a two-thirds chance of staying within the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C target.</p><p>How, then, should the remaining carbon budget, or the estimated 440 billion tonnes of permissible carbon dioxide emissions quota be allocated to the different energy sectors and geographical regions?</p><p>With the current annual rate of emissions, the world is likely to overshoot its carbon budget in less than 12 years.</p><p>Attributing responsibility to those who have historically consumed disproportionate shares of the global carbon budget is key to understanding debates on climate justice, and ultimately who should be doing the most to prevent further emissions.</p><p>Consider that India presently accounts for the third largest emissions annually, right after the United States and China, but cumulatively, it is responsible for less than five per cent of the total emissions from 1751 to 2017.</p><p>This too, despite its much larger population size of 1.3 billion, accounting for more than 17 per cent of the world total population.</p><p>It is unreasonable, therefore, to hold developing economies to the same standard as richer countries, when the latter were mainly responsible for consuming most of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s carbon budget, while poorer countries are left with negligible carbon space to improve their basic livelihoods.</p><p>Keep in mind that more than a third of the global population is in poorer countries, like Africa and India, and that 800 million people worldwide still do not have access to reliable and affordable supply of electricity.</p><p>To put this into context, the average Ethiopian consumes less than 150kW-hours of electricity in one whole year. In contrast, this is the amount consumed by an average American in less than five days. Energy access is fundamental to alleviating hardcore poverty and improving healthcare in poorer countries.</p><p>Energy enables improved food productivity and improved healthcare operations. Electricity-powered refrigeration, for instance, allows for safer and longer storage of food and medicines, including vaccines. Modern energy is so pervasive throughout our daily lives that we tend to take it for granted.</p><p>The energy transition is bound to widen the already large disparity between low-income and high-income countries. But likewise, the global climate change is also expected to affect lower-income countries disproportionately.</p><p>This is partly the motivation behind the International Energy Agency\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s call for people-centered energy transition, or the World Energy Council\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s humanising energy transition narrative.</p><p>Ultimately, we must put humanity at the centre of the energy transition debate to prevent it from further deteriorating the inequitable distribution and access to resources worldwide.</p><p>The energy trilemma today involves enabling affordable, accessible and sustainable supply of energy. Simply put, we need more energy but less of the carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>The world has some of the technologies for our trajectory to a net zero future \u00e2\u20ac\u201d but not all. While this is the current reality that we have to deal with today, there is no doubt, however, that human ingenuity will ultimately triumph. We simply must, as there is just no other option.</p><p>The writer is a Malaysian scientist living abroad who aims to bridge between science and society to promote evidence-based thinking.

The termination of Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who worked as user-experience designers in Seattle, came in a couple of weeks after the company fired another employee Christian Smalls for raising health and safety concerns for people labouring through the outbreak. The Seattle-based firm has been facing public scrutiny over safety and working conditions of warehouse, delivery and retail gig workers in the United States after cases of COVID-19 were reported in some of its facilities. </p><p>Amazon workers have also protested in other countries. Amazon said it supported \"every employee's right to criticise their employer's working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies\". The world's largest online retailer is racing to update safety protocols, keep warehouses functional and ship essential goods to shoppers who have been told by their governments to stay home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Last month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered the city's Human Rights Commission to open an investigation to look into Christian Smalls' allegations. Five Democratic lawmakers also wrote a letter to the company last week questioning the allegations. The Washington Post, which first reported the story, identified the two employees as members of Amazon Employees for Climate Justice, an employee climate group that has been vocal in raising concerns over protecting warehouse staff. - Reuters/aa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-12640214</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YNG-XYB1-DYWP-R511-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"286\"/><timeReceived>8:10 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Most rely on carbon markets to deliver carbon offsets, mainly in developing countries.</p><p>What carbon offsetting means is that developed countries do not reduce emissions domestically but pay developing countries to do the reductions instead. Offsetting is deemed more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cost effective\u00e2\u20ac to buy carbon credits to offset emissions generated in the developed world.</p><p>With or without carbon offsetting, such pledges create a huge demand for sinks, mainly in the forests, wetlands and grasslands of developing countries. Clearly, the quantity of sinks needed would exceed the sequestration capacity of the planet by several fold.</p><p>This will have negative implications for developing countries, including generating conflicts over land use, as well as among local communities and indigenous peoples, whose lands and forests are being sought to solve rich nations\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 emission problems.</p><p>Climate justice groups have referred to this as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153carbon colonialism\u00e2\u20ac. Limiting temperature rise to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C requires the sharing of the remaining carbon budget in an equitable manner. For a 50 per cent probability of keeping global warming below the limit, the remaining carbon budget is 480 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2eq).</p><p>At the current rate of emissions of 42 GtCO2eq per year, the budget would be exhausted in about 12 years. With a shrinking carbon budget, the right approach must be one where the rich developed world takes the lead in much deeper cuts to their emissions based on a fair-share approach.</p><p>Such an equity-based proposal has never seen the light of day due to strong resistance from developed countries, especially the United States on the grounds that no international agreement can dictate a top-down approach to emission reductions for countries.</p><p>Serious academics and civil society groups have pointed out that rich countries are not doing enough. A recent analysis by Dr Jason Hickel from the University of London, reported in medical journal The Lancet, showed that up to 2015, the Global North was responsible for 92 per cent of excess emissions.</p><p>By contrast, most countries in the Global South were within their boundaries of fair shares. including India and China (although China will overshoot soon).</p><p>Instead, the net zero mantra allows developed countries to get away with targets that amount to doing too little, too late, and passes on the responsibility to developing countries to do the heavy lifting without commensurate financial and technological transfers.</p><p>The Paris Agreement does call for a balance between human emissions and removal by sinks by 2050, but this is to be on the basis of equity and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty.</p><p>The rich North must go to real zero and help developing countries do their fair share through financial and technological transfers so that they do not repeat the mistakes of the North.</p><p>Net zero is indeed a mirage to delay further action by rich nations responsible for the crisis in the first place. The sooner we realise this, the better it is for the planet and the poor.</p><p>MEENAKSHI RAMAN</p><p>President, Sahabat Alam Malaysia</p><p>( END )</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NSTRTT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NSTRTT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62GY-JG31-JC85-C4VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">151977</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 New Straits Times Press (Malaysia) Berhad All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>New Straits Times (Malaysia)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 22, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Main Section</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A3R8</classCode><className>CARBON OFFSETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924110GJ</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp;

LUMPUR</location></nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KUALA LUMPUR, June 8 -- There's no denying Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg has a way with words, especially getting world leaders to face up to the impacts of global warming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just ask ex-US president Donald Trump whose heated tweets with the teenage environmental icon became one of social media's most well-known feuds that carried on until he left the White House.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In an interview with Malay Mail and other international press, the 18-year-old had this to say about the very public contretemps between her and Trump, an ardent climate change denier.</p><p>\"I hope he's enjoying himself but I don't miss him.</p><p>\"I think it's time for the world to move on from that era,\" she said last Friday via Zoom.</p><p>The famed teenager was promoting her latest documentary Greta Thunberg: A Year to Change the World by BBC Studios which follows the climate activist around North America and Europe from August 2019 to late 2020 to explore the science behind the climate crisis, how it impacts humans and our ecosystems, and possible solutions.</p><p>Greta was scheduled to visit Asia but production was cut short due to Covid-19.</p><p>Among many things, she would have liked to explore issues related to coal-powered plants and manufacturing in this part of the world.</p><p>Southeast Asia clocked in the fastest carbon dioxide emissions growth in the world between 1990 and 2010, noting an excessive reliance on fossil fuel, deforestation and land degradation as the main factors driving emissions, according to the Asian Development Bank.</p><p>The International Energy Agency also revealed in 2019 that in the last 20 years, overall energy demand in Southeast Asia grew by more than 80 per cent and is expected to grow by 60 per cent by 2040.</p><p>The impact of climate change in our part of the world, say environmental experts, will come in the form of more intense typhoons and floods.</p><p>Despite the science, Environment and Water Minister Datuk Seri Tuan Ibrahim Tuan Man has said Malaysia is not vulnerable to climate change, pertaining to the country's exclusion at the US-organised Climate Action Summit in April.</p><p>His ministry later clarified that all countries, Malaysia included, are not spared from climate change after public backlash.</p><p>\"The climate crisis is a global problem and it will eventually affect everyone,\" Thunberg said.</p><p>\"Even though we're not sitting in the same boat, we are in the same storm.</p><p>\"We are not going to be hit differently but we will be hit and so I think it's quite delusional to still believe that we will be able to adapt.\"</p><p>She added that in some parts of the world, people will be able to adapt as long as there is access to money and infrastructure.</p><p>Many in vulnerable areas won't be afforded that privilege.</p><p>\"The people who won't be able to adapt are going to have to move somewhere so it doesn't make sense to have that approach.\"</p><p>Known for openly admonishing global leaders for their lack of climate action in favour of economic abundance, Thunberg was asked if her approach would be different when it comes to leaders in Asia where the culture is less confrontational.</p><p>\"Whether your rhetoric is confrontational or not, we'll have to face the science and no matter where in the world you live, the science is a fact we simply need to accept,\" she said.</p><p>While it's easy to assume the climate justice advocate spends much of her time worrying about what her future would look like, Thunberg admitted otherwise.</p><p>\"I try to focus on the present and try to change that future while I still have that possibility to do so.\"</p><p>In recent times, concerns about the planet's future and humanity's long-term survival have launched a new space race with tech billionaires Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos setting their sights on extraterrestrial pursuits in the event Earth becomes uninhabitable due to natural or human-made

The strategy marks a departure from past Democratic administrations that tended to run their climate strategies mainly through the Environmental Protection Agency. The interagency approach could help Biden make headway on global warming without having to rely on sweeping climate legislation that would be hard to pass in a divided Congress. \"Every agency is a climate agency now,\" said Sam Ricketts, co-founder of Evergreen Action, an advocacy group that advised Biden's transition team on climate change. </p><p>Here are how some federal agencies could likely to play a role in the administration's climate agenda: ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY The EPA, as the nation's top environmental regulator, will be the obvious choice for Biden as his administration seeks to beef up climate protections and enforce regulations. The EPA could also rebuild rules and scientific processes that had been systematically dismantled by the administration of President Donald Trump. INTERIOR DEPARTMENT In charge of a fifth of the country's surface, the Interior Department will carry out Biden's campaign pledge that the United States will conserve nearly one-third of all land and water by 2030. Interior will also likely refocus its energy and minerals leasing programs toward clean energy sources like solar, wind and geothermal and away from the oil, gas, and coal that had been favoured by the Trump administration. Biden has promised to halt new oil and gas drilling on federal lands and waters, a policy that will need to be led by Interior. DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY The Energy Department will lead the charge on clean energy research and development programs, including advanced nuclear, fusion, battery and biofuel technology. Biden has said he intends to direct massive public investment into clean tech to ensure the country is able to eventually hit net-zero emissions by 2050. DEFENSE DEPARTMENT The Defense Department is the single largest buyer of fossil fuels in the federal government and can use its enormous procurement powers \"to purchase clean and resilient energy technologies, and advanced low-carbon fuels, that will enhance domestic resilience and simultaneously help to build the industries that will help defeat the existential climate threat,\" according to a memo from advocacy group Evergreen Action to the Biden transition team. TREASURY DEPARTMENT The Treasury Department could use the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform act to require banks and other institutions to weigh climate risk in their investments, something that could trigger a big swing in private investment flows toward clean energy. Treasury could also create standards for federal overseas lending programs that could prohibit investment in high-carbon projects abroad. \"I think the Treasury Department is going to be a pretty big player on climate,\" said Christy Goldfuss, former White House Council on Environmental Quality under Obama who co-authored Climate 21, a roadmap for the Biden transition team to mobilise federal agencies to tackle climate change. AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT Agriculture accounts for 9 per cent of US emissions but US forest land, much of which is overseen by the Agriculture Department, sequesters up to 15 per cent of annual fossil fuel emissions. The department could pay farmers, ranchers, and forest land owners to reduce and offset emissions through a credit program. It could also use crop insurance policies to encourage \"climate smart agriculture\", according to policy experts advising Biden. EDUCATION DEPARTMENT The Education Department could direct federal dollars toward funding of specialised teachers and programs to raise awareness of climate change and use its procurement powers to assist in the electrification of bus fleets and greening of school buildings. \"There could be also be lots of opportunities for new dollars for K-12 and higher education for technical education that prepares students for jobs in things like renewable energy, retrofitting buildings and electric cars and infrastructure,\" said John King Jr, education secretary under Obama. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT The Justice Department will have to defend the new administration's climate policies but could also prioritise federal civil cases with a climate focus, negotiate supplemental climate projects in settlements with polluters, and beef up enforcement actions against major companies, according to Kate Konschnik, a former environmental enforcement trial attorney for the DOJ. Biden has also said in his climate plan that he will form an environmental and climate justice division within the DOJ to prioritise climate change and environmental justice. - Reuters/ec</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-13995982</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61TB-8NP1-JCDN-11YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><timeReceived>9:27 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 MCN International Pte Ltd.

I woke up the next day, and my phone was just blowing up with notifications ... Every time I refreshed my TikTok profile, I would just see the viewer numbers increasing in the thousands per minute,\" she recounted to TODAY.</p><p>Two years on, Ms Liel, a self-professed full-time \"TikToker\", boasts more than 125,000 followers and has amassed over 10 million \"likes\" for her videos, which range from skits reimagining Stamford Raffles in modern Singapore, to product reviews and vignettes of her daily life.</p><p>For someone who had toyed with the idea of being an entertainer when she was younger, the app has opened the door for Ms Liel to earn a living as one, as she began getting requests to do sponsored posts for brands earlier this year. \"I started thinking I could make (being on TikTok) a full-time thing ... Brands were getting on TikTok last year, but I feel like it was this year where they truly started to use TikTokers as content creators,\" said Ms Liel. \"I started getting some brand deals and it's quite sustainable in the long run.\"</p><p>She estimates that she earns, on average, \"higher than a fresh graduate's salary\" of S$3,000 a month.</p><p>Her TikTok journey echoes that of many others who have shot to fame - both in Singapore and overseas - from posting short, quirky videos on the app.</p><p>Social media experts told TODAY that while TikTok was already gaining traction when it launched internationally in 2017, it was boredom and isolation at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that boosted the take-up rate of the Chinese mobile app around the world.</p><p>According to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower, global downloads of the app surged from 200 million in the last quarter of 2019 to more than 300 million in the first three months of 2020, when the pandemic saw consumers \"drawn to their mobile devices more than ever\".</p><p>The figure also set a record for the most downloads for any mobile application ever in a quarter, said Sensor Tower in a blog post.</p><p>TikTok's rapid rise has also forced its competitors, particularly Facebook, to play catch-up and introduce features that mimic those of the former.</p><p>In late July, Facebook tweaked its algorithm so that people scrolling through its home page can discover content that is \"uniquely personalised to them\", said Meta, its parent company, in a blog post.</p><p>This means that users will not only see posts from accounts that they follow, but also content from accounts that they do not.</p><p>This is similar to how TikTok's algorithm recommends content based on users' interests, rather than which accounts they follow.</p><p>Social media experts expect TikTok to grow further both globally and locally, changing the social media landscape with its low barriers to entry for users and content creators, and diversifying beyond its predominantly Gen Z user base.</p><p>American think tank Pew Research Center defines Gen Z as those born from 1997 onward. TIKTOK'S GROWTH IN SINGAPORE</p><p>In Singapore, a survey found that TikTok made \"significant gains\" in the number of users in the last two years as the pandemic raged.</p><p>The survey was conducted by the Centre for Information Integrity and the Internet at the Nanyang Technological University's Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.</p><p>About 13.6 per cent of the survey participants said they used TikTok in December 2020, compared with 25.3 per cent saying they did so a year later.</p><p>The main users of TikTok were from young and middle-age groups aged between 21 and 50 years old. These groups made up 79 per cent of the total TikTok users in the survey sample.</p><p>The survey, which is conducted nationwide every six months, involved more than 400 respondents who participated in three surveys in December 2020, July 2021 and December 2021.</p><p>TODAY also previously reported that foreign workers quarantined in their dormitories during the pandemic turned to TikTok to entertain themselves and assure their families that they were okay.</p><p>Figures provided by data.ai, the market insights company, also showed that TikTok grew in Singapore over the pandemic period. Between the second quarter of 2019 and the second quarter of 2020, the number of TikTok monthly active users experienced its biggest jump in Singapore, growing by 187 per cent from 334,000 to 961,000.</p><p>Speaking to TODAY, Ms Lexi Sydow, the head of insights at data.ai, said that TikTok has grown phenomenally in Southeast Asia. Over the last five years, the number of monthly active users in Singapore has grown by more than eight times as of the second quarter of this year, in line with Malaysia and faster than Vietnam.</p><p>Within the region, the rate of growth was the highest in Indonesia, where monthly active users grew 17 times between the second quarter of 2018 and the second quarter of 2022.</p><p>She also noted that while TikTok ranks fourth for social media apps in Singapore by total time spent on Android phones, behind WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram, its average monthly time spent per user stood at 19.8 hours, surpassing Facebook (18.3 hours a month), WhatsApp (16 hours a month) and Instagram (9.5 hours a month)</p><p>Dr Crystal Abidin, an associate professor of Internet studies at Curtin University in Australia, said that in Singapore, TikTok pandemic gave local influencers who were unable to shoot content overseas, another outlet to produce content.</p><p>TikTok's \"come as you are\" culture where its creators can post casual videos of themselves at home allowed these influencers to present a more amateur side of themselves. It also gave them an avenue to continue producing content on a different platform without impacting their other personas or branded identities on other sites such as Instagram, Facebook or YouTube, said Dr Crystal.</p><p>Isolation during the pandemic also gave older, millennial influencers who were in their late 20s to late 30s the time to learn how to use TikTok and overcome the inertia of using another new app, she added.</p><p>But it was only when brands realised that TikTok had commercial value that the app truly went mainstream, said Dr Crystal, citing examples of how restaurants and alcohol brands turned to TikTok influencers to market their products and services during the pandemic.</p><p>Professor Lim Sun Sun from the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) said that she expects TikTok's user base in Singapore to grow beyond its younger, teenage audience with non-entertainment personalities such as politicians starting to take TikTok more seriously as a platform for engagement.</p><p>In response to TODAY's queries, a TikTok spokesperson from Singapore said the platform \"continues to see strong growth in its audience reach and engagement\", with more than 1 billion people globally coming to TikTok every month. Nearly one out of four global users came from Southeast Asia, with its user base in the region exceeding 240 million, up by 85 per cent year-on-year.</p><p>The spokesperson said that \"it was only natural\" for online platforms such as TikTok to see an increase in user activity during the pandemic when more people stayed at home, with TikTok playing a part in \"connecting and meaningfully engaging communities even while physically apart\".</p><p>During the pandemic, TikTok saw a significant increase in daily accumulated engagement on videos as well as an uptick in video creation, especially content related to spreading positivity and educating people on hygiene practices.</p><p>\"We've also seen this increase in TikTok user activity continue even as restrictions eased in Singapore - leading to the platform surpassing 1 billion active global users monthly in September 2021,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>LIVING OFF THE TIKTOK DREAM</p><p>As TikTok's popularity grows globally, so has its efforts to move beyond being a platform for trendy dance sequences - to one which promotes commerce.</p><p>To allow TikTokers to monetise their fame, the app has launched several features, including TikTok Creator Marketplace and TikTok Live in 2019.</p><p>In May this year, TikTok also introduced a subscription service for its TikTok Live where content creators can generate recurring revenue from fans through additional perks such as subscriber-only chats.</p><p>All seven TikTok creators whom TODAY interviewed said that they have made money from participating in brand sponsorships or publicising services on the platform.</p><p>Ms Liel, the 24-year-old TikToker, said that the rates for branded TikTok videos are usually in the range of thousands of dollars. Her highest-paid project on TikTok was a \"five-figure number\" while her least lucrative projects are usually in exchange for the products that she is promoting. While her monthly earnings are sometimes higher than that of a fresh graduate, Ms Liel acknowledged that what she does on TikTok cannot provide a stable income source.</p><p>\"I can be rolling in dough when big projects (involving large sums of money) come in one month, and then become a pauper the next month,\" she quipped.</p><p>To this end, Ms Liel said she has set up her own business - she runs several eyelash studio outlets - to ensure that she has something to fall back on if she becomes irrelevant and unable to make money on TikTok.</p><p>For Mr Ian Jeevan Prasad Arumugam, who is more popularly known as Ian Jeevan on TikTok, hitting 10,000 followers within a few months of his debut in April 2020 - during the \"circuit breaker\" period - was \"a big milestone\".</p><p>Mr Jeevan, who now has more than 150,000 followers on TikTok, earns between \"mid-four figures to low five figures\" for each project on the platform. The 26-year-old said that 80 per cent of his monthly income comes from social media content creation while the rest comes from his work as a financial consultant.</p><p>Another TikToker, dentist Tristan Peh, also started off by doing videos during the early part of the pandemic in March 2020 to bond with his young daughters, who were aged six and nine then.</p><p>Dr Peh, 43, who has gained more than 2 million followers through his videos on dental hygiene, said that he constantly gets emails from brands looking to do sponsored posts for toothbrushes or water flossers.</p><p>He began receiving requests for sponsored posts about four to five months after he started posting videos on TikTok.</p><p>He charges around US$5,000 (S$6,856) to US$10,000 for each post, based on his study of the market rates for such collaborations.</p><p>However, Dr Peh said that he is \"not really into sales\" and is mostly on TikTok to \"just have some fun, spread awareness (on dental hygiene) and get everyone to smile\". For some of these content creators, there is also the fear of losing their relevance in a space where the audience's taste is fickle and constantly evolving.</p><p>Ms Liel said: \"My worry is about whether I can start a family with a job that can be taken away (just) like that. It's (like) the whole world could collectively decide that they don't need you and I know that's imminent, because unless you create drama every day (on social media), you'll become irrelevant.\"</p><p>To stay relevant, Ms Liel has changed her content to keep up with her audience. While she started off with mostly comedy sketches, she now shares more about her life on TikTok to establish a connection and sense of community with her followers. Mr Jeevan, who is best known for Bollywood-style parodies on TikTok, said that he does not feel any financial pressure at the moment as he has a second job as a financial consultant, and brands are still actively seeking him out for collaborations.</p><p>To ensure that his TikTok content stays relevant, he said he has been branching out over the last two years, beyond the Bollywood skits.</p><p>He added that he has also sought to establish himself as a family-friendly content creator, one which brands find safe to collaborate with. This helps to ensure that brands continue to seek him out for campaigns, he said.</p><p>Still, he acknowledged the pressure from his fans or followers who want him to reproduce popular content that he has done before. But Mr Jeevan said that he does not want to do so unless he can be sure that the content is of good quality.</p><p>Meanwhile, other TikTokers said they do not see the need to chase \"likes\" or boost follower count because they feel financially secure with their day job.</p><p>One of them, Mr Hafidz Rahman, a 33-year-old arts educator, said: \"I do content when I want it and I'm quite comfortable doing it at my own pace. In terms of finding followers, I think they will come at their own time.\"</p><p>Mr Hafidz, who has been producing content on social media platforms since 2014, has 103,000 followers on TikTok and is known for playing the role of a Malay woman in comedy skits.</p><p>THE GOOD AND BAD OF TIKTOK</p><p>The TikTokers interviewed cited the ease of the app's video editing features and diverse reach as major draws for them.</p><p>Mr Cavin Chua Kar Shin, a 22-year-old university student who has been making videos on YouTube since primary school, said that TikTok allows anyone to build a following without needing to look good or have a following on other social media platforms first.</p><p>\"For YouTube, for instance, it takes very long to build a following, but you can do it really quickly on TikTok. Anyone can make a video and have it appear on the 'For You Page' at any time,\" he said.</p><p>The third-year communications and new media student at the National University of Singapore has more than 180,000 followers on his TikTok account cayydences. His posts range from comedy skits to anecdotes about his daily life.</p><p>Other upsides of the platform cited by the TikTokers include the sense of community it provides, and the opportunities to produce educational content or present minority views.</p><p>Mr Jeremy Tan, a 37-year-old magician who has more than 135,000 followers since joining TikTok last year, said: \"I realise that the community on TikTok, especially when I do livestreams, is really supportive and (they) care for the creators.\"</p><p>He recalled how when he was hospitalised recently for sleep apnea surgery and did not put up any posts, TikTok users messaged him to ask about his health and wish him well. Likewise, Mr Chua, who said he is an introvert with few friends, described TikTok as a \"substitute for his social life\", as his posts are similar to what he would share with a friend.</p><p>He has also spoken openly on TikTok about his struggle with depression and mental illness, and believes that this is one reason why users choose to follow him.</p><p>For others such as Ms Ainul Md Razib, a 24-year-old software developer, TikTok is not only a platform for her to share niche, educational content but also to inspire others as a member of a minority community in more ways than one.</p><p>She has built up a following of more than 40,000 by putting up TikTok tutorials on how to break into the tech industry.</p><p>\"I'm a Malay-Muslim woman working in the tech industry, and maybe people who see me on TikTok identify with me as a Malay, as a woman or as someone trying to break into the tech industry. They may not know anybody like that in real life, but they see me on social media and they follow because it inspires them,\" said Ms Ainul. Still, there are also drawbacks from being a TikTok personality, said those interviewed, with some lamenting the loss of their privacy.</p><p>Recalling how someone had interrupted his date for a photo request recently, Mr Chua said that he tries not to leave his house as far as possible and sticks to areas with fewer people to avoid being approached or recognised on the streets.</p><p>The TikTokers also cited hate comments as another hazard they have to face. As it is fairly easy to sign up for a TikTok account and remain anonymous on the platform, the problem is exacerbated on TikTok compared with other social media platforms, they said.</p><p>Ms Ainul said that she uses TikTok's filter feature to block out inappropriate words about her appearance or religion. These include words related to weight, vulgarities or Islamophobia.</p><p>Nevertheless, she noted that given the type of content she produces, the level of hate comments directed at her is still far lower compared with other TikTokers, including those with larger followings.</p><p>The TikTok spokesperson said that the company \"does not tolerate bullying on its platform\" and has developed several safeguards against it.</p><p>These include the removal of comments that go against TikTok's community guidelines, such as those which involve harassment or bullying, and hate speech.</p><p>TikTok has also partnered with digital safety organisations in Singapore such as the Media Literacy Council to launch campaigns that prompt users to think before they post or comment on videos. THE DOUBLE-EDGED IMPACT OF TIKTOK'S RISE</p><p>As with all other social media platforms, TikTok comes with the good, bad and ugly, said experts.</p><p>On the plus side, SUTD's Prof Lim highlighted how TikTok - with its ability to let anyone broadcast themselves - allows smaller, less visible communities, such as those with medical conditions, to band together.</p><p>It has also given regular folks with seemingly mundane lives an avenue to become famous, unlike influencers on other platforms such as Instagram, which is usually associated with glitz and glamour, said Prof Lim. She cited the example of how Mr Raymond Lim, better known as Uncle Raymond, rose to fame by broadcasting his dances outside MRT stations on TikTok.</p><p>Dr Crystal noted how TikTok became accepted as a mainstream application - and not just a platform for young people - when it was used in social justice movements.</p><p>For example, in Asia Pacific, TikTok was adopted as a means for the climate justice movement to organise marches in late 2019. It also became a site for young people to talk about anti-Asian racism when the Covid-19 pandemic broke out in East Asia and Southeast Asia in early 2020, said Dr Crystal.</p><p>Some observers also pointed to how the Black Lives Movement in June 2020 tapped TikTok for social advocacy. During that period of protests, the #blacklivesmatter hashtag trended on TikTok and provided an avenue for users to share educational resources on the issue.</p><p>Despite its upsides, TikTok has also received its fair share of criticism.</p><p>NTU's Assistant Professor Saifuddin Ahmed noted that there have been more widespread discussions surrounding censorship, privacy and surveillance on TikTok compared with other social media platforms, although these issues are not necessarily specific to TikTok.</p><p>This is due to allegations of data mishandling and TikTok bowing to pressures from the Chinese government on how the data is used, he said.</p><p>Prof Lim also raised concerns about how TikTok's algorithm has been designed to keep users on the platform longer, generating the fear that its algorithm could draw users into harmful content such as reckless and risky acts, eating disorders or substance abuse.</p><p>However, Dr Crystal said that there are echo chambers on every social media platform, and echo chambers are worse in closed messaging groups such as WhatsApp or Telegram where there is no third party to vet or challenge the content.</p><p>She also argued that while TikTok's For You Page \"does groom and understand your preferences\", the app's users are \"more likely to chance upon content that's not connected to your egocentric profile, that's also not connected to your personal network of people you follow\".</p><p>This also means that in comparison, TikTok users \"end up being a pedestrian in more subcultures than you would in other social media\", she said.</p><p>TikTok said that its recommendation system, the For You feed, is central to the TikTok experience. Recommendations are based on several factors including user interactions, video information and device and account settings.</p><p>The spokesperson added that TikTok is aware that one of the \"inherent challenges\" of recommendation engines is that they can \"inadvertently limit (a user's) experience\", sometimes referred to as a filter bubble.</p><p>\"We recognise these concerns, and continue to strike a balance with optimising our For You feed for personalisation and relevance, while also helping users find fresh content and uncover new creators,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>The spokesperson added that while safety is at the heart of the recommendation system, that did not mean that serious or controversial content did not have a place on the platform, which is ultimately built to support users' diverse thoughts, experiences and interests. \"THE MOST ADDICTIVE\" SOCIAL MEDIA APP</p><p>The success of TikTok's algorithm has led to it being dubbed the \"most addictive\" social media app. But its very strength is what could cause the most harm to users.</p><p>Mr John Shepherd Lim, chief well-being officer of Singapore Counselling Centre, said that the excessive use of TikTok is \"undoubtedly a common contributing factor\" to the mental health concerns that its young clients face today.</p><p>He noted that while TikTok can be a place for users to express their creativity, its mainly young and impressionable user base means that TikTok may have unintentionally created an environment where users feel the pressure to create videos to increase their follower count, views and \"likes\" in order to feel social validation.</p><p>Mindless consumption of content on TikTok can fuel self-esteem issues, body-image issues and life dissatisfaction, where users compare their own lives and relationships to what they see on the platform, he said.</p><p>\"If users find themselves ruminating or feeling more anxious regarding what they saw on TikTok, it might be time to put the phone down for a while,\" he added.</p><p>He also pointed out that with the presence of sexually provocative and various forms of controversial content available, youths are more susceptible to being exposed to adult content, perspectives and struggles at an earlier age.</p><p>TikTok's continuous supply of entertaining content and the \"rapid-fire nature\" of its videos train viewers' minds to quickly assess how pleasurable content is during the first few seconds. This may lead to a shortened attention span and a judgmental attitude that users can bring into other aspects of their lives, such as school or work, he noted. \"A litmus test for how affected our attention spans are, is to measure the length of time it takes for us to get impatient with less-pleasurable activities, such as homework,\" said Mr Lim.</p><p>\"If we seem to be performing other tasks at our normal capacity, our TikTok usage should not be a concern. Otherwise, users could consider setting a daily limit on TikTok screen time through the app's settings.\"</p><p>The TikTok spokesperson said it has options for users to manage the time spent on TikTok, including the daily limit feature which Mr Lim referred to.</p><p>The spokesperson reiterated that it is committed to protecting the safety of young users and has designed tools and strategies to prioritise age-appropriate experiences. These include community guidelines that prohibit nudity, pornography or sexually explicit content on TikTok.</p><p>The spokesperson said that TikTok also recognises that some content may contain mature or complex themes intended for older audiences. It is building a new system that will allocate maturity level to videos which will be rolled out in the coming months.</p><p>\"Our users' well-being remains our top priority and there is no end to our work on this front. As such, we are committed to actively developing and reinforcing our safety features to continue cultivating healthy digital practices and positive online experiences,\" said the spokesperson.</p><p>This story was originally published in TODAY.

Soon after his inauguration, Biden signed an executive action, among others, to begin rejoining the 2015 climate pact, reversing a decision by climate change sceptic Donald Trump. The process to re-enter the international accord takes a month, meaning the United States will only officially have been out of the deal for a short time, since exiting in November. READ: Biden puts US back into fight to slow global warming But Trump's hostility to the UN climate process and his support for polluting fossil fuels have left Biden's team a lot of catching up to do at home and abroad, policy analysts said. </p><p>\"Rejoining the Paris Agreement is really the floor, not the ceiling, for the Biden administration on climate,\" said Jennifer Morgan, CEO of Greenpeace International. If the US government then moves to help drum up more global ambition to curb rising temperatures, it must be done in a spirit of \"partnership and humility, not coming back in and telling everyone what they should be doing\", Morgan said. Rachel Cleetus, climate and energy policy director for the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), said there would be a number of opportunities in 2021 for Biden to help advance \"a progressive climate agenda\" on the world stage. Those include the G7 and G20 leaders' summits, and the UN climate talks in November. READ: How Biden could use his whole government to take on climate change Biden and his international climate envoy John Kerry should also pursue meetings with other major emitters - as Biden has indicated he will do - \"to solidify ways to collectively tackle the climate crisis head-on\", she said in a statement. Former United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who led the world body when the Paris deal was adopted, said he was \"delighted\" Biden had committed to bringing his country back into what Ban called \"the peace pact with the planet\". Trump's vow to leave it, first made in 2017, had acted like a \"cold shower\" for the global agreement, Ban told journalists. The US re-entry would \"help mobilise and resuscitate\" political will among global leaders, business and civil society to implement the accord faster, he added. 2030 TARGET One key task for Washington, after re-entering the Paris climate deal, will be to set a US emissions reduction target for 2030 and produce a stronger national climate action plan. Signatories to the Paris accord were meant to submit updated plans to cut emissions and adapt to worsening extreme weather and rising seas by the end of 2020 - but due to delays caused by the pandemic only about 70 have done so. The rest of the plans are expected to be delivered by the time of the postponed COP26 UN climate conference, set to be hosted by Britain in November. READ: Singapore welcomes US return to Paris Agreement on climate change: MFA The good news for Biden is that support for climate action is growing among the US electorate. A December survey of nearly 950 registered voters across the political spectrum found 75 per cent supported US participation in the Paris accord. In addition, 64 per cent said the United States should reduce planet-heating emissions regardless of what other countries do, the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication and the George Mason University Center for Climate Change Communication found. Last week, the Rhodium Group of researchers and analysts said US greenhouse gas emissions fell 10.3 per cent in 2020, the largest drop in the post-World War II era, as COVID-19 crippled the economy. But it warned the dip was not a clear indication that the United States could meet its more ambitious pledge under the Paris Agreement, to cut emissions 28 per cent below 2005 levels by 2025. Biden has said he plans to set the country on a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, something a growing number of major economies are now promising to do. READ: Commentary - Joe Biden takes office in pivotal moment for climate action. Can he deliver? But he will first need to announce an emissions-cutting target for 2030 - one experts say must be in the order of 50 per cent below 2005 levels to give the world a chance of holding global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the lower Paris goal. Youth activists and some green groups have called for even more ambitious targets, saying the United States should aim to reach net-zero emissions by 2040 if it is to do its \"fair share\" to fight climate change. \"The United States is the second-largest emitter of carbon emissions from fossil fuels annually and the largest source of cumulative emissions to date. Yet for decades it has not done its fair share to rein in emissions,\" said Cleetus of the UCS. CLIMATE FINANCE Dipti Bhatnagar, coordinator of climate justice and energy programs for Friends of the Earth International, said high-carbon lifestyles in the United States had contributed to \"untold suffering\" for families in the developing world. \"Droughts are destroying crops, cyclones are levelling homes, and whole nations are literally disappearing,\" the Mozambican said. \"The livelihoods and dignity of billions of people who didn't create the climate crisis require the Biden administration to take immediate and far-reaching climate action, driven by justice, equity and science.\" READ: Commentary - Five years since Paris Agreement, world must get ambitious on climate action Climate finance experts want Biden's government to make good on a promise to the Green Climate Fund, which helps developing nations adopt clean energy and adapt to a warmer world. Trump refused to deliver US$2 billion of an earlier pledge to the fund - and campaigners are now hoping to see this money come through, as well as increased finance for poorer nations to develop cleanly and build their resilience to climate impacts. Greenpeace's Morgan said the United States should commit in its new climate action plan not to back further development of dirty energy - coal, oil or gas - both on its own territory and overseas. \"Fossil fuels are like weapons of mass destruction - they need to be kept in the ground,\" she said. - Reuters/dv</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-14009598</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61TK-7D71-JCDN-136D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1055\"/><timeReceived>2:52 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 MCN International Pte Ltd.

Of its 54 countries, only South Africa has set a net-zero aim - and failure to revamp policies to benefit from a global low-carbon shift may mean Africa misses out on investment, said Wendy Hughes, a carbon markets manager at the World Bank Group. But officials from the continent noted that with sub-Saharan Africa currently producing less than 4 per cent of global emissions, \"carbon-cutting\" goals have limited relevance, with most African nations focused instead on creating jobs and economic growth. READ: Climate change action may seem 'optional' or 'too expensive' amid COVID-19 economic fallout: UK Ambassador to ASEAN LISTEN: The politics and path forward for international cooperation on climate mitigation With international investment already lacking in Africa - and some countries burned by disappointing promises of cash from sluggish carbon markets - many African countries are struggling to see net-zero policy as a priority, they added. </p><p>\"Without the financing, it's hard to have that incentive,\" said Damilola Ogunbiyi, special representative of the UN secretary-general for Sustainable Energy for All, noting investment in low-carbon energy systems in Africa had lagged. \"The funding is just not there,\" she said. Globally, a growing flood of countries, cities and regions from China to the European Union have set zero-carbon emissions targets over the last year or two, said Helen Mountford, vice president for climate and economics at the Washington-based World Resources Institute. More than 1,000 major companies also have committed to emissions cuts in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, as have over 30 large investment groups managing US$5 trillion, she said. As those governments and companies put their plans in place, Africa could see both risks and benefits - from being shut out of tightening supply chains to winning a big share of carbon offset cash, African analysts told an online event during London Climate Action Week. \"CARBON-POSITIVE\" GABON Officials said Africa, with its key Congo Basin forests, is well-positioned to tap into new, fast-growing markets for carbon credits, which are sold to compensate for emissions elsewhere. Lee White, Gabon's environment minister, said his Central African nation, which has protected its forests carefully, was already absorbing 1 million more tonnes of carbon dioxide a year than it emitted. READ: Climate change poses growing threats to vulnerable Africa, UN says READ: Climate change spurs doubling of disasters since 2000 - UN \"We don't think about net zero. We think about how we maintain our net-positive contribution to climate change,\" he said. But having financial incentives for safeguarding forests is crucial, he added - from ensuring what timber is cut is processed at home, creating jobs and income, to tapping into carbon markets as companies globally seek to offset emissions they cannot manage to eliminate. \"That's how we're going to get the Gabonese people and therefore Gabonese politicians thinking about how you maintain these forests. The forests have to become a valuable resource for us,\" White said. Without a clear financial incentive to keep forests standing and \"make the Congo Basin forests work for the Congo Basin people and countries\", no amount of aid or conservation grants will protect them, he said.

These are good investments,\" he said. For him, such finance is \"a much better way forward\" than seeking help from the Green Climate Fund, which gives loans and grants for developing countries to grow cleanly and adapt to climate change impacts. LOW INVESTMENT Ogunbiyi, of Sustainable Energy for All, said the lack of clean energy investment in countries like Gabon - with good low-carbon policies in place and political stability - was worrying. In a continent where about 565 million people still live without electrical power, for instance, providing access to any source of electricity will take priority over providing it cleanly if green energy investment is not available, she said. READ: Look beyond forests for cost-effective nature restoration, governments urged READ: Death threats, intimidation not a deterrence to scientist's mission to save Indonesia forests \"They're not waiting for the best solution in the world - they're just waiting for a dignified life,\" she added. In largely coal-powered South Africa, which generates about half the continent's planet-heating emissions, achieving a national net-zero goal will require major investment in shifting fossil-fuel workers to new clean energy jobs, said Joanne Yawitch, CEO of the country's National Business Initiative. Many African nations are interested in low-carbon growth - but few have received anywhere near enough finance to make it a reality, added Anthony Nyong, director of climate change and green growth for the African Development Bank. Meanwhile, initial payments for storing carbon have proved a disappointment in some countries, said Mithika Mwenda, executive director of the Pan-African Climate Justice Alliance. In Kenya, some farmers were promised payments for changing their practices to store more carbon in their soils and farm trees - but as the market price for carbon collapsed, they received little reward for their efforts, Mwenda said. The burden of addressing climate change, he said, must fall predominantly on the world's biggest and richest emitters, not on Africa or other poor nations. \"We cannot allow the developed countries to live their profligate lifestyles and think they can solve the climate crisis by asking farmers in Kenya and Gabon to absorb that carbon,\" he said. \"Even if you turn the whole of Africa green as an offset, I can assure you, we will not solve the climate change crisis.\" - Reuters/ic</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-13593808</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61B6-PT51-JCDN-14VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1061\"/><timeReceived>11:48 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.

During campaigning, Pennsylvania received a lot of attention from both presidential candidates. The state sits atop the Marcellus shale, a major source of natural gas; it is the second-largest producer of natural gas in the US, after Texas. </p><p>The industry employs about 32,000 people in Pennsylvania, but clean energy is among the fastest growing sectors in the state. Some speculated that Biden's stance on fossil fuel divestment, especially his comments during the final presidential debate on moving away from fossil fuels, might have turned away voters worried about their job security in these key states. Yet, the election results have shown the opposite.

The principal policy he proposed was to stop federal subsidies to the oil and gas industry. After the debate, Biden's team clarified that his proposal means a gradual phase-out of fossil fuels and he would not impose bans on the oil and gas industry. In short, Biden has been strategically ambiguous about the timeline of decarbonising the US economy. He supports the idea of achieving net-zero emissions in the US by 2050, yet serious questions remain whether his budget-saving and market-oriented approach to fighting climate change would effectively discourage a carbon rebound after the COVID-19 pandemic. In June, Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency, issued a stern warning that \"the world only has six months to avert climate crisis\" - a post-lockdown rebound in global greenhouse gas emissions would substantially derail the global targets set by the Paris climate agreement signed in 2016. The US officially left the agreement on Nov 5, but Biden has promised that it will rejoin. In light of such policy recommendations, Biden's reliance on market mechanisms to slowly phase out fossil fuels presents, at best, a moderate approach to decarbonisation.

During the final presidential debate, Biden repeatedly emphasised that he did not oppose fracking and would prefer to explore technical solutions to cut methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. There are few readily available solutions for reducing the methane pollution associated with the fracking process. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas - 84 times more powerful than carbon dioxide in the first two decades after its release. Averting a looming climate catastrophe demands an immediate ban on fracking. READ: Commentary: To combat climate change, investors should keep their shares in fossil fuels VOTER PREFERENCES ON FOSSIL FUEL DIVESTMENT Biden is by no means an environmental radical, but the GOP's portrayal of his support for fossil fuel divestment had the potential to damage his election performance in Texas and Pennsylvania. Previous research has addressed the pros and cons of fossil fuel divestment as a climate action tactic, the strong support it receives within higher education and its implications for climate justice. But there is no in-depth information available on undecided and conservative voters' perceptions on fossil fuel divestment. Prior to this election, climate change was a peripheral concern during presidential campaigns and debates. Scientific American highlighted that climate change received more attention during the first Trump versus Biden debate than in any other presidential debate in history. Comparing this year's election results with the final polling average and previous election results, two divergent trends emerge. In Colorado, which produces the most shale oil and gas in the US, voters remain supportive of Biden. Despite being defeated in Texas, the Democratic share of popular votes there increased to 46.4 per cent this year from 43.2 per cent in 2016. The results suggest one of two things: Either Biden's talk of fossil fuel divestment did not substantially change voters' minds, or it led to larger voter turnouts of progressive young voters. LISTEN: US election: A bitter fight for the soul of the world's most powerful nation READ: Commentary: The world has big expectations for a Joe Biden presidency The results in Ohio and Pennsylvania followed the same trend. Although Biden's performance in both states has been worse than the national polling average numbers, he gained a larger share of votes than Hillary Clinton in 2016. In Pennsylvania, Biden has managed to win 49.8 per cent of the votes, which is a solid performance considering Trump's strong pro-fracking push in Pennsylvania days before the election. At the county level, the dynamics become more complicated. In the southwest and northeast corners of the state where fracking activities concentrate, Trump held a decisive lead. In Bradford County, one of the most fracked places on the planet, Trump received over 70 per cent of the votes. READ: Commentary: Don't forget record numbers of Americans voted for Donald Trump Although election results suggest that fossil fuel divestment did not negatively impact Biden's overall election performance, it remains a pivotal and polarising topic for many states, and could be a challenge for future progressive contenders. Does such a political dilemma mean little political actions against the fracking industry and its lobbyists in the near future? We have to patiently wait for the next administration's climate policies. Sibo Chen is Assistant Professor at the School of Professional Communication, Ryerson University.

The United Nations official behind the deal, Christiana Figueres, said afterwards that it had \u00e2  ignited a huge flame of hope\u00e2  after two decades of tortuous negotiations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The signatories all committed to cut their carbon emissions in order to limit global warming to \u00e2  well below\u00e2  2\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial times, if not 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C. Today, that promise has not only failed to materialise but total emissions have climbed compared to three decades ago, according to news emerging from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experts meeting in late November at a dialogue of the global forum on the climate crisis revealed that the aggregate greenhouse gas emissions of developed nations, excluding economies in transition, will actually be higher in 2020 than they were in 1990.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00e2  This sombre fact demonstrates that the world\u00e2  s most advanced developed countries not only failed to reduce their emissions to zero in the 30-year period from 1990 to 2020, but collectively failed to reduce their emissions at all,\u00e2  Dr Gary W Theseira, technical adviser to the Malaysian Green Technology and Climate Change Centre (MGTC), says in a note to The Edge.</p><p>Given the dire consequences of this trend, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00c3\u00b3nio Guterres had to leave no room for doubt on the action needed to address the situation. Speaking at the opening of the Climate Ambition summit, a virtual event to mark the fifth year since the Paris climate pact was signed, Guterres called on governments to declare a \u00e2  state of climate emergency\u00e2  and to fulfil their promises to slash carbon pollution as they recover from the Covid-19 pandemic, the France24 news channel reported.</p><p>\u00e2  If we don\u00e2  t change course, we may be headed for a catastrophic temperature rise of more than 3\u00c2\u00b0C this century,\u00e2  he said on Dec 12.</p><p>Theseira draws attention to the gross negligence of the richest nations and companies highlighted in a report by public interest groups in October entitled \u00e2  NOT ZERO: How \u00e2  net zero\u00e2   targets disguise climate inaction\u00e2  (see illustration). When read together with the report by these climate justice groups, he says, the UNFCCC experts\u00e2   dialogue \u00e2  illustrates how the most profitable and deeply entrenched emissions are enabled, supported and even justified by the lowest cost emissions reductions measures\u00e2 .</p><p>Among other things, the Not Zero technical briefing points out that there is simply not enough available land on the planet to accommodate all of the combined corporate and government \u00e2  net zero\u00e2  plans for offsets and carbon capture and storage tree plantations, says Theseira.</p><p>To raise the profile of the climate emergency in the public eye, Climate Governance Malaysia (CGM) \u00e2 \" an initiative that aims to bring corporate boards up to speed about their responsibilities on climate resilience and sustainability \u00e2 \" has brought various stakeholders together to highlight the state of play as we mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement.</p><p>CGM\u00e2  s efforts are reflected in the views expressed by opinion leaders in this feature, including commentaries from the ambassadors of France and Sweden (see \u00e2  Do the right thing before it is too late\u00e2  and \u00e2  Creating a fossil-free nation\u00e2 ).</p><p>\u00e2  We\u00e2  re now entering into what is likely to be the most critical decade in the history of humanity. In order for there to be a viable future for this planet, we need to take meaningful steps in the multi-decade carbon transition, which will be both deeply complicated and uncomfortable for many,\u00e2  said CGM founder Datin Seri Sunita Rajakumar and CEO Action Network Working Group chair Luanne Sieh in an op-ed to mark the anniversary.</p><p>Notwithstanding the climate justice movement\u00e2  s criticism of net zero goals as a false solution, the majority of nations and a growing number of corporations are rallying to the UN secretary-general\u00e2  s call to commit to carbon neutrality by mid-century. The EU, Japan and South Korea, together with more than 110 other countries, have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050 while China says it will do so before 2060.</p><p>For PwC Malaysia executive chairman Datuk Mohammad Faiz Azmi, the target sets the world in the right direction, pointing the way ahead for corporations to take. \u00e2  While there has been much discussion on climate awareness, green financing and a move towards environmental, social and governance (ESG) disclosures, real change will only materialise if they are embedded as national and corporate commitments. One way to do this is to adopt a net zero emissions target as a first step,\u00e2  he says in an email to The Edge.</p><p>Major corporations are pushing the envelope. In October, Petroliam Nasional Bhd (Petronas) became the first oil company in Asia to commit to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and CIMB Group Holdings Bhd recently announced its commitment to phase out coal from its portfolio by 2040.</p><p>Says Mohammad Faiz, \u00e2  Companies should commit to a net zero emissions target to set the tone from the top. This commitment will encourage the organisation to take a hard look at its business strategy and resource alignment, decide on what can or cannot be reduced and put in place an implementation plan towards achieving its net zero ambition.\u00e2 </p><p>Hard choices about our development path need to be made. As one of only 17 countries in the world that have been identified as having mega biodiversity, attention is focused on deforestation in Malaysia along with other countries in the global south.</p><p>\u00e2  The ongoing destruction of ecosystems, resulting in climate change, is creating pressure to change our land-use approach and produce agricultural crops in a sustainable manner,\u00e2  CGM deputy chair Dr Kalanithi Nesaretnam tells The Edge in an email.</p><p>In Malaysia, 3.9 million hectares of forest have been cleared for oil palm plantations since 1990, she notes.</p><p>By embracing the criteria set by the Roundtable for Sustainable Palm Oil, which is the highest standard for any vegetable oil, and introducing the mandatory Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil standard, the country is on track to persuade critical buyers that Malaysian palm oil is sincerely adopting nature-based solutions to protect its ecosystems, says Kalanithi. \u00e2  The next step is to restore biodiversity in existing oil palm landscapes,\u00e2  she proposes.</p><p>Yet, this is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg as far as climate resilience goes. The nation\u00e2  s to-do list includes a climate change act, a carbon tax, mandatory corporate reporting on climate risks and enough public funding for a pivot to climate mitigation and adaptation measures, says Sunita. \u00e2  Is it too late?\u00e2  she asks.</p><p>\u00e2  The longer we take to start taking real action, the steeper and more drastic the transition will be. This is a transition that needs all of society, including all of the government\u00e2  s attention and will, to act.\u00e2 </p><p>Do the right thing before it is too late</p><p>According to the World Meteorological Organization, this past decade will be the warmest recorded yet. This year is on track to be one of the three hottest on record. The average global temperature in 2020 is set to be about 1.2\u00c2\u00b0C above pre-industrial (1850 to 1900) levels. There is at least a one-in-five chance of it temporarily exceeding 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C by 2024.</p><p>Why mention the 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C threshold? Because we all committed five years ago, in the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, to contain the rise in temperature at well below 2\u00c2\u00b0C and to strive to limit it to 1.5\u00c2\u00b0C by the end of the century. If our pledges \u00e2 \" the so-called Intended Nationally Determined Contributions \u00e2 \" stay what they are now, we will reach a global warming of over 3\u00c2\u00b0C, and miss our target.</p><p>The detrimental effects of climate change on the environment should not be seen as something too far away to care about. They are already jeopardising our livelihood. In some ocean basins, sea levels have risen to 20cm since the start of the satellite record in 1993. This trend is alarming for countries like Malaysia, where 70% of the population lives in coastal zones.</p><p>Regarding biodiversity, if we follow a business-as-usual approach, 20% to 30% of animal and plant species will be directly threatened by extinction. The heat waves and droughts are getting more frequent, impacting our water supplies and agriculture. On this current path, by the end of this century, what used to be once-in-20-years extreme heat days are projected to occur every two or three years.</p><p>Yet a gloom-and-doom attitude is not appropriate. Now is the time to act together. The Covid-19 crisis is an opportunity to take a step back and put climate at the top of our priorities.</p><p>We have to reset this new decade on a positive agenda. That is exactly why France, the UK and the UN, in partnership with Chile and Italy, decided to organise a virtual summit on Dec 12 to upgrade our pledges before the next Conference of the Parties to the Agreement in Glasgow in 2021.</p><p>Moreover, France has been pushing recently for an increase in the EU\u00e2  s pledge with a new target of a 55% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 compared with 1990 in order to align our commitments with the Paris Agreement. France is also supporting the ongoing transformation of the European Investment Bank into a European Climate Bank, which should make it possible to mobilise \u00e2 \u00ac1 trillion by 2030 in favour of ecological transition.</p><p>Turning the economy around is not only a necessity but also a great opportunity to create local jobs, generate growth and unleash innovation. The green transition is the next industrial revolution.</p><p>This crisis is an opportunity to make our economies greener and more resilient to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. Among them is the unavoidable energy transition to reach SDG No 7, which is to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services by 2030.</p><p>Everyone is responsible for this change. Let\u00e2  s not waste the next decade and do this the right way.</p><p>Creating a fossil-free nation</p><p>The world\u00e2  s largest asset management company BlackRock recently conducted a survey among its clients around the world in order to better understand the tectonic shift in capital towards sustainable assets that is presently taking place. Its findings were clear, namely that investors recognise the importance of sustainable investing to risk-adjusted returns and are backing up this conviction with their asset allocation plans. Of the respondents, 86% stated that sustainable investing is already \u00e2 \" or will become \u00e2 \" central to their investment strategies.</p><p>So, climate is king and sustainable business is here to stay! And it does not matter if a company operates globally or is limited to its domestic market. For long-term profitability, sustainability is a necessary and worthwhile investment. Let me share some of the things that are happening in my country Sweden in the industry sector with a focus on climate action.</p><p>Sweden is aiming to be one of the world\u00e2  s first fossil-free welfare nations. Our long-term target is to have zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2045 at the latest and to achieve negative net emissions after that. One piece of the puzzle to achieve this ambitious goal is Fossil-free Sweden, which is a government initiative launched prior to the global climate summit in Paris in 2015 with a clear message: \u00e2  Sweden can and will be fossil-free\u00e2 . Under the Fossil-free Sweden umbrella, 22 industrial sectors have developed roadmaps showing how they can become fossil-free or climate-neutral while at the same time boosting their competitiveness. Based on this, Fossil-free Sweden now aims to identify and reduce obstacles for several upcoming industrial projects that will contribute to more jobs and greater welfare in Sweden while also providing the greatest global climate benefit.</p><p>The most talked-about projects so far are the HYBRIT development project in which steelmaker SSAB, iron ore producer LKAB and electricity producer Vattenfall are collaborating on a process to enable the reduction of steel from iron ore using hydrogen instead of carbon, and Northvolt, which will be Europe\u00e2  s biggest battery factory focusing on sustainability and recycling. Other industry sectors, such as aviation, cement, concrete, forest, construction and heavy road haulage, have also adopted roadmaps describing how they will become fossil-free and which technologies need to be developed.</p><p>In order to achieve this, the industry will need access to renewable energy. Today, more than 54% of Sweden\u00e2  s energy production comes from renewable sources. One important part is our waste management system, where 99.2% of household waste is reused or recycled. A lot of the waste is used to produce biofuel, district heating and electricity and many city buses run on biogas derived from waste and municipal sewage. In recent years, we have also seen an increase in the use of heat pumps, another contribution to a greater proportion of our energy coming from renewable sources. In the electricity sector, hydropower constitutes the main source of renewable energy, although we have seen huge investments in onshore and offshore wind farms in Sweden in the last couple of years.</p><p>And we can see that access to green and affordable electricity has attracted more investments to Sweden, for example in green batteries.

He lamented that G20 countries were channelling 50 per cent more of their COVID-19 stimulus to sectors related to fossil fuels, compared to those using low-carbon energy. Indeed, some would argue G20 countries are advanced economies today because they have burnt fossil fuels and contributed most of the man-made carbon dioxide emissions causing climate change. Most would argue the moral burden is on G20 countries to support adaptation and mitigation efforts across the world, especially in developing countries. READ: Commentary: Five years since Paris Agreement, world must get ambitious on climate action READ: Commentary: Big oil and coal exporters face reckoning as Paris Agreement turns five COUNTING BOTH METHANE AND CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS As a scientist who studies the Earth's climate, my first instinct is to look for evidence that rich countries today account for most of the world's historical carbon dioxide emissions. From publicly accessible data at OurWorldinData.org, the seven leading economies that have emitted the most carbon dioxide from 1751 to 2017 (from before the start of the Industrial Revolution until now), are: The US (399 billion tonnes), European Union nations (353 billion tonnes), China (200 billion tonnes), Russia (101 billion tonnes), Japan (62 billion tonnes), India (48 billion tonnes), and Canada (32 billion tonnes). These are also among the top eight economies by gross domestic product (GDP) in 2019. However, carbon dioxide is not the only man-made greenhouse gas (GHG) that causes climate change. </p><p>While it makes up 76 per cent, methane accounts for another 16 per cent of the annual global GHG emission of 49 gigatonnes of equivalent carbon dioxide in 2010, according to the fifth and most recent Assessment Report of the Inter-governmental Panel for Climate Change. Although human society emits annually much less methane than carbon dioxide, methane absorbs about 30 times more radiant energy in a period of 100 years, which means one tonne of methane is roughly equivalent to 30 tonnes of carbon dioxide for its 100-year global warming potential. How could climate change reshape your dinner? Listen to an expert break it down on The Climate Conversations podcast: (sl) TCC food As about half of anthropogenic methane comes from agriculture today, and this fraction was even higher in pre-industrial times, even ancient agrarian societies must be held responsible for methane emissions. But how far back the timeline should stretch is unclear. The Agricultural Revolution took place about 12,000 years ago, when mankind largely abandoned hunter-gatherer lifestyles and started planting crops and herding animals. Modern nations began taking shape many millennia later. Even then, agricultural production data across societies were not collected or preserved for the most part in history. READ: Commentary: Save forests or build 4-rooms? It's not a zero-sum game READ: Commentary: Let Singapore's green spaces grow wild DEVELOPING COUNTRIES' EMISSIONS WILL ECLIPSE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES' Current GHG emissions are just as important to climate change as past emissions. The G20 nations include large, fast-developing economies which have seen some of the most rapid growth in recent years, like China, India, South Africa, Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia, which will continue to emit much GHG until 2100 and beyond. For the remainder of this century, many Asian, South American and African countries outside the G20 are also projected to accelerate their industrialisation and agricultural production. Some of their future economies would no doubt be big enough to challenge G20 members. Non-G20 nations together already make up about 27 per cent of the world's GDP in 2019, larger than the leading G20 economy, the US, which accounts for about 16 per cent. If they continue to exploit fossil fuels, especially natural gas which is cleaner than coal and oil, and perpetuate methane-producing farming practices, future history will only recount how one leading group of GHG-emitting nations was replaced by another group. With proper planning, mitigation efforts today can be tailored to cost less than projected costs of adaptation to avoid the potential loss of life and property, and to replace damaged ecosystem services under future climate change scenarios. Therefore, it is in the economic interest of non-G20 countries to finance in part their own shift towards renewable energies and sustainable agriculture today.

READ: Commentary: China's move on climate action signals arrival as a 'hybrid superpower' HARD TO PIN DOWN RESPONSIBILITY FOR USING FOSSIL FUELS We often personify nations as though they are morally responsible for an action like an individual is. But the people comprising a nation at present are entirely different from those centuries ago. To say that citizens of a nation today enjoy the fruits of past generations - and hence inherit the moral burden of their forebears - also ignores the fact that those fruits benefited people beyond that nation's border, due to international trade. For example, in the early 1800s, steam-powered cotton mills in England burnt coal for energy and produced textile that were exported and used all over the world. Furthermore, in the 19th and most of the 20th century, fossil fuels were the only technologically feasible and commercially available large-scale energy source that could reliably power entire industries and raise living standards. In this sense, the historical carbon dioxide emissions were an \"unavoidable evil\" in the pursuit of economic growth. (Let's also not forget the earliest scientific results providing evidence for the global warming effect of carbon dioxide was only published in 1896 by Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius, long after fossil fuel adoption has become widespread across the world.) Likewise, we should also expect poorer countries to continue using fossil fuels if they receive no technological or economic assistance today to access renewable energies. READ: Commentary: Singapore could be a model for cooler cities in a world heating up READ: Commentary: Importing electricity from Malaysia is a good thing G20 NATIONS ALREADY STEPPING UP CLIMATE COMMITMENTS Attributing which economies should bear the cost of historical emissions seems an impossible task. The good news is there is general consensus that G20 nations should bear more of the economic and technological burden for climate change, as with most challenges involving global commons, since they have the resources to do so. This is one of the longest standing social contract regarding climate action. At the same time, non-G20 nations must act responsibly because they are now aware that GHG emissions cause the Earth to warm up. They should actively conserve forests, pursue renewable energies, and adopt sustainable agriculture with assistance from G20 nations. The EU and China, the second and third largest cumulative emitters of carbon dioxide, have taken the lead in pledging ambitious climate actions at the recent 75th United Nations General Assembly. READ: Commentary: Little smoke this haze season - but fires rage on in Indonesia The US, as the largest cumulative emitter, soon under a new presidency, is poised to make a comeback to the 2015 Paris Agreement. From a pragmatic perspective, climate justice is best served if countries can get serious on collective climate action and invest in protecting the one world we live in, for the sake of us all.

Super Typhoon Goni - known locally as Rolly - barrelled across the southern part of Luzon, the country's largest and most populous island, on Oct 30 leaving at least 25 people dead, nearly one million affected and extensive damage to infrastructure and agricultural land. Tens of thousands of homes were damaged, their occupants left stranded in evacuation centres. Overall, the bill is estimated to well exceed US$200 million. As the recovery process continued, Typhoon Vamco hit and caused major flooding in Manila on Thursday (Nov 12). At least 27 lives were lost. </p><p>Vamco was the 21st typhoon to hit the Philippines this year. For a population left reeling by COVID-19, it has been another sapping few weeks. Typhoons in the Philippines are becoming more regular, more intense and unpredictable. While damaging weather patterns are highly complex and multi-faceted, the science is all but settled on the climate-related factors that are contributing to the more frequent emergence of monster typhoons. About a quarter of the world's typhoons hit the Philippines, and while their number is not expected to rise in the years to come, because of climate change, they will hit harder and move along paths that are difficult to predict and prepare for. Between 2006 and 2016, 99 typhoons entered the Philippines; 10 of them were particularly deadly, most notably Typhoon Haiyan which killed at least 6,000 people in 2013. \"Most of the typhoons are intensifying, especially in the last quarter of the year. We are experiencing stronger typhoons than before and we can attribute it to the warming of the sea surface temperature and the warming of the atmosphere,\" said Esperanza Cayanan from the Office of the Deputy Administrator for Research and Development at PAGASA, the Philippines' national meteorological agency. \"Projecting our future is really scary. But we have to prepare. We have to think of ways to protect ourselves knowing we have these projections,\" she said. Warmer water, which is a symptom of climate change, helps give tropical typhoons their energy. The presence of the La Ni\u00f1a atmospheric phenomenon as a result of the cooling of sea surface temperature in the central Pacific Ocean means warmer waters currently persist around the Philippines, accelerating the formation of typhoons. As global temperatures increase, so too does the ability of the atmosphere to hold water vapour - the air can hold about 7 per cent more for every single degree rise. It means heavier rains being dumped over a typhoon's path. \"In the next century, tropical cyclones, such as Super Typhoon Haiyan will become the norm,\" said Associate Professor William Holden, a field expert from the University of Calgary's Department of Geography and Environmental Science Program. It presents big problems for highly vulnerable communities, who may have grown accustomed to regular storms but are equally fearful of the big ones. About 80 per cent of the country's population lives within 50km of the coast, where sea level rise is expected to become a growing issue. READ: Singapore to contribute US$200,000 in disaster relief for ASEAN nations hit by typhoon, floods Higher storm surges, which was the main cause of Typhoon Haiyan's destruction, will exponentially increase across islands of the archipelago, which are already witnessing higher-than-average sea level rise, making the Philippines one of the places most prone to land loss in the world. \"Sea level rise will see islands removed from the map. Looking at the Philippines, being an archipelago prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, we do not find many safe places anymore,\" said Cayanan of PAGASA. The casualty rate from Goni was relatively low compared to previous disasters, but that should not distract from its pure power and the need to better understand future risk, says Dr Antonio La Vi\u00f1a, environmental policy expert and executive director of the Manila Observatory. \"It's always a misperception when not too many people die because then we think it's not really serious when it is in fact,\" he said. \"The way I describe it is that Rolly destroyed one third of the island of Luzon.\" \"WE ARE TIRED OF BEING TOLD WE ARE RESILIENT\" Despite high prevailing levels of poverty across much of the Philippines, the regularity of damaging weather has seen its people gain a reputation for their ability to bounce back. While admirable, La Vi\u00f1a of the Manila Observatory says it has led to apathy among policymakers and authorities. \"We are tired of being told we are resilient. You have to change the situation that allows this to happen,\" he said. \"Resilience is a good thing if it's not an excuse for not doing the right things before the storms hit: when resilience is misused to justify negligence. \"You have to fix the systems in place so that people do not have to start all over again every time there's a storm. People are tired of being told this okay.\" Awareness is growing among the wider community about the havoc climate change is already wreaking. Regular storms on the horizon that were once simply part of life in this part of the world are now a reason to fear.

Policy makers and ordinary people finally woke up to the perils of climate change,\" said Dr Rodel Lasco, executive director of The Oscar M Lopez Center for Climate Change Adaptation and Disaster Risk Management Foundation. \"Moving forward, more intense typhoons will expose more of our vulnerabilities,\" he said. PAGASA is playing a leading role in awareness and education campaigns, particularly among young people. But \"experience is the best teacher\", according to Cayanan. \"It's very difficult to educate the public. Their memory of extreme events is only for a short period of time. But we are doing our best,\" she said. \"If you experience extreme events in your life, you will remember and you should pass that experience to the next generation.\" CHANGES TO CLIMATE ACTION POLICIES While typhoon mitigation is a work in progress, the Philippines has taken recent steps to be more proactive in a global problem. The country's climate action policies do not currently align with goals of the Paris Agreement, mainly due to the growth of the coal industry, but changes are afoot. The Department of Energy last month declared a moratorium on all new planned coal projects, with the aim of modernising the country's power generation on the back of cleaner and cheaper renewables. Energy security has been a problem with frequent network-wide outages in recent years, an issue that experts believe renewables can help solve, while also reducing national emissions. Still, it remains a country highly exposed to climate change, without contributing significantly to the global problem. \"Thus this becomes a discussion of 'climate justice',\" said Holden of the University of Calgary. Like many developing countries, working out ways to get compensated for climate damage caused by higher polluting nations is an important agenda.

Then we can build better,\" La Vi\u00f1a said, while at the same time rejecting the notion that \"relatively low emissions\" can be an excuse for domestic inaction. \"The Philippines itself has to do its part because we cannot contribute to our own destruction,\" he said. \"We are not reducing our emissions considerably and there's a lot of space to do that in energy, forestry and agriculture without any real burden on us. In fact it could make our economy stronger. It's just that there's inaction at that level. \"Inside the Philippines we need to get the science better and eliminate the risks in some places by moving people early and changing our land use patterns,\" he said, adding that land reclamation actually makes the country more vulnerable. Many of the natural defences that the country had against disasters have been wiped out by human activity. Mangrove forests have been cleared and large-scale mining allowed to destabilise the earth and poison coral reefs. Reversing those trends and fast will be key for the Philippines if it wants to withstand the coming storm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNA-13525650</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6192-7DX1-JCDN-131X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">234507</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1433\"/><timeReceived>10:01 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 MCN International Pte Ltd.
