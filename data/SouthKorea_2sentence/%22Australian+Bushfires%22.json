EPA-Yonhap The deadly Australian bushfires are a reminder that we are open to the same threatBy Ko Dong-hwan Youn Ho-joong, Director General of the NIFOS forest conservation department. If there is a lesson to be learned from Australia's horrendous bushfires, it is that a bushfire, once combined with enough fuel, wind and oxygen, can become humanly unstoppable. And a disaster similar to that in Australia, which since June 2019 has burnt almost 19 million hectares of forest in the southeastern states, killed about 1 billion wild animals and more than 30 people and displaced 100,000 residents, can also happen in Korea, according to local experts. The country's uneven and mountainous terrain and the worldwide climate change can trigger \u00e2\u20ac\u0153major\u00e2\u20ac bushfires \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 a disaster category for a fire that burns 100 hectares or more.Korea's state forest researchers believe that because mountain forests make up 64 percent of the country's land, forests are mostly near human habitats, and increasingly hotter air due to the climate change can start fires more easily.And really, the country would have been helpless in front of the Australian bushfires which destroyed an area almost three times as large as the entire Korean forest region, according to the Korea Forest Service.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because our land is small and citizens' living spaces are close to forests, people have suffered from bushfires many times,\u00e2\u20ac Youn Ho-joong, director-general of the forest conservation department of the National Institute of Forest Science (NIFOS) under the forest service, told The Korea Times.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153And most of our trees were artificially planted to replace destroyed forests (from the 1972 national afforestation project following hundreds of years of stripping mountains of trees in search of energy and food) and haven't grown mature yet.\u00e2\u20ac The bushfire from April 2000 in Gangneung and other east coastal cities in Gangwon Province is recorded as the largest in the country's history. </p><p>Courtesy of Gangwon Ilbo A hotter, dryer atmosphere with low humidity resulting from global climate change increases the risk of disaster. In the 1900s, the number of days when bushfires occurred in Korea had averaged 109 a year, according to the NIFOS. In the 2000s, the figure jumped to 126 days. The institute believes this could be due to climate change.According to the institute's local bushfire risk forecast using its climate change-based scenario HAPPI (Half a degree Additional warming, Prognosis and Projected Impacts), the disaster risk has increased in the past 40 years. The findings also showed that whenever the country's temperature increased by 1.5 degree Celsius, bushfire frequency and intensity increase as well.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because days of bushfire breakout increased to 126 days, the forest service has asked our institute whether to extend the country's official bushfire warning period by 17 days,\u00e2\u20ac Youn said. The period, officially set due to seasonal climate conditions, begins near spring in February. If extended, it will last until June instead of May. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That is an incredible administrative pressure on local jurisdictions nationwide because it will enforce additional around-the-clock work duties to related personnel,\u00e2\u20ac Youn said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153That's a financial burden to the central government as well.\u00e2\u20acClimate change affects more than just bushfires; the causal relation also works reciprocally, creating a chain reaction. The NIFOS found that each hectare of burning forest emits 54 tons of carbon emission \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 equivalent to the yearly emission from seven cars \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 which is a major contributor to global warming. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We are considering expanding our institute's bushfire prevention department to a separate bureau because we anticipate the disasters will occur more often,\u00e2\u20ac Youn said. A view from a firefighting helicopter shows smoke from a bushfire that has spread into mountain valleys. Courtesy of NIFOS Throughout the past decade, Korea each year has had more than 430 bushfires on average. The figure in the past three years jumped to 526. During the decade, almost 30 times the area of Yeouido (290 hectares) burned. The largest bushfire in the country's history came in April 2000, when 23,794 hectares \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 the size of 35,000 football fields \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 near five east coastal cities in Gangwon Province, including Gangneung, Donghae and Samcheok, were ablaze for eight days. Winds reached 23 meters per second, 850 residents lost their homes and damage totaled 36 billion won ($29.7 million). The same region in 2017, 2018 and 2019, Gangwon's Goseong County in 1996, and South Chungcheong Province's Cheongyang and Yesan Counties in 2002 also saw major bushfires that each burned from 1,000 to 3,800 hectares. The fires all occurred during the warning period. The NIFOS analysis report released in 2019 said the threats of major bushfire \u00e2\u20ac\u0153have grown year after year recently.\u00e2\u20ac It added that the fires were mostly human errors and rarely caused by natural occurrences like lightening, friction or fermentation.

Courtesy of NIFOS With the country's relatively small area, concentrated population and thick density of mountain forest over 6.4 million hectares, bushfires in Korea must be contained early before they spread and cause irreversible damage. Youn likened the disaster to the rampant coronavirus outbreak (COVID-19) here \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 once spread to so many victims, it runs out of control.And in Korean forests, of which 41 percent are needle leaf trees \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 mostly pines \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 that are vulnerable to bushfire, crown fires can easily occur; this most lethal category of bushfire can consume a series of entire tree tops.Korea has developed strong mechanical arrangement for early containment, from technical hardware at the forefront of battlefields to smart forecast technologies in control towers and on the ground.The main and indispensable means are helicopters, which are first sent to every major bushfire with thousands of liters of extinguisher before ground units can approach. This has been the basic counter-bushfire strategy \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 catching crown fires with helicopters and leaving the rest to ground forces.As of February 2020, there are 167 firefighting helicopters. The forest service owns 49, while the National Fire Agency runs 28, the Ministry of National Defense 20, with the rest operated by the National Police Agency, national parks and local governments. The helicopters are kept in 12 cities and counties.The most destructive and expensive units are S-64, made by America's Erickson and carrying up to 8,000 liters of extinguisher. The forest service owns six and bought two more \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 each worth 27 billion won ($22.2 million) \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 in February this year and stationed them in the east coastal region, where the bushfire threat is greatest. The forest service also has 30 Russian KumAPE KA-32 helicopters with 3,000-liter capacity, which are the agency's main firefighting units.Helicopters do more than drop water-mixed foaming agents that lower the temperature and cut off oxygen \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 they also act as mobile control towers. Their heat-sensing detectors can locate fires, and an aerial view from the choppers' built-in cameras can be simultaneously shared by the forest service, the NIFOS and the presidential office. A firefighter sprays extinguisher on Naksansa Buddhist Temple in Yangyang, Gangwon Province, in April 2005. Korea Times file The latest addition to the flying squadron are heat-sensing drones, which can monitor a bushfire at night. With power-cable attached, they can stay afloat effortlessly and, with a hose hooked up, can also extinguish small fires. The forest service is now developing a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153bomber-drone,\u00e2\u20ac which, with heat-sensing vision, can carry extinguishing bombs weighing 30 kilograms. The agency has also designated nationwide 4,000 water reserves equipped with an anti-freezing facility to supply extinguisher for helicopters, even in winter.Under the sky, about 20,000 personnel across the country plus 330 recently appointed special counter-bushfire squad members monitor signs of bushfire with ample mechanical support. They can climb up to two kilometers up mountains with a motor-pump hose or carrying a pump on their back.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153One of the difficulties for ground units is that, because fires can last more than a day, the firefighters must search for remaining fires or smoke,\u00e2\u20ac said Youn. The job means a meticulous search for hidden signs of fire inside trees or underneath layers of fallen leaves.Fire trucks may be the largest ground units but because they cannot enter mountains they usually just supply water to much smaller one-ton bushfire trucks. These carry up to 80 liters of water and can access topsy-turvy mountain roads. Firefighters, using rakes and carrying pumps on their backs, put out a surface forest fire. Courtesy of NIFOS Evolving measuresAfter a 2005 bushfire in Yangyang, Gangwon, which burned historical Naksansa Buddhist Temple and 973 hectares of nearby forest, the country beefed up unmanned counter-bushfire facilities around national heritage sites and houses near mountains. Water cannon, spraying from 25 meters above ground, were built inside the temple and other locations, while venues and forests were kept apart by 50 meters. Sixty-five kilometers of new forest roads were built to give bushfire trucks' better access to bushfires, while the width of existing 100 kilometer-long forest roads was extended from three to five meters.The NIFOS also forecasts bushfire possibilities in cities and counties across the country based on local climate conditions like wind speed, temperature and humidity. Real-time big data is transferred to digitized maps of the country at the institute's control room where decisions are made. The control room can also check the real-time locations of helicopters and their birds' eye views. Bushfire risk levels in rural counties due to trash incineration \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 one of the minor causes of local bushfires because wind can carry sparks from the burning \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 can also bring warnings, depending on conditions. Bushfire has also been studied at a NIFOS lab in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, since 2018, to see how varying climate conditions can cause bushfires. Youn said a larger lab was being built this year. A model bushfire is tested at a NIFOS lab in Pocheon. Courtesy of NIFOS To better prepare for disaster, the forest service in August 2018 introduced another command tower centered in the country's hottest epicenter region.The East Coastal Forest Fire Center in Gangwon's Gangneung is the country's first large-scale bushfire prevention center under local jurisdictions. With combined experts from forestry, firefighting, police, meteorology and the local government offices, the facility is responsible for the region, where 32 of 49 overall major bushfires from 1991 to 2019 occurred. Nowhere in the country has more types of wind than the east coastal region also known as Yeongdong \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 winds descending from the Taebaek Mountains, winds from the East Sea, the country's most dominant southwesterly wind and mountain valley winds, all of which trigger bushfire. Taebaek also mostly consists of needle leaf trees. The region, according to experts, has all the possible triggers for a bushfire.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Unlike other countries, there are no naturally caused bushfires in Korea,\u00e2\u20ac Youn said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153So we consider bushfires manmade disasters rather than part of a natural cycle, as some argue.

He doesn't have to single out a particular event to recognize that the climate crisis is already here. He can now feel it almost naturally on a daily basis. He expressed it in his latest work, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Love in the Time of Climate Change,\u00e2\u20ac with phrases like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153hot winter,\u00e2\u20ac \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chilly spring,\u00e2\u20ac or elaborated out to a grimmer degree in: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Sophie blocking her ears to stop hearing her skin being grilled under the sun,\u00e2\u20ac or \u00e2\u20ac\u0153getting sunburnt under the morning sunlight without having closed the curtains over the windows last night.\u00e2\u20ac Such vivid depictions put readers at the center of pain and horror against the real world that is becoming more and more unpredictable. </p><p>This unpredictability is such an overwhelming force that, as he points out, even Korea's tech-savvy national meteorological center is sometimes left confused. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153These weather guys, in fact, forecast as they are shrouded in this unpredictability,\u00e2\u20ac Kim told The Korea Times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The climate crisis has already brought us halfway to an apocalyptic society, where we can predict less and less every day.\u00e2\u20acThe short story collection's ground zero consists of various real-life climate issues: rising temperatures, more frequent tornadoes, the effects of greenhouse gases, the Australian bushfires from 2019 that for months burned 14 percent of the world's forests, and global energy firms clashing over their interests. These problems are as close to apocalyptic as humanity has faced so far \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 and it is very clear what direction they will take in the near future.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Before working on this collection, I asked myself a question both desperate and abysmal: since climate crisis is no longer merely the problem of polar bears, but that of ourselves, and a very imminent one, what should I do then, or what can I do now?\u00e2\u20ac Kim said. The cover of \"Love in the Time of Climate Change\" / Courtesy of Minumsa The climate crisis' unfair tolls Published by Minumsa in early April, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Love in the Time of Climate Change\u00e2\u20ac highlights the fact that the climate crisis has varying tolls on people of different social classes, nationalities and ethnicities. It's depicted in the first three works that share the same fictitious world, where some so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153chosen people\u00e2\u20ac with enough money and particular socially acceptable backgrounds are allowed inside an air-conditioned artificial space, under a huge dome that protects residents from the scorching sun, while others who were ostracized or chose to live outside in nature lived outside the dome. The two groups constantly battle. Outsiders dig underground tunnels to reach inside the dome, either to live there or overthrow the society inside; while insiders keep the society safe by preventing the outsiders from coming in. The plot reaches a climax when the outsiders inflate condom-balloons containing explosives and blow them over the dome, shattering its cover. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted to show that the climate crisis is not just an environmental issue, but it will also speed up its unfair tolls (physically and mentally) on different classes of people,\u00e2\u20ac Kim said. He wanted to deliver this message in as entertaining a way as possible. He used characters and settings from various cultures and countries: from survivors in the dome society's apocalyptic world, to an uncivilized mute boy living in a cave, to a polar bear and its cub constantly encountering predators, to a newly formed couple who keep digging a hole and building a tower without any apparent reason, only to get murdered by neighbors. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I wanted to show various aspects of how the climate crisis can affect people's lives and those in various relationships,\u00e2\u20ac said Kim. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153What I didn't want was to overwhelm readers with a bunch of information, because it makes storytelling dull and I am not a news writer.\u00e2\u20ac&lt;iframe width=\"740\" height=\"409\" src=\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DLnhdnSUVs\">https://www.youtube.com/embed/2DLnhdnSUVs</url>\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;Emotion, more powerful than knowledgePrior to writing \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Love in the Time of Climate Change,\u00e2\u20ac Kim was most strongly motivated by a campaign video jointly made by Greenpeace and the Italian pianist and composer Ludovico Einaudi, which alerted viewers about melting icebergs in the Arctic. Titled, \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Elegy for the Arctic,\u00e2\u20ac the three-minute video shows Einaudi playing sorrowful music on a small floating iceberg, while the frozen lands in front of him begin to melt and crack. Kim said that the icebergs in the video \u00e2\u20ac\u0153rip like paper,\u00e2\u20ac a description he used in one of the short stories he wrote about polar bears searching for ways to survive amid melting glaciers. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It's just like the Maldives, where the country gradually loses its land due to rising sea levels,\u00e2\u20ac said Kim. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Arctic is more than just a sheet of ice. It's where people and animals have lived. With the story, I wanted to depict the surreal emotions of the sobbing Earth.\u00e2\u20acUsing his literary imagination, Kim wanted to shatter the status quo, where people, although they have learned enough about climate crisis either voluntarily or by chance, don't go further than learning just the facts. He couldn't find any clues that may lead to resolving this impending phenomenon. So the author tried to shake up the stagnant situation by trying to move people with emotion, not merely by providing them with information.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Fear may not be the most effective method for us to face the climate crisis, but when we face life-or-death situations that force us to decide what we should do in our final moments, what will ultimately drive us to make that final decision is emotion rather than information,\u00e2\u20ac Kim said.If people's minds when they chose not to go further than learning the mere facts about the climate crisis could be conceived of as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153placid,\u00e2\u20ac what Kim wanted to do was throw a rock into that water and disrupt it to make a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153necessary ripple.\u00e2\u20ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope my stories will provide 'sense-oriented knowledge' instead of 'cognitive knowledge' to readers,\u00e2\u20ac Kim said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Because so far, they have been reluctant to do anything (radical), although they know that what they will meet in the end will be their own self-destruction.\u00e2\u20acKim, a self-claimed neophyte writer, said that there was one more story he failed to finish and include in the collection \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 one mixed with unpredictable weather and unpredictable romance. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was so hard to let 'unpredictability' slip into the plot that I eventually gave up,\u00e2\u20ac Kim said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153But do you know what's good about being a writer? Writers can keep challenging the narratives about various subjects.\u00e2\u20ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Love in the Time of Climate Change\u00e2\u20ac is a new addition to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153climate fiction,\u00e2\u20ac a genre not yet fully developed in Korea but already extensive in international book markets. Kim hopes that his latest work will encourage Korean readers to read more \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cli-fi\u00e2\u20ac books.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153I believe that a good book has the power to drive readers to continue reading another book,\u00e2\u20ac Kim said, mentioning \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I'm With the Bears: Short Stories from a Damaged Planet,\u00e2\u20ac by the Booker Prize-winning Canadian author, Margaret Atwood, and nine others as an example. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153I hope my latest work gets translated someday and encourages more international readers to jump into the world of cli-fi.\u00e2\u20ac</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["\u00e2\u20ac\u0153These weather guys, in fact, forecast as they are shrouded in this unpredictability,\u00e2\u20ac Kim told The Korea Times. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The climate crisis has already brought us halfway to an apocalyptic society, where we can predict less and less every day.
