[{"relevance_score": 38, "title": "The EU must stay true to its climate commitments", "published": "2025-07-07", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">KAMPALA - After considerable delay, the European Commission has presented its legislative proposal to set a 90 percent target for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 2040, which will now be deliberated by the European Parliament and the Council. The bloc has already positioned itself as a climate leader, setting an ambitious 2030 emissions-reduction goal that it is on track to meet. But with its new focus on regaining economic competitiveness and military might, the EU has been grappling with a practical and moral question: Will it continue to set the global standard for climate action?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To be sure, the EU stands to benefit from adopting the proposed 2040 target. Increasing its use of renewables would bolster energy security, reduce geopolitical risk, and stabilize its economy, owing to lower and more predictable power costs.</p><p>But the bloc\u2019s commitment to decarbonization also has global implications. The clean-energy transition offers the best chance of achieving broad-based prosperity, and the world cannot afford for the EU to reverse course. Such leadership is especially important as countries finalize their updated nationally determined contributions (NDCs) - climate-action plans for the next five years - ahead of the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30) in Bel?m, Brazil.</p><p>What may seem like a technocratic exercise in emissions accounting affects countless lives and livelihoods, particularly in the Global South countries that have borne the brunt of a crisis largely created by the Global North. Communities across Africa are already suffering the devastating effects of climate change, including heat waves, crop failures, and coastal erosion. Last year, flash floods affected more than one million people in Nigeria. In Uganda, where I live, families are losing their homes and land to landslides triggered by heavy rains. Despite contributing the least to global warming, we are facing its most severe consequences, and falling deeper into poverty as a result.</p><p>Moreover, many Global South governments are caught in a debt trap, with high interest payments limiting their ability to invest in climate adaptation and mitigation. Their inability to manage worsening climate conditions could result in up to 216 million people being internally displaced by 2050, including nearly 86?million internal climate-change migrants in Sub-Saharan Africa. With cross-border climate-induced migration also likely to increase, EU leaders must decide whether to confront the root causes of displacement or treat its symptoms by fortifying the bloc\u2019s borders - an undertaking that could prove more challenging and costly than decarbonization.</p><p>Failure to adopt the proposed 2040 target would be a betrayal of the people and countries with the least influence and the most to lose. But I do not expect the bloc to choose between its own interests and those of the Global South, because this target benefits everyone. Cutting emissions by 90 percent by 2040 would save the EU more than \u20ac850 billion in fossil-fuel imports, eliminate its dependence on foreign gas supplies, and create two million new jobs in green industries. This is why many European businesses and investors support the target. It would also substantially reduce household energy bills and toxic air pollution, improving financial and human health across the continent.</p><p>Maintaining an ambitious climate policy would also offer the EU an opportunity to rebuild trust with Global South governments, many of which have grown disillusioned with the Western liberal order after broken climate-finance promises, foreign-aid cuts, vaccine hoarding during the COVID-19 pandemic, and limited support for the newly operationalized loss and damage fund. African countries, in particular, are closely following the EU\u2019s actions, wondering whether years of lofty rhetoric about climate justice will finally translate into decisive action.</p><p>The signs are not promising. France, despite playing a crucial role in the ratification of the 2015 Paris climate agreement, is now leading efforts to weaken the 2040 target. Instead of displaying climate vision and leadership when they are needed most, Emmanuel Macron\u2019s government has argued for \u201coutsourcing\u201d up to 7 percent of the emissions reduction to non-EU countries by incorporating carbon credits into the target proposal.</p><p>Such indifference has a high cost. If the EU fails to submit an ambitious NDC, it risks undermining the global fight against climate change. Other countries may follow the bloc\u2019s example and water down their own commitments. The chance to set bold collective goals ahead of COP30 will be lost, and Europe\u2019s credibility, especially among climate-vulnerable countries, will take another hit.</p><p>Climate justice cannot be postponed any longer. The EU\u2019s decision on the 2040 target will shape the outcome of COP30 and, by extension, the crucial next phase of climate action. The world is watching to see if Europe will take responsibility for its historic role in the climate crisis and invest in a safe and dignified future for everyone. Given a chance to draw a clear line between past and future - between cowardice and courage - the EU must make the right choice.</p><p>Vanessa Nakate is a Ugandan climate-justice activist and the author of \u201cA Bigger Picture\u201d (Pan Macmillan, 2022).

This battle is not waged with weapons or political rhetoric, but with the weight of legal arguments and the fervent determination of climate-concerned citizens, passionate activists and lawyers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the center of this struggle is Korea's Constitutional Court, which held the first public hearing of Asia's first climate lawsuit against the government's climate target on April 23, with the next hearing scheduled for May 21, a watershed moment in the global fight against the climate crisis.</p><p>The genesis of this legal saga dates back to 2020, when the first climate lawsuit was filed in Korea. Now, four consolidated lawsuits stand before the court, each representing a diverse array of plaintiffs united by a common cause: To hold the government accountable for its inadequate climate policies. From infants to children, teens, citizens and civil society activists, the plaintiffs represent a unified voice demanding climate justice and liability.</p><p>The crux of the plaintiffs' argument rests on a fundamental premise: That climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a matter of constitutional rights. They contend that the government's failure to address the climate crisis effectively in a timely manner infringes upon their right to life and a clean environment - an assertion bolstered by the Korean National Human Rights Commission's declaration that climate change constitutes a human rights issue of paramount importance.</p><p>Central to the plaintiffs' case is the disparity between Korea's national greenhouse gas emission reduction goal and those of other industrialized nations. They argue that the government's current policies fall woefully short of what is required to mitigate the catastrophic effects of climate change, citing scientific evidence and international legal precedents to support their claims. From inadequate emissions reduction targets to a reliance on fossil fuels, the government's approach to climate action is deemed insufficient and incompatible with its constitutional obligations.</p><p>However, the government remains steadfast in its defense, citing the complexities of policymaking. While acknowledging the urgency of climate change, government officials argue that the judiciary should not encroach upon matters of policy and governance -- a stance that sets the stage for a clash of legal doctrines and raises fundamental questions about the separation of powers.</p><p>As the courtroom drama unfolds, the eyes of the world are fixed upon Korea, recognizing the profound implications of this historic legal battle. The outcome of these lawsuits will reverberate across continents, shaping the future of climate action and holding governments accountable for their climate commitments. Indeed, Korea's climate litigation is not just a domestic affair; it is a global rallying cry for climate justice and a testament to the power of grassroots activism in effecting change.</p><p>In recent years, climate litigation has emerged as a powerful tool for holding governments and corporations accountable for their contributions to climate change. From landmark rulings in Europe to groundbreaking lawsuits in the United States, courts around the world have increasingly recognized the urgent need for climate action and the legal obligations of governments to protect the environment and uphold human rights.</p><p>Korea's climate litigation represents a significant milestone in this global movement for environmental justice. By challenging the government's climate policies in court, plaintiffs are not only seeking redress for past injustices but also demanding systemic change to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for all. Their courage and determination serve as an inspiration to activists and advocates worldwide, galvanizing support for climate action and sparking meaningful conversations about the intersection of law, justice and the environment.</p><p>Beyond the legal arguments and constitutional debates lies a deeper truth -- a truth that speaks to the moral imperative of safeguarding our planet for future generations. It is a truth embodied by the faces of the youth activists who stand as plaintiffs in this historic case -- a generation that refuses to inherit a world ravaged by the climate crisis. Their voices echo a universal call to action, reminding us of our collective responsibility to protect humanity and our planet.</p><p>In the end, Korea's climate litigation is not just about winning a legal battle; it is about winning the fight for humanity's future. It is about affirming our commitment to climate justice and ensuring that the voices of the marginalized and the disenfranchised are heard and heeded.

G20 member countries, including Korea, are responsible for more than 80 percent of global carbon emissions.</p><p>The same reality applies within our society as well. Climate action is everyone's common responsibility, but it should be greatly differentiated. In Korea, those 685 corporations subject to the Korean Emission Trading Scheme (K-ETS) are responsible for 74 percent of the total greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Especially the top 10 private emitters, including POSCO, Samsung Electronics, Ssangyong C;amp;amp;amp;E, S-Oil and LG Chem, are responsible for more than a quarter of the total emissions.

To do so, as a member of the G20, the Korean government needs to strengthen its climate policies by following the immediate steps recommended by the U.N. secretary-general.</p><p>Firstly, South Korea, as a member of the OECD, needs to phase out fossil-fuel power generation as fast as possible, including coal, by 2030. However, the current governmental plan is to phase out fossil-fuel power by not 2030 but 2050. What is worse is the government allows additional fossil-fuel power plants to be built. The Yoon administration's actions are clearly in contradiction of its directive of becoming a \"global pivotal state\" in this time of climate emergency.</p><p>Secondly, Korean policymakers need to increase the pricing on carbon. In fact, Yoon promised to strengthen the K-ETS, but the carbon pricing recently hit its lowest level, 7,000 won equivalent to $5 per ton of carbon. The K-ETS is failing to serve its purpose and the Yoon administration is responsible for it. We need to either fix or replace it with a more effective carbon reduction policy.</p><p>To demand not climate change but systemic change based on climate justice, more than 450 civil organizations together with tens of thousands of people will organize a massive climate march this Saturday, Sept. 23, near Seoul City Hall.</p><p>long with the other inspiring climate movements around the world in recent years, there were two major climate protests held in Korea in 2019 and 2022.

In the Netherlands, the government has issued an apology for the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds role in the global slave trade, and the king has \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdasked for forgiveness.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has urged Denmark to \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdaddress the negative impacts\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd of its colonization of Greenland. And in the United Kingdom, media outlets, the Church of England, and cities like Manchester have acknowledged the hard truth: their wealth and power were built on the backs of enslaved people.While these efforts are rightly recognized as historic, they have also been criticized for a lack of consultation with affected communities and an apparent reluctance to provide meaningful reparations. In fact, these statements and apologies often sidestep the question of what reparations should entail, rendering them toothless gestures of pseudo-accountability.To be sure, the discussions such public apologies spark help raise the public\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds awareness about the horrors of colonialism. </p><p>The conversations they nurture are crucial, and the fact that they are occurring in Europe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds most venerable institutions -- royal palaces, museums, centuries-old foundations, businesses and media conglomerates -- is a testament to the relentless efforts of organizers and communities to keep history from being swept under the proverbial rug.But we must be wary of what Georgetown University\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Olufemi O. Taiwo calls \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdelite capture,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd whereby potentially transformative and liberating concepts are stripped of their radical content and appropriated by the political, social, and economic forces they target. In many ways, the reparations discourse is already being co-opted in this way.While important, none of the recent acknowledgments and apologies seeks to tackle the living legacy of slavery, colonialism, imperialism, and the extractive capitalism that they underpinned. Official apologies can serve as a good starting point, but those in positions of power must not be permitted to use the process of reckoning with the atrocities of colonial plunder to evade real accountability.Focusing solely on memorializing and apologizing for historical injustices without acknowledging their enduring effects risks perpetuating structural inequalities. Colonialism undergirded the international economic order. The over-policing of Black youth, disproportionately high mortality rates among non-white mothers, workplace discrimination, migrants\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd limited access to social services, and the necropolitics of \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdFortress Europe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd are all part of the legacy of the racist imperialism upon which Europe\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds wealth was built.To address these systemic injustices, we must recognize that the emphasis on financial restitution in current debates about reparations is a problem. If we are not careful, governments and institutions could use this money-centric definition of reparations as a cop-out. As we know from international law, countries often prefer to pay damages for their human rights violations rather than take meaningful steps such as revising laws, policies, and practices.This is not to downplay the vital role of wealth redistribution in building a just world. But financial settlements that seek merely to placate those who call for justice are not the same as redistributive policies that target systemic inequality. So far, European governments and institutions have been more than eager to blur the distinction between the two.As Esther Stanford-Xosei and the Pan-Afrikan Reparations Coalition in Europe have argued, the financial aspect of reparations \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdwill be meaningful only if it serves the holistic purpose and strengthens the integral whole of our self-repair process.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd In other words, any form of reparations must enable communities to reclaim power, dignity and stewardship over their shared wealth and resources. If reparations are solely focused on the past, we risk neglecting the present and weakening their emancipatory potential. A more historically informed approach would view reparations as part of a larger project.Much like the broader struggle for racial, social, economic, and climate justice, the purpose of reparations is to help build a more equitable world. The transition to such a world will not be costless and will undoubtedly require sacrifices. Reparations should ensure that these costs are distributed fairly rather than provide a monetary band-aid.To bring about a more just future, we must first meet the most urgent needs of communities grappling with the lasting legacies of colonialism. This means dismantling the unequal power structures in our legal, education, health care and political systems, as well as our workplaces and public services.By adopting a community-oriented approach to addressing structures of oppression, we can ensure that marginalized groups have equal access to essential public goods. But we must also be willing to challenge the inherently harmful and extractive systems that we often take for granted.Simply put, we can no longer accept that any framework, institution or process that affects marginalized communities is established or operated without their meaningful participation. Rectifying historical injustices is not just about righting past wrongs. To create a more equitable society, we must also address colonialism\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ongoing effects.By Nani Jansen ReventlowNani Jansen Reventlow, a human rights lawyer, is founder of Systemic Justice, a nongovernmental organization that works with communities to address racial, social and economic injustices through strategic litigation. -- Ed.(Project Syndicate)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["If reparations are solely focused on the past, we risk neglecting the present and weakening their emancipatory potential.

There are three celebrity forests in Jamsil Hangang Park, two in Ichon, two in Gwangnaru, and one each in Jamwon and Yeouido. The earliest of these is 'RM Forest No.1' in Jamsil, established in August 2019. With donations made for the leader of global K-pop sensation BTS, 1,250 bridal wreaths were planted.

Policymakers, investors, CEOs, and the boards of mining firms should be seeking -- and delivering -- positive answers to that question. Instead, the failure to engage with human-rights concerns could derail our already faltering journey to a low-carbon world.At the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) in Glasgow last November, governments and much of the investment community reaffirmed their commitment to the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Breaching that accord\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds global-warming threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels will expose current and future generations to the deadly effects of climate breakdown. </p><p>To avoid a collision with Earth\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ecological boundaries, we need a warp-speed acceleration in the transition to a zero-carbon pathway, starting with halving carbon dioxide emissions this decade.Achieving that target will require a quantum leap in investments to secure sufficient supplies of so-called transition minerals. Clean-energy technologies such as solar plants, wind farms, and electric vehicles are mineral-intensive. Motors and turbines need nickel, chromium, manganese, and rare earths. New electricity networks require vast quantities of copper wire. Electric-vehicle batteries need lithium and nickel. The International Energy Agency estimates that reaching net-zero emissions by mid-century will require a six-fold increase in mineral inputs, and a 40-fold increase in lithium supply.Policymakers and investors have slowly woken up to the fact that shortages of transition minerals pose a real and present danger to global climate goals. With demand outstripping supply, prices are surging. Mining companies are desperately seeking new sources of minerals. Larry Fink, the chief executive of BlackRock, the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds largest money manager, anticipates a transition-mineral investment boom that \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdis going to be large and (...) going to be multiple years of investing.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdTherein lies both an opportunity and a threat. The opportunity is for governments, investors, mining companies, and civil-society organizations to come together to develop new investment models aimed at supplying a renewable-energy revolution while building shared prosperity, public trust, and strengthened governance. The threat is that we fail to protect the human rights of vulnerable communities in the transition-minerals boom, with an investment surge instead fueling the destruction of livelihoods, environmental damage, and a global wave of land and water grabs by multinational companies.Anyone doubting the scale of that threat should consult the Transition Minerals Tracker compiled by the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre. The tracker documents 61 credible new allegations of human-rights abuses in the previous year, including the erosion of land rights, toxic pollution, the diversion of scarce water resources, and attacks on local communities and human-rights defenders. Companies featuring prominently in the charge sheets of the tracker database include Glencore, Anglo American, China Minmetals, and Rio Tinto.I was quite shocked to see that corporations embracing the green economy were committing human-rights abuses. But perhaps none of this should come as a surprise, given that deposits of many transition minerals are concentrated in countries with notoriously poor governance.In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds largest source of cobalt and a major supplier of copper, mining is associated with child labor, corruption, and widespread violence. Indonesia, the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds top nickel producer, has a weak record on protecting communities from mining pollution. Lithium extraction in Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia has pitted local communities seeking to defend scarce desert water resources against mining companies that use water-intensive extraction methods and ride roughshod over land rights.As a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, I am well aware of the challenges facing mining firms and the wider investment community. Extracting minerals while protecting the environment and respecting human rights is an inherently difficult balancing act, not least when governments fail to act on their responsibilities.Environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investing is not filling the void. Ubiquitous greenwashing aside, attention has focused almost entirely on decarbonization and the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdE\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd of the acronym. Social criteria -- including human rights -- have been ignored, exposing communities to the threat of systemic rights violations, and investors to reputational risks.Human rights should be put at the center of ESG investment. The Investor Alliance for Human Rights, a group of over 200 firms representing more than $10 trillion in assets, has called for stronger regulatory measures, including mandatory human-rights and environmental due diligence consistent with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The European Commission\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds proposed directive on corporate sustainability due diligence, which would impose obligations -- with potential penalties -- on companies to monitor their value chains, promises to spur movement in the right direction.Mining companies and transition-minerals investors should be at the forefront of efforts to strengthen human-rights protection. Board members of mining companies should ensure that these firms\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd corporate cultures and practices reflect the human-rights principles that most of them claim to endorse. These include deep engagement with affected communities and respect for their prior informed consent, due diligence in reporting on supply chains, and access to remedies when harm occurs.Ahead of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt this November, I will be calling on governments, mining companies, investors, financial regulators, and civil-society organizations to agree on a shared agenda for a low-carbon transition that is both fast and fair. While increased supplies of transition minerals can greatly accelerate emission-reduction efforts, protecting human rights is an essential condition for climate justice.Mary RobinsonMary Robinson, a former president of Ireland and former UN high commissioner for human rights, is the chair of The Elders and chair of the Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Advisory Board.(Project Syndicate)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["These include deep engagement with affected communities and respect for their prior informed consent, due diligence in reporting on supply chains, and access to remedies when harm occurs.

For, if truth be told, the consequences of global warming and the resulting accelerated climate change will be far deadlier for humanity than the Holocaust, leading to the deaths of hundreds of millions, or billions, as agriculture collapses in the face of spreading deserts and the oceans die as a result of warming waters and increasing acidity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That we can read about this catastrophe in newspapers and refuse to end our thoughtless consumption of fossil fuels and our mindless plunge into a fantasy of immediate gratification without concern for future generations suggests nothing less than mass psychopathology.</p><p>The analogy to the Holocaust is imperfect and tentative, but it explains how a shadow has fallen between the knowledge of catastrophe and actual action. It offers precedents for the psychology of educated people who fall over backwards to deny an obvious disaster, who refuse to admit that their daily actions had anything to do with the radical crimes carried out in secret.</p><p>We can imagine a future date, if humanity manages to survive in some form, at which this brutal truth of how those with the learning to grasp the problem who pretended that they had nothing to do with this suicidal process will be forced out into the open and the public will be forced to take responsibility for the immensity of the crime that we have committed, and face the bitter fact that we betrayed future generations every time we drove to the market in a car or typed on a computer using energy generated by coal.</p><p>The denial of the Holocaust was not limited to the refusal of Germans to acknowledge the systematic rounding up of Jews (and other undesirables) for transport to concentration camps and on to death camps. The denial of this crime spread around the world, including all the nations of Europe. Educated people in France, Spain, Italy, Belgium and elsewhere knew full well that Jews in their country, and elsewhere, were being rounded up and sent to their deaths. It was an open secret. There were a handful of people who pursued the issue, who looked at the facts (disappearing Jews, threats of violence and a rhetoric of annihilation) and were led inevitably to the unpleasant explanation for what was occurring.</p><p>Even intellectuals in the relatively free nations of the United States and the U.K. were swept up in the systematic denial of the reports of the Holocaust and those brave eye witnesses who testified as to what was happening were dismissed. Officially, the Allied governments claimed that did not learn about the Holocaust until the first liberations of concentration camps in 1944, but in fact they were fully aware of the number (in the millions) who were being killed by 1942 and deliberately avoided offering any assistance.</p><p>Moreover, in 1980 the American historian and journalist Walter Laqueur found out that the British had already cracked the encrypted code of the SS in 1941 and constantly listened to the radio traffic of the Nazis. In 1996 Richard Breitman published British listening records that included success reports from the German 'SD-Einsatzgruppen' and police battalions, about the \"extermination of the Jews\" during the summer of 1941. There was no doubt as to what was happening.</p><p>Szmul Zygielbojm of the Polish government took tremendous personal risks in June 1942 to smuggle detailed reports about industrialized mass murder to London. Although the Daily Telegraph did mention his materials eventually, it was on page five of a six page newspaper (similar to the treatment that catastrophic climate change receives these days). Zygielbojm met with 'indifference, disbelief or even suspicion,' eventually taking his life after his wife and son were killed during the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto in 1943.</p><p>Refugees trying to escape persecution were turned back, such as the passengers of the ship the St. Louis that came to the U.S. in 1939 without any serious discussion of the reasons the passengers were fleeing. The U.S. even turned away 20,000 Jewish children fleeing Nazi Germany in much the way that refugees from climate change (whether in Central America or Syria, or Northern Africa) are turned back without a second thought from the U.S., Canada or Japan today.</p><p>The use of Jews as slave labor to aid the German economy (and the economies of other countries), the misuse of the property confiscated from Jews in Germany, and across Europe, profits generated through budgets related to the 'Final Solution' project were deep secrets that had real financial benefits.</p><p>The point is not to berate the Europeans for what they did then, but rather to suggest that the mentality was strikingly similar to what we see today. Fossil fuels (petroleum and coal above all) are dirty and immoral sources of energy and wealth whose catastrophic implications for the environment have been carefully hidden from sight while the immediate consequences are disguised through misleading reports in the corporate media that understate their deadly implications.</p><p>The best and the brightest of so-called 'advanced nations' have their fingers all over this crime, whether in the promotion of economic theories that ignore climate change and assume that growth and consumption are necessary, or policy reports that vastly understate the gravity of the situation, or media reports that fail to mention 'climate change' when reporting massive hurricanes, forest fires or droughts.</p><p>The number of people who are dying now, and who will die in the future, are carefully guarded by these gatekeepers, much as the mass killings of Jews were hidden from the writings of professors, journalists and government officials in Paris and Budapest, in Berlin and Rome, during the 1940s. Similarly, today we see educated people distracted by trivialities like Trump's temper tantrums, and unable to focus on the disaster that stares them in the face.</p><p>We created this cognitive dissidence and we are all guilty. The industry of death around us has been hidden with our permission and with our consent. Factories in China or Vietnam use coal that destroys the ecosystem and pollutes the local region so that rich nations can enjoy inexpensive products without having to consider the price paid by our precious Earth. We pat them on the back for being environmentally friendly because we do not have the domestic pollution we had in the 1960s and 1970s. But the unspeakable damage to our shared ecosystem is the same, whether the factory is in downtown Paris, or in rural Myanmar.</p><p>How is such an approach different from the scheme whereby placing the death camps in Poland allowed all of Europe to enjoy a false sense of innocence? As the recent Hungarian movie '1945' (directed by Ferec Torok) shows, the confiscation of the possessions of Jews was a massive industry that was assiduously covered up by those involved. It was too easy to blame the entire project on a small group of SS officers.</p><p>The current project of death encompasses the production of petroleum, the entanglement of the U.S. dollar with the use of petroleum, and the creation of fraudulent mechanisms like 'carbon trading' that distract us from the necessary steps such as banning the use of fossil fuels. The myth that market mechanisms can solve the problem is embraced by environmental groups that limit their discussions to the most superficial solutions.</p><p>Even more grotesque is the transformation of the military in the U.S. (and elsewhere) into a massive consumer of petroleum and massive producer of carbon emissions that devotes its work to promoting wars to secure only more petroleum and natural gas, and thereby to create petroleum wealth for a select few. The generals embrace the mission of 'security' while ignoring the real security threat of climate change. The scale of the horror is so great that many prefer to simply play stupid and let the insane project proceed unimpaired.</p><p>Today we deny the deaths of millions in wars over oil and the death of tens of millions as the consequence of climate change globally.</p><p>We can understand the mass pathology behind the killing of the Jews, or the embrace of fossil fuels, through a comparison with incest. Incest, sexual relations between close family members, is ethically offensive and disruptive behavior in our society. It results in tremendous psychological damage for victims (and at some level all family members involved are victims) that last for a lifetime.</p><p>There is a disturbing pattern in incest. Although disputes between family members about money or power often spill out into the open where they can be addressed by the family as a whole, and can be resolved, incest is often swept under the rug. Families try to maintain a semblance of normality for years, or even for decades, pretending that the unspeakable relationship does not exist. The same behavior is true for other forms of child abuse.</p><p>Similarly, when addressing the denial of climate change, we must confront the capacity of humans to embrace false narratives at the family level, the national level and the global level that spare them the pain of facing the truth and taking responsibility. We must recognize the ability of humans to deny the truth despite the tremendous damage that such action causes them over the long-term.</p><p>Such was most the mentality of thoughtful people in Prague, in Budapest or in Warsaw who felt comfortable sitting at cafes sipping their favorite drinks, reading intellectually complex novels and discussing the weather, or the latest movies with friends while avoiding any mention of the mysterious disappearance of Jews from their neighborhood. They even struggled to block out the memories of evictions and roundups they had witnessed.</p><p>Of course the Gestapo and other fascist groups were so dangerous that silence was demanded. Yet the totalitarian system could never have been established if citizens had not practiced psychological denial for long enough to allow totalitarian rule to take root. The willingness of educated Germans to ignore the Nazi Party's actions from 1933 on allowed that organization to establish a system that would eventually make criticism impossible.</p><p>Eventually those who tried to help Jews, homosexuals, dissidents, disabled people, Jehovah's Witnesses, communists, POWs, critical authors, Sinti and Romanies were charged with crimes that demanded immediate and brutal punishment.</p><p>Although the Trump administration has made climate change a topic that government officials are not allowed to discuss, let alone respond to, discussing the topic is not illegal yet. Nevertheless, the brutal suppression of the protests against the Keystone SL tar sands pipeline last year, including ridiculously long prison sentences, suggests that it is entirely possible that the debate on climate itself will be criminalized in the years ahead, forcing us to make even more difficult decisions at even greater sacrifice.</p><p>We who fight for climate justice must recognize that we may not have much time before not only is radical climate change unavoidable, but also before the discussion of the topic is made impossible. Creating a sustainable future may require profound sacrifice and moral courage that goes beyond any 'carbon trading' schemes that have been floated by multinational investment banks.</p><p>Climate change is already killing millions around the world, and will kill hundreds of millions in the years ahead. Yet the vast majority of the well-off (and well-off means those who make more than $US40,000 a year) are indifferent to the relationship between their overheated homes, their minivans, their imported cheap products, or their offices with ridiculously high ceilings in the lobbies and glass and steel exteriors that require vast amounts of energy to keep at a comfortable temperature, and climate change. They do not see, or they do not want to see, a link between the hurricanes devastating the coasts, the spreading deserts, the increases in forest fires, and their own daily actions.</p><p>In a grotesque burlesque that has become commonplace, we remark to each other as a greeting that the weather is so cold. Yet we are fully aware that today's winters are so warm that flowers continue to bloom into December, and beyond. We intentionally wear heavy jackets when they go out, willing to put up with the inconvenience because the ritual somehow convinces them that the climate has not changed at all. The painful pursuit of truthThere were brave men and women who risked their lives, and often more importantly, their relations with their own families and friends, to get the truth out about the Holocaust. More often than not their stories were dismissed as exaggerations. It was assumed that the unfortunate deaths of a few Jews were being exaggerated into a fantastic mass murder. The arguments for dismissing their stories (and such arguments are made even today) were based on the assumption that the fascists could not possibly have engaged in something so terrible and that the populations of Europe could not possibly have allowed something on that scale to happen. In effect, the scale of the crime made the task easier, not harder.</p><p>The psychology we see today regarding climate change is identical. The reports produced by scientists based on the scientific method that speak of massive destruction are dismissed or ignored because they are Pollyanish. The rosy predictions made by politicians, television personalities, columnists and businessmen, constructed from self-interest, ego and primitive denial are embraced by many as a precious salve for their deeply troubled collective conscience.</p><p>The scale of the catastrophe, which threatens humanity with extinction, is so large that those who embrace the culture of denial find it easy to dismiss. But there is no scientific basis for such dismissal. If anything, multiple mass extinctions from prehistoric times suggest that such scenarios are all too possible. That bitter reality is detailed in Elizabeth Kolbert's book 'The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History' (2014). Certainly the current massive die-out of insects, amphibians, and reptiles indicate that the process of extinction is inexorably working its way up the food chain towards us.</p><p>It is no longer a secret that a small group of billionaires are making a fortune off of encouraging waste among the population and forcing us to be dependent on fossil fuels, often using taxpayers' money to subsidize this addiction to a dangerous energy source. They are fully aware of the crime that they are engaged in and they are informed about the coming catastrophe. Yet they march forward towards mass destruction, much as the leaders of the Third Reich did when they started their invasions of Eastern Europe and Russia, knowingly launching a catastrophe that destroyed them as well.</p><p>Just as a small group of intellectuals, such as Austrian-German Orientalist Adolf Wahrmund (1827-1913), pushed fake science about Jewish inferiority in Europe from the late 19th century, and tried to convince French and Germans that the contradictions of capitalism could be traced back to racial characteristics of Jews, a circle of fraudulent 'experts' have made a fortune from paybacks from fossil fuel industry to push their denial of, or understatement of, climate change.</p><p>These professional deniers and scientists for hire such as Fred Seitz, Robert Jastrow (founder of the notorious George C. Marshall Institute) and William Nierenberg pawn off fake science using glossy brochures and fancy PPT presentations with the criminal intention of misleading the public about a national security crisis. The process is immoral and illegal, but even today is described in the media as merely matter of differing opinion - much as rabid anti-Semitism was treated in Europe from the late 19th century.</p><p>Today's professors, lawyers, doctors or businessmen and reporters contribute to the promotion of a fossil fuel-based economic system that defines the economy in terms of consumption and waste. They are amply rewarded for their work, through consulting contracts, through their connections to corporations pushing automobiles or fossil fuels, or through other financial links. They shamelessly discuss economics while ignoring the impact of energy on the environment and they promote 'free trade' while ignoring the tremendous emissions that result from the transportation of products across the world by container ships. This shameless work forms a perfect parallel to the pseudo-science of racial inferiority promoted by anthropologists and physiologists in pre-war Europe like Houston Stewart Chamberlain (1855-1927) who provided Hitler with his roadmap for systematic 'scientific' attacks on Jews.</p><p>The Washington Post reported in November 2017, that the U.S. became the biggest polluter per capita in the world and that it has the most climate change deniers of any country. Such an extreme situation could not have been reached without the massive collaboration of countless American intellectuals in this institutionalized death march.</p><p>Some intellectuals have written books about the magnitude of climate change that receive attention in the mainstream media. For example, Naomi Klein has written, and spoken, in a persuasive and blunt manner about the scale of the threat to humanity, saying that the Earth is 'fucked' by the false promise of perennial growth on a planet with limited resources. Her 'This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate,' published in 2014, is a rare example of a widely read book that suggests that the economic and ideological assumptions of our society will be fatal.</p><p>So also Clive Hamilton, an Australian professor who is a member of the Board of the Climate Change Authority of his country, published a powerful critique of flawed economic policies 'Growth Fetish' in 2003, and the trenchant 'Requiem for a Species' in 2010. Hamilton suggests that even the experts behind the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) have vastly underestimated the dangers ahead because of economic and political pressures.</p><p>But most climate change discourse has been laughable and pathetic. The most representative artifacts of this culture of understatement are former Vice President Al Gore's two inconvenient movies: 'An Inconvenient Truth' (2006) and 'An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power' (2017). Both films are more a promotion of Al Gore than a serious effort to address the threat of climate change. The saccharine narratives assume unwarranted optimism that multinational corporations that pursue profit can solve this catastrophe if only upper middle-class citizens raise their awareness of climate change. The movie avoids any consideration of serious actions such as the categorical prohibition of the use of fossil fuels, or even heavy taxing of pollution. The road forward2018 was a turning point in the modern Holocaust of climate change. The disruption of the Northern Hemisphere's jet stream led to a vastly increased warming of the North Pole that meant a smaller difference in temperature relative to the equator. The result has been reduced the air circulation at the altitude of nine to 12 kilometers with the consequence of minimal seasonal variations around the world. The resulting extreme rainfall in Italy, the unprecedented drought in Germany, the massive fires in California and Greece show that extreme climate is a reality, but governments, and their citizens are incapable of articulating responses on the appropriate scale.</p><p>Most of us lack the bravery, and the intellectual clarity, necessary to face ugly truth of climate change and its roots in our culture and habits. We have externalized the problem and therefore are unable to move to the next step of changing our behavior so as to make progress.</p><p>There is still hope. We see a rising awareness of climate change around the world that makes an honest discussion about the scale of the threat possible. But we cannot allow half-truths and rosy projections to delude us. The struggle ahead will be profound and disorienting. We will have to challenge the consumption-based economics that underpins every aspect of our current ideology. The circumstances may be entirely different, but a moral bravery on a par with that which was required to confront the Holocaust will be demanded of us if we wish to find a solution.</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["Although the Trump administration has made climate change a topic that government officials are not allowed to discuss, let alone respond to, discussing the topic is not illegal yet.

With the Kyoto Protocol on carbon emissions expiring in 2012, the delegates who will gather in Copenhagen have been given the task of concluding a new international agreement. The world's countries are engaging in one of the most complex and consequential exercises in collective action that has ever had to be managed in the history of international relations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although the responsibility of industrialized countries and emerging economies in the battle against carbon emissions is now well known, Africa's place in the climate agenda has been largely neglected. Sub-Saharan emissions, estimated at only 3 percent to 4 percent of global man-made emissions, are deemed of little interest. Yet Africa is central to the global environmental crisis in two important ways.</p><p>First, Africa would be the first victim of major climate disturbance - with side-effects on the whole planet. Experts predict that the continent will experience some of the gravest changes, whereas the capacity of African societies to respond to them is among the weakest in the world.</p><p>Several African countries are already experiencing reduced rainfall, soil degradation, and the depletion of precious natural resources, which has a direct impact on the livelihoods of two-thirds of sub-Saharan Africans. The economic, social, migratory, and security consequences of such vulnerability on the rest of the world cannot be ignored, as Africa will be home to more than two billion inhabitants in 2050.</p><p>Second, Africa is one of the important actors in the global environmental crisis. Because of its vast natural heritage, the continent contains some of the most potent solutions to climate change. The Congo basin represents the second largest mass of tropical forest in the world, with 220 million hectares. At a time when carbon emissions are rapidly rising worldwide, this gigantic carbon-capture machine is, like agricultural land, one of the essential elements of global climate control. And yet Africa's forest coverage fell by 10 percent between 1990 and 2005 - more than half the recorded global shrinkage.</p><p>Moreover, Africa will experience by far the largest growth in energy requirements of any world region in the next 50 years. The fight against climate change will be waged in large part over whether Africa's energy needs are met with fossil fuels or renewable energies.</p><p>It is vital that the Copenhagen delegates recognize and promote Africa's contribution to the world's delicate climatic balance. Efforts to preserve Africa's natural resources and to exploit the vast potential of the sub-continent's renewable energies are not free. But if Africa's carbon-storage capacity is viewed as a global public good, as it should be, then everyone should contribute to its provision by developing mechanisms that enable preservation and spark the move toward sustainable energy models.</p><p>Three promising tracks will have to materialize rapidly. The first consists in increasing the use of existing tools, such as Clean Development Mechanisms, which enable actors from rich countries to promote projects that reduce emissions in developing countries. Up to now, Africa has missed out on the benefits of CDMs: to date, less than 2 percent of these projects take place in Africa, compared to 73 percent for Asia. Africa ought to be the global carbon market's new frontier.</p><p>The second track is official recognition of the carbon storage of African lands and forests, as well as rewards for \"avoided deforestation.\" At a time when humanity is coming to measure the value of biodiversity and the importance of land and forests in climate control, Africa has much to gain by making itself the guardian of a heritage that is essential to humanity's survival. This is worth several billion dollars annually, which could constitute one of the essential stepping-stones to sustained economic growth in Africa in a post-petroleum era.</p><p>Finally, the 'climate justice\" plan sponsored by France and others in Copenhagen, which aims to increase Africans' access to clean energy, is crucial at a time when three of ten sub-Saharan Africans have no access to electricity. It is a question not only of justice, but also of climate regulation. Linking public and private efforts to provide two billion Africans with renewable energy will therefore be one of the major challenges of the coming decades.</p><p>In the past, African countries found it difficult to make their voices heard in major international negotiations. Their decision to act as a bloc in Copenhagen is an important step forward. But Africa and its partners will now have to unite to win the adoption of measures that ensure the sustainable exploitation of Africa's vast environmental potential in the interest of us all.</p><p>Jean-Michel Severino is CEO of the Agence Francaise de Developpement and a member of the blog <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.id4d.org\">www.id4d.org</url>. - Ed.</p><p>(Project Syndicate)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["At a time when humanity is coming to measure the value of biodiversity and the importance of land and forests in climate control, Africa has much to gain by making itself the guardian of a heritage that is essential to humanity's survival.
