The summer was marked by 20 tropical nights ? a stark triple the average ? while 15 autumn typhoons caused extensive damage, and heavy snow and torrential rain battered the peninsula in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unsettling trends continue this year, with a sweltering heat wave approaching 40 degrees Celsius, followed by flash floods from torrential rains of up to 400 millimeters. In July alone, a staggering 23 consecutive tropical nights surpassed last year\u2019s record. This volatile pattern of extreme weather shows that economic damage and social instability are deeply intertwined with national security.</p><p>This perspective is supported by a report titled \u201cThe National Security Rationale for Japan\u2019s Transition to Renewable Energy,\u201d published in May by the Council on Strategic Risks, an American nonprofit security policy institute. The report argues that Japan\u2019s overwhelming reliance on foreign imports for 97 percent of its energy, with 83 percent of that coming from fossil fuels, creates significant geopolitical risks and economic vulnerabilities.</p><p>It compellingly argues that a strategic and rapid shift to renewable energy is a crucial pathway to enhancing energy self-sufficiency and strengthening national security. Given Korea\u2019s similar circumstances, this analysis reveals three specific connections between climate change and national security.</p><p>The first and most immediate link is the concept of climate resilience, a society\u2019s capacity to adapt to and recover from impacts of climate change. Extreme weather events, such as those Korea has recently experienced, directly affect a nation\u2019s economic and social stability.</p><p>A prime example is \u201cclimateflation.\u201d When floods or prolonged heat waves devastate agricultural regions, crop yields plummet, causing a sharp increase in food prices. This would not only affect household budgets but also the entire value chain of industries that depend on those ingredients. A stark example in Korea is how the price of Napa cabbage, a fundamental ingredient for kimchi, skyrocketed by 31.1 percent in a single month due to persistent heavy rains and heatwaves. This illustrates the destabilizing reality of climateflation.</p><p>The transition to a decentralized energy grid with renewable sources can bolster this resilience. Unlike centralized systems susceptible to widespread outages from a single catastrophic event, a distributed network of renewable sources can limit the scope of blackouts during a climate-related disaster. This localized approach ensures that vital services continue to operate and communities recover more swiftly. This, in turn, indirectly contributes to the nation\u2019s security by maintaining social order and economic function during times of crisis. Moreover, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, renewable energy also addresses the root cause of climate change, serving as a fundamental form of preventative national security.</p><p>The second major connection is the pressing need for energy independence. Like Japan, Korea\u2019s heavy reliance on energy imports presents a significant strategic weakness. In 2024, fossil fuels constituted over 80 percent of Korea\u2019s total energy consumption. Even more concerning is the geographic concentration of these imports: In 2023, Korea sourced 72 percent of its petroleum from the Middle East and over 40 percent of its coal from Australia.</p><p>With a 94 percent import dependency, Korea is highly vulnerable to global supply chain disruptions and price volatility caused by geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters or international market shifts. If a disruption were to occur, the resulting increase in energy costs could severely degrade industrial competitiveness, cripple the national economy and create widespread social unrest.</p><p>Expanding the use of renewable energy provides a strategic alternative. By developing domestic renewable energy sources, Korea can mitigate these external risks. The global climate think tank Ember highlights this, arguing that \u201ca $1 investment in solar panels can produce the same amount of electricity while saving $1 a year on gas imports,\u201d demonstrating the compelling security value of this transition.</p><p>However, this shift also presents challenges. A simple substitution of dependencies ? from fossil fuel imports to a reliance on China for key raw materials and components like polysilicon and rare earth elements ? would merely trade one form of geopolitical vulnerability for another. Therefore, a successful transition requires both expanding the use of renewable energy and developing a robust domestic supply chain.</p><p>Finally, a stable climate and a secure energy supply are directly linked to military power. Extreme weather and energy supply disruptions pose a direct threat to a nation\u2019s defense capabilities. Extreme weather can wreak havoc on critical military infrastructure, from naval bases on the coast to airfields and training grounds. The U.S. Navy, for example, has spent billions of dollars on mitigating evolving climate-related infrastructure risks. Economic downturns caused by climate-related disasters or energy price shocks could also force reductions in defense spending.</p><p>Therefore, strengthening climate resilience and increasing energy independence are not just civilian concerns; they are fundamental to national defense. A resilient society with a stable, self-sufficient energy supply is better equipped to support its armed forces, ensuring military operations are not compromised by environmental or economic crises.</p><p>This also brings up the often-overlooked point of the military\u2019s own carbon footprint. A 2022 study by a U.K. nongovernmental organization revealed that military activities account for approximately 5.5 percent of the world\u2019s annual greenhouse gas emissions ? more than the combined global emissions of the aviation and shipping industries. This creates a dangerous cycle where military activities contribute to the very climate change that later threatens military infrastructure and operational capacity.</p><p>While long-term goals are vital, the immediate and necessary step is to begin reducing military-related emissions to break this cycle and make a direct contribution to both environmental and national security.</p><p>Kim Sung-woo, head of Environment &amp; Energy Research Institute at Kim &amp; Chang, is a member of Management Committee for National Climate Fund.</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["It compellingly argues that a strategic and rapid shift to renewable energy is a crucial pathway to enhancing energy self-sufficiency and strengthening national security.

Forests play a critical role in addressing this crisis as natural carbon sinks, helping reduce carbon dioxide emissions and mitigate climate change. Moreover, healthy forests store water, protect soil and support increased agricultural yields, making them a key solution to the global food security challenge.</p><p>Every year on March 21, the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the United Nations Forum on Forests jointly observe the International Day of Forests to highlight the crucial role of forest ecosystems in climate stability, security and biodiversity. This year's theme is \"Forests and Food.\"</p><p>According to the FAO, forests serve as an essential safety net in times of food crises caused by crop failures or conflicts. More than five billion people rely on forests and forest products for food and livelihood.</p><p>However, global food insecurity is worsening. In 2023 alone, conflicts and climate-related disasters left approximately 212 million people across 38 countries struggling with food shortages. Meanwhile, deforestation continues at an alarming rate, with an annual forest loss of 4.7 million hectares since 2010, which is equivalent to 75 percent of South Korea's total forest area.</p><p>The primary driver of deforestation is population growth and the increasing demand for food. The World Wildlife Fund warned that reckless forest conversion contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss and decreased food production.</p><p>When forests are cleared, the stored carbon is released, accelerating the climate crisis. This, in turn, intensifies droughts, floods and heatwaves, making food production even more challenging. If climate change continues unsolved, crop yields will decline, food prices will soar and global food insecurity will worsen.</p><p>To tackle these issues, we need policies that promote forest restoration and sustainable conservation, helping mitigate climate change while ensuring food security.</p><p>The Korea Forest Service is committed to sustainable forest management under its \"Valuable and Healthy Forests for All\" initiative. In February, the agency introduced the \"Forest Food\" national brand to provide greater access to healthy, forest-grown food products from Korea's pristine forests.</p><p>These Forest Food products -- such as wild vegetables, deodeok (Codonopsis lanceolata), chestnuts and gomchwi (Ligularia fischeri) -- have been naturally harvested and consumed since ancient times. Since they are grown in remote forest regions, their consumption will also support rural communities at risk of depopulation. Moreover, maintaining forests for their production contributes to climate change mitigation.</p><p>In addition, Korea is leveraging its successful reforestation experience to assist developing countries in restoring and conserving their forests while improving food security.</p><p>For example, in Ethiopia and Togo, both facing, KFS is supporting projects to establish nurseries, restore forests and implement agroforestry, a method of integrating crop cultivation within forest areas to boost food production and earnings.</p><p>Through the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization spearheaded by Korea, we have worked with Southeast Asian countries to protect local forests and strengthen food security there. Additionally, we have invited forestry officials from developing countries to share Korea's expertise in reforestation through specialized training programs.</p><p>Forests and food are deeply intertwined. Looking ahead, KFS will drive global collaboration to restore forests and promote sustainable food production. By deepening partnerships with international organizations, we aim to make a lasting impact on global forest conservation.</p><p>On this International Day of Forests, I encourage everyone to reflect on how forests sustain human life and the critical link between forests and food security.</p><p>Lim Sang-seop is minister of the Korea Forest Service.

A heat warning is issued when the daily temperature reaches 33 degrees or higher. Asphalt, made from petroleum, begins to soften at 30 degrees and can suffer serious damage above 35 degrees. Consecutive days of extreme heat can push surface temperatures to 50 to 60 degrees, causing bulges and holes.</p><p>Last month, roads near Hongpa Elementary School in Seoul\u2019s Dongdaemun District and Nongso Elementary School in Ulsan\u2019s Buk District developed warped, melted surfaces that hardened again, prompting firefighters and municipal workers to carry out repairs.</p><p>The capital has been hit especially hard. Seoul recorded 15 days of heat warnings in July ? 7.5 times more than last year\u2019s two days.

Over half the world's food production now comes from areas experiencing declining freshwater supplies. Two-thirds of the global population face water scarcity at least one month per year. More than 1,000 children under 5 die every day, on average, from water-related diseases. And if current trends continue, high-income countries could see their gross domestic product shrink by 8 percent by 2050, while lower-income countries (many in Africa) face losses of 10-15 percent.</p><p>Yet this crisis also presents an extraordinary opportunity. As South Africa assumes the G20 presidency (for which I have been appointed special adviser to President Cyril Ramaphosa), it can champion a new economics of water that treats the hydrological cycle as a global common good, rather than as the source of a commodity to be hoarded or traded.</p><p>The economic case for action is compelling. The International High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa shows that every $1 invested in climate-resilient water and sanitation delivers a return of $7. With Africa requiring an additional $30 billion annually to meet the Sustainable Development Goal on water security and sustainable sanitation, the financing gap is significant, but it is surmountable with the right strategy. The Global Commission on the Economics of Water (which I co-chaired with Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the director general of the World Trade Organization, Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, and Singaporean President Tharman Shanmugaratnam) recently called for such a strategy.</p><p>Treating water as a global common good and adopting mission-oriented approaches to transform the crisis into an opportunity requires that we recognize three critical facts. First, water connects us all ? not just through visible rivers and lakes, but through atmospheric moisture flows that travel across continents. Second, the water crisis is inseparable from climate change and biodiversity loss, each of which accelerates the others in a vicious cycle. And, third, water runs through every SDG, from food security and health to economic growth.</p><p>Yet too often, water investments follow the failed playbook of climate and development finance. There is a tendency to derisk private capital without ensuring public returns; to fund projects without strategic direction; and to treat water as a technical problem, rather than a systemic challenge. Such approaches risk creating water infrastructure that serves investors more than communities, exacerbates existing inequalities, and fails to address the interconnected nature of the water, climate and biodiversity crises.</p><p>This interconnectedness demands a new economic framework that aims to shape markets proactively rather than simply fixing failures after the fact. We need to move from short-term cost-benefit thinking to long-term value creation, and that calls for mission-oriented investments that shape markets for the common good.</p><p>Missions require clear goals ? like ensuring that no child dies from unsafe water by 2030. Once goals are established, all financing can be aligned with them through cross-sectoral approaches spanning agriculture, energy, manufacturing and digital infrastructure. Rather than picking sectors or technologies, the point is to find willing partners across all industries to tackle shared challenges. Such mission-oriented investments can also lead to economic diversification, creating new export opportunities and development pathways.</p><p>Consider Bolivia's approach to lithium extraction. Rather than simply exporting raw materials, the country is developing strategies to avoid the traditional \"resource curse\" by building domestic battery-production capabilities and participating directly in the energy transition. In doing so, it is converting its resource wealth into innovation capacity, strengthening value chains and creating new export markets for higher-value activities.</p><p>As matters stand, more than $700 billion per year is channeled into water and agriculture subsidies that often incentivize overuse and pollution. By redirecting these resources toward water-efficient agriculture and ecosystem restoration, with clear conditions attached, we could transform the economics of water overnight. To that end, public development banks can provide patient capital for water infrastructure, while requiring private partners to reinvest profits in watershed protection.</p><p>Africa is uniquely positioned to lead this transformation. Its vast supply of groundwater remains largely untapped, with 255 million urban inhabitants living above known supplies. Combined with affordable solar power, these supplies present an opportunity to revolutionize agriculture. By focusing on efficiency and reuse, as well as on capacity building, data-sharing and monitoring and evaluation, this relatively stable groundwater resource, accessed by solar-powered pumps, can be a decentralized alternative minimizing the emissions, waste and other environmental costs implied by larger infrastructure projects that disrupt natural waterflows. Through Just Water Partnerships ? collaborative frameworks that pool such solar-groundwater projects for increased bankability while ensuring community ownership ? international finance can be channeled toward water infrastructure that serves both national development goals and the global common good.</p><p>South Africa's G20 presidency ? the first ever for an African country ? offers a historic platform to advance this agenda globally. Just as Brazil has used its G20 leadership and role as host of the upcoming United Nations Climate Change Conference to drive climate action, South Africa can make water security central to the global economic agenda. With the 2026 UN Water Conference on the horizon, and with the international community recognizing that climate change cannot be tackled without also addressing the water crisis, the time is right for bold leadership.</p><p>The African Water Investment Summit is not just another gathering, but should be a watershed.

The annual Smart City Expo World Congress, in its 14th edition, commenced its three-day run on Nov. 5. Hosted by the city of Barcelona and Fira Barcelona, the congress serves as a global hub for urban development that connects people and companies working to build better cities.Under the theme \"Live Better,\" this year's expo urgently called for climate resilience and sustainability as cities worldwide face the growing impacts of climate change. Held at Fira Barcelona's Gran Via venue, the event attracted a record-breaking 25,771 attendees from 850 cities globally, according to the organizers. </p><p>Featuring 1,150 exhibitors and 632 speakers across 261 sessions, the scale of the expo prompted Fira Barcelona to expand the exhibition space by 30 percent to meet the increased demand, they said.\"If we want to 'live better,' we should change our way of life, use technology, and seek innovation through collaboration. The goal of the expo is to address various urban challenges with innovation for better living and sustainability for the future,\" said Ugo Valenti, director of the expo.Highlighting the Barcelona Supercomputing Center's use of simulations and artificial intelligence to forecast and manage natural disasters across Europe, said Laia Bonet, Vice Mayor of Barcelona for urbanism, ecological transition, mobility and housing, \"The smartness of a city is not defined by how much data or technology it deploys. It is defined by how it uses data, technology and knowledge to manage and prevent extreme climate events.\"\"Being smart doesn't only mean predicting and tackling disasters. One of the smartest things we can do is to adapt and mitigate the effects of the climate emergency in the long run,\" she said, underscoring the need for resilience to be integrated into urban infrastructure.The catastrophic flooding on Oct. 29 that devastated the province of Valencia serves as a stark reminder of the urgency of these challenges. The flooding claimed at least 222 lives and destroyed infrastructure, homes, businesses and factories.\"The devastating rainfall highlighted the need for cities to prepare for the effects of climate change and be ready to guarantee the well-being of citizens. Technology enables governments and institutions to monitor and set early warning protocols that can mitigate the effects of events such as the storms in Valencia,\" an official from the Fira Barcelona said. Building inclusive communitiesMajora Carter, a real estate developer and urban revitalization strategist from the South Bronx, delivered a speech at the expo focusing on the concept of \"low-status communities.\" Carter highlighted the systemic challenges these communities face, such as poor public services and limited economic opportunities, which are deeply rooted in historical inequalities. These include practices like redlining -- which in the United States concentrated people of color in neighborhoods deprived of investment and prevented them from accessing loans and buying property -- and discriminatory zoning laws that have segregated and marginalized these areas for decades in New York State.Carter criticized the prevailing notion that success for talented individuals in these communities is measured by how far they can move away to achieve better living conditions. She argued that talent retention is crucial for reversing economic stagnation and fostering community growth. For instance, she transformed a neglected area along the Bronx River into an award-winning park, providing green spaces where residents can connect with nature and each other. Carter also developed job training programs for people facing employment barriers, linking them to the green economy and providing new opportunities within their communities.Carter stressed her vision for equitable urban development, saying, \"Nobody should have to move out of their neighborhood to live in a better one.\"Adding to this global conversation, South Korea made a notable impression at the expo with its active participation. Notably, the \"Korea Pavilion\" featured contributions from a range of institutions, including Busan City, Pohang City, Korea Land &amp; Housing Corporation, Korea Water Resources Corporation, and Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power. Additionally, the Seoul Metropolitan Government, in collaboration with its districtsof Dongdaemun, Gangnam, and Seocho, partnered with 15 AI and big data companies to present the Seoul Pavilion. Other significant participants included the Gyeonggi Housing and Urban Development Corporation and Seongnam City, all showcasing their advancements and initiatives in urban development.One standout initiative was Seocho-gu's \"Smart Inclusion Model,\" particularly highlighted through its \"Seoripul Forest Imagination School.\" This initiative is pioneering access to experiences in nature for people with disabilities, utilizing digital augmented reality content. For the first time in Korea, visitors can walk through a barrier-free forest path and engage with 102 types of AR content across nine themed zones, providing a vivid and interactive experience of local flora and fauna. This project not only enhances cultural and leisure opportunities for disabled individuals but also exemplifies the inclusive approach to urban technology that creates environments where everyone can thrive.\"This initiative aligns perfectly with the vision of making cities equitable, using technology to ensure inclusivity and accessibility for all residents. The integration of innovative solutions like the Seoripul Forest Imagination School demonstrates a commitment to building communities where residents, regardless of their physical abilities, have equal opportunities to engage with and enjoy their local environments,\" said an official from the Seocho-gu district office. She added that government officials from various European countries attended the exhibition to learn from this case.At the expo, some Korean cities and companies were recognized for their innovative contributions to urban development, receiving prestigious awards that highlight their advances in smart city solutions.Seongnam was notably shortlisted as a finalist in the Innovation category of the World Smart City Awards, a first for any Korean local government. Its \"Innovation for Hope\" project focuses on tackling regional inequalities and intergenerational conflicts that have arisen from fast-paced urban development.The Korea Land &amp; Housing Corporation won the Living &amp; Inclusion Award of the World Smart City Awards. COMPAS, the award-winning platform, utilizes citizen participation and data analysis to tackle urban challenges through a crowdsourcing approach.

After completing his undergraduate studies at Konkuk University in Seoul, he went to the United States for graduate school, only to struggle with poor grades and eventually be expelled. It was an extremely difficult period, and having nowhere to go, he even studied on park benches, he recalled.</p><p>Then, a professor introduced him to Charles Sterling at the University of Arizona, who accepted him into a Ph.D. program in HIV/AIDS research. Cho earned his doctorate and returned to Korea, later joining the faculty at his alma mater, Konkuk University.</p><p>Calling himself the \"last-place Ph.D.,\" he said that he just never gave up.</p><p>At 49, Cho paused his academic career to study public policy at Harvard Kennedy School. \"I realized science alone wasn't enough,\" he said. \"To help more people, you need policy, you need business.\"</p><p>Over the years, he served twice as president of the AIDS Society of Asia and the Pacific and worked on global health and development projects.</p><p>World Vision Korea</p><p>Cho assumed his current role at World Vision in 2021.</p><p>Founded in 1950 during the Korean War to support war orphans and widows by Korean pastor Han Kyung-jik and American journalist-pastor Bob Pierce, World Vision has grown into the world's largest international NGO, operating in about 100 countries. With an annual budget of approximately 4.2 trillion won ($3.09?billion), it has helped more than 200 million children over 75 years.</p><p>Over the years, South Korea has also undergone transformation, from one of the world's poorest countries to now the 12th-largest economy and from aid recipient to \"donor nation.\"</p><p>\"Now is the time to show the world a warmer, more compassionate Korea. World Vision aims to be part of that journey,\" Cho said.</p><p>World Vision Korea recently expanded its focus to address the growing impact of climate change on vulnerable children. \"Climate change affects everyone, but for children in fragile regions, it's a matter of survival,\" said Cho. \"While wealthier communities can adapt, children in poor areas suffer first and worst.\"</p><p>One example is the Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration initiative to restore forests in Ethiopia. The project reforests degraded land, improves ecosystems, and helps communities build climate resilience ? while offering carbon offset opportunities for global partners.</p><p>The organization is also embracing new approaches to fundraising. On June 1, World Vision became the first NGO in Korea to accept cryptocurrency donations, partnering with Dunamu, the operator of the digital asset exchange Upbit.

Dubash</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEW DELHI - When climate change is framed as a global problem requiring collective regulation of greenhouse-gas emissions, developing-country governments see little reason to prioritize the issue over others. After all, the rich, industrialized countries who contributed disproportionately to the problem are themselves backing away from decarbonization and climate-finance commitments, while low-income countries bear the brunt of the costs of climate change. Decision-makers in developing countries understandably conclude it may be more rational to hunker down and focus on climate resilience rather than emissions reductions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But this is not the only way to frame the problem. While climate change undoubtedly poses a global collective-action problem, in practice climate outcomes are shaped by myriad decisions concerning development objectives such as industrial development, urbanization, job creation, and local pollution management. Because late developers often have not entirely locked into energy systems, transport infrastructure, urbanization plans, and energy consumption patterns, they have greater flexibility to steer investment and consumption choices toward lower-carbon and climate-resilient options.</p><p>In other words, the climate challenge can be framed as a choice among alternative development pathways. In many cases, development choices are also climate choices, and in a world where being a low-carbon economy confers a competitive edge, the absence of structural lock-in could be turned into an advantage.</p><p>Pursuing a climate-as-development approach is not easy or foolproof: It requires considerable state capacity, strategy-setting capabilities, and full mobilization of the necessary technologies and finance. Importantly, it does not negate concerns about climate equity. Developing countries may opt to pursue the climate-as-development opportunity, but rich countries that disproportionately caused the problem remain on the hook to support this transition. Yet, this perspective offers an alternative to the zero-sum framing of climate policy and a basis for nationally specific visions.</p><p>An important starting point is that elites internalize and support low-carbon development as a potential opportunity, with climate resilience as a necessary component. Climate objectives cannot trump development goals, but, equally, development innocent of climate considerations is no longer viable. To be politically feasible, any strategy must be rooted in the national context. Low-carbon development pathways are not easily replicable and need to be tailored to geography, local capacities, and other variables. And, as with any long-term structural change, a durable, widely shared national narrative is needed (South Korea\u2019s \u201cgreen growth\u201d in the 2010s is a useful example).</p><p>Shifting from narrative and vision to policy and implementation requires high levels of state capacity. Technical capabilities, along with the ability to identify climate-as-development opportunities and sources of climate vulnerability, are necessary, but by no means sufficient. In addition, as sociologist Peter Evans\u2019 analysis of East Asian industrial policy reminds us, the state must be simultaneously \u201cembedded\u201d to engage and support private-sector players, and maintain sufficient \u201cautonomy\u201d to avoid capture.</p><p>In practice, this means building institutions that can set the strategy, coordinate across sectors and at different scales, and provide trusted platforms to mediate conflict, ideally enshrined in law. All too often, climate policymaking is entrusted to relatively weak or siloed environmental ministries that cannot organize or enforce an all-of-government approach. Moreover, because broad structural changes can introduce distributional concerns and leave some communities behind, deliberative bodies - such as South Africa\u2019s Presidential Climate Commission - can help to entrench low-carbon options by mediating social frictions and maintaining broad-based political buy-in.</p><p>Another major challenge for developing and emerging economies facing high capital costs is mobilizing adequate finance for capital-intensive low-carbon development. There are no easy answers here. According to BloombergNEF, global investment in the low-carbon energy transition in 2024 was only around one-third of the annual amount required through 2030, and there were wide disparities in spending. Developing countries have experienced few tangible gains from multilateral initiatives to scale up climate finance and reform the international financial architecture. Holding advanced economies to their financing commitments should remain a priority; but developing countries also need to mobilize more domestic finance and develop credible investment programs to attract global capital.</p><p>Recent efforts to create \u201ccountry platforms\u201d - government-led coordination mechanisms that articulate a vision and identify financing pathways to achieve it - suggest one way forward. In preparing to host this year\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30), Brazil is seeking to lead the way with a comprehensive multisectoral development program to mobilize investment. Independent research suggests that Brazil has all the ingredients for a successful green industrial transformation: a strong resource base, a legacy of advanced manufacturing, and a large market. Such models are worth exploring elsewhere, provided that they reflect a national vision, not donor-driven objectives.</p><p>One common criticism of nationally led, multi-objective development strategies is that the urgency of the climate crisis demands more direct action focused on emissions reduction, rather than on the indirect pathways suggested here. But this view ignores political reality. If climate action is seen to be at odds with other development objectives, it will lose. The only option is to devise strategies that can realize both sets of goals. The most effective climate policy over the long term might be one that shapes structural choices regarding urbanization and industrialization, rather than one that focuses narrowly on regulating emissions.</p><p>With the scope for global cooperation receding in today\u2019s fraught geopolitical environment, these arguments should not be interpreted as a call for atomization. On the contrary, developing national visions for low-carbon, resilient economies would benefit from mutual learning and enhanced coordination rooted in attention to local contexts.</p><p>Moreover, deploying low-carbon technologies will require investment in stable value chains, which depends on political and economic predictability. Developing countries, in particular, will have to be strategic and nimble in finding a niche for themselves. And the provision of finance at the necessary scale will still depend on a threshold degree of global cooperation.</p><p>But there is only one foundation that can support all these elements: a domestically developed vision of a low-carbon, competitive, and resilient economy.</p><p>Navroz K.

And the problems of desertification and droughts almost become forgotten. But this neglect is not only unjustified, it is dangerous. While desertification and droughts are slow-moving and less dramatic than wars, floods, and fires, they are just as devastating. Just ask the more than 500 million people living in the MENA region who must cope with them each day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whereas healthy land produces food, retains water, absorbs carbon, and supports livelihoods, degraded land does not. And from the Atlas Mountains to the Tigris-Euphrates river valley, the MENA region features some of the driest - and most rapidly degrading - landscapes on Earth. With temperatures in the region rising nearly twice as fast as the global average, water scarcity, extreme heatwaves, and desertification are increasingly shaping everyday life. Add to that some of the world\u2019s fastest-growing populations, and the risks to food security, economic stability, and social cohesion will only grow.</p><p>MENA\u2019s experiences are an ominous portent of what awaits other regions, which will soon find themselves facing many of the same challenges. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the frequency and duration of droughts have increased globally by nearly 30 percent since 2000. More than 3.2 billion people worldwide are now affected by land degradation, with 12 million hectares of arable land lost each year.</p><p>But the MENA region also offers reason for hope. For example, Saudi Arabia - for which I am the FAO\u2019s program director - has been investing heavily in mitigating and, where possible, reversing the effects of climate change, including through land rehabilitation, rangeland restoration, reforestation, and climate adaptation.</p><p>The Kingdom\u2019s ambition is exemplified by the Saudi Green Initiative, which includes pledges to plant ten billion trees and rehabilitate 40 million hectares of degraded land. Innovation is central to this effort. One novel land-restoration technique, developed through a collaboration between Saudi technical institutions and the FAO, uses dry palm leaves to stabilize sand dunes in Saudi Arabia\u2019s Eastern Province. This organic material, which was historically considered waste, protects topsoil from wind erosion and slows the rate at which water evaporates, thereby ensuring enough moisture for dormant native seeds to germinate.</p><p>The FAO is also working with Saudi Arabia to implement science-based land-monitoring systems, scale up sustainable land-management techniques, and train national experts in climate-smart practices. More than 40 professionals have been trained across key regions, including Al-Jouf, Riyadh, and the Eastern Province. While solutions are always adapted to the local ecosystem, they are designed with scalability in mind.</p><p>But climate change is not bound by national borders. That is why Saudi Arabia created the Middle East Green Initiative, which aims to strengthen regional cooperation. At the global level, the Kingdom is spearheading the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership, aimed at helping the most vulnerable countries cope with drought.</p><p>Since the initiative\u2019s announcement at the 2024 UN Convention to Combat Desertification (COP16), more than $3 billion has been mobilized. It helps that, beyond being crucial to human well-being, land restoration is a high-return investment: the FAO estimates that every dollar invested in it can yield up to $30 in economic and environmental returns.</p><p>Local NGOs and communities are playing a growing role in land-restoration efforts, such as by establishing nurseries for native plants, building green belts, and raising public awareness about land restoration. This combination of local action, national direction, and international cooperation delivers the kind of robust, lasting results that are needed to build true climate resilience. And it should serve as a model for the rest of the world.</p><p>The climate crisis is advancing fast, but so are solutions - thanks not least to those on the frontline. The most climate-vulnerable countries are acting as role models, innovators, pioneers, and leaders. What Saudi Arabia is doing today will shape what California, southern Europe, and the Sahel do tomorrow.

The core message is simple: Everyone is a water manager and every drop counts.</p><p>I proposed this concept through my nongovernmental organization, Rain For All, and it was adopted after years of field implementation in Southeast Asia. In the Mekong region, more than 20 Rain Schools have been successfully established. These schools not only serve as educational hubs but also demonstrate how rainwater harvesting can improve daily life and build resilience in vulnerable communities.</p><p>In Cambodia specifically, the Rain School Initiative has been formally integrated into the national education and water policy. The Cambodian Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports has expressed a commitment to expand the model nationwide, aiming to build 1,000 Rain Schools across the country. These schools engage students and teachers in practical learning ? monitoring rainfall, testing water quality and promoting water-saving habits. Rain becomes more than a resource; it becomes a subject of science.</p><p>Beyond Cambodia, Rain Schools and Rainwater for Drinking (RFD) systems have been introduced in other Southeast Asian countries and Pacific Island nations. These efforts respond not only to water scarcity but also to a broader set of climate challenges.</p><p>We are currently piloting a new model of decentralized water service: the rainwater drinking cluster. This approach centers around a Rain School equipped with mobile RFD systems ? compact, electricity-free purification units capable of producing drinking-quality water. Households in surrounding villages draw from this cluster, creating a low-cost, community-scale water network without the need for underground infrastructure. It is an alternative to piped water systems and has proven useful in disaster-prone areas.</p><p>The broader implications of MoMoMo are significant. It offers practical solutions to pressing issues like wildfires caused by dry landscapes, groundwater depletion from overextraction and the breakdown of urban water cycles due to impermeable surfaces. MoMoMo even offers strategies to mitigate urban heatwaves through improved moisture retention and landscape design, aligning with both mitigation and adaptation goals under climate policy.</p><p>MoMoMo\u2019s recognition in the U.N. report reflects a shift in global thinking. It validates the role of traditional wisdom, civic engagement and cultural values in shaping sustainable development. It also underscores Korea\u2019s potential to lead in environmental innovation ? not through megaprojects, but through community-based, ethical and educational approaches.</p><p>Moving forward, we aim to build a global Rain School network, collaborate with international partners and organize official sessions and side events at the 2026 U.N.

Trump immediately signed an executive order withdrawing the US from the Paris climate agreement, and his administration then canceled funding for clean-energy projects under the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Against this backdrop, some companies are quietly downplaying or abandoning their previously announced environmental and climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But no amount of shock-and-awe policy disruption in one country compares to the disruption caused by climate change. Already, the financial costs from disrupted global supply chains - owing to water stress, biodiversity loss, and land degradation - are projected to reach up to $25 trillion by 2060.</p><p>Businesses that fail to manage these risks will face higher costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, and reputational damage. For example, automakers that are slow-playing the transition to electric vehicles may find themselves scrambling to catch up as more governments enact legislation to phase out internal combustion engines in the coming years. In time, legacy auto brands are likely to face the same kind of scrutiny and reputational fallout that oil and gas producers have.</p><p>By contrast, companies that proactively build greater resilience throughout their businesses and supply chains will benefit from greater investor confidence, and thus lower capital costs. For example, the champagne brand Taittinger has opened a vineyard in Kent to manage the risk that climate change poses to production in France.</p><p>But with the climate-finance industry focused mostly on the net-zero agenda (reducing emissions), physical risks and climate-adaptation needs have not received the attention they merit. As a result, banks, asset managers, and (especially) insurers are sitting on a time bomb of potential liabilities. Adapting to a world characterized by biodiversity loss, water stress, and other risks is now crucial to maintaining corporate profitability over the long term.</p><p>Far-sighted countries and companies will recognize that this upheaval represents an opportunity. In separate studies, McKinsey Sustainability and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) estimated the economic opportunity represented by the sustainable transition at $12 trillion per year by 2030.</p><p>Similarly, Kantar BrandZ assessments show that perceptions of sustainability enhance brand equity (value in the eyes of customers), drive sales, and allow brands to command a premium. Yet even as sustainability perceptions add as much as 10% to the value of the top 100 brands, these companies are still leaving an estimated $600 billion on the table. The next decade of business will be defined by companies that recognize sustainability as an economic imperative, rather than just a regulatory requirement.</p><p>Economic power is shifting fast with the impending generational transfer of wealth. In the U.S. alone, the transfer of wealth from baby boomers (born between 1946 and 1964) to millennials (1981-96) and Gen Z (1997-2012) could amount to $84.4 trillion over the next 20 years.</p><p>As millennial and Gen Z consumers become more dominant in the marketplace, they are seeking brands that reflect their values, and chief among these is a preference for mutualism over individualism: a sense of community and shared responsibility for collective gain in the face of anticipated uncertainty and adversity. In this context, businesses like Airbnb, Vinted, and IKEA are stealing a march with brand communications that focus on cooperation, community, and a sense of belonging. Airbnb\u2019s stated purpose, for example, is to \u201ccreate a world where anyone can belong anywhere.\u201d</p><p>Most of the business community understands what it at stake. In Kantar\u2019s work with the Climate Governance Initiative, 88% of board directors told us that climate change requires new thinking and new forms of leadership from top executives to the workforce, and 84% viewed climate-related challenges as opportunities for business innovation.</p><p>As global business leaders increasingly recognize the need for a new mindset, one finds more and more brands exploring circular business models - such as reuse, repair, and rental - that allow them to differentiate themselves, strengthen customer loyalty, and unlock new revenue streams. IKEA\u2019s CIRKUL?R initiative, for example, uses financial rewards, humor, and green imagery to encourage customers to buy and sell used IKEA items, decoupling growth from the production of new items.</p><p>As global markets increasingly focus on business resilience and respond to the rise of industrial policy and longer-term investment strategies, companies that adapt to generational change will be best positioned to lead the next industrial revolution. We are experiencing much more than the shock of U.S. policy shifts. To remain credible in the eyes of consumers and investors, brands and businesses will have to get serious about building climate resilience into their operations - whether by addressing single points of failure in their supply chains or by implementing robust crisis and recovery plans.</p><p>For businesses, the need to adapt to climate change isn\u2019t going away, and neither is consumer demand for sustainable solutions.

From maritime shipping, which carries 80 percent of global trade, to the undersea fiber-optic cables that transmit 95 percent of international data, the ocean is deeply embedded in our societies and daily lives. According to one projection, ocean-based industries could generate more than $3 trillion annually by 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the ocean is far more than an economic engine. It\u2019s also the planet\u2019s largest natural climate regulator, absorbing nearly 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions, capturing 90 percent of excess heat, and storing 50 times more carbon than the atmosphere. And yet the ocean\u2019s capacity to provide these vital services is now nearing a tipping point.</p><p>The case for investing in sustainable solutions has never been stronger, and doing so offers a unique opportunity to unlock financial flows at scale. After all, today\u2019s ocean economy represents a multi-trillion-dollar investment frontier, spanning multiple sectors that depend on a healthy marine environment: renewable energy, coastal infrastructure, ports, maritime transport, sustainable fisheries, and aquaculture. The cost of inaction is simply too high and is increasing.</p><p>But these opportunities remain largely untapped. Although the sustainable blue economy is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years to over $3.2 trillion by 2030, a substantial funding gap continues to hinder sustainable ocean-related development and innovation.</p><p>As extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and shifting coastlines increasingly disrupt coastal areas and key industries, this shortfall poses a grave threat to both climate resilience and long-term economic growth.</p><p>Between 2012 and 2022, just $13 billion was invested in ocean sustainability, mostly from official development assistance and philanthropic sources. This reflects the widespread perception that ocean-based ventures are more risk than reward, with investors frequently pointing to regulatory uncertainty, fragmented markets, and a shortage of bankable projects.</p><p>To unlock the full potential of a sustainable ocean economy, policymakers and business leaders must focus on three key priorities. First, they must recognize the ocean as a high-growth investment opportunity.</p><p>Blue finance has traditionally focused on conservation and restoration efforts, which are necessary but insufficient to drive the systemic change needed to safeguard ocean health. Achieving such change will require recognizing that large-scale projects can, in addition to providing financial returns, help build climate resilience and promote inclusive economic growth. Scalable, commercially viable projects span sectors such as renewable energy, shipping, coastal infrastructure, large-scale aquaculture, and ports.</p><p>Second, attracting private capital requires de-risking ocean investments. Developers and industrial stakeholders must work closely with multilateral development banks, insurers, and philanthropies to reduce perceived risks through concessional financing and first-loss guarantees, thereby reducing capital costs and encouraging private-sector participation.</p><p>Third, the pipeline of bankable ocean-based projects must be expanded. While developers often point to a lack of funding, one of the main obstacles to capital deployment is the limited availability of mature, scalable projects. Bridging this gap will require coordinated action across borders and industries.</p><p>Governments, investors, and business leaders must work together to establish supportive regulatory frameworks, form public-private partnerships, and facilitate targeted investments that can bring viable, high-impact ventures to market.</p><p>The main challenge for emerging and developing economies across the Global South is addressing investors\u2019 concerns about regulatory and policy uncertainty, currency volatility, underdeveloped capital markets, and inadequate financial infrastructure.</p><p>Alongside technology transfers and knowledge-sharing, these economies must embrace nature-positive approaches to ocean-based industries and infrastructure development.</p><p>The offshore wind sector offers a promising model. For example, innovations such as Shanghai Electric Wind Power\u2019s recyclable wind turbine blades demonstrate how integrating capital, cutting-edge technologies, and shared expertise can drive progress.</p><p>These efforts can be complemented by developing policies such as Costa Rica\u2019s National Decarbonization Plan, which aims to transition the country to 100% renewable energy by 2050.

Growth is decelerating, climate-related volatility is rising, and debt distress is deepening, but the available policy tools remain too cumbersome, fragmented, and inefficient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Africa has long borne the brunt of these failures. But rather than merely calling for reform, African governments are increasingly advancing solutions, building institutions, and introducing innovations to help create an international financial system that allocates capital more efficiently and is equipped to handle escalating shocks and widening inequalities.</p><p>While calls for reform are often framed as a matter of fairness, the more pressing issue is efficacy. The global financial system fails to provide sufficient liquidity during crises, invest in climate adaptation, channel capital to high-return yet underfinanced green-sector opportunities, and resolve sovereign-debt disputes quickly enough to preserve development gains. It is economically dysfunctional and ultimately destabilizing.</p><p>That is why African countries have championed international debt reform and local-currency financing in recent years, urging multilateral development banks (MDBs) to take on a more active role. These proposals reflect a growing recognition that structural failures raise risk premiums, deter investment, and leave national economies increasingly exposed to external shocks.</p><p>Debt distress is the most urgent and systemic threat to global development. More than 30 African countries currently spend more on servicing external debts than on health and education. While the IMF\u2019s Global Sovereign Debt Roundtable Playbook encourages creditors and borrowers to come to the table sooner and emphasizes the need for transparency, its impact remains limited by a lack of enforceability.</p><p>African governments have responded by calling for a debt resolution framework that is predictable, rules-based, and responsive to development needs. Today\u2019s system - plagued by delays, elevated risk premiums, and poor creditor coordination - fails to align incentives, contain spillovers, and mobilize private investment. Fortunately, South Africa\u2019s G20 presidency provides a unique opportunity for the continent to push for bold reforms that reframe debt not as a liability but as a growth catalyst.</p><p>One notable example of African efforts to redesign the global financial system is the proposal to repurpose special drawing rights (SDRs, the IMF\u2019s reserve asset) as hybrid capital for MDBs. This idea, advanced by the African Development Bank and the G24, would allow SDRs to be leveraged while retaining their reserve-asset status, thereby creating more space for concessional lending. Several MDBs are now considering the proposal as a way to strengthen their balance sheets and expand lending capacity.</p><p>Similarly, regional institutions like the Trade and Development Bank and the Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa (BADEA) are advancing pooled credit enhancements, South-South financing platforms, and climate-finance mechanisms tailored to fragile contexts. These are not just innovations - they are viable templates that global policymakers should adopt and scale.</p><p>To be clear, public financing alone cannot mobilize the volume of investment needed to boost growth, build resilience, and accelerate the climate transition. But private capital flows continue to bypass many African economies, deterred by perceptions of high risk, rising borrowing costs, limited financial instruments, and weak project pipelines.</p><p>Instruments like credit guarantees, blended finance, and first-loss capital could help rebalance risk-return profiles and attract private investment. But to be effective, they must be deployed at scale, not confined to pilot projects. Equally critical are upstream reforms that strengthen legal frameworks and institutional capacity in order to develop a strong pipeline of investable projects.</p><p>Africa\u2019s experience shows that MDBs must support both downstream and upstream investment. A persistent blind spot is the failure to promote local-currency finance and domestic capital market development. Over-reliance on foreign-currency borrowing exposes African countries to market volatility and raises debt-service costs. Yet MDBs and development partners continue to treat local-currency instruments as fringe or experimental.</p><p>They shouldn\u2019t.</p><p>Brazil\u2019s Tesouro RendA+ and Educa+ programs can serve as a useful model, demonstrating the potential of inflation-adjusted, retail-accessible savings instruments. These tools, delivered through mobile apps and gift cards in increments as low as $1, have successfully mobilized long-term domestic capital while fostering financial inclusion. Likewise, the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS) - now operational across multiple central banks - is enabling cross-border trade in local currencies, addressing market frictions, and providing a blueprint for building a more resilient financial system.</p><p>To respond effectively to climate-related shocks, Africa needs a comprehensive toolkit that includes debt-for-climate swaps, green bonds, and concessional financing facilities capable of attracting private investment in adaptation measures. While the IMF\u2019s Resilience and Sustainability Trust is a step in the right direction, it must be scaled up significantly. More importantly, it must mobilize greater private-sector investment and climate finance.</p><p>The challenge is not only to create new instruments, but also to improve implementation. MDBs and donors must simplify access, enhance coordination, and incorporate climate resilience into national investment strategies.</p><p>Africa\u2019s priorities - timely debt resolution, upstream-investment readiness, local-currency borrowing, and large-scale climate finance - are not merely regional demands. They are systemic solutions that would make the global financial system more responsive and better prepared to withstand future crises.</p><p>In a world increasingly plagued by compounding shocks and capital scarcity, African governments are advancing actionable, forward-looking solutions that address the financial system\u2019s most persistent blind spots.

", "published": "2025-05-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world has spent the past 80 years building the current multilateral system ?anchored by institutions like the United Nations and the World Bank. Born from the devastation of two world wars, this system was largely designed and driven by the United States with the goal of ensuring lasting peace and shared prosperity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet it took only a few months ? perhaps a few years, if counting his first term ? for President Donald Trump to seriously disrupt this structure. By withdrawing from or weakening key multilateral treaties and organizations, Trump fundamentally challenged the foundations of the international order.</p><p>The pressing question now is whether the multilateral world that has shaped global norms for eight decades can endure without the active engagement of the United States. Equally important: What role, if any, can middle-power countries like South Korea play in this evolving global landscape?</p><p>This is not a theoretical concern for Korea, which faces a pivotal presidential election in less than a month. As the international order shifts rapidly under the weight of Trump's impulsive and unpredictable trade and security policies, Seoul must define and assert its role to stay relevant. In a new multipolar system where powers like the European Union and China are already moving to fill the vacuum left by US retreat, Korea needs leadership that understands and champions the multilateralism that has underpinned its economic and security gains for decades.</p><p>So what will the world look like in an era of American isolationism? Will the multilateral system collapse with the withdrawal of its chief architect? Unlikely. Institutions like intergovernmental organizations and other frameworks of global governance have weathered previous crises ? such as oil shocks and regional conflicts ? and have proven resilient. They may survive the current turbulence, but the contours of the system will inevitably shift. New norms and agendas will emerge, shaped by rising powers such as the EU and the BRICS countries ? Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, among others ? who are increasingly asserting themselves on the global stage.</p><p>Since his second inauguration, Trump has pulled the US out of several intergovernmental organizations, including UNESCO, the UN Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. He cited alleged anti-Israel and pro-China biases as justifications. These withdrawals, coupled with the US exit from the Paris Agreement on climate change, have seriously weakened multilateral institutions ? especially given America's historic role as a major funder and influencer. The WHO, for instance, has already reported funding shortfalls that it warns could endanger global health efforts.</p><p>Perhaps even more damaging is Trump's aggressive trade policy. From day one of his second term, he imposed or threatened steep tariffs on both allies and rivals. Product-specific tariffs ? on steel, automobiles and more ? were layered on top. Trump's latest move, a proposal for sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs,\" would impose a 25 percent blanket tariff on Korean exports to the US. His agenda is clear: Dismantle the WTO's multilateral trade framework and replace it with bilateral deals where American leverage is maximized.</p><p>Despite this, multilateralism is likely to persist ? though in a different form. Rather than being dominated by a single superpower, IGOs and other international mechanisms will be increasingly influenced by multiple major players. The EU, emboldened by Trump's provocations, is already stepping up, not just in Europe but globally. European nations have committed to increased defense spending in response to Trump's demands to restructure NATO. Similarly, regional organizations like the African Union and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations are poised to take on more active roles.</p><p>Non-Western powers, especially BRICS nations, will bring new momentum to multilateralism. China, India and others are already filling the leadership void with bold initiatives. China's Belt and Road Initiative and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank directly challenge the US-dominated global financial architecture led by the World Bank and the IMF. Under such developments, even the supremacy of the US dollar could come under question, despite Trump's rhetorical threats to uphold it.</p><p>This evolving multilateralism brings real risks. Chief among them is the infusion of values that challenge the West's liberal, rules-based order. Disillusioned developing countries, alienated by Trump's \"America First\" rhetoric, may be drawn to alternative systems that emphasize state sovereignty over democracy and human rights. A multilateral order led by authoritarian regimes, many of which now populate the expanded BRICS bloc, could prioritize control and coercion over cooperation and fairness.</p><p>That is precisely why middle powers like South Korea must step forward. Rather than remain a passive bystander, Korea should assert its voice to defend and promote a liberal international order from which it has greatly benefited. The UN military support during the Korean War and postwar financial aid from institutions like the World Bank were foundational to Korea's security and economic rise. It is now Korea's turn to help sustain the system in the absence ? whether temporary or permanent ? of its original architect.</p><p>This is no small task for a country of Korea's size. But if it is serious about fulfilling its aspiration to become a \"Global Pivotal State,\" it must take the lead in key areas like digital governance, climate resilience and global health.

This year, prolonged tropical nights and rising temperatures delayed harvests and impacted fruit quality, prompting the island to adapt its agricultural practices.\"Mandarins develop their yellow color when nighttime temperatures fall below 20 degrees Celsius,\" said Hyun Jong-ho, manager at the Namwon Agricultural Product Center, one of Jeju's busiest distribution centers. \"This year's prolonged heat has reduced the quantity of harvest-ready mandarins,\" Hyun added.Hyun further explained that extreme conditions are increasingly causing delays in ripening and disruptions to harvest timelines. </p><p>According to the Korea Meteorological Administration, tropical nights lasted 63 days from July to September -- nearly double the previous year -- while heatwave days, when temperatures exceed 33 degrees Celsius, totaled 21.4 during the same period.To address these challenges, Jeju authorities revised regulations in October to allow the sale of green mandarins if they meet strict sweetness standards. This adjustment, along with modified size and quality criteria, is expected to slightly boost harvested volume, with open-field production estimated at 408,000 tons this year, up from 398,000 tons in 2023.Despite these efforts, local officials acknowledge the challenges posed by erratic weather patterns, including decreased fruit size and delayed coloring. Meanwhile, subtropical crops are emerging as a potential alternative as Jeju's climate grows warmer.The Agricultural Research Institute for Climate Change Adaptation, under the Rural Development Administration, has introduced 58 subtropical crops and identified 17 promising varieties, including mangoes, passion fruit and dragon fruit. \"To address the declining cultivation areas for traditional crops, we need to develop new varieties and expand subtropical farming techniques,\" said Han Hyun-hee, a researcher at the institute.However, transitioning to subtropical fruits is a challenge because their cultivation requires costly greenhouses and a shift from traditional mandarin farming methods. \"Farmers remain hesitant to switch to subtropical crops due to higher initial investments and unfamiliar farming practices,\" Han added.Jeju's deep-rooted affection for mandarins reflects their importance to the island's identity and economy. As of 2023, mandarins accounted for 55.8 percent of Jeju's total agricultural revenue, generating 1.32 trillion won that year, with 35.7 percent of Jeju's arable land devoted to citrus farming, according to the Korea Rural Economic Institute.The significance of mandarins is part of the 2024 Jeju Citrus Expo, which celebrates its 12th year.

This year is expected to be the hottest in centuries. Heat waves are hotter, longer and more frequent than they were in the 1960s.By now, most of us understand that extreme heat is bad for our health, making our hearts, lungs, kidneys and other organs work much harder. But too often we overlook the quieter, less obvious toll heat takes on another vital organ: our brain.Extreme heat doesn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt just make us cranky and uncomfortable, it can make it harder to think clearly and be productive at work. </p><p>It also worsens our mental health, exacerbating common mood disorders like anxiety and depression as well as rarer conditions like schizophrenia and self-harming. With each warming year, that issue deserves more time and attention.Typically, a part of our brain called the hypothalamus keeps our body at its natural internal temperature (for most, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds around 37 Celsius). But the human brain only has so much energy to devote to that, explains Kim Meidenbauer, a social, cognitive, and environmental neuroscientist at Washington State University. On an oppressively hot day, \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdone of the first things that seems to go is higher cognitive functioning,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd she says, making it harder to pay attention and impairing working memory (humans\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd ability to process and keep track of information in real time).For some, that cost is high. The elderly, young children, people taking certain medicines for schizophrenia or depression, and those with certain medical conditions or disabilities have a harder time thermoregulating.One analysis of commercial health insurance claims over the course of a decade linked hotter days to an increase in emergency room visits associated with a broad array of mental health conditions. The rate of ER visits was higher in northern parts of the US, suggesting the need for cities in those areas to better adapt their infrastructure to help people when temperatures soar, says Amruta Nori-Sarma, an assistant professor in the Environmental Health Department at Boston University School of Public Health, who led the work. Understanding what is driving those visits -- and who is at most risk -- is critical for preparation and prevention.Heat waves have also been linked to a higher risk of suicidality. In its Climate Resilience Review released this month, London officials noted that the risk of suicide is twice as high in the UK when the temperature is 32 Celsius versus 22 Celsius.And people with schizophrenia are disproportionately at risk of succumbing to the effects of extreme heat. Some 8 percent of the deaths that occurred during the 2021 heat dome in British Columbia were among people with schizophrenia, a group that comprises less than 1 percent of the population there.Liv Yoon, a sociologist at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, has been trying to diagnose the complex causes of those deaths. Multiple factors are at work, including both physiological deficits and social vulnerabilities, she says. A symptom of schizophrenia is an unawareness of one\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds bodily status -- it\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds hard to tell how hot or cold you are. Moreover, people with schizophrenia are often taking medication that can compromise the body\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds ability to thermoregulate.What\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds the solution? Reducing the mental health impact of climate change will require some obvious structural fixes, whether that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds policy aimed at slowing global warming, addressing social determinants of health, or improvements in the design of cities to minimize dangerous hot spots.Hospitals need to know when to expect an influx of patients, and at the same time, more needs to be done to reduce demand, both by addressing mental health needs before someone reaches the point of a crisis and ensuring people have access to resources amid a heat wave. That\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds especially true for people with schizophrenia, who might be less likely to take advantage of public resources like cooling centers.Many small changes can be made now. For example, training the mental health workforce to be more aware of heat\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds dangers could encourage them to check in on the most vulnerable, connect patients with more resources, and make sure they know when their medicines put them at higher risk when temperatures rise.We all can make a difference, too. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdMore and more research is finding that social isolation is a huge factor\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in predicting someone\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds risks amid extreme heat, Yoon says. The city of Vancouver has been promoting \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdcool kits,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd a physical bag of items that can help people stay safe in the heat. But increasingly, she says, public health officials are recognizing that social connections matter just as much.Whether or not someone leans on their community is one of the best predictors of resilience, Nori-Sarma says. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdThose social ties are often the most protective measures we have in place.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdChecking in on friends, tuning into the family text chain, keeping an eye out for your neighbors that live alone -- those small acts can have a big impact on our most vulnerable members of society.As this scorching hot summer drags on, that\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds worth remembering.

Climate Change Conference (COP27) was held in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, from Nov. 6 to 20. World leaders kickstarted the conference on an urgent and somber note. 2022 has shown that climate change can indeed pose an existential threat to humanity, as the year has been marked with several devastating and unprecedented floods, heat waves, droughts and storms. Making matters worse were the geopolitical tensions leading to crises in energy, food, water and inflation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the World Leaders Summit, held over two days during the first week of the conference, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the world is on \u201ca highway to climate hell\u201d and reiterated that there is no time to lose in addressing the climate emergency. Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley surprised the unexpected audience by saying that it is time to revisit and reform the Bretton Woods institutions. Both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), created back in 1942 to help the rebuilding efforts following World War II, are outdated and require an overhaul to effectively address the challenges posed by climate change, argued Mottley. Other leaders shared similar sentiments and showed their support for such an initiative.</p><p>Just before COP27, it was unveiled that efforts remain insufficient to limit the global temperature rise by the end of the century to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Against this backdrop, Egypt's COP27 presidency chose \u201cmoving from negotiations and planning to implementation\u201d as its vision for the 2022 conference (#togetherforimplementation). To be more precise, it is the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.</p><p>Article 2, paragraph 1 of the 2015 Paris Agreement calls for a stronger global response to the threat of climate change, including by (a) keeping the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, (b) increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and fostering climate resilience and (c) making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.</p><p>It is Article 2.1(c) of the Paris Agreement that has huge implications for the global finance. All Parties to the Paris Agreement (193 states including the Republic of Korea, plus the European Union) have the obligation to actively align all public and private money with the goals of cutting emissions and strengthening climate resilience. In essence, it requires a complete overhaul and transformation of the global financial system \u2015 a kind that would effectively and systematically channel funds into climate action.</p><p>The term \u201cclimate finance\u201d is generally used to refer to financing from all sources \u2015 public, private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources \u2015 that is meant to support climate change mitigation (to curb emissions and transition to clean energy) and adaptation (to adapt to the adverse effects of the changed climate). Climate finance is a crucial means of implementation for the global, regional and national climate agenda, and it was hotly debated and discussed in the previous U.N. climate change conferences, including COP27.</p><p>What was notable in the recent COP27 negotiations was that the Parties came away with a breakthrough agreement to provide \u201closs and damage\u201d funding for vulnerable countries hit hard by climate-fueled weather extremes and disasters. It marked the very first time that loss and damage was officially included in the U.N. climate negotiations agenda. \u201cLoss and damage\u201d goes beyond financing for mitigation and adaptation and thus, it is a new aspect of climate finance. A negotiator was quoted as saying, in a recent CNN news report, that it is because we did not mitigate sufficiently early enough, we are having to adapt so much. And it is because we didn't get to adapt to the changed climate early enough, we are now talking about the need for loss and damage funding.</p><p>Although governments took the ground-breaking decision to establish a new fund dedicated to assisting developing countries in responding to loss and damage, there are still many questions left unanswered. For one, the scope of loss and damage in climate disasters is not as clear, as well as who should pay and who exactly will qualify for compensation. Vulnerable countries have argued that the polluters, or wealthy countries responsible for historic emissions and a bulk of climate change, must pay up.</p><p>While the U.S. and European Union had resisted such campaigns, fearing spiraling liabilities, they changed their position during COP27. The EU has argued that China should pay into the loss and damage funding as the world's second-largest economy, although the country is classified by the U.N. as a developing country. However, China has not committed to any payment so far.</p><p>As the future of loss and damage funding is not entirely clear, I will use \u201cclimate finance\u201d to refer to the money that is dedicated to financing climate change mitigation and adaptation in the remainder of this column. As we established above, climate finance by definition includes money from public coffers that flows from developed countries to developing countries or that is raised and committed by developing countries themselves, plus any finance that is mobilized by the private sector or other types of contributors like foundations or philanthropies.</p><p>While climate finance includes both public and private investment, it is true that public climate finance has served more like a first responder in dealing with the emergency and has been used in de-risking climate-related investments, often in the form of development aid. As for private climate finance flows, it is methodologically harder to compile and assess such data, as it is not often specified how the private funds are sourced, and whether the funds are received by public or private sector entities from developed or developing countries.</p><p>A popular reference figure in climate finance has been $100 billion. At COP15 held in Copenhagen in 2009, developed country Parties committed to a goal of jointly mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 to help developing countries pay for climate action. This goal was formalized at COP16 in Cancun and was reiterated at COP21 in Paris. However, the $100 billion commitments by the end of 2020 were not met, and this goal has been extended to 2025.</p><p>Although the $100 billion goal has not been met, there has been an upward trend in global climate finance flows. A recent biennial report by the Standing Committee on Finance (SCF) under U.N. Climate Change shows that global climate finance flows in 2019-20 reached an annual average of $803 billion, up 12 percent from the 2017-18 figures. This trend, the report says, was driven largely by increased investment in the energy efficiency of buildings ($34 billion increase), sustainable transport including electric vehicles ($28 billion increase) and adaptation finance ($20 billion increase).</p><p>The same SCF report indicates that more public finance flows from developed to developing countries were for mitigation than for adaptation, although adaptation finance has grown significantly through bilateral channels and multilateral development banks (MDBs). Another interesting finding from the report is that public adaptation financing was predominantly delivered through grants, while public mitigation financing predominantly took the form of grants in 2019-20.</p><p>The increased funding channelled for mitigation actions was more pronounced in the realm of private climate finance. The SCF's biennial report says between 2016 and 2020, private climate financing mobilized by developed countries for developing countries through bilateral and multilateral channels totalled $66.8 billion. Of this amount, 86 percent was mobilized for mitigation actions, particularly in the energy sector, while the rest was mobilized for adaptation actions targeting industry, mining and construction.</p><p>Private climate finance was mobilized through various mechanisms, although there was a dominance of direct investment in companies and special purpose vehicles. MDBs mobilized 57 percent of total estimated private climate finance, followed by bilateral providers and multilateral climate funds like the Green Climate Fund.</p><p>Despite the general upward trend in global climate finance flows, several estimates say we need substantially more climate finance in order to meet the Paris Agreement warming limits. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that the level of climate-related investment in developing countries must increase by between four and eight times before 2030. That would bring annual climate investment in developing countries to around $2 trillion to $3 trillion annually, according to an analysis done by Carbon Brief.</p><p>The SCF under U.N. Climate Change issued another report on the climate finance needs of developing countries to implement their national plans, known as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). This report says such needs are currently estimated at $5.8 trillion to $5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period. The COP27 cover decision text \u2015 titled Sharm el-Sheikh Implementation Plan \u2015 also highlights that \u201cabout $4 trillion per year needs to be invested in renewable energy up until 2030 to be able to reach net zero emissions by 2050.\u201d Further, it is also noted in the cover decision that a global transformation to a low-carbon economy is expected to require investment of at least $4 to 6 trillion per year.</p><p>Bringing all these together, we need a lot more climate finance and need to move from billions to trillions far more rapidly. As U.S. Climate Envoy John Kerry said, no government on earth can raise that level of capital alone. It remains the job of all public and private sector entities, businesses, financial institutions, MDBs and climate funds to unlock trillions and channel the funding to climate action to ensure that the world gets off \u201cthe highway to climate hell.\u201d</p><p>A lack of implementation and action at this critical juncture will spike up costs even further, and by then, even trillions of dollars in climate financing wouldn't be enough to correct the path. The cost of inaction will just be too grave.</p><p>The writer is Knowledge Management and Uptake Specialist at Green Climate Fund.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/newsV2/images/202211/f40e7637f78b4d3fab54db2f8adeed30.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["To be more precise, it is the implementation of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change.

Courtesy of Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and TransportBy Lee Kyung-min Road experts and relevant government officials from Korea and the U.S. held an online seminar, Nov. 5, on improving road infrastructure safety in the face of climate change-induced hazards including landslides, the land ministry said Tuesday.They shared knowledge about Korea's efforts toward digitization of social overhead capital (SOC), a key part of the Korean New Deal. </p><p>Under the deal, the government plans to spend 160 trillion won ($143 billion) on digital and green initiatives over the next five years, creating 1.9 million jobs in the process and identifying new sources of sustainable growth. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport said the seminar was attended by officials from the ministry, the U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) and the Colorado Department of Transportation.Among topics discussed were ways to better respond to hazards resulting from climate change especially landslides, a growing risk to road safety which the ministry says can be monitored with 3D maps of the entire country drawn up by 2022. The maps will be created via a digital twin, a technology that improves the accuracy of simulation models enabled by fuller integration of Internet of Things (IoT). A digital twin refers to a digital replica of a living or non-living physical entity, which can represent actual living or inanimate physical objects including people, places, systems and devices.The officials also discussed digitization of related information needed for the development and implementation of landslide warning systems for roads.This is an issue both countries are increasingly paying attention to because of the continued frequent reports of landslides despite regular check-ups and maintenance of roads on uneven terrain.Such reports are on the rise due to the recent unusual weather events such as an extremely long monsoon season, typhoons and atypical precipitation patterns here, which the ministry views as key reasons prompting greater government prevention measures.Other participants included Korean experts from the Korea Institute of Civil Engineering and Building Technology and the Korea Expressway Corporation Research Institute.Also discussed were research findings on geohazards and climate resilience that can be addressed by an IoT-powered, real-time landslide monitoring system.The U.S. gave presentations on the links between climate change and geohazards, and a performance analysis on geohazard management, the ministry said.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153The impact of climate change is not limited to Korea but is a global issue,\u00e2\u20ac said Oh Soo-young, the ministry's director for road management division.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We therefore plan to work with the U.S. and other countries around the world in research and discussion to build proactive response systems for climate resilience in the field of road management.\u00e2\u20ac</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["Such reports are on the rise due to the recent unusual weather events such as an extremely long monsoon season, typhoons and atypical precipitation patterns here, which the ministry views as key reasons prompting greater government prevention measures.

We do so at a time of unparalleled opportunity for our countries and our citizens, and at a hinge point of history, when geopolitical competition, the climate crisis, Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, and nuclear provocations test us. This is a moment that requires unity and coordinated action from true partners, and it is a moment we intend to meet, together. Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States are determined to align our collective efforts because we believe our trilateral partnership advances the security and prosperity of all our people, the region, and the world. In this spirit, President Biden commended President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida for their courageous leadership in transforming relations between Japan and the ROK. With the renewed bonds of friendship--and girded by the ironclad U.S.-Japan and U.S.-ROK alliances--each of our bilateral relationships is now stronger than ever. So too is our trilateral relationship.</p><p>On this historic occasion, we commit to expand our cooperation trilaterally and raise our shared ambition to a new horizon, across domains and across the Indo-Pacific and beyond. We will strengthen our economies, provide resilience and prosperity, support the free and open international order based on the rule of law, and bolster regional and global peace and security, especially as current and incoming members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). We will strengthen our coordination on promoting democracy and protecting human rights. And we will enhance strategic coordination between the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-ROK alliances and bring our trilateral security cooperation to new heights. As we embark together in this new era, our shared values will be our guide and a free and open Indo-Pacific, in which our half-billion people are safe and prosperous, will be our collective purpose.</p><p>Today, we declare openly that we are united in a common purpose to strengthen our shared region. Our mandate is to ensure Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States are aligned in our objectives and in our actions, generating the common capacity required to ensure that the Indo-Pacific is thriving, connected, resilient, stable, and secure. Ours is a partnership built not just for our people but for the entire Indo-Pacific.</p><p>We announce our governments' commitment to consult with each other in an expeditious manner to coordinate our responses to regional challenges, provocations, and threats that affect our collective interests and security. Through these consultations we intend to share information, align our messaging, and coordinate response actions. To this end we will improve our trilateral communication mechanism to facilitate regular and timely communication between our countries, including our national leadership. We will hold trilateral meetings between our leaders, foreign ministers, defense ministers, and national security advisors at least annually, complementing existing trilateral meetings between our respective foreign and defense ministries. We will also hold the first trilateral meeting between our finance ministers as well as launch a new commerce and industry ministers track that will meet annually. We will also launch an annual Trilateral Indo-Pacific Dialogue to coordinate implementation of our Indo-Pacific approaches and to continually identify new areas for common action. Recognizing the increased threat posed by foreign information manipulation and misuse of surveillance technology, we will also discuss ways to coordinate our efforts to counter disinformation. We welcome the trilateral development policy dialogue planned in October to advance concrete discussions for deepening development policy coordination. We are resolute in our determination to uphold regional security, strengthen Indo-Pacific engagement, and promote common prosperity.</p><p>We wholeheartedly reaffirm ASEAN centrality and unity and our support for the ASEAN-led regional architecture. We are committed to working closely with ASEAN partners to support robust implementation and mainstreaming of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific. We are collectively working to support sustainable energy and promoting water security and climate resilience in the Mekong River Basin. We reaffirm, too, our support of Pacific Island countries and intend to work in genuine partnership with the Pacific in a transparent and effective manner, consistent with the Pacific Way, that strengthens individual countries and the Pacific region. We plan to coordinate regional capacity-building efforts to ASEAN and Pacific Island countries to ensure that they are mutually reinforcing and maximally beneficial to our valued partners, including through capacity building efforts in cybersecurity and financial integrity and our new Trilateral Maritime Security Cooperation Framework.</p><p>We share concerns about actions inconsistent with the rules-based international order, which undermine regional peace and prosperity. Recalling the publicly announced position of each of our countries regarding the dangerous and aggressive behavior supporting unlawful maritime claims that we have recently witnessed by the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the South China Sea, we strongly oppose any unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the waters of the Indo-Pacific. In particular, we steadfastly oppose the militarization of reclaimed features; the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels; and coercive activities. In addition, we are concerned about illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. We reiterate our firm commitment to international law, including the freedom of navigation and overflight, as reflected in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The July 2016 award in the South China Sea arbitration sets out the legal basis for the peaceful resolution of maritime conflicts between the parties to that proceeding. We reaffirm the importance of peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait as an indispensable element of security and prosperity in the international community. There is no change in our basic positions on Taiwan, and we call for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues.</p><p>Furthermore, we reaffirm our commitment to the complete denuclearization of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in accordance with relevant UNSC resolutions and urge the DPRK to abandon its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. We call on all UN Member States to fully implement all relevant UNSC resolutions. We strongly condemn the DPRK's unprecedented number of ballistic missile launches, including multiple intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) launches and conventional military actions that pose a grave threat to peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and beyond. We express concern regarding the DPRK's illicit cyber activities that fund its unlawful WMD and ballistic missile programs. We announce the establishment of a new trilateral working group to drive our cooperation, including with the international community, to combat DPRK cyber threats and block its cyber-enabled sanctions evasion. Japan, the ROK, and the United States remain committed to reestablishing dialogue with the DPRK with no preconditions. We also commit to strengthening cooperation to promote respect for human rights in the DPRK and reaffirm a shared commitment to the immediate resolution of the issues of abductees, detainees, and unrepatriated prisoners of war. We express support for the goal of the ROK's Audacious Initiative and support a unified Korean Peninsula that is free and at peace.</p><p>The United States unequivocally reaffirms that its extended deterrence commitments to both Japan and the ROK are ironclad and backed by the full range of U.S. capabilities. Our three countries announce today that we intend to hold annual, named, multi-domain trilateral exercises on a regular basis to enhance our coordinated capabilities and cooperation. In mid-August, our three countries conducted a maritime ballistic missile defense warning test for the real-time sharing of missile warning data to demonstrate our ability to deter and respond to the DPRK's advancing nuclear and missile threats more effectively. By the end of 2023, we intend to operationalize our sharing of missile warning data on the DPRK in real-time in fulfillment of commitments reflected in the November 2022 Phnom Penh Statement, and our countries have taken initial steps to test our technical capabilities for real-time sharing of missile warning data. We are committed to pursuing enhanced ballistic missile defense cooperation to counter DPRK nuclear and missile threats. We reaffirm that achieving a world without nuclear weapons is a common goal for the international community, and we continue to make every effort to ensure that nuclear weapons are never used again.</p><p>Even as we deepen our security partnership, we will also maintain focus on building robust cooperation in the economic security and technology spheres, leveraging the unique capabilities that each of our countries brings to bear. In implementing our commitments in the Phnom Penh Statement, our national security teams have met twice under the auspices of the Trilateral Economic Security Dialogue to advance our shared objectives. We are now cooperating trilaterally on supply chain resilience, particularly on semiconductors and batteries, as well as on technology security and standards, clean energy and energy security, biotechnology, critical minerals, pharmaceuticals, artificial intelligence (AI), quantum computing, and scientific research.</p><p>oing forward, our countries are committed to working closely together to launch early warning system pilots to expand information sharing and enhance policy coordination on possible disruptions to global supply chains as well as to better prepare us to confront and overcome economic coercion. We will continue to develop the Partnership for Resilient and Inclusive Supply-chain Enhancement (RISE) to help developing countries play larger roles in the supply chains of clean energy products. We will also enhance cooperation on technology protection measures to prevent the cutting-edge technologies we develop from being illegally exported or stolen abroad. To that end, we will conduct inaugural exchanges between the U.S. Disruptive Technology Strike Force and Japanese and ROK counterparts to deepen information-sharing and coordination across our enforcement agencies. We will also continue to strengthen trilateral cooperation on export controls to prevent our technologies from being diverted for military or dual-use capabilities that could potentially threaten international peace and security.</p><p>In tandem with technology protection measures, we will bolster combined and collaborative scientific and technological innovation, including by pursuing new trilateral National Labs cooperation and expanding trilateral collaborative research and development and personnel exchanges, particularly in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) sectors. In addition, we seek to expand trilateral cooperation on open radio access network (RAN) and further enhance trilateral dialogue on space security cooperation, particularly regarding threats in the space domain, national space strategies, and the responsible use of space. We acknowledge the crucial role of AI as a transformative technology and affirm our respective efforts to help shape international governance on AI and ensure safe, secure, and trustworthy AI, in line with our shared democratic values and as the basis for international discussions on frontier AI systems.</p><p>We are fully committed to continuing to eliminate barriers to economic participation and build diverse, accessible, and inclusive economies in which all our people--including women and marginalized groups--can succeed. We will work to further strengthen our people-to-people ties, including among our young people and students. We will continue our cooperation toward the successful conclusion of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) negotiations, and President Yoon and Prime Minister Kishida welcome the United States' hosting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum this year. President Yoon and President Biden applaud Japan's strong and principled leadership at the G7 Hiroshima Summit to respond to challenges that the international community is facing. Together, we are committed to accelerate the clean energy transition; mobilize financing for quality infrastructure and resilient supply chains, including through trilateral collaboration among our development finance institutions as well as through the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII); and promote sustainable economic growth and financial stability, as well as orderly and well-functioning financial markets. We will continue our ambitious agenda to evolve the multilateral development banks to make them more responsive to shared global challenges. The Leaders committed to explore delivering new World Bank Group concessional resources and headroom to fight poverty by addressing global challenges in line with its forthcoming concessionality framework and enhancing resources for the poorest countries, including crisis response.</p><p>We are united in our support for Ukraine. We reaffirm our commitment to stand with Ukraine against Russia's unprovoked and brutal war of aggression that has shaken the foundation of the international order. We commit to continue providing assistance to Ukraine, imposing coordinated, robust sanctions on Russia, and accelerating the reduction of dependency on Russian energy. We believe the lasting lesson from this catastrophic war of aggression must be the international community's abiding will to uphold the principles of territorial integrity, sovereignty, and the peaceful resolution of disputes. We reaffirm our view that when these foundational principles are rejected anywhere, they represent a threat to our region. We are unified in our intent to ensure that no such egregious acts are ever perpetrated again.</p><p>We depart Camp David with a shared resolve and optimism for the future. The opportunity that lies before us was not guaranteed--it was embraced. It is the product of a determination, fiercely held by each of us, that if we are to deliver a peaceful and prosperous future for our people, and the people of the Indo-Pacific, we must more often stand together. Today, we declare that a new chapter in our trilateral relationship has begun. We are aligned in our vision; undaunted in the face of our era's greatest challenges; and, most of all, united in our belief that Japan, the Republic of Korea, and the United States can meet those challenges together, now and in the future.</p><p>Source: Yonhap News Agency</p>", "publisher": "Korea News Gazette", "instances": ["We wholeheartedly reaffirm ASEAN centrality and unity and our support for the ASEAN-led regional architecture.

With countries in the South increasingly championing homegrown solutions, many are now able to provide technical assistance and development finance and share their innovative approaches to support other countries to attain inclusive and sustainable development.Since its establishment seventy-five years ago, the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has forged partnerships and promoted regional cooperation to enable countries to find solutions for the sustainable development challenges facing the region. As we recover from the pandemic, the importance of multilateralism, partnerships and enhancing targeted technical cooperation is even more pronounced and critical for a response to the myriad common and transboundary challenges in the region.The Asia-Pacific region has seen significant progress in reducing extreme poverty, expanding social welfare and accelerating innovation over the past two decades thanks to the shared goals and targets set by the international community since the turn of the century. </p><p>However, as we near the midpoint of implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, COVID-19, the increasing impacts of climate change and geopolitical conflicts have revealed the fragility of our interconnected world. All these crises threaten the hard-earned progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).COVID-19 highlighted the widespread inequalities that exist among countries and within countries through widened gaps in access to health care and other services, financial resources and capacity to implement initiatives for economic recovery, just as rising levels of debt are limiting the ability of governments to address the impact of the pandemic commensurately.In addition to the pandemic, geopolitical conflicts are compounding SDG financing challenges and exposing fault lines in energy and food systems, in international finance and in social protection. It is undoing efforts to strengthen food security and systems by putting additional pressure on limited public resources.This is exacerbated by the impacts of climate change. We are already seeing the devastating impacts of climate change affecting countries that have contributed very little to it. Worldwide, our actions are currently insufficient to ensure the resilience and sustainability of our future. Rising sea levels, extreme weather events and food and water scarcities are projected to increase in intensity and frequency. But the political commitments continue to be vague, and indeed, the gaps between actions and commitments are clearly evident.These issues, particularly inequality, environmental sustainability and climate resilience, require transformational policy measures at the country, regional and global levels. Development challenges that our countries face are too large and too complex to be addressed by one country alone.Looking forward, three elements will be critical to support efforts to build back better and advance the implementation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.First, increased access to financing for sustainable development is urgently required. Governments need to prioritize domestic resource mobilization, curb non-developmental expenditures and safeguard SDG investment, raise additional funds through innovative instruments and work together on debt sustainability. After decades of agreement, we are still far below the ODA target of 0.7 percent of GNI. Yet we have added new pledges to meet global challenges. Developed countries need to follow through on their old and new pledges, particularly the $100 billion per year for climate action, as the threat of climate change has become a clear and present danger for all countries.We also need to adopt more effective approaches and rethink how multilateralism and regional cooperation can effectively overcome transboundary, interlinked challenges, build resilience against shocks and ensure that no one is left behind. All development partners need to work more closely together on a wider range of regional public goods, including through South-South and triangular cooperation.Finally, partnerships need to be broadened and diversified. With a changing donor landscape and new emerging donors, we need to adapt partnerships towards more integrated, effective, and networked development cooperation strategies. We need to identify and overcome the barriers standing in the way of long-term and deeper partnerships with beneficiaries. It is only by interventions that are targeting systemic changes that we will have a sustainable impact. It is also critical to keep existing partnerships dynamic and innovative, especially with more experienced development partners. With this purpose, in June this year, KOICA and ESCAP expanded the scope of collaboration towards achieving concrete outcomes in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Through this revamped agreement, we seek to strengthen our cooperation, including through emphasis on sustainable finance and technologies in achieving low carbon and climate resilient development, gender equality and women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds economic empowerment, improving connectivity, and combatting air pollution while ensuring that no one is left behind.Looking forward, middle-income developing countries stepping into their role as new donors and enhancing South-South cooperation are promising steps in the right direction to ensure faster progress in achieving Sustainable Development Goals and reverse the alarming trends we currently observe.I observed firsthand during the Eleventh Global South-South Development Expo that ESCAP was privileged to co-host from 12 to 14 September 2022, the richness and the diversity of development solutions that the Global South is bringing to the table.

Participants of the WFC this year adopted the Seoul Forest Declaration, identifying priority agendas that not just the forestry sector, but also stakeholders and institutions in different fields, should follow to build a green, healthy and resilient environment, the KFS said. The WFC has also drawn significant agreements and discussions, envisioning healthy forests amid mounting threats from climate crisis, it added.With the declaration, delegates reached a consensus that forest protection can help restore the Earth\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds environmental balance and countries around the globe should therefore increase their cooperation on forests. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWe must now scale up political will and increase financial and technical investments. </p><p>The Declaration will add to the sense of urgency to accelerate action, strengthen partnerships and enhance cross-sectoral collaboration,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd said Maria Helena Semedo, the deputy director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in a statement. The declaration, in detail, says that investment in forest and landscape restoration needs to triple by 2030 to meet internationally agreed commitments and targets on restoring degraded land. In addition, an advent of a revolutionary financial solution that can support restoration and preservation of forests is also required, the declaration reads. The world, particularly the construction sector, should also use more sustainably sourced wood, to protect the environment, the declaration said. Introducing data-based analytics to forest management is needed as well, to enable evidence-based forest and landscape decision-making, according to the declaration. The declaration also stresses that the forestry sector, stakeholders, and government bodies should try to minimize damages to forests, which can greatly benefit human health, amid ongoing threats from COVID-19 and potential danger from future pandemics. The KFS said the latest edition of the WFC allowed the world to recognize the huge potential of forests to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The KFS also expressed hopes that the declaration and new ideas that came out during the congress could help the world to join forces to increase forest health and climate resilience. During the congress, ministerial level officials met together and agreed that the countries should make more investment in forest management. They particularly agreed on using more sustainably sourced wood, which could help them achieve their Nationally Determined Contributions. Throughout the event, the KFS also shared the country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds history of forest management and related policies with the experts and government officials from other countries, through special events such as the Forest Fire Forum and the Peace Forestry Initiative high-level meetings.

In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are both challenges and opportunities in ensuring that COP26, a U.N. climate change summit, builds confidence in the Paris Agreement as an effective tool to avoid climate crisis.</p><p>Frank RijsbermanAs 2020 comes to a close, the date is fast approaching for all parties to the Paris Climate Agreement to submit their updated commitments, or NDCs, that specifically delineate how each country will meet the common climate goals within the United Nations framework. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, COP26 climate talks were postponed to 2021, and instead a series of virtual events including the Climate Ambition Summit was held on Dec. 12, where countries could give updates on their adjusted NDCs. Much has happened in recent months. While the Republic of Korea did not show very ambitious NDC targets earlier this year, President Moon Jae-in announced net zero ambitions for 2050. Likewise, China made a net zero pledge for 2060. The European Union announced enhanced ambition to cut emissions by 55 percent from the 1990 level by 2030. Many other states made commensurate pledges to tackle the climate crisis. A Race to Resilience was also launched by mayors, community leaders and insurance companies committed to safeguarding the lives and livelihoods of 4 billion vulnerable people by 2030, which aligns in particular with the priorities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs).</p><p>Ingvild SolvangWhile these commitments are positive and more ambitious than earlier NDCs, they are still not ambitious enough to meet the 1.5 degree target and protect people and nature from climate change. U.K. Minister Alok Sharma has called out the world leaders' failure to show necessary levels of ambition. Reflecting on priorities ahead of next year's COP26, the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI) will continue supporting its members' and partners' NDC enhancement and implementation through climate and carbon finance mobilization. However, a key area of focus in 2021 will be to build synergies between climate solutions and green COVID-19 recovery. It is critical to ensure that the unprecedented economic stimulus packages result in lasting shifts toward green development pathways with explicit focus on employment potential and other socio-economic co-benefits. The tens of trillions mobilized to recovery efforts provide a big and perhaps last chance to solve the unprecedented challenges as leverage vanishes with rising debt levels and dried-up public funding. Green Recovery Packages must be put to work to decarbonize the economy. Renewable energy (RE) is now the cheapest form of energy, especially when taking account of the extended costs of our reliance on fossil fuels so far. Circular economy options can drastically reduce waste, and alternatives to fossil fuel are available in the bioeconomy, and nature-based solutions hold tremendous untapped climate mitigation potential with employment and adaptation co-benefits. New technologies are pushing opportunities. Hydrogen can take up where RE cannot reach, and artificial intelligence can push energy efficiency and effective production. These are trends moving us in the right direction. Explicit focus is required to highlight the economic multipliers and social co-benefits of climate action. In our collaborative Green Growth Program with the government of Indonesia, this means promoting nature-based solutions that help halt deforestation, restore carbon rich wetlands and soils, improve land productivity and water security, and deliver improved livelihoods as well as enhanced climate mitigation and adaptation actions. Continued and improved investments in biomass-based and solar energy-based electricity generation bring more and higher-quality jobs, food security and climate resilience. In Vietnam, the GGGI works with the government to enhance its NDC ambitions through promoting sustainable urban cooling, energy efficiency, digital solutions and increasing green investments with innovative financial instruments such as carbon financing or green bonds through collaborating with the government of Luxembourg. To verify the employment potential of RE, the GGGI's employment assessments in countries like Indonesia, Rwanda and Mexico show that renewable energy, solar photovoltaics in particular, employs more people per unit of investment compared to fossil fuels-based technologies. A global solar-powered irrigation program, including Ethiopia, Burkina Faso and Uganda, will improve livelihoods, food security and climate resilience. While supporting several governments with their NDC revision processes into 2021 with the NDC Partnership and others, technical analysis incorporating employment potential and safeguarding of poor and vulnerable communities is key. The GGGI is supporting several SIDS countries is this regard \u00e2\u20ac\u2022 Saint Lucia is using a modeling approach to explore how reforming fossil fuel subsidy and taxation schemes can lower fossil fuel consumption while ensuring that vulnerable populations are not negatively impacted. In Antigua and Barbuda, GGGI is developing programs to ensure that all segments of the population are included in the transition to renewable energy.Focusing on green recovery packages and climate action simultaneously means more effective integration of NDCs and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). While the COVID-19 pandemic has placed emphasis on the socio-economic aspects of climate action, and the importance of assessing and including long-term health and vulnerabilities of the local communities into planning processes, the notion that we must marry sustainable development and climate ambitions have been made evident by the successes and failures of climate action to date. And, as the world recovers with the introduction of vaccines that can bring back business and economic activity, it is essential that a change in trajectory toward green recovery, that does not bounce back to business as usual, is at the center of our focus toward COP26 in Glasgow in 2021.</p><p>Frank Rijsberman is the director-general and Ingvild Solvang is the head of Climate Action and Inclusive Development at the Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI).</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["Explicit focus is required to highlight the economic multipliers and social co-benefits of climate action.

Biden can complain all he wants about China, but after 29 years of congressional inaction since the Senate ratified the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the rest of the world sees the truth: America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds broken and corrupt Congress remains in the pocket of Big Oil and Big Coal.Financing is at the heart of the geopolitical rupture on climate change. Developing countries are already reeling under countless pressures: the COVID-19 pandemic, weak domestic economies, increasingly frequent and severe climate-related disasters, the multiple disruptions of the digital age, US-China tensions and high borrowing costs on international loans. They watch the rich countries borrow trillions of dollars on capital markets at near-zero interest rates, while they must pay 5-10 percent, if they can borrow at all. In short, they see their societies falling even further behind a few high-income countries.Against this background of high economic anxiety, developing countries see the rich countries refusing to discuss forthrightly the financing crisis developing countries face when it comes to climate-change mitigation and adaptation or other urgent needs. They see rich countries spending an extra $20 trillion or so on their own economies in response to COVID-19, but then failing to honor their promise -- dating from COP15 in 2009 -- to mobilize a meager $100 billion per year for climate action in developing countries.Of course, Biden\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds reticence on climate financing for developing countries is understandable. He would be lambasted in the nationalistic US media if he called for more US help for the developing countries, and would gain nothing for it in Congress. With US global influence waning, America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds nationalists have turned even more aggressively against the rest of the world. \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdAmerica Firsters\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd in Congress would block any new appropriations.Many governments in Europe are in roughly the same position, perched precariously between nationalist and internationalist parties. And with budget deficits in European countries generally high in the wake of COVID-19, many parliaments have little taste to do more -- especially given that the European Union already devotes a far higher share of gross national income (roughly 0.5 percent) to official development assistance than does the US (just 0.17 percent).That leaves us stuck between the reality of a devastating global climate crisis and rich countries\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd nationalist politics, with climate finance based on voluntary contributions by the rich. The result is the chronic deep underfinancing of global public goods such as a safe climate, the Sustainable Development Goals, and COVID-19 vaccines. Leaders like Biden may plead with their legislatures to be responsible, but the legislators find it more politically expedient to rail against \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdundeserving\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd foreigners.The financial failures at COP26 are both tragic and absurd, going beyond the overarching failure to mobilize the promised $100 billion per year. Consider that the much-vaunted Climate Adaptation Fund, established to help developing countries to meet their adaptation needs, collected all of $356 million in pledges at COP26, or roughly 5 cents per person in the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds developing countries. Financing for \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdlosses and damages,\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd that is, to recover and rebuild from climate disasters, fared even worse, with rich countries agreeing only to hold \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddialogue\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd on the issue.This financial voluntarism needs to end. We need a global formula that assigns responsibility to each rich country. At least in that case, the global community would have a benchmark to demand action from laggard countries like the US.Here is one straightforward and workable approach. To help fund the clean-energy transition (mitigation) and climate resilience (adaptation) in developing countries, each high-income country would be levied $5 per ton of carbon dioxide emitted. Upper-middle-income countries would be levied $2.50 per ton. These CO2 levies would start as soon as possible and rise gradually, doubling in five years.Countries could easily pay such modest sums from the proceeds of carbon taxes and auctions of emissions permits, both of which will have much a higher price per ton of CO2 than the levy.COP26 showed definitively that asking national politicians to vote for voluntary funds for global public goods is a dead end. The rich-country politicians had a dozen years to get the promised climate financing in place, but they failed. A rules-based system, with fair and transparent burden sharing, is the way to secure the financing we need for planetary safety and fairness.Jeffrey D. SachsJeffrey D.

After the first confirmed case was reported in January 2020, the country managed to contain several waves of infections without complete border closures or local lockdowns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This helped ensure the continuity of essential social and economic activities. The economy contracted 0.9 percent last year, which was one of the best performances among major economies worldwide.</p><p>The Korean economy is projected to grow 4 percent this year and 3.1 percent next year. Strong exports and investments have driven the recovery since the second half of 2020.</p><p>And expansionary macroeconomic policy bolstered consumer spending starting in early 2021. A new flare-up in infections led to tightening of social distancing measures and a sharp drop in domestic demand in the third quarter. However, the near-term outlook remains bright.</p><p>Global demand for Korea's major exports, including semiconductor chips, electronics, automobiles and ships, will likely benefit from the broadening global recovery. Rapid digitization is also a boon to the semiconductor and information and communication technology sectors, boosting exports and investments.</p><p>Despite a resurgence of infections, the government appears set to progressively ease social distancing measures as nearly 80 percent of the adult population is fully vaccinated. This also bodes well for consumption growth.</p><p>However, the country faces considerable cyclical headwinds as it navigates the path to an inclusive and sustainable recovery.</p><p>First, record-low interest rates in response to the pandemic have pushed household debt to over 100 percent of GDP. It is now the highest in Asia. Financial asset and housing prices also soared amid increased market liquidity and credit growth. Inflation has picked up significantly, with higher prices for food, energy and housing rentals. Debt-laden households are vulnerable to higher interest rates as the Bank of Korea (BOK) has begun lifting its policy rates. Should higher inflation force the BOK to raise interest rates faster, rising debt servicing burdens and potential asset price corrections could put households under financial strain, threatening the consumption recovery.</p><p>Second, inflation is a concern around the world and for Korea. The release of pent-up demand following lockdowns is raising prices particularly for services, while persistent supply chain bottlenecks and surging energy prices are pushing up manufacturing costs. High inflation could also force the U.S. Federal Reserve to accelerate its tapering of asset purchases and start interest rate hikes earlier and faster than expected. U.S. interest rate hikes and a tightening of global financial conditions have proved disruptive to emerging markets in the past, as global investors pulled funds from riskier emerging market assets. This scenario led to the so-called 'taper tantrum' in 2013.</p><p>Third, fiscal spending has pushed government debt in Korea to an estimated 51.3 percent of GDP this year, from 41.2 percent in 2019. Although the government's extraordinary fiscal measures were warranted during the pandemic, the debt should be aggressively managed in the medium to long term to ensure its sustainability. The need will continue for increased spending associated with an aging population and necessary structural adjustments to meet growing demand for welfare as well as disaster and climate resilience.</p><p>Structural challenges are bigger problem</p><p>An aging population, labor market rigidities and widening inequality are casting a shadow over the economy's long-term growth potential. Short-term macroeconomic stimuli seem to have cushioned the economy from the pandemic, but they are unlikely to reverse the long-term trend of declining potential growth.</p><p>A recent International Monetary Fund study estimated Korea's long-term growth potential will fall below 2 percent by 2030, mainly due to population aging.</p><p>Korea is among the world's fastest-aging economies. People aged 65 and older account for 16.5 percent of its population, and by 2030 the proportion is expected to reach 25 percent.</p><p>The fertility rate is 0.84 children per woman, the lowest in the world, while longevity is up thanks to a comprehensive and affordable national healthcare system. Combined with structural rigidity in the labor market that's lowering labor force participation and dampening investment, the aging population is crimping productivity and long-term growth potential.</p><p>Social inequality is also a concern, as more than 40 percent of citizens over 65 live in relative poverty (defined as earning 50 percent or less of median household income), according to a recent Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development survey. This is the highest level among the 39 OECD member countries.</p><p>Inequality, entrenched by economic and social stratification, can also lead to a loss of momentum and dynamism. Recent reforms have taken aggressive steps to address rising inequality, by driving up minimum wages, increasing property and wealth taxes, and strengthening health insurance and social safety nets.</p><p>Despite some potential long-term benefits of these reforms, there has been criticism that they add regulatory obstacles to already rigid markets and pose challenges to long-term debt sustainability.</p><p>As the pandemic recedes, government policy needs to transition from 'crisis response' to a new phase of 'economic recovery.' For example, it needs to reorient fiscal spending to promote long-term growth potential that also meets social and environmental objectives.</p><p>There is ample scope to raise productivity, especially in the services sector, where regulatory restrictions have limited entries and competition.</p><p>The country's goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050 can also create new opportunities in the clean energy, battery, and automobile industries. Post-pandemic reforms should clearly promote economic efficiency and productivity by addressing market rigidities, reducing red tape, improving the rule of law and enhancing transparency and predictability in policy making.</p><p>The writer is director of the Regional Cooperation and Integration Division in the Economics Research and Regional Cooperation Department of the Asian Development Bank.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img.koreatimes.co.kr/upload/newsV2/images/202112/40ab31c96bd7436ebe60a09e9f94dd03.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["2 percent in 2019.

The following is an edited transcript of The Korea Economic Daily's July 21 interview with Everett.\u00a0<br/><br/>\u25b2 What are the major long-term structural changes shaping real estate markets and how has the pandemic impacted these changes?<br/><br/>\u201cDemographics, infrastructure, globalization, innovation and technology, which Principal Real Estate refers to as DIGITAL themes, have become very important in driving the growth of formerly niche, or non-traditional, property types. As the pandemic transformed the outlook for occupiers, the capital markets are propelling these property types into the mainstream.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cThese DIGITAL themes manifest themselves in both the traditional and non-traditional real estate property types. Increasingly, non-traditional properties have become the beneficiaries of these demand drivers. While these factors can impact every aspect of investing, they are particularly relevant to the real estate markets.\u201d<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220013.700x.0.jpg\">Todd Everett, executive director and CEO at Principal Real Estate Investors</url><br/>\u25b2 How do you see inflation and rising rates impacting real estate in the coming years?<br/><br/>\u201cInvestors need to be mindful that not all property sectors, or locations, will offer the same performance or the same inflation mitigation benefits. We recommend focusing on a mix of emerging growth and traditional property types in metro areas aligned with long-term structural drivers that include technology and strong demographic growth profiles.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOne area of opportunity is commercial real estate. Although commercial real estate is not inflation-proof, historically, it has a record of performing well during periods of higher-than-average inflation, owing to its ability to generate and increase income returns for investors given the nature of leases that are often tied to measures of inflation.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 What is your outlook on the real estate market? Which property types will benefit from strong demand tailwinds?<br/><br/>\u201cDemand fundamentals are reasonably balanced within commercial real estate although the impact of the pandemic is still seen in office sector occupancy levels. We believe that property types with resilient, embedded demand drivers \u2013 for example, data centers, medical offices, manufactured housing \u2013 may remain well supported by tenants and investors.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 In the expected stagflation market in the US going forward, what specific sectors would Principal recommend to its investors and why? <br/><br/>\u201cWe believe it is important to focus on resilient (DIGITAL) drivers of demand as well as specific strategies such as focused development to potentially generate risk-adjusted performance.\" <br/><br/>\"For example, the development offers outsized opportunities in the US housing market. Generational changes to the US population are intersecting with impacts from COVID-19, creating sustained demand in the residential sector that may have long-term tailwinds.\u201d<br/><br/>\"A substantial shortage of housing, coupled with rising affordability issues, is generating significant demand for rental real estate. The demand has expanded beyond traditional apartments to include single-family homes, manufactured housing, and built-to-rent units. <br/><br/>\"The demand for residential real estate has also shifted into high gear among investors who recognize the acute need for housing and the increasingly broad swathe of options the sector can offer renters.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cWe believe that development strategies offer attractive risk-adjusted opportunities within the residential sector by generating return premiums over the core and stabilized assets. Further, a development-oriented approach offers the ability to tailor assets to meet shifting tenant profiles, including more ESG-related amenities, and potentially meet and exceed inflationary pressures by covering rising material and labor costs via increased stabilized asset values.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 Given that inflation is leading to higher construction costs, why has Principal stated a strong preference for development over buying existing properties today? Does this approach vary by property type or market?<br/><br/>\u201cAs investors search for higher-yielding investment solutions, many are turning to opportunities in the development space given that value-add returns have also seen significant erosion. The premium for investing in value-add has declined thereby rendering the risk and return relationship less attractive.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cWe believe development strategies continue to offer attractive absolute and relative returns. Core industrial and multifamily assets offer a relative value opportunity, given the range of their current cap rates.\" <br/><br/>\"While supply and labor shortages have extended development timelines and increased appropriate underwriting contingencies, stronger capital market demand has more than compensated experienced developers for these incremental risks. Low cap rates and powerful rental growth continue to offset cost and timing considerations.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cDevelopment strategies offer the ability to tailor new build assets to evolving and growing ESG demands and standards from occupiers and buyers that have been catalyzed by COVID-19, climate change and expanding regulatory requirements.\u201d<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220015.700x.0.jpg\">Optima Kierland, a multifamily property in North Scottsdale, Arizona which Principal and Optima co-developed in 2020</url><br/><br/>\u25b2 Interest in ESG investing has grown exponentially over the last few years. Can you tell us about Principal Real Estate Investors\u2019 commitment to ESG? And what are the sustainability efforts from a real estate perspective? <br/><br/>\"We are keenly aware of the role the financial industry can play to support a more sustainable world and future. Principal Real Estate has had an overarching ESG framework, the Principles for Responsible Property Investing, since 2013. It guides our investment management practices, which is used by Principal and our property management and joint venture partners.\u201d\u00a0 <br/><br/>\u201cThe framework is based on our comprehensive policies, governance framework, reporting practices and research. Through our research, we have identified five primary areas of ESG focus which guide our decision making: Environmental Performance, Occupant Experience, Community Impact, Climate Resilience, and Managerial Excellence.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cFurther, this framework outlines our ESG expectations throughout the property lifecycle, starting with the analysis of key ESG factors during due diligence, an iterative performance improvement cycle during operations and disposition practices such as sharing key ESG data. As trends and best practices evolve, we continually look to refine the platform.\u201d<br/><br/>\u25b2 What makes Principal Real Estate different from its peers when selecting and evaluating green properties? And how does Principal measure ESG factors differently from others? <br/><br/>\u201cWe thoroughly evaluate ESG issues from the earliest stages of our new property and existing asset acquisition pre-investment process. As part of the underwriting process, we consider ESG issues that are unique to each site and local market resilience, from both an economic and regulatory perspective.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cRelying on local market expertise provided by our property management and development partners, in addition to our regional asset management and engineering teams, allows greater insight and focus on key local market conditions.\u201d<br/><br/>\u201cOne area to highlight is how we assess physical and transition climate risk as part of our due diligence process for new developments and acquisitions. High risks identified are considered for each deal by the engineer, acquisitions and asset management teams and experts as needed such as the Property Condition Assessment (PCA) consultant to identify immediate design changes or capital expenditures.\u201d <br/><br/>\u201cFrom a policy and legal perspective, an increasing number of jurisdictions and regional governments are adopting climate action plans, renewable energy portfolio standards, or other environmental regulations targeting greater energy efficiency and reduced carbon emissions associated with commercial buildings.\" <br/><br/>\"The climate risk report includes a transition risk rating for each asset\u2019s estimated value at risk (VaR) as a result of anticipated regulations in the next 15 years. In addition, our analysis process helps identify properties exposed to specific energy disclosure or performance regulations.\u201d<br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220017.700x.0.jpg\">\u00a0The office tower at 500 W. 2nd Street in Austin, Texas which Principal and Trammell Crow Company co-developed in 2016</url><br/>\u25b2 How do green certifications add value to yield?<br/><br/>\u201cBuilding owners seeking to benefit from green building investments often choose to obtain credible green building certifications. While there is a cost to such certifications \u2013 both the application fees and the cost of implementing the required measures to meet the standards \u2013 third-party certifications provide a consistent framework with independent verification of integration of environmental and social standards at the property.\u201d<br/><br/>\"Certification standards also provide guidelines to building owners that allow them to benefit from significant energy savings. For example, the US\u00a0Green Building Council (USGBC) finds that LEED-certified buildings consume 25% less energy than equivalent commercial buildings.\"<br/><br/>\"Sustainability research in 2021 found that buildings with green ratings benefitted from average rental premiums of 11% for LEED-certified buildings\u00a0and green buildings tend to attract more tenants and boost occupancy rates.\"<br/><br/>\u201cInvestors may benefit from higher rents and increased demand by incorporating green building elements into their developments, renovations and operating plans. So it is not surprising that green buildings with credible certifications such as LEED have been found to sell for 21% more per square foot than equivalent buildings over the last three years, depending on the market. Buyers value the energy-saving upgrades, on-site renewable energy installations, and healthier interior conditions.\u201d<br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kedglobal.com/data/ked/image/2022/07/22/ked202207220020.600x.0.jpg\">Link to Image</url><br/><br/>Headquartered in Iowa, Principal Real Estate Investors is a real estate group within Principal Global Investors.

Many agreed that, like the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change consequences are disproportionately affecting women and girls. Round table discussions continued from the session's opening day on 14 March on the same themes: climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes -- advancing gender equality through holistic and integrated actions from global to local; and on women's voice and agency -- good practices towards achieving women's full, equal and meaningful participation and decision-making in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes. (For details, see Press Release WOM/2213.)</p><p>During the general discussion in the afternoon, Rosy Akbar, Fiji's Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said climate finance often fails to take account of gender equality and women's empowerment. To remedy this, she called on the international community to increase gender-responsive climate, environmental and disaster risk finance. She also called for efforts to promote women's full participation and leadership in climate, environment, ocean, biodiversity and disaster-risk-reduction action, and to strengthen their capacities through accessible training and gender-responsive policies and programmes.</p><p>In the same vein, Vindhya Persaud, Guyana's Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co-operative Republic, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), reiterated disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met. Stressing that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States, she said its impact represents a \"code red for humanity\". Moving forward, a gender perspective must be part of building climate resilience and designing and implementing disaster-risk-reduction strategies and recovery plans. In addition, climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities must include measures that support women-owned enterprises in the green and blue economies, she said, also calling for investment in gathering gender specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate.</p><p>On behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), Patricia Kaliati, Malawi's Minister for Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, agreed that the current situation calls for action, as women make up the poorest and most vulnerable groups in her region. Reasons stem from their general subordinate legal status and limited access to such critical resources as land, technology, credit, education and housing, she said, pointing to several ongoing efforts to help to address these challenges. For its part, SADC integrated gender and climate change into its Protocol on Gender and Development in 2016. This means State parties should, by 2030, develop policies, strategies, and programmes to address the gender issues in climate change, conduct research to assess the differential gendered impacts of climate change and adopt effective mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>Youth representative Antonette Ncube, from the European Union delegation, in its capacity as an observer, spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls when she presented several recommendations. Underscoring a need to improve data and strengthen capacity building, she encouraged stakeholders to pursue the ethical collection and dissemination of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and gender statistics on all dimensions of environmental, disaster risk reduction and climate change issues, and sexual and gender-based violence. She also recommended that stakeholders ensure the gender-responsive implementation of international commitments made in such instruments as the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Calling for concerted efforts to address gender-based violence and the disproportionate impact of climate crises and disasters on women and girls, she expected the Commission to adopt strong and action-oriented conclusions.</p><p>Some speakers shone a spotlight on the importance of remembering the most vulnerable groups of women when aiming at inclusive responses. The representative of Chile, speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Older Persons, said those often overlooked must urgently be considered. Older persons -- and even more so older women -- remain largely invisible and disregarded in the development of policies and programmes. To change this, he urged United Nations agencies, and particularly the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), to systematically collect and disaggregate data by age and gender, particularly of women beyond their reproductive years.</p><p>Marta Lucia Ramirez, Vice President of Colombia, declared that, when women arrive in positions of power, they must remember to open more spaces for others \"just as those who came before did for us\". Half the world's population has historically been excluded from power, but gender equality is essential for generating sustainable economic growth, she said, highlighting Colombia's five point national policy to support women's inclusion -- from the business sector to peace and security. Colombia also launched the world's first sovereign gender bond to help women-owned businesses recover from the widespread economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing attention to the situation of women in conflict affected zones in Afghanistan to Ukraine, she said the international community must always call for the dignity and rights of women and must remember that these and other conflicts are a result of wars \"always declared by men\".</p><p>lso delivering statements during the general discussion were Iran, Iceland, Uzbekistan, Serbia, Netherlands, Turkey, Egypt, Morocco, Republic of Korea, Austria, Sweden, Liechtenstein, Finland, New Zealand, France, Kazakhstan, Germany, Jordan, Ireland, Oman, Portugal, Israel, Trinidad and Tobago, and Luxembourg.</p><p>The representative of the Russian Federation spoke in exercise of the right of reply.</p><p>The Commission on the Status of Women will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 March, to continue its work.</p><p>Ministerial Round Table III</p><p>In the morning, the Commission held a ministerial round table discussion on the theme \"Climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes: advancing gender equality through holistic and integrated actions from global to local\".</p><p>Ministers and senior officials of Member States exchanged views on how Governments are working towards advancing gender perspectives into national policies and programmes. Discussing concerns about such pressing challenges as drought and gender inclusion in related mitigation efforts, delegates presented a broad range of national examples, from cash grants to training for women in the information and communications technology (ICT) sector. They also highlighted gender-responsive policies and needs for improvement in such areas as financing.</p><p>HYE RYOUNG SONG (Republic of Korea), Vice-Chair designate (Asia and Pacific States Group), opened the round table, sharing some of her country's actions. Among them are targeted initiatives that led various ministries to draft recommendations related to the gender aspects of climate change. Emphasizing the importance for partners to respond to the climate crisis in a sustainable, inclusive manner, she encouraged delegates to have a fruitful round table.</p><p>VINDHYA PERSAUD, Minister for Human Services and Social Security of Guyana, cited several national achievements, including the Low Carbon Development Strategy. Launched in 2009, the Strategy seeks to transform the economy while combating climate change and promoting the inclusion of women and vulnerable groups in key economic sectors through micro-, small enterprise and entrepreneurial projects and job opportunities. Women were awarded 62 per cent of low-carbon cash grants and were trained in climate-smart agriculture, sustainable forestry and business development. With the second highest percentage of forest cover in the world, Guyana secured climate financing for the Amerindian Development Fund, which benefitted 180 communities and strengthened village economies, providing hundreds of jobs for indigenous women. Climate financing is currently bridging the ICT divide for hinterland women and girls with the provision of laptops and the creation of hubs powered by solar-energy systems, transforming the way in which they access Government and social services. In addition, Guyanese women are leading in climate action and advocacy and have pioneered solutions to protect the country's valuable ecosystem.</p><p>ROSY AKBAR, Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation of Fiji, highlighted significant strides in developing coherent legislative and policy frameworks in the context of gender, environment and disaster risk reduction. The National Climate Change Policy (20182030) and the 2021 Climate Change Act endorse the principles of gender equality and women's empowerment while recognizing women as agents of change. Gender mainstreaming mandates extend to all programmes of the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2020-2024) while the Green Growth Framework identifies gender equality as key indicators of social development. The National Disaster Risk Reduction Policy establishes \"human rights and gender-based approaches\" as one of its eight guiding principles, in line with Fiji's commitment to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women and the gender action plan of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Initiatives related to combating gender based violence in times of disaster responses are among other ongoing efforts to ensure that the needs of the most vulnerable groups, including women and girls in all diversity, are met, she said.</p><p>NAREK MKRTCHYAN, Minister for Labour and Social Affairs of Armenia, presented several ongoing initiatives in line with his country's commitments to such global efforts as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Armenia's disaster management strategy outlines a series of sector-targeted actions for preparedness, response and risk reduction from national to local levels while also recognizing the need to increase women's representation in such activities. The Government prioritizes mainstreaming gender equality in all its projects dedicated to environmental sustainability, resilience-building, climate change adaptation and crisis mitigation. The Gender Policy Implementation Strategy sets the Government's priorities for women's equal participation in all spheres of public life, including: preventing the feminization of poverty in the context of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda; involving rural women in combating climate change problems; strengthening cooperation with civil society and non-governmental organizations in the field of environmental and disaster risk management; and reducing of the impact of pandemics, in particular COVID-19.</p><p>NDEYE SALY DIOP DIENG, Minister for Women, Family and Gender of Senegal, said climate change is the biggest challenge, leading to land degradation, drought and other major problems. Indeed, decreases in soil fertility and other side effects have a negative impact on women while also triggering an estimated economic loss of 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the agriculture sector. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates that more than 3 million people live in areas that are extremely vulnerable to climate change, alongside expert projections that envision 1 billion people facing climate change threats by 2050. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) projects that Africa will lose two thirds of its arable land by 2025. These challenges have a human cost, she said, emphasizing that women in rural communities are being affected. Local production, from fishing to forestry, has also felt the impact. Senegal's analysis and assessments demonstrate the scope of these climate consequences, which could possibly limit women's access to arable land. Efforts include strengthening initiatives from the global to local levels, including promoting a green economy transition, which Senegal supports, she said, adding that funding must be increased for such endeavours.</p><p>MATEJA RIBIC, State Secretary at the Ministry of Labour, Family, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities of Slovenia, said her \"green\" country has a wealth of natural resources and rich biodiversity, yet recognizes the immediate need to address paramount climate change and sustainable development challenges. Slovenia's new climate change strategy aims at fostering a society adapted and resilient to climate change impacts and is characterized by a high quality of life and a high degree of safety. Fully aware of strong links among biodiversity, climate change, food security and water, she also noted the well-established interlinkages among human rights, environmental degradation and climate change, which affect millions of people, especially women and girls across the world. Welcoming the Human Rights Council's recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment, she said Slovenia strongly supports women's empowerment in the context of foreign policy priorities, with gender equality and environmental protection being a cross-cutting issue for development cooperation and humanitarian aid, including ongoing support for projects in sub-Saharan Africa. Women and girls must be at the centre of building back a better, greener, more resilient and more equal world, she said, highlighting the need for strong commitments to achieving gender equality at the highest political level.</p><p>NALIZA REBUELTA-TEH, Under-Secretary of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources of the Philippines, said her country -- located in the tropical cyclone belt -- ranks fourth among nations most affected by extreme weather events in the 2021 long-term Global Climate Risk Index. It experienced 317 exceptionally devastating events from 2000 to 2019. In December 2021, Super Typhoon Rai ravaged more than 2 million families and left $650 million in damages to housing, agriculture and infrastructure. Citing projections from the Philippine Climate Extremes 2020 Report, she said warming temperatures and decreasing rainfall are expected to threaten many communities. Coastlines and coastal resources are also highly vulnerable to climate change and disasters, with low-lying islands facing permanent inundation. The National Framework Strategy on Climate Change -- among other gender-responsive adaption and mitigation efforts -- addresses the different impacts that individual catastrophes and the slow-onset effects of climate change have across gender, age, socioeconomic class, indigenous status, migration status and disability. Women are ensured equal benefits and participation in Government programmes and policies, she said, adding that, in 2021, over $50 million was allocated to advance women's technical knowledge and overall capacity to implement mitigation measures in resource-based communities. The Government's gender mainstreaming efforts are institutionalized in focal point systems, annual appropriation for related budgets and a planning and reporting system monitored by the Philippine Commission on Women. Organized and systematic gender mainstreaming has produced national benefits for over two decades, she said, noting the Philippines' commitment to continue this holistic, integrated effort through sex aggregated data, social inclusion and measuring long-term strategic impacts.</p><p>HALA MAZYAD ALTUWAIGRI, Secretary-General of the Family Affairs Council of Saudi Arabia, said climate change impacts women and girls disproportionately and is an added stressor that will set back their advancement. Noting that 43 per cent of the global agricultural labour force is in developing countries, she said United Nations research shows that women make up 80 per cent of those displaced by climate change, which requires a serious effort from Governments and the active participation of all community members. Citing several national achievements, she pointed to the launch of a set of environmental protection policies and initiatives that address local to global climate change effects and also consider women's inclusion in decision-making and policymaking. The national environment strategy includes 64 initiatives aimed at restructuring the sector alongside such emission reduction programmes and policies as the adoption of an e Government project and renewable energy efforts. Contributions were allocated to the non-profit sector for providing solutions and innovation through advanced programmes and mechanisms, with women supervising the implementation of most of these efforts. The launch in 2021 of the Saudi Green Initiative aims to reduce the impact of climate change, achieve sustainability and create job opportunities for women and youth.</p><p>MOHAMMED SAHIB MARZOOQ, Head of Human Rights at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iraq, delivering a statement on behalf of Yossra Mohsen, Director General and Head of Women's Empowerment in his country, said climate change consequences -- from the reduction of arable land to the loss of waterways -- has led to displacement and a loss of revenue, disproportionately affecting women and girls. As such, a historic role must be played to mitigate climate change effects. This shared responsibility should be based on circumstances and national capabilities, as solidarity and international cooperation have proven to be the only way forward. Highlighting several key achievements, he said Iraq has developed a series of projects and action programmes to tackle these and related challenges and has adopted laws and policies aimed at protecting women and increasing their participation at various levels. Noting that 95 women were elected in recent elections, he pointed to other gains, including the Government's launch of its second National Plan for Women's Economic Empowerment (2021-2022). Efforts included opening centres to protect women from domestic violence, creating a high-level committee to assist rural women, and a Ministry of Agriculture initiative to implement several targeted projects. In addition, 1 million trees have been planted as part of a mitigation project. Going forward, Iraq is working on revising its laws related to women's rights and on implementing a national strategy for Iraqi women that also focuses on climate change.</p><p>In closing remarks, MAMI MIZUTORI, Special Representative of the Secretary General for Disaster Risk Reduction, said that, while disasters affect everyone, they disproportionately affect women and girls. Summarizing several threads of the discussion, she said structural inequality is a driver of risk, noting also that women must be involved in efforts to address this. Policies must also be embedded with gender perspectives. At the same time, investing in all these policies and efforts is also critical, she said. Highlighting several other issues, she said more science and knowledge must be shared with women and girls. Attention must also be paid to the issue of increased violence against women amid disasters and the vulnerable situation of women in rural areas, she said, commending the participants for sharing their encouraging efforts at national to local levels.</p><p>lso participating were ministers and other high-level representatives from Kenya, France, Indonesia, United Republic of Tanzania, Saint Lucia, Spain, Bangladesh, Angola, United Kingdom, Maldives, El Salvador, Azerbaijan and Chad.</p><p>Ministerial Round Table IV</p><p>The Commission then held a ministerial roundtable discussion on the theme \"Women's voice and agency: good practices towards achieving women's full, equal and meaningful participation and decision-making in the context of climate-change, environmental and disaster-risk-reduction policies and programmes\".</p><p>Ministers and senior officials of Member States detailed national strategies to increase women's participation in decision-making and address the disproportionate effects of climate change and natural disaster on women and girls. Stressing that such effects, along with widening inequality, necessitates including these individuals in policymaking, they also pointed out that women and girls possess unique knowledge and experience that can be harnessed to inform risk-reduction and resilience strategies. Further, they pointed to the link between climate change and gender-based violence, stressing the need to mainstream gender perspectives in national policy to ensure that women and girls have both voice and agency in addressing a phenomenon that affects them in specific ways.</p><p>ELIZABETH GOMEZ ALCORTA, Minister for Women, Genders and Diversity of Argentina, chairing the round table, said that women and girls -- who hold deep knowledge of the needs and priorities of their communities -- are key to combating climate change and environmental degradation. However, women are far from achieving full gender parity and lack the critical mass necessary to influence policy, decisions and strategies. Further, women's civil society organizations face barriers to participation and leadership due to diminishing funds and threats to physical security. Pointing out that, while climate change is a global challenge, not all countries share the same responsibility, she said that the richest countries produce the most greenhouse gases while those with the fewest emissions are most exposed to the negative effects of the same. This reflects the hegemonic model of development, which is harmful to the environment and increases inequality. For its part, she said that Argentina works towards gender mainstreaming by training public officials and providing more resources to community organizations, especially those affected by climate change.</p><p>SILVERIA ELFRIEDA JACOBS, Prime Minister of Sint Maarten, speaking on behalf of the Netherlands and its constituent countries of Sint Maarten, Curacao and Aruba, said that the latter three small island developing States are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change. The climate crisis magnifies inequalities and vulnerabilities -- especially for women and girls -- which are further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, in the global discussion regarding climate action, the voices of women and girls are underrepresented, and the international community cannot expect to solve this crisis by leaving these individuals behind. Member States must work towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality by ensuring women's full access to equal opportunities, knowledge and pay. Emphasizing that \"women must be part of the solution\", she said that, by working together to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 5, the world can progress towards achieving all 17 Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>RIUNZAYA AYUSH, Minister for Labour and Social Protection of Mongolia, noted that her country has ratified 12 United Nations conventions relating to climate change, and to ensure implementation of these international treaties at the national level, has adopted several laws and policies to protect the environment. Further, the Government has implemented a number of projects to combat desertification and reduce air pollution, as the negative effects of climate change continue to pose a risk to both women and the national economy. Air pollution -- caused by densely populated urban areas -- has particularly negative effects on the health of the population. She emphasized that this problem especially affects infants and pregnant women, and has also led to respiratory diseases, premature birth and developmental disorders.</p><p>YANNA WEBSTER-ROY, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago, outlined Government efforts to ensure that women have voice and agency by incorporating gender considerations in strategies and projects to enhance environmental and climate resilience. Socially constructed roles and inequality disproportionately affect women -- especially in rural areas  and she highlighted the need to incorporate the United Nations principle of \"leaving no one behind\" in developing disaster-risk-reduction policies and programmes. Gender issues and priorities specific to women must be integrated into the same, and the Government has worked to include women in stakeholder groups such as environmentally focused cabinets. She went on to stress the need to ensure that no barriers prevent the participation of women and girls in efforts to address climate change.</p><p>NASSENEBA TOURE, Minister for Women, Family and Children of Ca'te d'Ivoire, pointed out that women comprise 70 per cent of agricultural workers in her country, producing 90 per cent of foodstuffs. As such, they suffer disproportionately from the consequences of drought, high precipitation and natural disaster. Against that backdrop, the Government has implemented a national programme to fight climate change by empowering women and girls. Institutional and legislative support measures have been passed, multiple support funds for women working in agriculture have been established and women's participation in elected assemblies has increased. She also said that the Government is committed to implementing three projects for producing solar energy in the country's north -- 12 solar plants and 1 biomass project using residue from cotton and cocoa will create thousands of jobs for women and girls.</p><p>HELENA DALLI, European Commissioner for Equality of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, stressed the need to address the lack of women's participation in decision-making as \"no crisis is gender-neutral\". Climate change and environmental degradation take a disproportionate toll on women due to such individuals' reduced access to resources, and therefore, the European Union's climate-adaptation strategy aims to increase women's leadership and gender balance. Further, the bloc supports programmes worldwide that promote women's participation in climate governance -- once such instance is its partnership with Bhutan to help local governments include women in the process to improve disaster resilience. Spotlighting the link between climate change and gender-based violence, she said that the European Union works to prevent such violence through targeted action, such as strengthening institutional capacities to address violence against women and girls following natural disaster.</p><p>NINO TANDILASHVILI, Deputy Minister for Environmental Protection and Agricultural Affairs of Georgia, joined other speakers in expressing solidarity with Ukraine and its people, condemning the Russian Federation's invasion and use of force against Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity in contravention of international law. Turning to climate change, she said the phenomenon has had -- and will continue to have -- severe, lasting impact on the environment and social development. The resilience and adaptive capacity of women and girls must be supported, and for its part, the Government is working to mainstream gender perspectives in its environmental and climate change policy. These efforts include enhancing women's role as agents of change and reducing the impact of natural disaster on population and infrastructure by providing early warning systems and locally informed risk management. \"Without gender equality today, a sustainable, equitable future remains beyond our reach,\" she added.</p><p>NNA MARIA MOKGETHI, Minister for Nationality, Immigration and Gender Affairs of Botswana, highlighted the lessons learned from the COVID-19, HIV/AIDS and Ebola pandemics, in which women were not only affected, but also at the forefront of the response. As countries hold national and international dialogues on climate-change mitigation, women and girls must be at the negotiating table to ensure their voices are heard. Noting that women and girls in her country are negatively affected by aridity, persistent drought and erratic rainfall, she said that the Government pursues inclusive development policies that focus on the particular needs of women and children. Further, it engages women and girls in rural areas in the management of rural community resources, as their wealth of indigenous knowledge is essential for resilience. She went on to stress that these indigenous practices must be preserved, and that the women employing them must be empowered to fully participate in the supply chain.</p><p>In closing remarks, PREETI SINHA, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Capital Development Fund, highlighted the link between women's economic empowerment and the climate agenda. Offering an example of the Fund's work in Uganda, she said that the informal settlements of Mbali suffer from frequent water-supply outages, flooding and contamination. As such, only 20 per cent of households have access to clean, piped water, and this lack of access forces women and youth to travel long distances to collect water, which renders them susceptible to gender-based violence. The Fund is working to improve this water access situation, and this scenario demonstrates the effects that climate adaptation measures can have on women's security. The relationship between climate finance and women's economic empowerment has the potential to be one of the most powerful, virtuous cycles in development finance for least developed countries and beyond. \"Let us unite to have capital serve humanity, and not the other way around,\" she added.</p><p>lso participating were ministers and other high-level representatives from Estonia, Sierra Leone, Liechtenstein, Denmark, Gambia, Portugal, Ethiopia, Croatia, Greece, Mexico, Paraguay, Romania, Czech Republic, Cuba, Switzerland and Mali.</p><p>eneral Discussion</p><p>MILENKO ESTEBAN SKOKNIC TAPIA (Chile), speaking on behalf of the Group of Friends of Older Persons, said that it is undeniable that all older women make a significant contribution, as agents of change, to the social, economic and sustainable development of societies. Not only do women account for the majority of older persons, but the proportion of older women in the global female population will also increase in the coming years. Therefore, policies and programmes must address women's needs throughout their lives, particularly when they are older. Calling for a change in the way of thinking about ageing, he said there is a need to challenge narratives regarding the role older women can play in the economy, society and households.</p><p>It is hard to conceive that considering that older populations will outgrow younger populations by 2020, older persons -- and even more so older women -- remain largely invisible and disregarded in the development of policies and programmes. Such invisibility is evident in this year's Secretary-General's report on the priority theme, which hardly addressed the complex realities of older women facing climate change and natural disasters, despite the compounded vulnerabilities they are more likely to experience. Such lack of visibility can and must be addressed urgently. The Group therefore urges the United Nations agencies, and particularly United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) to systematically collect and disaggregate data by age and gender, particularly of women beyond their reproductive years.</p><p>Ms. AKBAR, Minister for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation of Fiji, speaking on behalf of the Pacific Islands Forum, said that the science is non-negotiable and urgent action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is critical. Equal and full participation of all women and girls must be central to global action. The recent volcanic eruption in Tonga caused tephra ash to fall, a tsunami and severe damage to submarine telecommunications cables. Pacific women and girls, in all their diversity, continue to play a critical role in building resilient communities. Recognizing women's and girls' knowledge, capabilities and skills, and empowering them, is vital to the safety and security of all Pacific families. The Pacific has one of the highest rates of violence globally; on average, two out of every three women experience some form of violence throughout their lifetime. Global evidence indicates a link between disasters, climate change and gender-based violence, she said, noting that in the Pacific, reports of domestic violence cases have increased. During disasters, women are subject to increased workloads and care responsibilities and must travel further to look for water and food. This is exacerbated by the increasing levels of non-communicable diseases in rural and remote areas.</p><p> lack of adequate sexual reproductive health and outreach services are worsened by climate change and related disasters, she said. Climate finance also often fails to take account of gender equality and women's empowerment. She called on the international community to increase gender-responsive climate, environmental and disaster risk finance, promote women's full participation and leadership in climate, environment, ocean, biodiversity and disaster risk reduction action, and strengthen the capacities of women through accessible training and gender-responsive policies and programmes. It is also vital to ensure women have access to essential services during crisis situations. She also called for increased investment in national gender statistics which ensures gender-disability-geographical disaggregated data in the gender-environment nexus. \"COVID-19 recovery and recovery from recurring natural disasters is an opportunity to reset our global development agenda to one that is climate-resilient, gender-inclusive and leaves no one behind,\" she said.</p><p>VINDHYA PERSAUD, Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co operative Republic of Guyana, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), noted that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States and that its impacts represent a \"code red for humanity\". Reiterating disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met, he noted that women and girls are often disproportionately affected by the impacts of climate change. There must be a gender perspective when building climate resilience, as well as in the design and implementation of disaster-risk-reduction strategies and recovery plans, he said, calling also for investment to enable the production of gender-specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate. Poverty eradication is central to reducing women's vulnerability to climate change, he added, stressing that climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities should include measures supporting women owned micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises in the green and blue economies.</p><p>Turning to action to address sexual and gender-based violence and domestic violence, he noted that CARICOM nations are encouraging the equal sharing of responsibilities in parenting and household work; engaging community leaders to address discriminatory social norms and gender stereotypes; and adopting robust legislative regimes. Women in the region are also leaders advocating for protection of the environment and implementing home-grown solutions. Highlighting progress in Guyana, he pointed to its low-carbon development strategy, noting that 62 per cent of the jobs it has created are held by women. While women and girls are disproportionately impacted by climate events, they have also been creating innovative solutions to protect the country's valuable ecosystem, including by using drones to monitor environmental activities to ascertain what threats have emerged to the mangroves ecosystem and how responses should be tailored. To promote women's economic empowerment, free, non-traditional technical vocational programmes, with no pre-admission requirements, have been created to provide the necessary training and skills for thousands of women across Guyana.</p><p>PATRICIA KALIATI, Minister for Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare of Malawi, speaking on behalf of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), said that at a meeting in February, African Union ministers responsible for gender and promotion of women resolved that the current situation -- marked by a regression of the gains made to advance women's rights and gender equality due to the devastating effects of climate change and environmental disasters coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic -- necessitates taking action. Agriculture plays an important role in the economy of all SADC member States. Environmental degradation threatens economic development and directly affects peoples' livelihoods. SADC has established three main environmental policy goals: protect and improve the health, environment and livelihoods of the people of Southern Africa with priority for poor; preserve the region's natural heritage, biodiversity and life supporting ecosystems; and support regional economic development on an equitable, sustainable basis for the benefit of present and future generations.</p><p>When unexpectedly heavy floods displaced more than a million people in Southern Africa in 2007, SADC began to meet annually to prepare for future occurrences, she said. It established a Disaster Risk Reduction Unit responsible for coordinating regional preparedness and response programmes for trans-boundary hazards and disaster. The SADC Regional Platform for Disaster Risk Reduction was inaugurated in 2011. The newly developed SADC Regional Resilience Framework 2020 2030 will guide SADC member States and other stakeholders in the design and implementation of a broad range of resilience programmes. Women in the region account for most of the poorest and most vulnerable due to their general subordinate legal status; limited access to productive resources such as land, technology, credit, education and training, formal employment; as well as their susceptibility to HIV and AIDS. The SADC Protocol on Gender and Development was revised in 2016 to include gender and climate change. She stressed that State parties should, by 2030, develop policies, strategies and programmes to address the gender aspects of climate change, conduct research to assess its differential gendered impacts and put in place effective mitigation and adaptation measures.</p><p>NTONETTE NCUBE, a youth representative from the European Union delegation, in its capacity as an observer, also spoke on behalf of the Group of Friends for the Elimination of Violence Against Women and Girls. Stressing that climate change, disasters, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss disproportionately affect women and girls, and that crises and disasters exacerbate pre-existing gender inequalities and discrimination, she said women and girls frequently face increased sexual and gender-based violence. They are subjected to harmful practices such as early and forced marriage due to the impact of climate change, disproportionate burden of care work, and restricted access to essential health services. The Group calls for concerted efforts to address these issues and expects the Commission to adopt strong and action-oriented conclusions.</p><p>More specifically, she said, the Group recommends that all stakeholders ensure the gender-responsive implementation of international obligations and commitments, including the Paris Agreement, Lima Work Programme on Gender, Convention on Biological Diversity and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. In that regard, the Group stresses the importance of enhancing women's full, equal, effective and meaningful participation and leadership, she said, underscoring a concrete need to improve data and resources and strengthen coordination and capacity-building. The Group encourages all stakeholders to use comprehensive indicators and pursue the ethical collection and dissemination of high-quality, timely, reliable and disaggregated data and gender statistics on all dimensions of environmental, disaster risk reduction and climate change issues and sexual and gender-based violence.</p><p>MARTA LUCa\\x8DA RAMa\\x8DREZ, Vice President of Colombia, spotlighting the threats to global peace and stability seen over the last two weeks, said that the future will depend on including women's voices. Fifty per cent of the world's population has historically been excluded from power, but gender equality is essential for generating sustainable economic growth. For its part, Colombia has implemented a national policy with five objectives: to provide economic empowerment for women entrepreneurs; to include more women in politics; to involve women in peace and security; to ensure that women can live free from violence; and to establish more gender-based institutions. Noting her status as her country's first female Vice President, she stressed that, when women arrive in positions of power, they must remember to open more spaces for other women \"just as those who came before did for us\".</p><p>She went on to detail Colombia's establishment of a sovereign gender bond to help women-owned businesses recover from COVID-19 -- the first of its type in the world -- and stressed that economic autonomy is essential for women to decide their own futures and live free from violence. The international community must also remember the situation of women living in Ukraine, Afghanistan and other conflict zones as a result of wars \"always declared by men\". It must recall the voices of Afghan women, \"no longer heard in the halls of the United Nations\", which reflects the current multilateral system. And it must always call for the dignity and rights of all women, she urged, highlighting the legal and moral obligation to allow women around the world to rise up with all their creative and transformative might.</p><p>ENSIEH KHAZALI, Vice President for Women and Family Affairs of Iran, said that, during the pandemic, some 12,000 women-headed households have been trained and introduced to the traditional and cybermarkets. Also, more than 1 million women-headed households are covered by the Imam Khomeini Relief Committee. They have benefited from special social protection services including funding and insurance services. Ten million rials in cash subsidies were allocated to 17 million households to reduce economic constraints on families. Supported by the Vice-Presidency for Women and Family Affairs, the women-headed households were prioritized for receiving aid packages, and with the approval of the Cabinet, the amount of loans granted to those households were doubled. Also to protect the environment, 6,000 rural and nomadic women have become members of 2,000 rural and nomadic cooperatives, some of whom have been granted plots of land over the past five years. Iranian women are fighting the effects of unilateral coercive measures, she said, adding that their heroic achievements in various areas have proven that they can withstand various unjust and unilateral sanctions.</p><p>KATRIN JAKOBSDa\\x93TTIR, Prime Minister of Iceland, said that climate change has not spared her island country, with sea levels rising and glaciers melting. \"No country is an island when it comes to climate change,\" she said, stressing that similarly gender inequality plagues all parts of the world. Climate change causes poverty, disproportionally affecting women economically and socially. Climate change also causes instability and creates conditions for gender-based violence. Citing the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine, she expressed concern that the conflict will produce mass displacement, which, in turn, creates more cases of gender-based violence. This \"shadow pandemic\" had occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak, she said, calling for attention to gender-based violence caused by the Russian Federation's aggression. There is a need to include young people in social justice and health, as they are the best advocate for their own future. There are many remarkable women activists and human rights defenders in the forefront. \"The world will be a better place with women in the lead,\" she said.</p><p>TANZILA NARBAEVA, Chairperson and Speaker of the Senate of Parliament of Uzbekistan, said the Commission is a catalyst for incorporating gender into all aspects of United Nations work. Expanding the rights of women and girls is a key priority of Uzbekistan State policy, she noted, with a new development plan for 2022-2026 and a national programme to bolster the role of women and girls in the country's future. Addressing climate change, she noted Uzbekistan is particularly vulnerable to natural disasters, including the drying of the Aral Sea, which threatens the sustainable development of Central Asia. Reports have further suggested that, between 2030 and 2050, the average air temperature in the region may increase by 1.5C to 3C. Uzbekistan has adopted the broad use of renewable energy, and is working to develop the Aral Sea region, including through women-focused training courses to manage resources and regenerate salinated areas. During the third Central Asian Summit, Uzbekistan advanced the regional programme \"Green Agenda for Central Asia\", and is planting 200 million saplings.</p><p>ZORANA MIHAJLOVIC, Deputy Prime Minister and the President of the Coordination Body of the Government of the Republic of Serbia for Gender Equality of Serbia, said that UN-Women has been a partner of the Coordination Body for Gender Equality for years. They have worked together on gender mainstreaming of climate policies and practices in Serbia, and on ensuring that the normative framework related to energy is gender-sensitive and that climate change finance always includes women's perspective. A new national energy strategy, as well as the National Energy and Climate Action Plan are under way, both of which will be gender-sensitive, because without gender mainstreaming of public policies, the existing gender gap cannot be closed. The Government established the National Coalition on Energy Poverty whose goal is to underline gender gaps in energy poverty. \"The gender-just transition is our chance not only to change our energy sources and to have a cleaner environment, but also to change the perception of the energy sector as a men-dominated sector,\" she said.</p><p>EVELYN WEVER-CROES, Prime Minister of Aruba, speaking on behalf of the Netherlands and its constituent countries of Aruba, Curacao and Sint Maarten, said that these four countries have been battling the elements for centuries -- \"from North Sea floods to Caribbean hurricanes\" -- and are united in tackling the climate crisis, which is \"the greatest challenge of our time\". The world is unequal, and this crisis is amplifying that inequality. In the Caribbean, the greatest burden of care falls on women and girls when communities are in crisis; however, these individuals remain underrepresented in decision-making at all levels, including at the United Nations. Against that backdrop, she urged full, equal, meaningful and effective participation and leadership for women in adaptation and mitigation processes, along with granting the same equal access to the knowledge and resources necessary to respond to climate change.</p><p>ROBBERT DIJKGRAAF, Minister for Education, Culture and Science of the Netherlands, underscored the importance of knowledge in combating climate change, as it is \"the only resource that grows as you use it\". However, the voices, knowledge and experience of women and girls are unheard, as these individuals are underrepresented at all levels, including technical areas crucial to making the necessary energy transition. The world needs the contribution of women and girls, in all their diversity, to ensure a liveable future for humanity. Noting that today's meeting occurs in extraordinary times, he expressed full solidarity with all women and girls living in conflict -- including those in Ukraine -- and condemned the Russian Federation's illegal invasion of that country.</p><p>DERYA YANIK, Minister for Family and Social Services of Turkey, said that a civilization teaches: \"Plant a tree, even if it is your last deed.\" Her country puts great emphasis on environmental protection. Since 2002, it has witnessed remarkable progress as a result. Thanks to the \"Zero Waste\" project, a new era has begun in terms of environmental protection. Women play a major role in the success of this project. In adapting to the Paris Agreement on climate change, Turkey has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2053. An effective fight against climate change requires a political and social atmosphere in which women are resilient, empowered and their rights are ensured. Her country has made significant progress in eliminating all forms of violence and discrimination against women, adopted priority goals to increase the education level of women and girls, and taken crucial steps in terms of empowering and increasing the participation of women in the labour market. With the \"Gender-Responsive Planning and Budgeting in Turkey\" project, the Government is determined to ensure that women are not ignored and their needs and problems are always visible in budget programmes.</p><p>MAYA MORSY, Minister for Women and President of the National Council for Women of Egypt, said that her country is among those most affected by climate change, despite its very limited contribution to the phenomenon's existence, as Egypt accounts for only 0.6 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. In light of the impact of climate change on women -- particularly on their health, food security and living standards -- the Government works to implement a sustainable development model and has adopted many initiatives, programmes and projects to promote adaptation and mitigate the effects of climate change, while also promoting women's empowerment. These efforts include: raising women's awareness of rural initiatives and eco-friendly agricultural methods; organizing environmental camps to train women in eco-friendly industries; and raising awareness of sustainable flood-management. She also detailed Egypt's perspective for women, the environment and climate change, affirming the Government's commitment to address climate change and empower Egyptian women in various fields.</p><p>AWATIF HAYAR, Minister for Solidarity, Social Integration and Family of Morocco, outlining her country's efforts on the priority theme, said that national priority focuses on integrating women into environmental policy. This session coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a huge impact on women. Her country is including women in all areas of policy implementation. The 2011 Constitution bases itself on the principle of equality of men and women. Morocco is also working to implement all its international commitments in eliminating discrimination, advancing gender equality and addressing climate change. It has established the 2020-2030 Strategy for Climate Change Adaptation, with a view to archiving gender equality. The Government is undertaking projects with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) in the field of green technology. The Government has set a goal of increasing women's economic activity by 2026, she said, also noting that more women candidates won during the 2021 elections than in past elections.</p><p>CHUNG YOUNG-AI, Minister for Gender Equality and Family of the Republic of Korea, voiced concern about the impact of violence on women and girls, many of whom have been displaced or forced to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. She affirmed that only when the perspectives of women -- who account for half the world's population -- are incorporated into policies and programmes will the world be able to prudently respond to the crisis facing the international community. Her Government formulates a Basic Plan for Gender Equality Policies every five years, and has enforced gender-responsive budgeting since fiscal year 2010. It is aiming for carbon neutrality by 2050. In addition, a designated officer system has been established to support women in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The country is also responding to deepening gender inequality in the labour market brought on by the pandemic with a COVID-19 Women's Job Recovery Plan launched in 2021, expanding jobs for women in the public and private sectors. With the help of her ministry, UN-Women has established the United Nations Women Centre of Excellence for Gender Equality in Seoul.</p><p>SUSANNE RAAB, Federal Minister for Women, Family, Integration and Media in the Federal Chancellery of Austria, aligning herself with the European Union, noted that women and men are affected differently by climate and environmental crises and States have to think differently and come up with new solutions. Highlighting measures taken by her country in that regard, she stressed a special focus on the empowerment of women and girls in technology and innovation, to ensure that they equally benefit from job opportunities and increase diversity in those sectors, including through \"Lets Empower Austria\", an initiative which aims to increase the participation of women and girls in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Turning to the Russian's Federation's invasion of Ukraine, she noted that war leads to an unbelievable suffering for civilians, in particular women and girls. In that regard, she expressed her country's full solidarity with women and girls in Ukraine and those who fled.</p><p>EVA NORDMARK, Minister for Gender Equality, Ministry of Employment of Sweden, associating herself with the European Union, expressed solidarity with those living in conflict situations and other emergencies, including Afghanistan, Yemen, Ethiopia and Ukraine. The unprovoked, illegal and indefensible Russian Federation invasion of Ukraine is having an immense impact on the civilian population there, with a huge number of people, including women and children, forced to flee their homes. \"We all have an obligation to strongly condemn this invasion,\" she said. As a member of the Swedish feminist Government, she noted women's economic empowerment is key to achieving gender equality. \"When you make your own money, you can choose your own life,\" she said, citing political reforms such as parental leave for both mothers and fathers, affordable childcare and individual taxation to help close the gender pay gap. Addressing the urgency of stopping fossil fuel emissions to accelerate a just climate transition, she noted Sweden is producing batteries and the world's first fossil-free steel, creating thousands of new green jobs. As the COVID-19 pandemic has globally increased the risk of women being subjected to men's violence, prostitution and trafficking, the Government has adopted a 99-point Action Programme for preventing and combating violence against women. The blame must be put where it belongs: on the perpetrators. Stressing the importance of sexual and reproductive rights, she said: \"We must continue promoting access to safe and legal abortions, contraceptives and comprehensive sexuality education.\"</p><p>DOMINIQUE HASLER, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Education and Sport of Liechtenstein, noted the meeting unfortunately falls under the shadow of a terrible war, condemning the Russian Federation's invasion of Ukraine. She stressed that all armed conflicts have devastating consequences for civilians, and are a setback for the rights of women and girls, who disproportionately suffer violence, marginalization and exclusion, but show amazing resilience. Their role is key in supporting the international rules-based order; it is not a question of political correctness but a prerequisite for successful and peaceful political processes. Climate change also disproportionately burdens women and girls, and generations to come will note the action -- or inaction -- of the international community on the issue. Addressing the interlinkage between climate change and rights, she noted women lack access to land ownership. Modern slavery and human trafficking increase during and after natural disasters, she stressed, pointing to a blueprint the Government has developed for financial institutions to prevent such crimes through financial inclusion. Liechtenstein has also partnered with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) on the Climate and Environment Transition Fund. Quoting the Secretary-General, she noted that humanitarian emergencies move the clock backwards on women's rights.</p><p>THOMAS BLOMQVIST, Minister for Nordic Cooperation and Equality of Finland, aligning himself with the European Union, condemned Moscow's aggression against Ukraine in the strongest terms, stressing that the war is also a violation of women's rights. \"We must hear the voices of Ukrainian women. As in every conflict, women are critical to achieving sustainable peace,\" he said. Noting the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women and girls, he stressed that climate change is also a gender issue, calling for increased efforts to ensure a gender perspective in all climate, environment and disaster management policies. Highlighting the intersection between climate issues and sexual and reproductive health and rights, he spotlighted the essential importance of universal access to quality comprehensive sexuality education, bodily autonomy, access to clean water and sanitation, and women's economic empowerment, in order to achieve gender equality. To that end, his Government has introduced family leave reform and is also introducing national legislation on pay transparency, he noted. Expressing concern about the increasing sexual and gender-based violence, harassment and hate speech, both offline and online, he emphasized the need to bridge the gender digital divide and eliminate harmful gender stereotypes, including gender bias in artificial intelligence.</p><p>HO JAN TINETTI, Minister for Women of New Zealand, emphasized that women who experience multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including indigenous women, are among those most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and disasters, but also powerful agents of action, change and resilience. As such, the Government of New Zealand is increasingly applying gender and intersectional analysis to all its actions and decision-making, including by promoting the use of an online tool, she said. Noting the data-collection gaps and shortcomings exposed in that process, she stressed the vital importance of gender-disaggregated data to ensuring visibility for the gendered impacts of climate change and natural hazards, and of tailoring responses accordingly. She went on to state that New Zealand is also focusing on enabling an equitable climate transition to a low carbon economy, which entails consideration of the outcomes for different groups in the way climate change policies and programmes are funded and financed.</p><p>LISABETH MORENO, Minister Delegate for Gender Equality, Diversity and Equal Opportunities of France, expressed concern over the fate of women and girls in Ukraine following the Russian Federation's military aggression and underscored the need to preserve the rights and dignity of Ukrainians. Turning to climate change, she pointed out that women are the primary victims of it, and quite often, they are not heard despite \"having something to say\". Gender equality is at the forefront of France's efforts in the European Union, and the Government also works to combat sexual and gender-based violence. National legislation addresses domestic abuse, street harassment and new forms of violence on the Internet, and an ombudsman for public enterprises was established to combat harassment in the workplace. She also emphasized the importance of women's economic independence, noting that the pandemic has revealed the inequality women face in the public and professional spaces. Despite women playing a key role, their contributions are often not seen or valued, and she expressed hope that, post-pandemic, \"parity will be the rule, not the exception\".</p><p>LYAZZAT RAMAZANOVA, Minister for the National Commission for Women, Family and Demographic Policy under the President of Kazakhstan, said her country is committed to all issues on gender equality as women are the main beneficiaries of a clean environment. Kazakhstan is addressing climate change challenges head-on. A transition to the green economy requires significant investment in line with commitments made under the Paris Agreement and the subsequent agreement in Glasgow. Kazakhstan seeks to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The Government does not represent the whole picture in this effort, she said, stressing that civil society and businesses are doing their parts. Noting that her landlocked country is far from the ocean and two thirds of its land is desert, she said Central Asian economies like hers must adapt to climate change. Kazakhstan will plant 2 billion trees, with civil society participating in that endeavour. About 80 per cent of civil-society organizations are headed by women. She noted the establishment of a green technology centre in Kazakhstan.</p><p>NNALENA BAERBOCK, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Germany, said an estimated 800,000 women will give birth in Ukraine in the next few months, many without shelter or access to proper care. \"This illustrates clearly that conflicts and crises are not gender-blind,\" she said, stressing that conflicts disproportionately impact women from Afghanistan to the Sahel. The same is true for the climate crisis, she said, urging the Commission to compel States to put women's rights at the heart of climate action. She noted that, during droughts, it is girls who are sent to school less frequently because gender norms dictate that fetching water falls to them. For such reasons, Germany supported the Human Rights Council in recognizing a clean, healthy and sustainable environment as a human right, and it supports efforts to give women and other marginalized groups an equal say in decision-making processes.</p><p>MUSA MAAYTAH, Minister for Political and Parliamentary Affairs and Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for the Empowerment of Women, and Minister of Political and Parliamentary Affairs of Jordan, said the international community must take into account the most vulnerable people to ensure civil society features the participation of women in decision-making processes. Jordan has pioneered mainstreaming gender into State policy on climate change, stressing the importance of measures addressing the root causes of inequality and discrimination and acknowledging the different circumstances of men and women. He also affirmed the Government will work to provide better services to women in humanitarian crises, either through prevention or recovery, and is further taking into account lessons learned from the pandemic, involving women in decision-making related to economic empowerment. He noted that the labour law was amended to provide nursery care for female staff, equal pay and paternity leave, as well as equal pay for equal work.</p><p>RODERIC O'GORMAN, Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth of Ireland, aligning himself with the European Union, expressed solidarity with women and girls in situations of conflict or other emergencies and pointed out that these individuals are particularly impacted by the same, including in Ukraine. Ireland prioritizes women's empowerment, demonstrated by its international development programming that focuses on social protection, food systems, climate action and the women, peace and security agenda. Spotlighting the link between climate and security, he said that instability and fragility have a disproportionate impact on women. Women's role in addressing the climate crisis is too often overlooked and undervalued, and States must ensure that women's voices are heard at all levels. He went on to say that Ireland, for its part, has pioneered citizens' assemblies as exercises in participatory democracy, and the assembly for gender equality recently submitted its report containing 45 recommendations in this area to the Government for implementation.</p><p>LAILA AL NAJAR, Minister for Social Development of Oman, emphasized the importance of a prominent role for women in national development, noting that they instil the value of tolerance. Noting that his country's Constitution guarantees the rights of women, he said their economic participation is an important goal for Oman. A high percentage of women are now joining the labour market, he added. Pointing out that more women occupy leadership positions in political and public life, he said they are holding decision-making positions in private companies, as well. Oman provides assistance to women entrepreneurs and small business owners engaged in e-commerce, he said, adding that the Government also supports victims of domestic violence. Women volunteer to help those affected in crisis situations, he noted, stressing that their participation is crucial both during normal times and in emergencies.</p><p>MARIANA VIEIRA DA SILVA, Minister of State for the Presidency of Portugal, said that it is fundamental to invest in the production of data disaggregated by sex, on the impacts of phenomena and policies. Environment and energy, agriculture, mobility or urban planning are important sectors in this approach. Since 2021, Portugal has monitored gender equality indicators in its State budget report, including in the field of climate change, with all data produced by the Central Administration to be disaggregated by sex. In the labour market, the Government is integrating more women in key areas of climate transition, whether through training activities in maritime economy, in the management of rural fires, or through the training of women working in the agricultural sector. In the fight against energy poverty, it is reducing the costs of energy and other consumptions, supporting the more vulnerable households, namely single parent families. Legislative measures set minimum thresholds for participation in decision-making positions. Since 2017, the average proportion of women on the boards of publicly listed companies increased from 12 to 29 per cent. In public administration, since 2015, the rate of women senior managers jumped from 32 to 43 per cent. In the Portuguese Parliament, women account for more than a third of representation.</p><p>MEIRAV COHEN, Minister for Social Equality of Israel, spotlighted all the young girls, mothers, sick or wounded women, pregnant women and senior citizens in Ukraine who thought they would never have to experience war atrocities again. Those women must be kept in mind when discussing policy. The gap between the privilege of discussing gender issues and the need to stay alive and protect one's children must be pondered by all. On a national level, she pointed to the presence of many different communities, which presents challenges to promoting women's rights in a \"complex sphere\" where every group lives according to its traditions and customs. Nearly 56 per cent of Israeli women are employed, most of them working mothers. Together with a high birth rate in Israel, Israeli women are burdened by their households much more than their Western counterparts. As a result, her Government's attempt to reduce environmental hazards by restricting the use of disposable housewares was met with strong opposition from Orthodox communities that consist of multi-child families. An attempt to limit disposables with extensive taxing was considered an attack on women in the more traditional household. The women, as sole housekeepers, had to choose between spending more money or having to do more housework. To that end, her country has the complex task of finding the right balances between promoting women's rights while preserving the environment and addressing climate change.</p><p>YANNA WEBSTER-ROY, Minister in the Office of the Prime Minister responsible for Gender and Child Affairs of Trinidad and Tobago, said the country's National Vision 2030 Development Plan and the National Policy on Gender and Development recognize the importance of holistic, interdisciplinary and cross-sectoral approaches to conserving, developing and safeguarding natural resources. The Policy aims to encourage women and men to play diverse and complementary roles in approaches to climate change and environmental protection. She noted that Trinidad and Tobago ratified the Paris Agreement, aiming to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 15 per cent in the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors by 2030 -- a 103 million-ton reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. On gender, she cited the Ministry of Planning and Development, the political head of which is a woman, and the Multilateral Environmental Agreements Network, with women accounting for 58 per cent of the groups and playing a lead role in decision making. The country's Comprehensive Disaster Management Policy further recognizes that disasters and hazards affect women, girls, men and boys differently. Because of their reproductive responsibilities, women are particularly valuable \"change agents\" in the transition to a sustainable economy, and should be trained and supported in adopting new environmentally friendly practices and technologies.</p><p>TAINA BOFFERDING, Minister for Equality between Women and Men of Luxembourg, said that crises -- whatever their nature -- affect each individual differently. In the conflict situation in Ukraine, women and girls must demonstrate resilience and courage while facing unprovoked Russian aggression. In a three-week period, millions have been forced to flee their homes, the majority of whom are women and girls. Also expressing shock over reports of sexual and gender-based violence perpetrated by Russian armed forces, she demanded that the Russian Federation \"cease this stupid war\". Turning to women and climate change, she stressed the need to improve the collection of reliable, disaggregated gender data; to place gender equality at the centre of resilience policies and disaster-risk-reduction programmes; and to increase the number of women in decision-making and leadership roles. She added that, for its part, the Government has adopted a feminist foreign policy and its development-cooperation efforts -- to which 1 per cent of Luxembourg's GDP is allocated -- are focusing on new gender strategies, such as increasing financing for projects bolstering women's empowerment throughout the world.</p><p>Right of Reply</p><p>Speaking in the exercise of the right of reply, the representative of the Russian Federation said that many delegates made baseless allegations against his country in their statements today. They ignore the fact that the Ukrainian army has stricken the heart of Donetsk, killing civilians. Since the coup d'etat in 2014, the Ukrainian regime has taken a decision to destroy the Russian-speaking populations in the country's east, where they are being shelled and killed. He wondered why Western countries ignore this situation created by the criminal regime in Kyiv, and instead provide lethal weapons to Kyiv. He reminded the Commission that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) used inhumane weapons in the former Yugoslavia, killing civilians, including women and children, also citing similar actions by the so-called \"peacekeeping\" forces in Afghanistan and Libya.</p><p>Source: United Nations</p>", "publisher": "Korea News Gazette", "instances": ["In the same vein, Vindhya Persaud, Guyana's Minister for Human Services and Social Security of the Co-operative Republic, speaking on behalf of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), reiterated disappointment that the developed countries' pledge to provide $100 billion by 2020 for developing nations to address climate change was not met. Stressing that climate change poses an existential threat to small island developing States, she said its impact represents a \"code red for humanity\". In addition, climate finance for both adaptation and mitigation activities must include measures that support women-owned enterprises in the green and blue economies, she said, also calling for investment in gathering gender specific statistics and data on the relationship between gender and climate.

I applauded this. But I also said that was not enough. To be credible, we need to match ambitious long-term goals with ambitious mid-term targets, with clear baselines. I will repeat this call in September.</p><p>I will also emphasize that major developing economies have a critical role in the negotiations: Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa and, perhaps most important of all, China.</p><p>Already China has devoted a sizable portion of its national stimulus spending to renewable energy and green economic growth. It has become a world leader in wind and solar technology. China's dynamic renewable energy sector is worth nearly $17 billion and employs close to 1 million workers.</p><p>This is impressive, but it is just a beginning. China, for example, has enough wind resources to generate more electricity than it currently uses.</p><p>Imagine the potential. Imagine if, thanks to wind and solar, China could wean itself from coal, which accounts for 85 percent of its carbon emissions. And if China were to do it, so could much of the rest of the world. In so doing, China can serve as a model not only for developing nations, but for the whole world.</p><p>We must also adapt to those climate impacts that are already wreaking havoc on communities, particularly in the least developed countries.

Many used the occasion to urge that the Forum's independence be maintained, especially in the absence of a global forest convention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'As you know, this issue is evolving swiftly' in the context of growing responsibilities, said Senegal's delegate on behalf of the African Group. The secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests must be considerably bolstered with ambitious supplementary goals. Its independence as a subsidiary of the Economic and Social Council also must be preserved. 'If this is not done, we risk devaluing the efforts of Member States and other organizations that have worked tirelessly in the 27 years since the Rio Declaration [Principles]' on environment and development, he asserted.</p><p>Such calls were echoed by the European Union delegate, who said it is of utmost importance to ensure that the Department's reform not impinge on the Forum's ability to fulfil all its functions as outlined in Economic and Social Council resolution 2015/33. Member States must understand how proposals for the Forum fit into the full picture of the Department's reform. 'We expect more details and a comprehensive picture of the measures envisaged,' she insisted.</p><p>The representative of Australia likewise called for an informed approach, requesting that delegates' views be fully captured in the Chair's summary, which should also be sent to those involved in decision-making on the Forum's future. Unless the Forum is recognized as the competent body for forests, the United Nations risks reverting to a fragmented system unable to realize forest goals. She called for maintaining the secretariat's structure and resources and filling the director position as a matter of urgency.</p><p>On that point, several delegates raised concerns over a proposal to downgrade the Forum's leadership from an executive director to a director position, with Canada's delegate stressing that any such demotion would be a mistake. She urged those making decisions to reconsider such a move.</p><p>Fielding those and other queries raised since the start of the session, Zhu Juwang, Officer-in Charge of the Forum's secretariat, read out the answers provided by Department officials who are in Geneva for the Chief Executives Board meeting. The Department will continue to provide the highest-level support to the Forum and its secretariat in fulfilling its mandates outlined in resolution 2015/33 and the United Nations strategic plan for forests.</p><p>Noting that the Forum's secretariat will continue to report to the Under Secretary General for delivery of the work programme, under the subprogramme on sustainable forest management, he said the director post in the secretariat remains vacant and its functions are being reviewed. Member States will be requested to examine these functions in context of the Department's 2020 budget proposal.</p><p>In an afternoon discussion on the resources available to finance the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network, Peter Gondo of the Forum's secretariat said that, since the sixth session of the Global Environment Facility, $825 million is now expected to leverage $8.4 billion in co-financing. Stressing that 'we still need more resources' to achieve the targets laid out in the global forest goals, he said the secretariat works with 25 countries, with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa, North Macedonia and several others recently added to the list.</p><p>The European Union's delegate raised questions about whether China would cover the full cost of the Beijing office or the differential cost, with the secretariat continuing to cover other costs. As the secretariat is small, he was interested in how the Department would ensure that the two locations do not lead to a loss in efficiency and cooperation, and how any changes in the Forum's leadership in terms of post level would affect the office's management.</p><p>'I'm very puzzled,' said Switzerland's delegate. 'We asked last year for information, but only have an oral report.' Stressing that the China office is not a United Nations office, she called for clarity on what its role would be, as there is no work plan or budget. 'There is a total lack of transparency and this is quite shocking,' she said. 'We require all possible documents, as required.'</p><p>The United States delegate said such an office must carry out its work in a neutral and multilateral manner. The secretariat must provide regular updates on it and invite input from Forum members. Its relationship with the Network must be made clear and its functions carefully chosen. Moreover, Forum Member States should be able to comment on the memorandum of understanding for such an office.</p><p>Australia's delegate meanwhile asked how the potential of the project office can be determined, given the ongoing reforms in the Department, while Ecuador's delegate said middle-income countries face unique financing difficulties and stressed the importance of capacity-building.</p><p>The day also featured two panel discussions, the first on the theme 'Monitoring, assessment and reporting', and the second on 'Means of implementation for sustainable forest management'.</p><p>The Forum on Forests will reconvene at 10 a.m. on Thursday, 9 May, to continue its fourteenth session.</p><p>Information on Department of Economic and Social Affairs Reform</p><p>The representative of the European Union, reiterated questions posed to the Forum on Forests a day earlier, among them: the options being considered in the Department of Economic and Social Affairs regarding the Forum; the implications of each option on budget, resources and reporting lines; the potential implications on the Forum's representation in various meetings; the Forum's capacity to fulfil its functions will not be weakened regardless of the Department's reform; and plans for fulfilling the director position.</p><p>The representative of Canada said her delegation seeks information on the status of the Department's reform regarding Forum matters. Recalling that her delegation had requested the Department's staff to attend today's session, she said there are questions around whether the subprogramme on forests remain intact as part of the organ; actions and options being undertaken in the context of Department reform; results of the cost-benefit analysis of each option; if there is a merger, how the Department person leading Forum matters would ensure budget and human resources; and if the subprogramme merged into another division, what are the lines of reporting.</p><p>ZHU JUWANG, Officer-in-Charge, Forum secretariat, read out the answers to the questions from senior Department officials who are in Geneva for the Chief Executive Board meeting. The General Assembly will consider the following reform measures, as proposed by the Secretary-General on 28 December 2018, among them: strengthening leadership to respond to the new demands of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; improving data, statistics and analysis to inform decision-making and enhance accountability for results; enhancing capacities for leveraging financing for the Sustainable Development Goals; and strengthening the Department's strategies and mechanisms to enhance external communications and partnerships, including with the private sector and academia. Those measures are being considered to better align Department's expertise with the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>He said the Department will continue to provide the highest level of support to the Forum and its secretariat in fulfilling its mandates outlined in resolution 2015/33 and the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030. The Forum's secretariat will continue to be responsible to the Under-Secretary-General for delivery of the work programme, under the subprogramme on sustainable forest management. The post of director in the Forum's secretariat remains vacant. The functions of the post are being reviewed. Member States will be requested to examine these functions in context of the Department's 2020 budget proposal. The Under-Secretary-General, as Department head, has been delegated to manage resources. The director for the Forum secretariat will be responsible to the Under-Secretary-General for Management of regular and extra-budgetary resources, and its work programme. The allocation of the Forum's resources will continue to be presented to Member States separately in the Department's annual budget.</p><p>The representative of Algeria asked that the secretariat distribute the questions posed to Member States</p><p>The representative of New Zealand highlighted the importance of maintaining the Forum's ability to best promote the strategic plan on forests and the strategic forest goals. He supported its emphasis in the quadrennial work programme, stressing that the Forum occupies a unique space for addressing forest policy and management, given that there is no forest convention.</p><p>The representative of Senegal, speaking on behalf of African States, recalled that the Economic and Social Council created the Forum as a subsidiary body for the conservation and sustainable development of all kinds of forests. The Department must take note of arrangements for the Forum. Its 'striking areas' included the creation of a global financing network for forests, and in 2017, the first United Nations strategic plan on forests. The Department must recognize the Forum as a world-level intergovernmental body which independently deals with various dangers to forests. 'As you know, this issue is evolving swiftly' in the context of climate change, he said, stressing that the secretariat must be considerably bolstered with ambitious and supplementary goals. He requested that the reform process preserve the Forum's independence as a subsidiary body of the Economic and Social Council and consider the growing responsibilities for its secretariat to strengthen its effectiveness. 'If this is not done, we risk devaluing the efforts of Member States and other organizations that have worked tirelessly in the 27 years since the Rio Declaration [Principles]', he insisted.</p><p>The representative of the European Union said the Forum is the only policy forum with universal membership. Citing resolution 2015/33, she said the Forum administers the trust fund, fosters inter-agency collaboration, liaises with countries and stakeholders and works within the United Nations to promote forest conservation. It is of utmost importance to ensure that the Department's reform not impinge the Forum's ability to fulfil all its functions as outlined in resolution 2015/33. Member States must understand how proposals for the Forum fit into the full picture of the Department's reform. 'We expect more details and a comprehensive picture of the measures envisaged,' she insisted, calling for enhanced transparency.</p><p>The representative of Australia called for an informed approach to the Department's reform. Requesting that her views and those of others be fully captured in the Chair's summary, which should also be sent to bodies involved in future decision-making processes that will determine the Forum's future, she welcomed reforms that will bolster the Forum's operations and voiced concern over those not allowing the body to fulfil its mandates. While underscoring the body's unique and special place within the United Nations system, she said there has never been a greater need for a fully functional Forum secretariat.</p><p>At the time it was created, the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017 2030 noted that it came at an unprecedented opportunity to safeguard forests, she continued. 'We have less than 12 years to deliver on the ambitious forest goals,' she said, underscoring that a fully functional secretariat is crucial to the successful implementation of the strategic plan. Emphasizing the breadth of work undertaken by the Forum secretariat, she said it has a valuable role in the collaborative partnership on forests and in work on such high-profile events as the International Day on Forests. 'It is the voice on forests,' she said. The secretariat must be recognized as the competent body for forests, without which the United Nations risks reverting to a fragmented system that is unable to realize forest goals. 'Forests matter', she insisted, and if the secretariat scales down, it risks an erosion of capacity. In such circumstances, the shared vision of a world in which all forests are sustainably managed and provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations will be unachievable. She called for maintaining the secretariat's structure and resources and filling the director position as a matter of urgency. Decisions on the Department's reform must be taken in a fully informed manner with complete transparency to Member States.</p><p>The representative of Nigeria, associating himself with the African Group, recalled the expectations placed on the Forum to deliver on its mandates, stressing that reforms should only strengthen its ability to address future challenges. While noting the responses by the Officer-in-Charge, he said that, of the Department divisions, only those addressing population and development matters were organized along sectoral areas; the others are multisectoral. Greater consultation with Member States would be helpful and he urged the Department to address the recommendations offered by Australia's delegate.</p><p>The representative of China expressed hope that Department reforms will consider the important role played by the Forum and its secretariat in implementing the strategic plan, and both the global goals on forests and the Sustainable Development Goals. Its independent status should be maintained. He expressed hope that the budgetary arrangement will not affect its work and only enhance its ability to fulfil its responsibilities.</p><p>The representative of the United States voiced full support for the Department's reform, pointing to the Forum's work to develop global forest indicators, and a new format and cycle for voluntary reporting. The global forest financing facilitation network meanwhile is supporting the effective use of domestic and international funding, while the collaborative partnership on forests has developed work plans that are aligned with country and donor interests. That not only benefits Member States, but aligns with the United Nations goal to enhance its capacity to leverage financing, and develop external communications and partnerships. The Forum secretariat should continue to be cost-effective, and both equipped and resourced to carry out priority actions. Reaffirming the need to maintain the Forum's ability to fulfil its mandate and role, she reiterated the importance of fulfilling the director position to ensure there is consistent leadership, representation and communication. She expressed support for the positions of New Zealand and the European Union on that matter, adding that such points should be included in the Chair's summary.</p><p>The representative of the Russian Federation emphasized the importance of a fully functional Forum secretariat able to deliver on its role and mandates. 'We have many tasks at hand,' he stressed, citing the elaboration of the work programme and resolution of matters relating to voluntary national contributions and reports. He asked that questions posed be transmitted by the secretariat to Member States.</p><p>The representative of Niger, associating himself with the African Group, pointed to the secretariat's need for resources necessary to fulfil its mandate, stressing that reforms should not impact its ability in that regard. The secretariat cannot be effective and efficient if it is not supported, he said, underscoring Niger's commitment to achieve the goals outlined in the strategic plan.</p><p>The representative of Japan expressed support for the aims of the Department's reforms, which impact the Forum's structure. Yet, Member States were unable to attain full transparency over the administration of the budget, due to a lack of clarity around the director position. That lack of clarity can impact the scope of the Forum's activities and its visibility at various forums. For such reasons, she expressed hope that the issue would be clarified soon and asked that the questions and responses be circulated to Member States for review, adding that it is not clear which options were considered in the cost-benefit analysis.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said forests add major contributions to achieving the 2030 Agenda, and the Forum's work goes much beyond such commitments. It is the only policy forum on forests, and its ability to deliver on its goals must be assured. Its subprogramme is of utmost importance, she said, adding that the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network stands among its most essential services to help countries in transition access sustainable financing. Given that the 2019 climate summit in September will address nature-based solutions, strengthening the Forum's secretariat is essential. All the Forum's sessions have taken care to integrate all the Sustainable Development Goals into its discussions, she said, requesting that the director post be fulfilled.</p><p>The representative of Canada asked the Office-in-Charge to clarify that the director would maintain a direct reporting relationship to the Under-Secretary-General. She also requested that respect be shown to Member States by answering questions throughout the year, reiterating that the decision of director versus executive director is a crucial one. The strategic plan on forests must be transmitted to the world. 'Any downgrading of executive director is a mistake,' she clarified, urging those making decisions to reconsider such a move.</p><p>The representative of Algeria clarified that the Department should provide written responses to the questions raised and include them in the Chair's summary.</p><p>The representative of the major group for children and youth, on behalf of all major groups, expressed strong support for the positions of New Zealand, African States, European Union and others to ensure that the Forum's secretariat remain fully operational. He voiced concern over the steps being taken to diminish its ability to represent the role of forests in global processes. There is a clear need for a functional secretariat to foster communication, which would be a signal for youth, women and civil society as a whole that the international community is taking action to combat current and future problems. He recalled that this is a process in the hands of Member States.</p><p>The representative of the scientific and technological community major group, associating himself with the African Group, European Union, Australia, New Zealand and the United States, voiced concern over the implication of reforms on the secretariat's independence, operational budget and on the morale of its staff, given the decision to downgrade the executive director position. However, he was encouraged by the by the Officer-in-Charge's statement this morning and looked forward to a strengthened Forum.</p><p>The representative of Norway voiced support for the Department's reform, as well as the need for a transparent reform process and a fully functional Forum secretariat. He voiced concern however over the downgrading of the director position, expressing hope that such concerns will be outlined in the Chair's summary.</p><p>Forum Chair BORIS GREGU\u0160KA (Slovakia) said that the secretariat will circulate the package of questions posed by Member States by the end of the morning session.</p><p>The representative of Australia, reflecting on the Officer-in-Charge's response to Canada's question on the reporting function to the Under-Secretary-General, said the director participates in a range of meetings, as well as in both inter- and intra-United Nations processes. If it is not filled at the D 2 level, she asked whether that representation will be undertaken by the Under-Secretary-General.</p><p>Mr. ZHU replied that the director will indeed report to the Under-Secretary-General. Representation at various events would depend on the prioritization of the events.</p><p>The representative of Germany voiced concern that the Forum's secretariat cannot be represented in ordinary meetings abroad, such as the collaborative partnership on forests. The question was not whether the Under-Secretary-General would be represented at certain meetings. Rather, he voiced concern that the Forum secretariat cannot even be appropriately represented at international meetings where directors are present, including in meetings with Governments, where there is a difference between a D 2 and a D 1 post.</p><p>Mr. ZHU said the representatives of Australia and Germany have made important points that will be shared with the Department's management.</p><p>The representative of Argentina asked about the Department reform process, as any reduction in the executive director position would be detrimental to the Forum.</p><p>Introduction of Secretariat Note</p><p>AFSA KEMITALE-ROTHSCHILD of the Forum secretariat then introduced that body's note (document E/CN.18/2019/3), on the agenda item titled 'Monitoring, assessment and reporting on progress towards implementing the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030, including the United Nations forest instrument and voluntary national contributions'. Noting that the document provides an overview of intersessional activities on monitoring and reporting, as well as items for discussion by the Forum, she said its drafters proposed the development of several core definitions, including of the terms 'forest-dependent people', while considering national contexts. Additionally, they requested the development of a platform for the dissemination of information on forest-related issues and greater coordination with national actors. Countries were encouraged to submit their voluntary national contributions to the Forum's upcoming sessions and share best practices, including in the context of the Forum's mandated flagship publication, she said.</p><p>Panel I</p><p>The Forum then convened its first panel of the day, on the theme 'Monitoring, assessment and reporting'. Moderated by Roman Michalak, Programme Manager of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe-Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Forestry and Timber Section, it featured four panellists: Peter Csoka, Senior Forestry Officer at FAO; Kofi Affum-Baffoe, Production Manager at the Forestry Commission of Ghana; Patrick Kariuki, Deputy Conservation of Forest and United Nations Forum on Forests Alternate Focal Point at the Forest Service of Kenya; and Davia Carty, Strategic Planner and Analyst at the Forestry Department of Jamaica.</p><p>Mr. MICHALAK, citing a challenging global environment for monitoring and reporting on forest-related issues, said many of the indicators being studied are complex and lie 'outside the comfort zone' of many States and sectors. Emphasizing that the main indicators being considered today - namely, the number of forest-dependent people living in extreme poverty and the contribution of forests to food security - are huge topics with broad implications, he said today's panel is an opportunity to learn from delegations about their work and future expectations on those issues.</p><p>Mr. CSOKA, recalling that there is nothing new in the 'global core set of indicators' now being examined, said the data being collected can be used in monitoring multiple processes at the same time - including towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Aichi Biodiversity Targets and others. Noting that both the methodology of data collection and the availability of data continues to pose a challenge, he said the Collaborative Partnership on Forests has been working with all Member States to provide support. Participants at the Forum's thirteenth session welcomed progress made on the core set of indicators, while also requesting the development of remaining indicators, as well as more reporting. Providing an overview of efforts to more clearly define the terms 'area of degraded forests' and 'forest-dependent people in extreme poverty', he said the greatest challenges include agreeing on the definition of 'dependence' and 'food security'. Additional considerations include whether national targets should be set for sustainable forest management, similar to the Sustainable Development Goals target allocating 0.7 per cent of gross national income to official development assistance (ODA).</p><p>Ms. CARTY, sharing Jamaica's experience with monitoring, assessment and reporting, said it is one of six pilot countries using the Forum's reporting template - aimed at helping countries review and develop national forest policies and tools, generate information for national reports on forest conditions and management and communicate effectively with society and stakeholders. Recalling that Jamaica submitted its voluntary national contribution to the Forum's thirteenth session, she reviewed progress made since 2017 - namely, an expansion of the nation's boundary verification programme; the assessment and mapping of 2,000 hectares of mangrove and swamp forests to transfer for protection; the reforestation and restoration of 1,800 hectares of denuded/degraded forest lands; and the maintenance of 5,600 hectares of forest plantations. A $2 million grant now supports a forest-related alternative livelihoods programme, which encourages agroforestry, bamboo utilization, apiculture, smart agriculture, water harvesting, yam stick production and the production of medicinal and nutraceutical products. While Jamaica amended its national forest policy, she said gaps remain in measuring the socioeconomic impact of forests and their correlation to poverty levels.</p><p>Mr. AFFUM-BAFFOE focused his presentation on Ghana's experience in studying forests' contribution to poverty reduction and food security. Spotlighting a partnership between the Forestry Commission and farmers supporting the planting of trees on the fringes of degraded forest areas, he said its benefits include a 40 per cent share for farmers in the 'standing tree value' and a 5 per cent share for the community. However, not all stakeholders adhere to those terms and there is an absence of a formal mechanism to monitor the programme's contribution to poverty reduction. Also describing the benefits of Ghana's 'Timber Utilization Contracts' for offloading unused trees and logs, he said the programme provides small-scale millers and local carpenters access to timber and generates employment for the rural poor. However, there is a lack of coordination of domestic players in the small-scale value chain and the revenue generated is difficult to quantify. Against that backdrop, he listed several recommendations to enhance the visibility of forest goods and services and their contribution to poverty reduction.</p><p>Mr. KARIUKI, recalling that Kenya submitted its voluntary national contribution to the Forum in 2017, said that report was mainly qualitative as its work is still in the pilot phase. More recently, an analytical study was conducted, leading to proposals for several national indicators. Those relate to: improving livelihoods for forest-dependent people; the contribution of forests and trees to food security; mobilizing significant resources from all sources of sustainable forest management; and increasing forest-related financing from all sources, including the public sector, education, research, multilateral and other external sources. Turning to potential sources of data, he said such existing indicators as the national poverty headcount, per capita income, gender equality index and child poverty can provide insight. In line with the work of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics, forest-related data will be collected from across the country's various wards and administrative units, as well as from selected forests. However, he also cited several challenges, including the small, scattered nature of Kenya's forests, limited institutional capacity and the high cost of forest data collection.</p><p>In the ensuing discussion, many speakers agreed that a strong relationship exists between forests, their goods and services and efforts to reduce poverty around the globe. However, in the context of monitoring and reporting, several speakers warned against saddling States with undue or overly complex reporting burdens and called for efforts to avoid duplication and overlap with other reporting processes.</p><p>The representative of the European Union, expressing support for the core set of indicators, said the contributions of forests to poverty reduction and food security should form the basis of an appropriate national census question.</p><p>The representative of Fiji, noting that its national development plan seeks to manage forests in a balanced manner and in line with their natural potential, described specific efforts to study the important impacts of water cachement systems. He also requested support from the Forum in ongoing monitoring and reporting efforts, including to identify data gaps.</p><p>The representative of Argentina, welcoming the development of guides for national reporting, expressed support for the development of a template for national reports which would help countries provide information in a unified format.</p><p>Striking a similar tone, the representative of the Russian Federation called for more clarity on reporting accountability. Noting that voluntary national contributions exist to reflect the participation of the Forum's Member States in achieving the global forest goals, he advocated for the development of a clear, concise and simple template for voluntary contributions, which he said will help avoid misreadings and 'double meanings' while allowing for more accurate comparisons.</p><p>Also speaking were representatives of Ukraine, Republic of Korea and the United States.</p><p>Means of Implementation</p><p>PETER GONDO of the secretariat of the United Nations Forum on Forests introduced that body's note on 'Means of implementation' (document E/CN.18/2019/4), which covers major developments since the Forum's thirteenth session. Pointing out that, since the sixth session of the Global Environment Facility, some $825 million are now expected to leverage about $8.4 billion in co-financing, he added that a liaison officer was also appointed. Support has been provided to land use projects with a forestry component and four projects were approved under the dedicated grant mechanism for indigenous peoples and local communities. Stressing that 'we still need more resources' to achieve the targets laid out in the global forest goals, he said the secretariat currently works with a total of 25 countries, with C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, South Africa, North Macedonia and several others recently added to the list. Recalling that an expert group meeting was held in January on the issue of a clearing house mechanism, he said work has begun on a generic modular guide for developing national forest financing strategies and is slated to be finalized in June.</p><p>THOMAS BALDAUF, Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture of Germany, updated the Forum on the expert group meeting of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network clearing house, stressing that its priorities included promoting and assisting members in designing sustainable forest management strategies, and serving as a clearing house and database for existing, new and emerging financing opportunities, and as a tool for sharing lessons learned and best practices from successful projects, building on the Collaborative Partnership on Forests online sourcebook for forest financing. Another priority not covered during the meeting is to contribute to achievement of the global forest goals.</p><p>He said the expert group meeting, held from 9 to 11 January, was attended by 60 experts from Member States, organizations, non-governmental organizations and academia. The objective was to discuss and identify the requirements and elements of information for the development of a comprehensive database on forest financing opportunities. Experts discussed aspects of the clearing house, including existing clearing house databases and sources of data; identification of key users and information providers; modalities of partnerships; and the need for interactive platforms on lessons learned and best practices. The outcome, a chair's summary, included six items, notably on the creation of a database and components to be included in its first phase.</p><p>HOSSEIN MOEINI-MEYBODI, Forum on Forests secretariat, updated on the establishment of its project office for the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network in Beijing. As the secretariat was appointed manager of the Network and the strategic plan, it adopted the four priorities for the Network. At the Forum's thirteenth session, China announced its willingness to host the project office in Beijing. Since then, the Permanent Mission of China transmitted a note verbale to the Department in September 2018, confirming the willingness of the nation to host the office and requesting the Department to prepare relevant drafts and organize initial consultations. A draft memorandum of understanding was prepared, in coordination with the Office of Legal Affairs, and since its November 2018 transmission to China, two consultation rounds had been held, in January and April 2019.</p><p>He said several forestry, foreign affairs, finance and customs administration officials from China participated in those meetings, as had United Nations officials from the Office of Legal Affairs, the Department and the Forum secretariat. Substantive progress has been made on the draft memorandum of understanding, which is expected to be finalized by year-end. The office will aim to enhance the secretariat's work in scaling up the Network's capacity-building ability. The secretariat is the manager of the Network, with the Beijing office as a project office, and will continue to advance the priorities of the Network. The Beijing office has no normative mandate or policy setting role. It will report on its operations and programme activities to the Forum secretariat, which itself will serve as an interface for Member States requesting Network support. The work programme will complement that of the secretariat in relation to the Network, and the office will operate under the supervision of the secretariat director. All programmatic and administrative costs will be covered by the extrabudgetary contribution provided by China - meaning that the office's establishment and operation will have no programme budget implications for the United Nations.</p><p>Statements</p><p>GUO YUFU (China) said the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network is critical to help developing countries mobilize funding and share best practices. That instrument has provided much support in that regard with good results, he said. However, as the Facility faces resource constraints, China decided to support the provision of such assistance by offering to host an office for the Facility in Beijing.</p><p>WINSTON LACKIN (Suriname), pointing out that his is the most forested country in the world, recalled its pledge to cap its forest cover at 93 per cent. Suriname has also called on the international community to provide the required science and technology, expertise, technical and financial support for those efforts. Noting that other developing countries are in the same position, he said 24 per cent of the world's forests - close to a billion hectares - are in high forest low deforestation countries. 'Under a business-as-usual scenario, many of these countries will see their deforestation rates increase sharply as a result of pressures associated with economic development,' he stressed, noting that high forest low deforestation countries have received under $2 billion in climate financing, less than 14 per cent of all funds committed. Calling for more efforts to assist those countries - which absorb more than 25 per cent of the world's human-generated carbon emission and sequester more carbon than logged, degraded and planted forests - he stressed that high forest low deforestation countries should sit squarely at the heart of the Forum's discourse.</p><p>Mr. DAS (India), noting that his delegation has no technical objection with the establishment of a Beijing office, nevertheless asked for more clarity on which challenges with the present system necessitated the office's establishment.</p><p>Ms. POLIAKOVA (Ukraine), pointing out that her country has utilized the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network, welcomed that instrument's efficiency. Asking for more information about eligibility for funding under that instrument, she said the clearing house mechanism should make information on eligibility more widely available.</p><p>Mr. JOHNSON (United States), noting that the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network has provided assistance to 29 countries and five subregional organizations to date, called for additional efforts to study and quantify the results of such financing. Regarding the possible establishment of a Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network office in Beijing, he stressed that such an office must carry out its work in a neutral and multilateral manner. The secretariat must provide regular updates on it and invite input from Forum members. In addition, he said, the relationship between that office and the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network must be made clear, and its functions should be carefully chosen. Forum Member States should be able to comment on the memorandum of understanding for such an office and the latter must fall squarely under all United Nations rules and guidelines. Requesting information about the proposal to use extrabudgetary funds for the Beijing office, he asked whether other locations have also been considered and asked the Secretariat to provide Forum members with a cost-benefit analysis in that regard. In addition, he stressed that maintaining and updating the clearing house mechanism should not include any new reporting requirements.</p><p>Mr. YIMAM (Ethiopia), calling for action to advance both the Sustainable Development Goals and the global forest goals, said such action must be tantamount to the scale of the challenges. Ethiopia is aligning its national efforts with the United Nations strategic plan for forests 2017-2030, while also ensuring its continued economic growth. Among those efforts, he said, the Government is providing more space for the private sector to engage in sustainable forest management, including through commercial planting. Ethiopia requires sustainable, predictable support from the international community in that regard, he said, spotlighting the disproportionate impacts of climate change on developing countries.</p><p>Mr. GRLAS of the European Union said the global forest goals will only be achieved through good governance, the active involvement of all stakeholders and the enhanced mobilization of and access to financing. Spotlighting the need for a Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network that is effective and transparent, he described that instrument as a 'success story' that has not overlapped with or duplicated the efforts of other mechanisms. In that context, he called for a strong, collaborative partnership on forests to support the Network - as well as efforts to enhance its effectiveness and efficiency - and expressed support for the development of the clearing house mechanism. Among other things, he also echoed calls for a cost-benefit analysis of the establishment of a new office in Beijing and requested more clarity regarding the funding of such an office.</p><p>Ms. VERMONT (Switzerland) echoed calls for more information about the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network's support, as well as on the establishment of the proposed Beijing office. 'We don't quite understand what the role of that office will be,' she said, citing a 'shocking' lack of transparency on the matter and recalling that relevant information was previously requested by the Forum.</p><p>The representative of Costa Rica, echoing the statement delivered by the representative of Suriname regarding the special needs of high forest, low deforestation countries, said those nations require greater support. The question of funding should lie at the heart of the Forum's discussions, he said.</p><p>Mr. KABENGELE (Democratic Republic of the Congo), associating himself with Suriname and Costa Rica, agreed that the contribution of high forest low deforestation countries to achieve an appropriate climate balance has not been recognized by the international community. Their needs should be a higher priority for the Forum, he stressed.</p><p>Mr. REMAOUN (Algeria) recalled that the decision to establish a new Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network project office lies with the Secretary General and thanked China for its offer to host such an office.</p><p>Ms. MANTHE-TSUANENG (Botswana) expressed gratitude for the support provided by the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network to her country's sustainable forest management efforts.</p><p>ALISON SOLANGE GRA\u00d1A CORONEL (Ecuador), associating herself with the representatives of Suriname, Costa Rica and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, described her country's 'zero net deforestation' policy and its commitment to the United Nations strategic plan for forests. However, she agreed with other speakers that developing countries require support in accessing financing for such work.</p><p>Ms. MOTOYAMA (Japan), echoing many of the concerns raised by the United States representative regarding the establishment of the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network office in Beijing, asked the Secretariat whether it has examined similar case studies in which main offices are separated from Headquarters - many of which have resulted in significant extra costs and duplication. She also expressed support for proposals to conduct cost-benefit analyses of various options for such work.</p><p>Mr. MAHMOUD (Malaysia) said his country continues to face challenges in accessing the necessary resources for sustainable forest management. The Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network should negotiate with the Green Climate Fund on terms and conditions, he said, adding that the former should continue to assist developing countries in accessing funds from all sources.</p><p>Mr. DRANIBAKA (Fiji) described the Global Forest Financing Facilitation Network as a 'great tool for making things happen' in the implementation of sustainable forest management initiatives. He also associated himself with the statement delivered by the representative of Suriname.</p><p>Mr. MAHONEY (Australia) said the possible establishment of a new office in Beijing is a novel initiative and posed questions about its relationship with the reform of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs.</p><p>Mr. MOEINI-MEYBODI of the Forum secretariat, speaking on the idea to assess progress achieved by the Network in mobilizing funding for forests, said his office has discussed it but has not yet acted on the idea. Noting that it has collected data on the projects undertaken by the Network - which is different than funding - he said it takes time for a project to be reviewed by multilateral funding institutions, which have their own procedures. While the secretariat is doing its utmost to involve the implementing or accredited agency in the process from the start, in some cases, such efforts were not successful. Even when such agencies were involved from the start, they had different priorities which created problems, as they need time and resources to review a project concept note and understand whether it aligns with its own priorities. The secretariat is working with members of the Collaborative Partnership on Forests to more easily transmit funding documents to financing institutions while respecting the priorities of the Governments involved.</p><p>Regarding the Network clearing house, he pointed to the expert groups meetings and various side events focused on that issue. The secretariat is aware of the huge mandate given to it by the Forum and acknowledges that its capacity is 'not sufficient at all' to fulfil its mandate. Thus, it is working closely with all Collaborative Partnership on Forests member organizations and data providers, including International Aid Transparency Initiative, FAO, Global Environmental Facility and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). 'Definitely our work is not going to duplicate their work,' he said. Rather, it will use existing capacity, where it exists, and not reproduce data. 'This is a collaborative exercise.'</p><p>On the proposed project office, he said the first consultation in January was held at a time when the secretariat note was being finalized. Noting that the United Nations set the deadline for document submission, he said the process started late, with the draft memorandum of understanding submitted only one month before the end of 2018. The second consultation was held only three weeks ago. He took note of the request to share information and would consult with the Office of Legal Affairs on that process and precedent.</p><p>Explaining that the Beijing project office would support the capacity development activities of the Network, he said the secretariat is accountable to the Forum on the Network's performance and would report to it on the project office, should it be established. The Beijing office would be considered a United Nations office, meaning that all requisite standards for recruitment, salaries, immunities, privileges and access would be applied. It would operate under the supervision of the secretariat director, and regardless of any changes that might emerge from the Department's reform. Its budget and staffing table are still being discussed, and China would cover the entire cost of the office. The Department's capacity-building office would be in charge of its administration and related matters, including authorizing the allocation of resources and activities.</p><p>The representative of Switzerland said she is still puzzled about share of work between two locations. Switzerland is big contributor to the Network and until matters concerning the office are clear, it will not be able to make any contributions to the trust fund. To encourage donors, all the information must be clear, open and transparent. There can be no expectation of contributions to the Network's fund without having precise lines of communication and understanding of 'who is doing what'. The situation must be sorted very quickly.</p><p>Mr. MOEINI-MEYBODI replied that the secretariat has taken note of the requests to share information on the memorandum of understanding and must seek guidance from the Office of Legal Affairs. 'We'll come back to you hopefully before the end of this session,' he said. 'We are in your hands. Whatever you decide, we will follow,' as there is nothing the secretariat can do without Member State support.</p><p>Mr. RATNAYAKE (Sri Lanka) said one of the biggest challenges facing developing countries is a lack of data. Specific indicators are needed for which data can be collected by forest officers or generated by citizens, he said.</p><p>Ms. WHELAN (Canada) expressed support for the development of the core set of indicators, as well as the relevant explanatory notes. Regarding the flagship publication, she cited several timing challenges and proposed that the latter be launched to coincide with the World Forestry Congress in 2021.</p><p>Mr. VAN OPZEELAND (New Zealand), noting the importance of the expert meeting, said the ability to report accurately and widely on forests is crucial to achieving the sustainable development targets. He voiced support for the development of an iterative set of core indicators, wherein refinements can be added. On the flagship report, he joined Canada's representative in voicing concern about the timing of its release and echoed support for the proposal to launch it at the World Forestry Congress in 2021.</p><p>LEI JINGPIN (China) echoed expressions of support for the development of a core set of indicators. Highlighting some related technical issues, she said 'different indicators have different definitions' which could affect their interpretation and evaluation. The accuracy and availability of data is critical, she said, adding that data can be divided into two categories - namely, quantitative or descriptive. Also underlining the importance of operability, she called for the provision of transparent, scientific means to carry out sustainable forest management.</p><p>Mr. SOUST (Uruguay) said his country is actively preparing its forest mapping, data collection and inventory. It formulated national policies aimed at protecting the nation's forests, which have resulted in positive results. Uruguay is committed to continue such efforts, he said, urging stakeholders to ensure that the relevant data collection tools continue to improve.</p><p>Mr. MAHONEY (Australia), welcoming efforts to support Member States in delivering their national voluntary contributions, asked for Mr. Csoka's input on how the core set of indicators can help define the operational processes related to Tier 3 indicators. Among other things, he agreed with the proposal to launch the flagship publication at the World Forestry Congress and requested more information about efforts to convene an advisory committee on that publication.</p><p>Mr. OGAWA (Japan) said each Member State should be able to share the data in its voluntary national contribution as it chooses, as the purpose of reporting is not to compare the efforts of countries. National reporting should seek to explore progress made, the process should seek to avoid duplication and the reporting burden of countries should be reduced, he said.</p><p>Ms. CORONEL (Ecuador), describing her country's data collection and reporting efforts, underlined the importance of having clear, available data in land use, land planning and other spheres. 'We need an alliance that will enhance cooperation,' she stressed, as well as efforts to democratize new technologies for developing and middle-income countries.</p><p>ERICA DI GIROLAMI of the children and youth major group said voluntary national contributions should include the contributions of young people. Proposing more collaborations with universities, she spotlighted many potential benefits of such partnerships and called for more attention to new technologies and design.</p><p>LISA JANISHEVSKI of the Convention on Biological Diversity Secretariat underlined the importance of aligning sustainable forest management efforts with efforts to achieve the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. Also spotlighting ongoing preparations for the post 2020 biodiversity framework, she said all relevant reporting should make use of data on gross deforestation and other critical issues.</p><p>Panel II</p><p>The Forum then convened the second panel discussion of the day on the theme 'Means of implementation for sustainable forest management'. Moderated by Sibylle Vermont, Senior Scientific Officer at the Federal Office for the Environment of Switzerland, it featured two panelists: Marilyn Headley, Chief Executive officer and Conservator of Forests at the Forestry Department of Jamaica; and Avhashoni Renny Madula, Director of Forestry Regulation and Oversight at the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of South Africa.</p><p>Ms. HEADLEY recounted Jamaica's experience with the Network, explaining that the country completed its national action plan, which dovetails with its climate resilience forest sector plan. The process involved all forest sector stakeholders. The Government also looked at devising a strategic forest financing plan. At the time, the Network had come into play, so Jamaica applied for assistance in devising and implementing its national strategy. The Network approved its request and Jamaica now works with a consultant. It is preparing a concept note that will lead to a project identification form to manage mangroves. By July, it should have its financial strategy in place to implement its national action plan.</p><p>Mr. MADULA said South Africa's situation is strikingly different from that of Jamaica in the sense it only now has started to engage with the Network. It held a stakeholder engagement capacity-building workshop to prepare proposals that it then submitted to multilateral funding agencies. That process had brought together various stakeholders, including a national focal point. While South Africa has resources to ensure implementation of the forest instrument and the United Nations strategic plan on forests, in started a process over the last year to help it improve its data, which involved a review of national forest resource assessment. Two pilot projects were carried out in two districts. 'Sustainable forest management is quite an expensive exercise,' he said, especially in an underperforming economy and budget cuts across the board. It approached the Network for funding that would allow it to scale up those projects.</p><p>When the floor was opened for delegates to share experiences in approaching the Network for funding, the representative of the Philippines said that, for nearly 10 years, sustainable forest management initiatives have been locally funded, often with ODA and funding from the Global Environmental Facility, focused on the provision of technical assistance. It also introduced into its environmental impact assessment system a condition for linking projected carbon generation to offset activities.</p><p>The speaker from the scientific and technological community major group said the Network is restrictive in that it does not extend support to non-State actors, a major stumbling block for major groups. He pressed the secretariat to set up a fund for carrying out such activities and invited donor countries to support the interventions outlined in a work plan produced at a recent expert meeting in Nairobi.</p>", "publisher": "Korea News Gazette", "instances": ["Moderated by Sibylle Vermont, Senior Scientific Officer at the Federal Office for the Environment of Switzerland, it featured two panelists: Marilyn Headley, Chief Executive officer and Conservator of Forests at the Forestry Department of Jamaica; and Avhashoni Renny Madula, Director of Forestry Regulation and Oversight at the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of South Africa.

From the melting of polar ice caps to the meltdown of financial markets, numerous challenges compete for our attention.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With every challenge that arises, however, new opportunities open. What is needed is to expand our field of vision and to act boldly to seize the moment. Now more than ever, we need to come together as a global community and expand our horizons to embrace common solutions to common problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year we have an unprecedented opportunity to address two of the most vexing challenges of our time - climate change and sustainable economic growth. The good news is we can tackle both at once, as solutions to the climate crisis can catalyze the green growth that is the foundation of long-term economic prosperity. Through global green stimulus packages, coupled with a new global climate change agreement to be negotiated in Copenhagen this December, the world has its best chance in decades to make serious progress on both the climate and economic fronts.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Climate change: the defining challenge &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>I have called 2009 \"the year of climate change.\" No issue better demonstrates the need for global solidarity than climate change, the defining challenge of our generation. No issue is more essential to our future survival as a species. And no issue is more fundamental to long-term national security and sustainable prosperity.</p><p>Climate change is now accelerating at a pace and scale that requires urgent attention from the highest levels of government.</p><p>Scientists say the pace of global warming is accelerating. According to evidence presented in March at a major international scientific congress, the window for action on climate change is closing perhaps even faster than had been supposed only two years ago.</p><p>According to these scientists, continued high rates of greenhouse gas emissions are now leading to trajectories at the high end of case scenarios outlined by the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, which remains the scientific standard for climate science. Evidence presented at the congress on ice melt in Greenland, changing dynamics in the polar ice sheets, and increasing warming and acidification of the oceans is deeply disturbing. It heightens the already stark conclusions of the report by the Nobel-prize winning IPCC.</p><p>Unfortunately, time is not on our side. The clock is ticking and cannot be turned back. Carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere today will remain resident for decades, if not centuries. Today's energy investment decisions will lock in the world's emissions profile for years to come. That is why it is crucial we act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Nobel-prize winning IPCC has warned that global emissions need to peak by 2015 and decline thereafter if we hope to keep the global average temperature increase within 2 degrees Celsius, which scientists say is the tipping point to avoid catastrophic damage from climate change.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Impacts and adaptation &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>Climate change affects us all, but it does not affect us all equally. Indeed it is the poorest and most vulnerable members of society - those who have done least to contribute to global warming - who are bearing the brunt of the impact today. For example, between 2000 and 2004, an average of one in 19 people each year living in the developing world was affected by a climate disaster. The comparable figure for OECD countries was one in 1,500 people.</p><p>Climate change is not some distant, futuristic scenario. The number of recorded disasters - where the impact of a natural hazard event overwhelmed coping capacity - has doubled from approximately 200 to over 400 per year over the past two decades. Nine out of every ten disasters recorded are now climate related. Even if no single weather event can be definitively attributed to global warming, the trends cited by the IPCC are clear.</p><p>Millions of people are already suffering from the effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, more frequent and prolonged floods, droughts, more intensive storms, and sea level rises. Hundreds of millions people could be seriously affected if we do not act immediately to reduce emissions and strengthen our resilience to climate change.</p><p>Almost two-thirds of cities with populations greater than five million are in low-lying flood-prone areas. Three-quarters of these are located in flood-prone, densely populated river deltas in Asia or in low-lying small island states. Nearly 634 million people - one tenth of the global population - live in at-risk coastal areas just a few meters above existing sea levels.</p><p>Developing nations will need increased financial support to protect the poorest and most vulnerable from these and numerous other climate-related impacts. But emerging economies and industrialized nations will also have to adapt to climate change. No nation will be immune. Adaptation cannot be seen as an additional expense.</p><p>Indeed, it is an essential investment in our collective future. While we cannot turn back the clock on GHG emissions already in our atmosphere, we can take simple measures today that will reduce their adverse impacts, strengthen community resilience, save lives, and prevent the pauperization of millions.</p><p>We must act quickly given the demands of science and the escalating cost of climate change - in both lives and livelihoods - as already evidenced today. Doing so will not be easy. It will test our maturity as nations and as a global community.</p><p>Leadership at the highest level is now needed to protect the planet, save lives, and build a more sustainable global economy for all. Climate change is much more than environmental issue. It is an energy, finance and security issue. Indeed, it is a Head of State issue.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Sealing a deal in Copenhagen &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>To that end, I urge world leaders to do all they can to see that climate negotiations are pushed forward and accorded top political priority so that we reach agreement on a new climate framework in Copenhagen this December.</p><p>In Copenhagen, the world's governments will meet to seal the deal on a climate change agreement that must be ambitious, fair and effective in reducing emissions while assisting countries as they adapt to the inevitable effects of climate change.</p><p>The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen will be a watershed moment in history. It is the moment where we must transform crisis into opportunity, and set the world on a safer, more prosperous path to green growth.</p><p>Two years ago in Bali, the 192 Parties of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change committed themselves to launching negotiations on strengthened action against climate change. This process is to culminate in an ambitious negotiated outcome at the end of 2009, which needs to enter into force before January 2013.</p><p>This leaves just nine months to conclude one of the most complicated international negotiating processes ever. In order to get all parties to seal a deal, five key political issues must be resolved. First, there must be ambitious, mid-term emission-reduction targets for industrialized countries. Without such targets, developing countries will not have confidence that industrialized countries are willing to take the lead on solving a problem that they did most to cause.</p><p>Second, major developing countries will need to define the extent of mitigation actions they are willing to undertake beyond what they are already doing. Third, coming to resolution on the question of finance is crucial. We need clarity on how the significant financial resources will be generated to help developing countries both limit the growth of their emissions and adapt to the effects of climate change. A variety of tools can be used, including emissions trading and market-based mechanisms as well as inter-governmental assistance. Fourth, there needs to be an efficient institutional mechanism for disbursing these funds and an equitable, accountable governance structure.</p><p>And lastly, an ambitious adaptation framework must be established that will bolster the climate resilience of vulnerable countries and protect lives and livelihoods.</p><p>The benefits of sealing a deal in Copenhagen will last for generations. With an agreement in hand, governments and businesses will have the signals needed to unleash investments in green technologies and clean energy. By sealing a deal, we can power green growth today and protect our planet for our children and their children to come.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; National stimulus packages: Catalyzing green growth &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>Of course, the climate crisis is not the only challenge confronting us. The economic crisis has sapped our confidence and caused millions to fear for their jobs, their homes, and even their next meal. The global recession unfortunately has caused some to cast doubt on the wisdom of tackling climate change with the urgency and resources required.</p><p>I take precisely the opposite view. Today's financial crisis is not an excuse for inaction on climate change. To the contrary, it represents an unprecedented opportunity to redirect government stimulus packages into green energy options and to fundamentally retool our global economy so that long-term, sustainable growth is accessible for all.</p><p>In my travels, I am heartened to see that the path to a greener, lower-carbon future already is being forged in dozens of countries, including the Republic of Korea. From investments in renewable energy and flex fuel vehicles to reforestation, countries everywhere are realizing that green is not an option, but an imperative for recharging their economies and creating millions of jobs.</p><p>Fiscal stimulus packages now being proposed to jumpstart economic recovery are a critically important tool for greening the global economy. </p><p>No nation has shown more commitment to pursuing this low-carbon path via national stimulus packages than the Republic of Korea. Some 80 percent of its $38 billion fiscal stimulus package is dedicated to green measures, the highest percentage in the world. Under full implementation, this represents an investment equal to some 3 percent of gross domestic product. The Republic's commitment to greening its economy represents nothing less than a fundamental shift in its approach to building the nation's prosperity.</p><p>In total, nearly one million green jobs will be created over the next four years, including:</p><p>n A $7 billion investment in mass transit and railways is expected to generate 138,000 jobs. </p><p>n The $5.8 billion in energy conservation in villages and schools - 170,000 jobs</p><p>n More than $1.7 billion in forest restoration stimulus - over 130,000 jobs</p><p>n $690 million in water resource management stimulus - over 16,000 jobs</p><p>n $10 billion investment in river restoration will generate nearly 200,000 jobs</p><p>The world is also looking to the Republic of Korea to demonstrate leadership in another key area of climate action: emission reductions. As a powerful emerging economy, the Republic of Korea can serve as bridge between industrialized and developing countries by setting ambitious emission reductions goals for itself.</p><p>In this way, the Republic of Korea will again serve as an influential model for other emerging economies and help pave the path toward an agreement in Copenhagen.</p><p>Of course, the Republic of Korea is not the only nation to jumpstart green growth through its national stimulus packages. China, Japan, the United States, Brazil and others have launched similar efforts.</p><p>China is expected to spend $586 billion on a fiscal stimulus package, of which an estimated $140 billion is earmarked for green investments. Its green investment package is likely to boost further its $17 billion renewable energy sector, which already employs some one million people.</p><p>Of the more than $800 billion in stimulus spending in the United States, some $100 billion is directed toward greening the economy, including investments in public transport and energy efficiency, nearly $20 billion for renewable energy and $11 billion to modernize the electrical grid. An estimated 2.5 million green jobs will be generated.</p><p>All this and more is needed. These stimulus investments represent a once in a generation opportunity to power green growth today and to move toward a lower-carbon, resource efficient society tomorrow.</p><p>While the amounts invested may seem large, when set against the $300 billion a year the world currently spends on energy subsidies - the vast majority for fossil fuel sources - it is clear we have a long way to go. By far the largest amount is spent by developing economies with subsidies in 20 non-OECD countries totaling $220 billion.</p><p>Cancelling these subsidies would reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by as much as 6 percent and add 0.1 percent to global GDP, according to the United Nations Environment Programme. The financial savings could also be redirected to investments in clean energy R&amp;D, renewable energy development and energy conservation, further boosting economies and employment.</p><p>&lt;b&gt; Power green growth, protect the planet &lt;/b&gt;&lt;p&gt;</p><p>We can transform the climate crisis into a catalyst for launching the green economy of the 21st century. Given the quickening pace of global warming, we may not have another chance.</p><p>The recent economic crisis has shown we need a new path - a more sustainable, energy efficient, and lower-carbon path. The United Nations will do its utmost to help Member States along this path, and is fully committed to supporting countries as they implement both existing and future climate agreements. We must work together to seal a deal in Copenhagen and catalyze the green economy of the future. The science demands it, the world economy needs it, and the livelihoods of hundreds of millions of people depend on it. Together, we can power green growth and protect the planet.</p><p>By Ban Ki-moon/United Nations Secretary-General</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["A variety of tools can be used, including emissions trading and market-based mechanisms as well as inter-governmental assistance.
