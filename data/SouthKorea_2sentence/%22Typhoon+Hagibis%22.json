Typhoons, which pack higher winds than other tropical storms, often kill five to 10 people per event and destroy infrastructure.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But for the past three years Taiwan and the Philippines, an archipelago to its south, have missed their historical average typhoon counts because of high water temperatures over the mid-Pacific where typhoons originate and shifts in upper-atmosphere winds, meteorologists believe.</p><p>The Philippines can get up to 20 of the raging storms per year.
