To do so, there should be more active climate diplomacy between the two countries, he added.Mohieldin, who is also serving as UN Special Envoy on Financing the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda, was in Songdo, Incheon to attend the 36th meeting of the Green Climate Fund Board from July 10 to 13 to discuss 12 funding proposals and the GCF's 2024-2027 strategic plan.In 2022, the Ministry of Economy and Finance of Korea made its first contribution to the Adaptation Fund, aimed at assisting developing countries to adapt to the impacts of climate change. The contribution plan was announced during a high-level contributor dialogue held on Nov. 15, 2022, on the sidelines of the COP27 UN Climate Summit in Egypt.Under this plan, the Korean government pledged to provide a total of 3.6 billion won ($2.8 million) to the Adaptation Fund over the next three years, starting in 2023. The fund amounts to 1.2 billion won annually.In addition, during a bilateral summit between Egypt and Korea in January last year, the two countries reached an agreement to enhance collaboration in digital and green infrastructure projects and focus on initiatives in ICT-based smart transport, eco-friendly energy solutions and advancements in education.The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on financial cooperation through the Economic Development Cooperation Fund that outlines their commitment to allocate $1 billion for joint projects from 2022 to 2026.The Korean government has set a national target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent compared to 2018 levels by 2030, aligning with the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit temperature increases to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. In line with this commitment, Korea has expressed its willingness to engage in bilateral climate arrangements with other governments to establish collaborative foundations for conducting emissions reduction projects abroad.When asked why he believes Korea would be able to reduce fossil fuel dependency up to 60 percent by 2030, Mohieldin pointed to Korea's impressive transformation fueled by investments in human capital, advanced infrastructure, and a strategic shift away from the hydrocarbon sector as factors.'Korea has at least sufficient elements in one of the factors of change -- technology, and is not very constrained in another factor -- finance,' said Mohieldin, touting Korea\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds private sector finance and investment in technology, education, and digitalization as driving forces for an emerging green ecosystem.'That's why I'm placing my bet,' stressed MohieldinHe also urged Asia's fourth-largest economy to encourage its private sector to invest in Egypt, calling it an attractive market that has cohesive trade relations with neighboring countries in the region.On widening gap between advanced and developing countries in clean energy financing, he called for better collaborations to foster a sustainable future.'We need to tackle emissions, adaptation, loss, and damage holistically,' Mohieldin stated, underscoring the interconnected nature of climate issues.He outlined finance, technology, and behavioral change as three key elements for transformative change, acknowledging funding commitments beyond the previously agreed $100 billion.'One trillion dollars is required, and this is excluding China,' said Mohieldin, suggesting an estimate of investment needed to combat climate change.</p><p/>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["The fund amounts to 1. 2 billion won annually.

", "published": "2021-11-22", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference -- or COP26 -- world leaders gathered for two weeks in Glasgow to check the progress of the nationally determined contributions and reaffirm their commitments for climate change transition. Although there are equivocal attitudes to its outcome and some unsatisfied groups, the global leaders in public and private sectors have made leaping progress if we recall how Kyoto Protocol rolled out in the end. The COP26 will be remembered as the most important milestone in climate change transition in the years to come.COP26 has several breakthrough agreements. First, nearly 200 countries agreed to end inefficient fossil fuel subsidies. </p><p>Second, around 110 countries signed up to the Global Methane Pledge for the first time. Lastly, the world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds two biggest emitters -- the United States and China -- shook hands for climate cooperation. There are other significant outcomes such as a carbon market rulebook, India\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds commitment and financial sector\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds active role which will move forward the science-based approaches. By far, most people agree that this was a major departure and an important step change.What Net zero really means for businessCompanies that diligently tracked climate change issues would know that net zero was discussed most vibrantly throughout the event. As nations announced their NDC progress, both public and private sector recognized that even with the current targets, the world would still face above 2 degrees Celsius increase. Therefore, efforts to tackle global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 1.5 degrees Celsius until 2050 has been reinstated by emphasizing net zero.At COP26, 74 countries which account for more than 80 percent of global GDP and 70 percent of global CO2 emissions made commitments for net zero. More than 3,000 global companies showed their commitments to the UN\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Race to Zero campaign. South Korea was remarked as one of the most ambitious goal-setter with the revised NDC of 40 percent reduction target. Global business leaders agree that net zero is now the new standard, a new organizing principle for businesses. However, what happens after making the commitment? What does it really mean when it comes to business decisions? What should CEOs do in 2022? According to McKinsey &amp; Co.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds analysis, companies must now accomplish 200 years of work in a condensed period of 30 years. There are industry differences, but the transition to net zero will require the largest reallocation of capital for most companies. In the midst of supply challenges in procuring green materials and utilizing green infrastructure, how can business leader manage and deliver proper ESG performance?Pledge, plan and performNet zero is not an easy or a short-term task. It requires strong commitment due to short-term losses. Some headwinds in the aftermath of COP26 was the criticism that goals were too ambitious and unrealistic. Many climate change experts in South Korea also expressed doubts when large Korean multinational companies made pledges for net zero by 2050 this year. The concerns mostly come from the production sites because of the huge cost and the huge chains of suppliers who are not ready to burden the cost and risk transition-led technical challenges. Especially without detailed action plans, pledges to net zero only becomes a timely marketing blurb which can cause companies to face investor risks from greenwashing. Therefore, what companies must now do is to put the detailed action plans into the net zero pledges. The commitment should now turn to specific steps for net zero. The United Kingdom Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak reassured at the COP26 that the UK Treasury would require UK-listed companies to release net zero plans by 2023. ESG and climate change transition standards tend to follow the practices of top-notch pursuers. Other countries will likely follow how governments engage with the private sector in disclosing and reporting ESG practices. Experts say that the basis of competition in the current times changed, and there is a premium on having a well-planned net zero road map and efficient execution. Therefore, whether it be by regulative pressure or competitive force to gain a sustainability advantage, global companies must dedicate a meaningful volume of corporate resources to aligning net zero goals with action and company performance. Net zero strategy will reflect company\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds true ESG valueMany shouted concerns and doubts about the 2021 COP26\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds outcome around net zero. There is no easy nor quick solution. But companies that build and execute bet zero strategies will accumulate sustainability advantage in the long run. In the ESG era where risks are harder to define and predict, companies must integrate strategic perspectives to the existing compliance and risk management scheme. This means business leaders must simultaneously look ahead for the changeable ESG and climate change risks with the current strategic direction of the company. Eventually, the three Ps -- pledge, plan and perform -- will be essential factors that reflect the key ESG value to the customers, stakeholders, and society because each process will reflect company\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds consistency, robustness and grit, and most importantly, company\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds integrity. Remember that what the company intended to say or do does not always equate to how it is perceived. Delivering a consistent and clear ESG message in the net zero strategy that integrates compliance and strategy along other upcoming transition risks will be the critical sustainability advantage beyond 2022 for business leaders.

Multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization, the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations agencies have long been unpopular among much of the public for supposedly encroaching on national sovereignty. </p><p>But then US President Donald Trump came along and made international cooperation well-nigh impossible.

International cooperation is a far more effective way to investigate local disease outbreaks and warn of global dangers; coordinate research, development, production, and distribution of vaccines or treatments; and agree on procedures for restricting or quarantining cross-border travelers. The WHO is not perfect, but it is obviously needed now.Likewise, global climate change is the archetypal global externality. A ton of carbon dioxide emitted anywhere has the same greenhouse effect everywhere. National regulation cannot by itself correct the misalignment of incentives, owing to the free-rider problem across governments. Hence the need for an international accord like the 2015 Paris climate agreement.Biden and other world leaders must also tackle the deepest global recession since the 1930s. Beyond measures to address the pandemic itself, advanced economies must agree above all on joint fiscal stimulus, as they did at the 1978 Bonn summit of G-7 leaders and at the 2009 G-20 meetings under the leadership of the United Kingdom\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds then-Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.The IMF recently estimated that if those G-20 countries with the greatest fiscal space simultaneously increased infrastructure spending by 0.5 percent of gross domestic product in 2021 and 1 percent of GDP in subsequent years -- and if those with more limited fiscal space invested one-third of that -- they could lift global GDP by nearly 2 percent by 2025, compared with a boost of just below 1.2 percent under an unsynchronized fiscal approach.A coordinated fiscal expansion (with substantial funds spent, one hopes, on green infrastructure investment and the fight against COVID-19) would thus help to ensure a faster global recovery of GDP and employment, and minimize the danger of a W-shaped recession.Moreover, a simultaneous stimulus need not adversely affect any G-20 country\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds trade balance.With interest rates near zero, the US and other advanced economies do not feel constrained in their ability to borrow, even as debt-to-GDP ratios rise. But emerging-market and developing economies -- especially those that already had unsustainable debt burdens before the pandemic struck -- have much less room to maneuver.Many EMDEs will need to have their debts restructured. Until now, the international community\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds response has mostly consisted of the G-20\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Debt Service Suspension Initiative, which was limited in scope. The scheme kicked the can down the road by merely postponing (as opposed to reducing) debt-service obligations, and it did not include private debt.The world\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds largest economies must urgently lead and coordinate on this issue. G-20 leaders recognized at their Nov. 21-22 summit that DSSI-eligible countries need more than bilateral official debt relief. But they made little tangible progress.Moreover, many African countries worry that well-intentioned efforts at coordinated debt restructuring will hurt their ability to continue accessing international capital markets. The poorest countries also need new concessional loans and grants. Proposals are back on the table to issue a new tranche of Special Drawing Rights (the IMF\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds reserve asset) and to direct the liquidity to emerging markets.On trade, many Democrats will urge Biden to continue to pursue some of Trump\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds objectives, but to work with US allies rather than against them. One such goal is to reduce the need for foreign corporations to share proprietary technology with domestic partners as the price of access to China\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds market.An intelligent US strategy might have been to stay in the Trans-Pacific Partnership and hold out to China the prospect of someday joining if it followed the rules, which were written mostly by America. The other TPP countries have gone ahead without the US, which could still catch up by rejoining.But it may be too late for that. While the US was sleeping, China organized its own Asia-Pacific trade bloc, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership. At this point, straightforward reciprocal tariff cuts may be a more promising option for the US than messy and hard-to-enforce \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bddeep integration.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdRecent high-level appointments to the incoming Biden administration are committed internationalists. The US will presumably allow the WTO to function again. But international trade agreements are unlikely to be high on its list of priorities, and committed devotees of the open rules-based trading system will have to recalibrate their ambitions. Furthermore, America\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds friends and allies have lost some of their enthusiasm for letting it conduct the international orchestra. But, at a minimum, they will be happy to have it back as an important and constructive player.Jeffrey FrankelJeffrey Frankel is professor of capital formation and growth at Harvard University. -- Ed.(Project Syndicate)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["5 percent of gross domestic product in 2021 and 1 percent of GDP in subsequent years -- and if those with more limited fiscal space invested one-third of that -- they could lift global GDP by nearly 2 percent by 2025, compared with a boost of just below 1. 2 percent under an unsynchronized fiscal approach.

It offers the possibility of a double benefit -- discouraging harmful activities, while also providing the government with revenue.Take sin taxes. Taxes on alcohol make it more expensive to get drunk, which reduces binge drinking and impaired driving. At the same time, they provide state and local governments with billions of dollars of revenue. </p><p>Tobacco taxes, which generate more than twice as much, have proven instrumental in the decline of smoking, which has saved millions of lives.Taxes can also be an important tool for environmental protection, and many economists say taxing carbon would be the best way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Economic theory says that unlike income or sales taxes, carbon taxes can actually increase economic efficiency; because companies that pump carbon dioxide into the sky don't pay the costs of the climate change they cause, carbon taxes would restore the proper incentives to the market.In reality, carbon taxes alone won't be enough to halt global warming, but they would be a useful part of any climate plan. What's more, the revenue from this tax, which would probably be hundreds of billions of dollars per year, could be handed out to citizens as a dividend or used to fund green infrastructure projects.Then there are those who want to use taxes to discourage excessive trading in financial markets, while extracting revenue from Wall Street. Economic theory suggests that much of the frantic trading that characterizes modern financial markets could be a waste of resources -- traders trying to beat each other to the punch by milliseconds, but not ultimately helping companies to invest more efficiently or helping investors to allocate risk. Leaders such as presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders have proposed a tax on financial transactions in order to curb such excessive trading. Sanders has also promised to use the revenue from the tax to pay for free college and student debt cancellation.Similarly, a wealth tax has been put forward as a way to reduce inequality while raising revenue. Sanders, like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, has proposed taxing large fortunes at very high rates -- up to 8 percent of total wealth per year for people with over $10 billion, in Sanders's plan. The revenue from this tax, which Sanders predicts will be over $4 trillion per decade, would be earmarked for housing, child care, health care and other government benefits. If you believe, as many do, that wealth inequality is inherently bad, then these taxes improve society while also swelling government coffers.But here's the thing: These sorts of taxes -- which economists call Pigouvian taxes, after the British economist Arthur Pigou -- involve an inherent trade-off. Raising taxes on alcohol or financial transactions above a certain point will discourage the thing being taxed so much that it actually reduces the amount of revenue raised. At that point, legislators have to decide what the ultimate goal is: deterring behavior or bringing in more funds.In the case of financial transactions, even a modest tax can cause trading volumes to fall substantially, especially for derivatives. Sweden taxed stock trading at a 0.5 percent rate in the 1980s -- the same rate Sanders proposes. But the tax raised only a small percent of the expected revenue, partly because of a dramatic decrease in trading of assets such as bond derivatives. France, Germany, Japan, Australia, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and Sweden have all eliminated or reduced their financial transaction taxes in recent years, thanks to disappointing revenue numbers. The UK's tax has raised more revenue, but still not close to what Sanders projects. Only a few small international financial hubs like Switzerland have managed anything close to those numbers. So a financial transactions tax might eliminate a lot of wasted effort in the finance industry, but it's unlikely to be a big revenue source.Very high wealth taxes also have the potential to kill the proverbial goose, or at least shrink it substantially. A 2015 study of Swedish households found that the wealthiest 0.01 percent earned less than a 5 percent annualized pretax excess return on their wealth between 2000 and 2007. In an environment of permanently low interest rates, that suggests that Sanders's wealth tax -- which is 5 percent for fortunes of $1 billion to $2.5 billion and even higher for bigger fortunes -- would shrink billionaires' wealth steadily over time, even before accounting for the devastating effect it would have on stock and real-estate values. That's good news if you believe, as Sanders does, that billion-dollar fortunes shouldn't exist. But it means that high revenues in the early years of a wealth tax probably couldn't be sustained over the long term.The biggest downside of Pigouvian taxation, however, might be political. Governments could become dependent on the continued existence of the things that the taxes were designed to discourage.Consider carbon taxes. In order to prevent catastrophic climate change, the world needs to eliminate carbon emissions, not just curb them somewhat. This will require switching entirely to carbon-free energy sources and industrial processes. But if governments are dependent on carbon taxes for a substantial fraction of their yearly tax revenue, making this switch would result in either big deficits or severe spending cuts. This could make governments very wary about full decarbonization.Thus, taxing bad things has its drawbacks. The inherent trade-off between discouraging something and making money off of it, as well as the danger of becoming fiscally dependent on the continued existence of social ills, means that Pigouvian taxes aren't quite the perfect policy that their proponents imagine.By Noah SmithNoah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. -- Ed.(Bloomberg)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["Economic theory says that unlike income or sales taxes, carbon taxes can actually increase economic efficiency; because companies that pump carbon dioxide into the sky don't pay the costs of the climate change they cause, carbon taxes would restore the proper incentives to the market.

Governments around the world are racing to promote environmentally friendly industries, technologies and jobs. \"Green\" has become a keyword of major economic policies and an indispensible term for social issues.</p><p>Infrastructure construction, which once represented development without considering the environment, is no exception. The New Economics Foundation of Britain has proposed the \"Green New Deal\" initiative to overcome the triple crunch of the credit crisis, climate change and the energy crisis. Green infrastructure is a representative policy for the Green New Deal which simultaneously pursues environmental protection and growth. The term of green infrastructure has been used since the mid-1990s to emphasize the importance of protecting the natural environment in land development. Combined with the green growth concept, the term now has a broader meaning referring to new infrastructure businesses that underpin sustainable development and future growth engines. From the intellectual transportation system to smart grids, to smart highways and to green buildings, green infrastructure mitigates greenhouse gas emissions, minimizes the impact of development on the natural environment and drives new growth by utilizing and converging information and communications technology, biotechnology and nanotechnology.</p><p>Governments have pursued policies for sustainable and environmentally-friendly infrastructure for a long time. But those policies were tied to the somewhat passive objectives of reducing environmental destruction in the process of development. New green infrastructure policy is based on a fundamentally different perspective. It looks to a positive harmony between the environment and growth. As such, recent government investments in infrastructure aimed at overcoming the economic crisis are focusing on green infrastructure businesses. Renewable energies, green homes and smart grids take the lion's share of expansionary fiscal expenditures across the world. The United States, for example, earmarked 10.4 percent of its stimulus spending for investment in energy efficiency, renewable energy such as wind power and green energy industries. China's planned investment in wind, solar and other renewable energy sources makes up 37.8 percent of the state outlay to boost the economy.</p><p>Green infrastructure policy</p><p>Korea's green infrastructure policy started in earnest with the low-carbon, green growth initiative which the government adopted in August 2008. The government unveiled the Green New Deal policy in January 2009 promising to invest 50 trillion won and create 956,000 new jobs. Top on the list were green infrastructure projects involving green living space (homes, offices, schools, rivers and streams), the cleanup and renovation of four major rivers, environmentally friendly mid- and small-sized dams, green transportation, renewable energy and green information networks. Green infrastructure figured prominently in other national initiatives such as the strategy to promote new growth engine businesses.</p><p>The policy goal of green infrastructure can be summarized as \"the development of new growth engines that prop up green growth.\" The government has set four policy directions to achieve the goal - a transport system with less carbon emissions, developing clean energy to replace fossil fuels, boosting efficiency and safety through new technologies, and fostering new growth engines based on green technology.</p><p>1) Low-emissions transport system: Korea is focusing its emissions mitigation efforts on the transportation sector, in which the nation registered twice as fast an emissions growth as the OECD average. As for automobiles, which account for 78 percent of the emissions by Korea's transport industry, the government is working to speed up the commercialization of electric vehicles and build the necessary infrastructure. Korea's latest standards of fuel efficiency (more than 17 kilometers per liter) and its emissions ceiling (less than 140 grams per kilometer) set in July 2009 are stricter than those of the United States. The government plans to apply the regulations to all vehicles by 2015. It is also implementing various measures to ease congestion, aiming to reduce emissions by an estimated 310,000 tons per year. For example, the transport authorities are expanding the wireless toll payment system Hi-pass, providing drivers with traffic information through intelligent transportation systems and allowing driving on hard shoulders during peak hours. On the side of supply, the government is promoting novel road construction technology less dependent on carbon-heavy materials such as cement, concrete, steel and asphalt.</p><p>The government is also seeking to make ports green by expanding the use of railways and marine transport for moving freight to and from ports, increasing use of renewable energy in handling cargo, promoting eco-friendly disposal and recycling of ocean wastes, developing port waterfronts and enhancing safety measures against the effects of climate change.</p><p>2) Clean energy alternatives to fossil fuels: Countries are waging cutthroat competition to take the lead in developing clean energy based on solar, wind, tidal and geothermal power. Advanced countries have already consolidated their presence in renewable energy industries through huge state spending on research and development. Korea, lagging behind in technology and production capabilities, is strategically focusing on areas in which the latecomer can take advantage of its natural environment. For example, Korea's relatively large tidal range offers favorable conditions for tidal power generation. A tidal power generation plant is under construction around Sihwa Lake. With the world's largest capacity of 254,000 kilowatts, the facility will be completed by the end of 2010 to meet the electricity needs of 500,000 people.</p><p>Clean energy development still confronts many hurdles. Installation of solar panels and construction of wind power plants require vast sizes of landmass and space, and could damage the natural environment. For example, building wind power complexes around mountain peaks could destroy forests. Tidal power plants also could degenerate marine eco-systems. Ethanol extraction for eco-friendly automobile fuels could result in massive destruction of Amazon forests. In addition, clean energy is still far behind fossil-based energy in terms of economic value. Its unit costs of development are high and its energy output efficiency is low. So, the promotion of development of clean energy requires massive financial support from governments.</p><p>In this regard, the Korean government is directing its clean energy efforts toward minimizing the impact on the natural environment, overcoming deficiencies in technology and production capabilities, raising the technological localization rates and improving economic efficiency of green energy sources.</p><p>3) Higher safety and efficiency through new technologies: This is the core future-oriented policy direction for green infrastructure. Backed by advanced information and communications technology and infrastructure, Korea has a competitive edge in this area. By harnessing its novel technologies, the nation can reduce costs in meeting green infrastructure needs, which otherwise would cost a lot.</p><p>Moreover, the increasing frequency and scale of natural disasters resulting from global warming and earthquakes has raised public awareness of the environment and heightened demand for infrastructure that is safer and more environmentally friendly.</p><p>Projects aimed to boost efficiency of existing facilities, such as smart grids and intelligent water leakage control, will save considerable costs and reduce energy consumption, thus contributing to fighting global warming. A smart grid system applies information technology to existing electricity networks. Through two-way communication between power suppliers and consumers, it enables homes and factories to use electricity at off-peak hours. Ground was broken on the world's largest open test bed complex for the system on Jeju Island in August 2009. The center will be a cornerstone for the nation's plan to commercialize and export smart grid and related technologies, as well as provide the chance to promote Korea's advanced green infrastructure technology worldwide.</p><p>Other examples include the \"mobile harbor\" system poised to change the conventional location pattern of seaports which require deep waters. \"Fog cannon\" technology for controlling fog and air pollutants can be applied to diverse uses, including helping the operations of airplanes, extinguishing forest fires and cleaning up the atmosphere in specific areas.</p><p>4) Fostering new growth engines based on green technology: The government hopes to develop green technology in the above-mentioned areas into the nation's next-generation growth engines. The 17 new growth engine businesses announced in May 2009 included six green technology sectors - renewable energy, low-carbon energy, sophisticated water treatment, LED applications, green transportation and green cities.</p><p>Green infrastructure strategies</p><p>Green infrastructure is a new policy paradigm which is vital not only to overcoming the current economic crisis but also to coping with looming environmental and energy crises, and pursuing sustainable economic development. In the recent G20 Low-carbon Competitiveness Report published by Third Generation Environmentalism, a British think tank, Korea ranked 4th in the low-carbon competitiveness index. The report citied \"the highest level of high-technology exports, the most efficient electricity transmission network, high rates of investment in physical capital, and low rates of depletion of natural capital.\" But the nation placed 15th in the low-carbon improvement index and 8th in the low-carbon gap index, which measures the difference between the current and target indices. The government said, \"The high ranking in low-carbon competitiveness reflects the strong potential of Korea's green industries and technology, and the government's determination to develop them. But the low positions in improvement and gap indices showed that Korea still has room to make much more effort in comparison to its capacity to reduce emissions.\" The comment indicated the government's firm commitment to a consistent and more active green growth drive.</p><p>For a successful green infrastructure policy, the Korean government is advised to consider the following strategies:</p><p>First, the government needs to set clear and detailed policy goals embodying \"green\" and \"growth\" visions. Clearly stated goals relating to, for instance, emissions cuts, improvement of infrastructure service and contribution to economic growth, will give a clear definition to the concept of green infrastructure and facilitate the achievement of those goals.</p><p>Second, green infrastructure requires a proper division of roles and a close cooperation between the pubic and private sectors. Private businesses should lead the way in developing green infrastructure, which is entirely based on creative technologies. But technological innovation has a high level of risks. So, the government should play a role of minimizing the risks while staying vigilant against possible moral hazards. The government needs to strategically select and concentrate support on projects that best satisfy the standards of feasibility, effect, growth potential and appropriateness of state support.</p><p>Third, projects to improve efficiency of supply and maintenance of existing infrastructure facilities deserve more emphasis. Changing methods of supply and maintenance of existing infrastructure can reduce costs, improve services and deter demands for new infrastructure construction. This will help slash greenhouse gas emissions and significantly save state spending on infrastructure.</p><p>In conclusion, the green infrastructure policy will contribute to the nation's economic recovery and creation of green jobs. Green technology know-how obtained through the process will also boost exports and sustain economic growth by providing the nation with solid ground in new markets created by global responses to climate change, including the Clean Development Mechanism and the cap-and-trade system.</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["Infrastructure construction, which once represented development without considering the environment, is no exception.

Currently, renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, accounts for just 2 percent of the country??s electricity production, while coal-fired power plants generate about 40 percent and nuclear reactors 30 percent. The <person><nameText>Moon Jae-in </nameText></person>administration is making a strong push for renewables, aiming to raise its share to 20 percent by 2030, which sparked concerns from some industries and experts. </p><p>However, Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, World Wide Fund for Nature??s leader of climate and energy practice, said with confidence that South Korea should take bolder approaches and aim for 100 percent renewables by 2050. ??We should not think about limits of the current context because we are talking about a mission that is going to work jointly with future trends of industry, markets, consumers, technology, innovation and more,?? he said in an interview with The Korea Herald on Wednesday. Pulgar-Vidal chaired the UN climate talks through 2014, culminating in the Lima Accord on climate change, which laid the foundations for the 2015 Paris Agreement.On a three day visit here, he delivered a keynote speech at the Korea Energy Vision 2050 forum hosted by WWF-Korea, during which various future energy scenarios were introduced. Among them was a proposal for Seoul prepared and presented jointly by WWF-Korea and leading experts including professors from Seoul National University. The report includes a roadmap for Korea to achieve 100 percent renewable energy, reduce energy consumption levels by 24 percent and slash greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent by 2050. ??Fortunately, Korea has already begun to take a leading approach like phasing out the coal powered plant, but the current reduction targets are considered insufficient to meet the global goals outlined in the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep warming below 1.5 degree Celsius,?? said Pulgar-Vidal.He also stressed that a clean energy transition can offer a major opportunity for new jobs and economic growth for Korea.??With more people concerned about job security, industrial development does not have to only involve gray or brown infrastructure. Korea should rethink green infrastructure, which is effective, economical and also enhances community safety and quality of life with better health and well-being.??With the expansion of the green infrastructure, renewable energy sectors will generate better quality jobs, he said. According to WWF??s report, the rate of employment in renewable energy sectors has been rapidly growing, with almost 10 million jobs newly created globally in 2016.Pulgar-Vidal said Korea is well positioned to be a major player in this fast growing sector, with a strong workforce and advanced technologies.??It is the government??s role to raise importance of such narrative to people and explain what it is to work for climate change.??He added that a future prosperity will be heavily dependent on a secure and affordable energy supply, and because South Korea lacks domestic energy reserves, it should turn its eye to expanding domestic renewable energy sector, shifting away its heavy dependence on imports. The BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2016 showed that South Korea was the world??s ninth-largest energy consumer in 2015, relying 98 percent of fossil fuel consumption on imports. To promote social acceptance for a safe and sustainable energy transition, Vidal said Korea should first raise public awareness on energy consequences.??There have been barriers to overcome including a lack of public understanding and awareness, as well as policy uncertainty,?? he said, adding that the public need for a safe and sustainable energy transition is ??greater than ever before.????We need to avoid the selfish approach (when tackling the climate change issue) because it is about achieving more solidarity. So if we are able to recognize that we are individuals living in a common planet, we should change the way of thinking.??By Kim Da-sol (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ddd@heraldcorp.com\">ddd@heraldcorp.com</email>)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["?

Under plans to reduce fine dust and build green infrastructure for urbanities, set by the KFS last year, the government agency is going to create at least one urban forest in each of the 17 metropolitan cities and provinces across the country starting this year. In addition, the agency is planning to create an additional 60 hectares of forests in the vicinity of facilities that dislodge fine dust particles, to help reduce emissions. The plans include measures to plant more than two rows of roadside trees and create as many green spaces as possible in idle sites in schools, like rooftops and walls. </p><p>'The main point of the plan is to smoothly connect the forests within the cities with naturally created forests outside the cities,' a KFS official said. 'When the cold wind from outside the cities flows into the urban areas, the wind road (baramgil) created along the forests will help eliminate fine dust particles and the urban heat island effect.' The role of forestry in reducing fine dust emissions has been enhanced in recent years. Due to rapid urbanization and overpopulation in cities since the 1980s, green spaces where people can rest amid clean air have been significantly reduced. Lack of green areas in cities and increasing use of fossil fuels, asphalt and cement have contributed to city temperatures rising 1 to 3 degrees Celsius compared to noncity areas and wind speeds declining 20 to 25 percent, leading to the urban heat island effect and unusual heat waves. The KFS has made constant efforts to increase urban forests since the early 2000s. In 2003, the agency started turning some state-owned areas in cities into forests. In 2005, it began creating forests in municipalities. As of 2017, the area of urban forest per capita was expanded to 10.07 square meters, surpassing the 9 square meters recommended by the World Health Organization. The benefits of urban forests are widely felt by citizens, including easing the fine dust problem, according to the KFS. Both fine dust and ultra-fine dust particles sit on tree leaves during the process of photosynthesis. While the pores of tree leaves absorb carbon dioxide and emit oxygen, dust particles accumulate on the surfaces of leaves. The average concentration of fine dust within urban forests turned out to be 25.6 percent lower than that of central city areas, according to a survey by the National Institute of Forest Science, conducted from April through May in 2017. The concentration of ultra-fine dust was 40.9 percent lower. 'The KFS will further strengthen the function of urban forests and forestry in decreasing fine dust by systematically managing the ecosystem of forests in and out of cities,' the KFS official said. The agency is planning to replace trees on the peripheries of urban forests with types of trees that are highly absorbent of dust. For forests outside of cities, the agency will improve the filtering function of air pollutants by securing sufficient wind roads through pruning and thinning. The KFS will soon legislate the creation, utilization and management of urban forests. It will also encourage businesses and citizens to participate in projects related to creating urban forests.'Having more forests near residential areas will not only help address the fine dust issue but also prepare against climate change,' the official said. 'Urban forests will also generate economic effects by driving up real estate prices of nearby areas and contribute to improving the quality of life of residents and raising competitiveness of cities.'

Ferraro] Start preparing for the next Hurricane Harvey ", "published": "2017-08-30", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">My heart goes out to the people who have borne the brunt of Hurricane Harvey and still face continued flooding and a long recovery. As a nation, we need to be better prepared for such catastrophic floods so as to mitigate their widespread damage and loss of life. Harvey??s 50 inches of rain in a few days might be unusual, but extensive flooding with its subsequent property damage and loss of life is not.It?</p><p>?s time to stop using the words ??unprecedented?? or ??one in a pick-your-large-number-year flood?? to fool ourselves into believing that we??re experiencing one-off disasters that can??t be defended against. We have the tools to prepare, if we??re bold enough to use them.First, stop building and rebuilding in areas that experience repeated floods. This requires political backbone both locally and nationally, because the incentives involved are misaligned. Local governments set zoning rules and collect the property taxes, and local builders profit from construction. But neither of these groups pays for rebuilding after a flood. Taxpayers elsewhere do, through state and federal disaster assistance.Texas?? relatively lax zoning laws and building codes have helped keep housing prices low and the population growing. But this shifts the full costs of building onto others. To help align local and national incentives, the federal government should publish a list of the local governments that allow or encourage building in flood zones.Second, manage storm-water runoff by investing in green infrastructure and traditional engineered controls (such as detention ponds), and cut back on surfaces that are impervious to water. Harris County, Texas, where Houston is located, has underinvested in such improvements, even though it experiences repeated floods. As its population has grown, the county has lost a substantial amount of its wetlands, which traditionally soaked up storm-water runoff. The county compounded this loss by allowing unrestricted expansion of impervious surfaces.Third, discourage the two behaviors that cause problems in flood-prone areas: widespread refusal to buy flood insurance, and a general unwillingness to evacuate. Only about one in 10 homes in Harris County has flood insurance. In other flood zones throughout the US, as well, homeowners lack flood insurance, even as almost all of them are insured against fire -- a much lower risk for them. Better communication with such homeowners, by both governments and insurers, could help increase take-up. But change will be slow to come as long as homeowners are permitted to forgo insurance and then receive grants for rebuilding.Behavioral biases -- overconfidence in good fortune, for one, and an inability to understand risk and probabilities -- also put lives in danger. Too many decide at the last minute to ??wait it out.?? Hurricane Harvey??s dire forecast came two days in advance. Government evacuation operations that need to focus on citizens who are immobile should not be overwhelmed by the needs of those who had the wherewithal to evacuate. An emergency law forcing regional hotels and shelters to take pets might go a long way toward improving future evacuation rates. In the face of a hurricane, the government needs to be able to impose emergency rules.Fourth, and finally, government leaders must face the science of climate change and the reality that extreme weather events are likely to occur more often. In and around Houston, over the past three decades, the frequency of intense downpours has nearly doubled. One cannot know whether the changing climate has made this one single weather event more intense, but an increased frequency of extreme storms is entirely consistent with expectations. Climate change denial prevents people from taking appropriate steps to adapt to the new reality. Storms like Harvey will be destructive in unpredictable ways, despite the best preparations. But local, state and national leaders have the responsibility to see that Americans are ready, and that damage and loss are kept to a minimum.By Paul J. Ferraro Paul J.

At this time of the year, you sometimes just want to seat relaxed in the back of a car and admire the view outside. The days will soon come when you do just that alone, behind the wheel, without driving a car.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Korean government unveiled its plan to bring about this future sooner. Under its first national road plan, the government will extend the expressway network of Korea to 5,000 km by 2020 so that 96 percent of Koreans can get access to the expressway in just 30 minutes. A smart tolling system will be introduced across the nation to ensure a fast passage of cars without stopping at booths for tickets. Roads and bridges will be reinforced to be more resilient to earthquakes by 2018. The policy is designed in the long term to provide sound guidance to future roads by factoring in the upcoming changes in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence (AI), environment, energy and reunification in shaping the policy. Even though the policy was designed for future roads, some of the changes in the policy are already happening.</p><p>For instance, autonomous driving is no longer a staple of science fiction. The global market for autonomous vehicles (AV) is expected to grow to 220 trillion won by 2020 and to 1,340 trillion won by 2035. To secure Korea's place in the market, the government is building K-Cities to test AV technologies. Other measures are also being put into place to speed up the launch of Korea's AVs on the market. In July, the C-ITS (Cooperative Intelligent Transport System), an advanced, ICT-based traffic management system, was introduced as a pilot program on some roads between Sejong and Daejeon. With the C-ITS, cars equipped with simple on-board terminals can receive various safety services including warnings against a sudden stopping of the car in front, or an approaching pedestrian at an intersection. As AVs go mainstream, cities will soon have highly intelligent roads that accommodate fully self-driving cars and repair themselves.</p><p>Roads of the future will become greener as well. Under the national road plan, the government aims to increase the proportion of green cars to 20 percent by 2020 and is building green infrastructure for this. Green roads will generate electricity from renewable sources including wind, solar and piezoelectric, which will in turn power the electric vehicles running on the roads wirelessly. Repairs will be done either by robots or roads themselves with the advancement of conventional road materials like concrete or asphalt.</p><p>Roads will become lighter as personal transportation and green cars become popular. Roads will become more flexible with sections being assembled on demand like Lego. That will reshape the image of cities as being old and polluting as they produce less noise and dust. Cities with future roads will be more efficient and livable with some roads going underground and others above the ground, linking to high-rise buildings. Safety will be enhanced too thanks to the breakthrough in shock absorbing materials used for road facilities and road design. Last but not least, roads will become more transnational, expanding beyond the Korean peninsula to Eurasia under the Asian Highway project.</p><p>To realize this future, however, improvement in road transport alone will not be enough. It needs to converge with existing or emerging technologies like AVs, smart cities and geospatial information. Disruptive innovation and cooperation across industries will facilitate the process. Regulations need to be improved as well. Efforts on these multiple fronts will make Korea's roads safer, more convenient and driver-friendly and something completely different from the roads we see today.</p><p>A shift in paradigm is sorely needed for Korean roads. Roads have powered the Korean economy and contributed to the balanced development of the national territory and better living standards. However, a dramatic change is needed so as to open a new future for Korea as it did for its economy. Paths between towns and regions used to serve as links where new civilizations were born and expanded. The paths have evolved into roads and they are still evolving.</p><p>Kang Ho-in is Minister of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["As AVs go mainstream, cities will soon have highly intelligent roads that accommodate fully self-driving cars and repair themselves.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In OECD countries alone, institutional investors control an estimated $92 trillion in assets. Annual official development assistance by multilateral finance institutions (MFIs) and governments amounts to just 0.16 percent of that - about $145 billion.</p><p>But, as commercial actors, institutional investors' primary objective is to maximize financial returns. Even as some purge their portfolios of carbon-intensive companies, they generally consider investing in new clean-energy infrastructure projects to be too risky, particularly in emerging markets.To finance the SDGs, including clean-energy infrastructure, MFIs have committed to mobilizing capital from private investors. This mobilization takes place largely through so-called blended finance, whereby MFIs and other public finance institutions use their own capital to crowd in private financing. But institutional investors have been largely absent from multilateral blended-finance initiatives, which have, in turn, failed to achieve a scale relevant to climate change.So what will it take to mobilize the needed capital from institutional investors? A recent paper by researchers at Stanford and Maastricht universities suggests focusing on three recent developments in the global financial sector.First, a growing number of institutional investors are reducing their dependence on financial intermediaries. Institutional investors have traditionally outsourced their investments to investment management firms, whose performance is generally assessed on a quarterly basis. Yet the investment horizon for infrastructure, including clean-energy infrastructure, is often more than 20 years.From the perspective of blended finance, traditional financial intermediaries, with their short-term biases, constitute a bottleneck between institutional investors and MFIs. The elimination of such intermediaries could thus provide new opportunities for direct cooperation between institutional investors and MFIs, as it enables the former to focus more on investment in long-term assets.Second, many institutional investors are establishing collaborative platforms to enable cost-sharing on deal sourcing, due diligence, and other stages of the investment process. Each of these platforms represents a very large amount of long-term capital. But, with few exceptions, they do not include MFIs.Third, there are new types of local strategic investors that can be highly effective at mobilizing private capital, including from institutional backers. Over the last decade, at least 20 countries have established state-sponsored strategic investment funds to co-invest in infrastructure projects with private-sector partners. Other countries have established green banks, whose domestic focus reflects the fact that 90 percent of private climate-finance investments are made within the capital's country of origin.The strategic investment funds that have successfully mobilized private capital are structured much like private investment organizations. They emphasize the independence and integrity of the investment decision-making process; and their boards and board committees have a high share of independent directors selected for their financial and business expertise. Some funds, such as India's National Investment and Infrastructure Fund, are owned mainly by private and institutional investors, with the government in a minority position.Managed by finance professionals recruited from the private sector, these strategic funds invest primarily in equity, and take an active role in structuring and arranging new deals. Because they are linked to local government and business networks, they are in a strong position to mitigate local risk.MFIs, by contrast, tend to emphasize country representation on their boards, leaving these boards with less financial-sector expertise in the relevant sectors. At the management and staff level, the private-sector branches of MFIs frequently have expertise in a wide range of areas. Despite this, MFI boards - unlike their private counterparts - generally do not establish a broad investment policy or delegate decisions on individual infrastructure projects to an independent investment committee; instead, they themselves make the decisions on capital allocation.Given MFIs' bureaucratic structures and frequently cumbersome procedures, institutional investors tend to be skeptical about them. Institutional investors often consider the projects MFIs pitch to be too small, too risky, or not profitable enough, and they worry that, if something goes wrong, MFIs' bureaucracies will not permit them to address it swiftly.Whereas MFIs have expanded their offers of risk mitigation for investors, they overwhelmingly remain providers of debt. Crucially, they invest very little in infrastructure equity. This is a significant distinction, because whereas equity investors frequently take an active role in structuring and arranging new infrastructure projects, providers of debt and risk mitigation generally engage once a project is fully documented and confirmed as 'bankable.'To achieve their goal of mobilizing private-sector capital, MFIs need to engage on institutional investors' collaborative platforms, and address these investors' concerns. This means helping them to assess and mitigate risk in new regions and sectors where green infrastructure is needed, if appropriate in cooperation with local strategic investment funds and green banks.By developing the capacity to assess and bear risk on commercial terms, traditionally risk-averse MFIs could engage more productively with institutional investors. And by building up the capacity to undertake equity investment in clean-energy infrastructure, MFIs could increase their capacity to engage with institutional investors at relevant stages of the infrastructure-investment cycle.Simply put, in order to mobilize institutional capital effectively, MFIs will need to start functioning more like private investment organizations, even as they fulfill a policy-defined mandate. This is a tall order; the OECD has suggested that efficient private capital mobilization may require a culture change within MFIs. But, if we are to curb climate change and achieve the SDGs, it could be the only way for MFIs to mobilize institutional investor capital at any relevant scale.</p><p>Havard Halland is a visiting scholar at the Stanford Global Projects Center (GPC) at Stanford University.

Sachs] A new grand coalition for Germany ? and Europe ", "published": "2017-11-29", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Friends of Germany and Europe around the world have been breathing a sigh of relief at the newfound willingness of Germany's Christian Democrats and Social Democrats (SPD) to discuss reprising their grand coalition government. The world needs a strong and forward-looking Germany in a dynamic European Union. The SPD's initial decision to go into opposition after its poor election result in September may have been sincere, and even strategically sound. But it is not timely. </p><p>Diplomacy almost everywhere is fractured. The United States is reckoning with a psychologically unstable president, a plutocratic cabinet, and a Republican congressional majority. Europe is in the throes of multiple economic, social, political, and institutional crises. China, by contrast, is dynamic and outward-looking - providing good reason for the EU to assume vigorous leadership and engage in constructive partnerships with China on key initiatives (such as sustainable infrastructure across Eurasia).In short, this is a critical time for Germany and Europe to provide vision, stability, and global leadership. And that imperative extends to Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, and the SPD.But the CDU/CSU and the SPD need to do more than merely extend the previous government, which was too parochial in outlook and temperament. The world and Europe need an outward-looking Germany that offers more institutional and financial innovation.Economic growth that is socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable is a very European idea, one that has now been embraced globally in the United Nations\u00ef'2030 Agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals, as well as in the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Europe's experience with social democracy and Christian democracy made this global vision possible. But now that its agenda has been adopted worldwide, Europe's leadership in fulfilling it has become essential.A grand coalition government in Germany must help put Europe in a position to lead. French President <person><nameText>Emmanuel Macron </nameText></person>has offered some important ideas: a European finance minister; Eurobonds to finance a new European investment program; more emphasis on innovation; a financial transactions tax to fund increased aid to Africa; and tax harmonization more generally, before the US triggers a global race to the bottom on taxing corporations and the rich.Contrary to the Germans who oppose such ideas, a European finance minister and Eurobonds would not and should not lead to fiscal profligacy, but rather to a revival of investment-led green growth in Europe. China has proposed the Belt and Road Initiative to build green infrastructure linking Southeast Asia and Central Asia with Europe. This is the time for Europe to offer the same bold vision, creating a partnership with China to renovate Eurasia's infrastructure for a low-carbon future.If Europe plays its cards right, Europe's (and China's) scientific and technical excellence would flourish under such a vision. If not, we will all be driving Chinese electric vehicles charged by Chinese photovoltaic cells in the future, while Germany's automotive industry will become a historical footnote.A European finance minister would, moreover, finally end Europe's self-inflicted agony in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. As difficult as it is to believe, Greece's crisis continues to this day, at Great Depression scale, ten years after the onset of the crisis.This is because Europe has been unable, and Germany unwilling, to clean up the financial mess in a fair and forward-looking manner. If Germany won't help to lead on this issue, Europe will face a prolonged crisis with severe social, economic, and political repercussions. In three weeks, Macron will convene world leaders in Paris on the second anniversary of the climate accord. France should certainly take a bow here, but so should Germany. During Germany's G-20 Presidency, Merkel kept 19 of the 20 members of the G-20 firmly committed to the Paris agreement, despite US President Donald Trump's disgraceful attempt to wreck it.Yes, the corruption of US politics (especially campaign funding by the oil and gas industry) threatened the global consensus on climate change. But Germany stood firm. The new coalition should also ensure that the country's Energiewende ('energy transition') delivers on the 2020 targets set by previous governments. A CDU/CSU-SPD alliance, working with France and the rest of Europe, could and should do much more on climate change. Most important, Europe needs a comprehensive energy plan to decarbonize fully by 2050. This will require a zero-carbon smart power grid that extends across the continent and taps into the wind and solar power not only of southern Europe but also of North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean. Once again, Eurobonds, a green partnership with China, and unity within Europe could make all the difference.Such an alliance would also enable a new foreign policy for Europe, one that promotes peace and sustainable development, underpinned by new security arrangements that do not depend so heavily on the US. The political terms of a new grand coalition government, it would seem, are clear. The SPD should hold out for ministerial leadership on economic and financial policy, while the CDU/CSU holds the chancellorship. That would be a true coalition, not one that could bury the SPD politically or deny it the means to push for a truly green, inclusive, EU-wide, sustainable development agenda.With Merkel and SPD leader Martin Schulz in the lead, the German government would be in excellent, responsible, and experienced hands. Germany's friends and admirers, and all supporters of global sustainable development, are hoping for this breakthrough. By Jeffrey D. Sachs Jeffrey D.

Trump is making a mistake that will have grave repercussions for his own country, and for the world.Trump claims that he will try to renegotiate the deal reached in Paris, or craft a new one. But leaders from around the world have already hailed the agreement as a breakthrough for the fight against climate change, a victory for international cooperation and a boon to the global economy. That remains true today.Among the many challenges we face today, climate change is unique in its global scale. </p><p>It affects every element of life on this planet -- from ecosystems and food production to cities and industrial supply chains. Viewing climate change as strictly an ??environmental?? problem misses the point entirely.We might charitably assume that Trump simply does not understand the implications of his decision. And yet, regardless of what Trump thinks, we know that he is surrounded by advisers who know very well what is at stake.On the campaign trail, Trump promised to create jobs and protect American workers from the ravages of the world. And he signed off his tweet announcing that he had made a decision on the Paris accord with the words, ??MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!??But Trump??s decision undermines every one of these goals and it goes against the wishes of a vast majority of Americans, including many of his own supporters. By turning his back on the Paris agreement, he is increasing Americans?? exposure to the devastating effects of climate change -- many of which they are already experiencing. Moreover, he is undercutting jobs in the thriving renewable-energy and electric-vehicle sectors, which are increasingly employing the very workers he purports to represent.More broadly, Trump has diminished America itself and abdicated its global leadership role. When I was a member of the French government participating in a global tour to build consensus for climate action -- an effort that eventually culminated in the Paris agreement -- I experienced firsthand what American leadership can achieve. It is tragic to watch that force for good be subverted by denial and myopia.By burying their heads in the sand, Trump and his advisers must be hoping that reality will simply go away. They have somehow concluded that America will be spared from the droughts already destroying farms in California??s Central Valley, the rising sea levels already flooding coastal cities, the storms and wildfires routinely ravaging vast swathes of the American countryside, and the water- and food-supply disruptions that threaten us all.Other parties to the Paris agreement have responded to Trump??s decision with strength, therefore proving the resilience of the agreement itself. The rest of the world will be sad to see an America that has been left behind, owing to Trump??s decision. But we will not wait; in fact, we are already moving on.The world??s response will be clear at the G-20 meeting in Germany this July. Already, Europe, China, India, Canada, and Pacific Rim and South American countries have recommitted to the goals of the Paris agreement. These countries understand the dangers of climate change, as do Exxon Mobil??s global shareholders, who, just this week, rejected that company??s attempts to ignore the impact of climate change on its business.By placing America in the company of the only two countries that have not joined the Paris agreement -- Syria and Nicaragua -- Trump??s decision is completely at odds with the current global atmosphere of cooperation. The world??s major economies are reaching new agreements every day to collaborate on research and development, infrastructure investment and industrial strategy. They are working together to achieve a low-carbon economy, and to make 2020 the year that global greenhouse-gas emissions will have peaked.European leaders are already meeting with their Indian and Chinese counterparts to find areas where they can cooperate on developing clean energy and green infrastructure. Massive investments will be made in these areas, and the European Central Bank, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, and many other institutions are devising mechanisms to finance them. Likewise, sovereign wealth funds with immense clout in the global financial system are redirecting their investments toward the green economy.Even the most optimistic among us did not predict that the old fossil-fuel paradigm would change so quickly. But Europe is phasing out coal-fueled energy production. And India, China, and South Korea are rapidly shifting their investments away from coal and toward renewable-energy sources.Worldwide, the competition is about ??who can go green the fastest.?? New industries are springing up, at scale, in areas ranging from electrification and smart-grid design to electric vehicles, green construction and recycling technologies and organic chemicals. The renewable-energy revolution, now spreading at an unprecedented rate, is already transforming entire sectors, not least transportation. In all of these sectors around the world, the excitement and growth potential is palpable.It is a shame that Trump has decided to shirk America??s global responsibility and turn his back on these developments. His decision is a blow to so many people -- including a great many Americans -- who have worked hard to be a successful part of the new economy.Still, Trump cannot take all of America with him. State- and city-level climate action is sweeping across the US, increasing in scale and ambition. Trump??s historic mistake represents an obstacle to that collective action; but it can hardly stop it. Just as Chinese companies are now training US coal workers to build wind farms, the rest of the world will continue to work together, and build the markets and workforce of the future.By Laurence TubianaLaurence Tubiana, former French ambassador to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, is CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a professor at Sciences-Po, Paris. -- Ed.(Project Syndicate)</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["s major economies are reaching new agreements every day to collaborate on research and development, infrastructure investment and industrial strategy.

As the deepest economic crisis of our lifetimes stretches into its seventh year, most OECD countries are continuing to underperform. This year, GDP growth in the world's advanced economies is expected to average 2 percent, compared to 3.2 percent worldwide. And 2016 is shaping up to be no better, with output in the OECD growing by 2.5 percent, while the rest of the world's GDP expands at a 3.8 percent rate ? close to the pre-crisis average.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the long-term economic prospects of the global economy as a whole look gloomy. As societies in many OECD countries age, and catch-up growth in large emerging economies begins to wind down, global GDP growth is expected to fall from its annual average of 3.6 percent in the 2010-2020 period to an estimated 2.4 percent in 2050-2060.</p><p>This slump may be inevitable, but it can be mitigated. Implementing policies to facilitate and reward long-term investments will be key to exiting the current crisis and boosting the world's growth potential.</p><p>Investments, both public and private, are needed to foster green growth, support innovation and entrepreneurship, contribute to closing the inequality gaps that have widened during the crisis, and help build the skills that are essential for more resilient economies and more inclusive societies. And, though meeting these needs will require transformational changes in the behavior of governments and investors, the payoff will be significant. In short, as we argued during the OECD Forum and annual Ministerial Council Meeting last week, this time we need to promote investments that focus on people and the planet.</p><p>The list of structural challenges facing countries around the globe is a long one. But efforts to overcome at least four ? high unemployment, an aging workforce, climate change, and infrastructure deficiencies ? would benefit significantly from policies promoting long-term investments.</p><p>Addressing the unemployment crisis, which has been particularly burdensome for the young, will require not only a strong recovery, but also a renewed focus on the development of skills. Investment in high-quality vocational education and training and work-based learning will be essential. These types of investments continue to be beneficial throughout a worker's life, as exposure to new skills and knowledge allows him or her to adapt to an evolving technological and business environment. Empowering today's workers will also help meet the challenges resulting from aging populations.</p><p>Moreover, an increased focus on long-term investment will help resolve the conflicts traditionally associated with addressing climate change and building infrastructure. One requires cuts in the emission of greenhouse gases; the other has tended to promote the combustion of fossil fuels for transport and energy. The solution is relatively simple, provided the presence of political will: By putting a price on carbon and repealing policies that incentivize fossil-fuel consumption, investments can be channeled into the creation of a low-carbon economy, including the necessary clean-energy infrastructure.</p><p>In order to encourage private investors to pursue long-term, responsible projects, governments need to promote consistent policies and frameworks. In addition to immediate uncertainties, investors are being held back by a shortage of incentives and a surplus of factors that reduce returns. These include restrictive regulations that reduce firms' ability to undertake new activities or enter new markets, especially across borders. The OECD's updated Policy Framework for Investment provides a blueprint for the promotion of investment and responsible business conduct.</p><p>Governments will also have to facilitate the participation of institutional investors. The challenge of long-term investment cannot be resolved without attracting more diverse and private sources of finance. In 2013, institutional investors in OECD countries alone held more than $57 trillion in assets, and pension funds collected around $1 trillion in new contributions.</p><p>Tools that could be used to leverage institutional investments include public-private partnerships to develop clear and transparent project pipelines for major green infrastructure projects, green banks and green bonds, and instruments that mitigate risk and enhance the availability of credit. Regulations for international accounting and funding will have to be examined to identify policies that inadvertently discourage institutional investors from putting their resources into longer-term, illiquid assets.</p><p>Finally, public equity markets will have to be strengthened. Savings must be channeled to firms that need capital for innovation and sustainable job creation. Today, however, the quality of corporate-governance frameworks worldwide is challenged by the growing complexity of investment chains and the dominance of passive and short-term investment strategies.</p><p>In a globally interdependent world, a better financial and investment system cannot be achieved on a country-by-country basis. There may be no one-size-fits-all model for economic development, but, without global standards and complementary regulations, the long-term outlook for the world economy will remain bleak.</p><p>Angel Gurria is secretary-general of the OECD.

In addition, a gathering body of analysis suggests that a business-as-usual approach to investment in traditional, emissions- and resource-intensive infrastructure will not result in the sustainable growth that many developing countries seek, and may even decrease economic resilience in some cases.</p><p>For example, by 2030 there could be a 40 percent gap between global water demand and supply, with the situation worse for those developing countries, particularly in the Middle East and Asia, that are already using freshwater supplies unsustainably.</p><p>In the agricultural sector, investment in traditional practices to meet the expected doubling of demand for production by 2030 could increase land under cultivation from 1.5 trillion hectares to 3.2 trillion hectares, leading to large-scale deforestation with negative land, water and climate change consequences.</p><p>Increase in energy demand</p><p>The energy sector also holds tremendous challenges. The International Energy Agency forecasts a 40 percent increase in energy demand by 2030, driven almost entirely by growth in developing and emerging countries.</p><p>Without action to decarbonize energy infrastructure, investments in the energy sector will continue to accentuate the world's reliance on emissions-intensive fossil fuels for close to 60 percent of total power generation for this period.</p><p>In addition to increasing greenhouse gas emissions, following such an approach will expose developing countries to increased volatility in fossil fuel prices, as imports of oil and coal rise.</p><p>The consequences are potentially dramatic. Given these scenarios, scientists and other observers warn that the world is heading for a global average increase in land temperature of between 4 and 6 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, when in fact the average global temperature increase should be maintained within 2 degrees to avoid the negative impacts of climate change.</p><p>The latest scientific analysis suggests the world has already experienced an average land mass warming of 1 degree since 1950; for every degree rise in average land temperature, scientists estimate an increase in the potential for more extreme weather events.</p><p>Rio+20 negotiations</p><p>Some commentators suggest that we are already seeing the early signs of things to come, with changing weather patterns (droughts and heavy rainfall) in many parts of the world, such as the recent floods in Thailand, the Philippines and Pakistan that have claimed many lives, left millions of people affected and created billions of dollars in economic damage.</p><p>Fortunately, some good news exists. The multitude of initiatives, policy and business-driven commitments that are being announced on the margins of the Rio+20 negotiations stand as proof of the potential for the public and private sectors to work together to achieve sustainable growth.</p><p>Supported by international agencies, an increasing number of governments in developing countries are changing their approach to infrastructure and industrial planning to make their economic growth more sustainable and resilient.</p><p>This is not just an abstract concept. China has devoted key parts of its last three five-year plans to developing a green growth strategy for energy, agriculture and infrastructure, investing over $51 billion in new renewable energy projects in 2010 alone, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.</p><p>Recently, Mexico enacted a national law making the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 30 percent by 2030 a legal commitment. Other emerging economies such as Brazil, South Africa, South Korea, Kenya, Vietnam, and increasingly India are promoting green growth policies to enhance the resilience of their economic development.</p><p>Many other developing countries are following suit. According to the Global Status Report of the Renewable Energy Network (REN21), by the end of 2010, 96 countries had enacted renewable energy targets, 60 had bio-energy mandates and at least 30 were developing some form of low-carbon growth path.</p><p>The goal of these national strategies, which includes policies on renewable energy, energy efficiency, transport and agriculture, as well as market-based carbon tax and trade mechanisms, is to direct significant investment flows into resource-efficient, job-creating growth.</p><p>The role that organizations such as the Global Green Growth Institute (headquartered in Seoul) are playing in helping developing countries design comprehensive green growth strategies is already showing initial successes in countries such as Ethiopia or Indonesia.</p><p>The move among many developing countries to make their infrastructure investment and their growth strategies green in general has important economic implications.</p><p>Bloomberg New Energy Finance shows that in 2011 global investment in new renewable power plants ? estimated at $187 billion ? surpassed that of power plants fuelled by natural gas, oil and coal ? of $157 billion ? for the first time.</p><p>2011 was also the first year when expenditure on renewable energy in developing countries, driven by China, exceeded that of the industrialized world.</p><p>These conditions present a window of attractiveness for investment into these growth markets. In the current economic circumstances, the fiscal outlook is more optimistic in developing countries, where debt to GDP ratios have been falling in recent years, as growth has been maintained and where as a consequence, risk premiums have continued to decrease.</p><p>The economic performance of emerging markets, including several in sub-Saharan Africa, has improved greatly in recent years, as is the case with emerging market countries such as India that can attract more investment and are in a better position to absorb capital flows aimed at an expansion in investment.</p><p>Sustainable world economy</p><p>To support the dramatic increase in private investment that is needed to transform towards a sustainable world economy, this past July 17 at the Mexican Business 20 (B20) Summit, the World Economic Forum launched a new public private partnership initiative entitled the Green Growth Action Alliance, with Mexican President Felipe Calderon taking the role of Honorary Chair.</p><p>The alliance aims to deploy public money to unlock and utilize private sector investment for clean energy, transport, agriculture and other green growth areas.

To go forward, Congress needs to confront the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">America is mired in a tarpit of accumulated law. Reformers propose new laws to fix health care, schools and the regulatory system, but almost never suggest cleaning out the legal swamp these institutions operate in. These complex legal tangles not only set goals but allocate resources and dictate the minutest details of how to meet those goals. Most are obsolete in whole or part.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nothing important can get fixed without remaking a coherent legal framework.</p><p>The flaw is not one that can be solved by deregulation. Almost no one, for example, would disagree about the need to provide education for disabled children. But a special education law, enacted in 1975, was structured as an open-ended mandate, and soon spun out of control. Today, special ed consumes 20 percent of the total K-12 budget in America. Programs for gifted children get less than half of one percent, and pre-K education gets almost nothing. Is this a sensible allocation of education dollars? No one is even asking the question.</p><p>Congress treats most laws as if they were the Ten Commandments - except they're more like the 10 million commandments. Most legislative programs do not codify timeless principles of right and wrong. They are tools of social management. These laws allocate social resources - almost 70 percent of federal revenue in 2010 was consumed by three entitlement programs enacted a half century or more ago. Congress almost never goes back to rationalize these programs. Running government today is like trying to run a business using every idea every manager ever had.</p><p>There are four problems caused by the accumulation of old law:</p><p>Too much law causes paralysis. Over the past century laws have piled up, like sediment in the harbor, until it's almost impossible to do anything sensibly. Building a \"green infrastructure,\" for example, is stymied by environmental processes that sometimes consume upwards of a decade.</p><p>Laws have unintended consequences. Things never work out as planned. Sometimes a well-meaning idea, such as special education, ends up undermining other important goals.</p><p>Priorities change. The more specific a law, the faster it becomes obsolete. In the 1930s, when many farmers were struggling, Congress enacted farm subsidies. The crisis ended by 1941. Now, 70 years later, farm prices are at record highs, and much of farming is done by corporations. But the farm subsidies continue - $15 billion in 2010.</p><p>Fixing what ails America is impossible, indeed illegal, without a legal spring cleaning. The goal is not mainly to \"deregulate\" but to restate programs in light of current needs and priorities.</p><p>As a practical matter, this requires Congress to authorize special commissions to make proposals, area by area. Using the base closing commission model, these proposals would be submitted to Congress for an up or down vote.</p><p>Going forward, Congress should incorporate sunset provisions in all laws with budgetary impact. The goal is not to end good programs but to impose a discipline that is essential for a functioning democracy that must constantly make tough tradeoffs.</p><p>Accumulated law is not a problem our founders anticipated. They made it hard to enact new laws, thinking they would thereby protect the open field of freedom against too much legal interference. But 200 years later, the land of the free is a legal swamp. It's hard to dredge, because those same checks and balances apply to repealing a law - with one additional impediment. Once a law is enacted, it is immediately surrounded by an army of special interests. Not one word can be changed until a majority of Congress has run a gauntlet of special interests, flogging each member with campaign funding. That's why changing old law is so politically difficult as to be unthinkable.</p><p>\"The difficulty lies not in the new ideas,\" John Maynard Keynes observed, \"but in escaping from the old ones.\" American government is trapped in structures of its own making. The essential first step in rescuing America is a spring-cleaning. It's hard to fix things until we can make fresh choices.</p><p>Philip K.

Instead of compartmentalizing the interests of big business and environmentalists, the economic crisis could offer an opportunity for nations to develop more environmentally friendly initiatives.</p><p>In October 2008, the United Nations Environment Program announced the Global Green New Deal, an economic initiative created as \"an antidote to current economic woes and as a springboard to a low-carbon, low-impact, high-job and better-managed global economy.\"</p><p>The Green New Deal proposal asks countries to seize the global financial crisis as an opportunity to redevelop their economies by encouraging environmentally-friendly investment. In this approach, the environment and the economy become mutually beneficial to a nation's prosperity.</p><p>Achim Steiner, U.N. Under-Secretary General and UNEP Executive Director, said that transformative ideas and decisions such as the Green New Deal are needed before it is too late to act on climate change. \"The alternative is more boom and bust cycles, (and) a climate-stressed world,\" he said. </p><p>Responding to the financial crisis</p><p>Since the announcement of the Green New Deal, a number of countries have included green infrastructure investments in their stimulus package responses to the global financial crisis.</p><p>The United States, Korea, Japan and China have been at the forefront of countries investing in green jobs and green infrastructure. In the United States, <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>plans to invest $150 billion in clean energy. In January, Japan also announced that it hopes to expand its green business market and create up to one million new jobs.</p><p>Strong political decisions like these are an indicator that the global community is ready to tackle the environment and the economy together.</p><p>\"Investments in clean-tech and renewable energy can not only counter recession and unemployment but can also set the stage for more sustainable economic recovery and growth in the 21st century,\" Steiner said.</p><p>One country that has not responded with the same fervor is Australia.</p><p>In 2007, Australia became one of the last countries to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. At a domestic level, Australia is also one of the world's top greenhouse gas emitters per capita because of its reliance on coal for its electricity.</p><p>Although the government under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has acknowledged the need to tackle climate change, this has not been reflected in Australia's own stimulus package response to the economic crisis.</p><p>Despite significant controversy from the major parties, the Rudd government's $42 billion stimulus package was approved by the Senate on Feb. 14, 2009. Since then the stimulus package has received mixed responses from the Australian Greens Party and other leading political and media commentators.</p><p>Part of the criticism is based on the package's limited attempt to use the opportunity to invest in environmentally-friendly projects, unlike other countries who have embraced the \"Green New Deal.\" Only $3.9 billion of the total stimulus package will be spent on the environment. This money will go towards the Energy Efficient Homes project, which aims to reduce energy consumption in 3 million Australian homes by providing rebates for ceiling insulation.</p><p>\"This scheme is part of the Rudd government's commitment to comprehensive action on energy efficiency - action to help tackle climate change and the economy and help create more green jobs,\" Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Arts Peter Garrett said.</p><p>However, what could have been an opportunity to create real change in Australia's environmental policy has evolved to little more than a short-sighted solution. Beyond the Energy Efficient Homes project, the stimulus package neglects to encourage environmentally-friendly investment. Instead, the central tenet of the Rudd government's stimulus package is that a total of $11 billion is being deposited into the pockets of Australians earning under $100, 000 per year, who are then expected to feed this back into the local economy.</p><p>But this is not necessarily helpful for the environment or the long-term outlook for the economy. ANZ Senior Economist Katie Dean told the Australian Broadcasting Commission, \"I think that this package will provide some offset, but I don't think it's going to completely avert a further slowdown in the Australian economy.\"</p><p>The Australian Greens Party, who have long been a force in pressing the government to act on climate change issues, argued that the time frame in which the package was considered was too short and should have allowed for greater scrutiny and public participation in the process. \"Overall, it is a missed opportunity to put in place the key investments for Australia to meet the urgent challenges of climate change,\" Greens Senator Bob Brown said. </p><p>Reducing carbon emissions</p><p>Despite this missed opportunity, the Australian government has had a policy on climate change for just over a year. This policy is based on a three-tiered approach of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, adapting to unavoidable climate change, and helping shape a global solution.</p><p>The policy approach has been shaped by advice from a range of scientific reviews and industry leaders. In particular, the Garnaut Climate Change Review has been an important source of input for the government's thinking.</p><p>However, since the announcement of Australia's key climate change initiatives, critics have charged decision-makers with not doing enough. In December 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd introduced his Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which aims to reduce carbon emissions by 60 percent of 2000 levels by 2050. This action directly addresses the first policy tier: reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>By placing a tangible cost on carbon pollution, the scheme aims to encourage major polluting businesses to curb their emissions. The Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme White Paper states that Australia's commitment of a 5-15 per cent reduction by 2020 is a realistically attainable and credible commitment to the global effort. The revenue generated from the carbon pollution tax will go toward creating jobs in solar energy, wind farms and geothermal energy.</p><p>As Australia is heavily reliant on fossil fuels for energy, the government is hesitant to offer a more ambitious policy. The white paper states that Australia faces a relatively greater structural adjustment task to move toward a low-emission future than many other developed countries.</p><p>In light of this, Rudd argues that the targets are both appropriate and responsible. \"They strike the right balance between tackling climate change and supporting our economy and jobs during this global recession.\"</p><p>However, Rudd has been criticized for neglecting to take enough action to minimize Australia's dependence on fossil fuels.</p><p>In an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Commission, chief climate change advisor Professor Garnaut said that the Rudd government has aimed too low in its targets and should have offered a more ambitious policy. He argued that although Australia may find the transition to a more environmentally-friendly economy difficult, it needs to take immediate effective action.</p><p>The Greens Party also said that the government should follow the recommendations of Garnaut's Review, rather than avoiding action with more political rhetoric. \"It is essential that the government admits that it has got the scheme completely wrong, and immediately review its weak targets and its shocking bias and generosity to the big polluters,\" Greens Senator Christine Milne said.</p><p>Working with the global community</p><p>Although the Rudd government has established some targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, global standards and global agreements are also necessary to accelerate progress in addressing the threats of climate change.</p><p>The issue of climate change is not restricted by geographical borders and demands a new approach to international cooperation.

The movement has been listed in the Encyclopedia Britannica, and many developing countries have localized the movement for their own national campaigns.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Following the launch of the campaign in the 1970s, Korea's economy grew at a rapid pace. It is now ranked as the 14th largest in the world, and the country will host the G-20 Summit in Seoul in November.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite all these achievements, Korea has faced a variety of growing global challenges caused by environmental changes, and so we must adopt green growth as a 'second' New Community Movement.</p><p>Today the world is faced with various environmental threats such as climate change, and the depletion of fossil fuels and natural resources, which undermines growth potential. Such global issues as energy problems and environmental issues are closely inter-linked, and the world has begun to put more weight on the latter. Taking a close look at the instability of the global financial market that triggered the global economic crisis, its fundamental cause can be found, in part, from the previous growth model which relied heavily on the consumption of carbon-based resources even in the face of economic slowdowns and environmental challenges.</p><p>Korea is not an exception. Environmental problems have a direct impact on the country \u00a1\u00a9 over the past century, the average temperature here has risen by 1.5 degrees Celsius, far higher than the world's average of 0.74 of a degree. In addition, Korea's economic structure is highly vulnerable to the ever-worsening energy-resources crisis; the country imports 97 percent of its total energy, among which 83 percent is fossil fuel. Korea, the 10th largest emitter of global warming gases in the world, also still depends on energy-intensive industries such as heavy chemical processing.</p><p>Furthermore, Korea's GDP growth has fallen from 7-9 percent to around 4 percent over the past two decades, showing that the energy-gulping industrial structure can no longer drive economic growth. Under these circumstances, Korea needs new growth engines along with a new vision and strategies for sustainable growth. The new growth engines are necessary to turn this environmental crisis into a new opportunity,</p><p>At a ceremony marking the 60th anniversary of the establishment of South Korea on Aug. 15, 2008, President Lee Myung-bak announced a new national vision of 'Low Carbon, Green Growth' that is seeking to transform the existing industrial structure to a low-carbon one and to establish a virtuous circle between economic development and environmental preservation. Since the announcement, the government has been making its utmost efforts to activate green growth. All Koreans are encouraged to join hands for the success of green growth as the second New Community Movement.</p><p>In July 2009, Korea charted the National Strategy and Five-Year Plan for Green Growth, which integrates and specifies green growth-related policy goals and tasks. The plan includes investing 2 percent of Korea's annual GDP or $83.6 billion from 2009 through 2013 in green infrastructure and R&amp;D for green technologies.</p><p>Also, the government set a mid-term target of reducing 30 percent of greenhouse gas emissions on a BAU basis by 2020, evidencing its strong commitment toward a low-carbon society. Showing its \"Me First\" attitude to the world, Korea's voluntary action proved its genuine drive toward green growth at the 15th Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen in December 2009. It also provided a new momentum to break long-stalled global negotiations on GHG emission mitigation.</p><p>More notably, Korea enacted the Basic Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth based on the government's new philosophy.</p><p>The country was the first in the world to enact a law on green growth and intends to transform itself into a low-carbon society, promoting a green lifestyle and building public-private partnerships for such growth.</p><p>More specifically, the government will make its industrial structure greener through intensive nurturing of green projects, technologies and eco-companies.</p><p>Certified parties will benefit from various incentives such as tax benefits, financial support, and priority in R&amp;D investment. In addition, in accordance with the Basic Act, Korea will start a GHG mitigation target monitoring system and has recently established a Greenhouse Gas Inventory and Research Center. It will also expand green buildings and promote green consumption and transportation for the purpose of encouraging an eco-friendly lifestyle among its citizens.</p><p>Climate change directly affects water, which is vital for national security since there are no alternatives, unlike other energy resources. If the 20th century was the era of \"black gold,' the 21st century will be the era of \"blue gold.'</p><p>Water resources are getting high prominence on the agenda of global society. Korea does not favorable conditions for water management - it is listed as a water-stressed nation and its climatic conditions put rather huge obstacles in the way.</p><p>Under these circumstances, the government initiated the Four-Major-River Restoration Project in 2009. The project is designed to secure abundant clean water resources and to tackle climate change. It is a representative 'Green Deal' project aimed at increasing water supply and at the same time restoring the vitality and productivity of the four major rivers.</p><p>First, the project will secure abundant water resources in the face of ever-worsening shortages. While Korea's annual precipitation of 1,245mm is higher than the world's average of 880mm, due to being a densely populated in a small country, its annual per capita rainfall is only one eighth of the world's average.</p><p>Moreover, 70 percent of Korea's rainfall - concentrated in June to September - quickly flows into the ocean because 65 percent of the land is made up of mountains. In order to respond to these climatic conditions, the project aims at securing 1.3 billion tons of additional water resources through the construction of 16 weirs and the dredging of rivers.</p><p>Second, abundant water resources will restore the vitality of the four major rivers. The Ministry of Environment has made great efforts to improve the water quality of rivers, but the nation still has a shortage of water.</p><p>The restoration project puts the first priority on increasing water supply - the government will invest 3.9 trillion won in environmental infrastructures and phosphorous treatment facilities. According to the National Institute of Environmental Research, when the project is completed, the share of 'good' water where children can swim will rise to 86 percent in 2012 from the current 76 percent.</p><p>Third, the project is a key component of Korea's efforts to adapt to climate change. Until today, Korea has suffered damage from frequent floods and droughts, which have caused 2.7 trillion won ($2.1 billion) in damages since 2000.</p><p>More specifically, the number of days with more than 100mm of heavy rainfall has increased 1.7-times in just two decades. The ongoing climate change will continue to cause water quality degradation, a lack of drinking water, property losses and disturbances to the aquatic ecosystem. The project will enhance Korea's capacity for the stable management of water resources, thereby helping it better cope with water-related national disasters.</p><p>Lastly, the project seeks to restore the vitality of the four rivers along with their surrounding environment. Under the project, valuable riparian wetlands will be protected and a total of 113 new wetlands will be created to enhance the ecological function of the rivers. Also, to restore the habitats of wild plants and animals, 929km of national streams will be transformed into ecological streams, and 120 local streams, 20 urban streams and brooks will undergo ecological restoration.</p><p>Today, Korea's green growth model is drawing attention from the global community as a workable solution for sustainable development. At the initiative of Korea, the Declaration on Green Growth was adopted at the OECD Ministerial Council Meeting (MCM) in June 2009; and the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP) published the Overview of the Republic of Korea's Green Growth Strategy in April, 2010, which highly assessed Korea as a country to lead green growth in the world.</p><p>Also, the report highlights that thanks to the government's systematic and bold investment in green infrastructure, Korea has become the only OECD country to record positive economic growth in the first quarter of 2009 on a quarter-on-quarter basis and recorded the highest economic growth of 2.3 percent in the second quarter of the same year.</p><p>More recently, at the World Economic Forum on East Asia held in June, 2010, Korea was recognized as a 'green tiger' leading global green growth. As such, the global community, including Asia, is acknowledging the country's green growth model as a way to turn this economic crisis into an opportunity for development.</p><p>The green wave, which stems from Korea, can spread across the world, but this cannot be achieved by the government alone as it requires the understanding and participation of the entire corporate sector and the general public.</p><p>Korea's vision of green growth needs to lead to a second Saemaeul Undong, which can lay the firm foundation to overcome challenges and social obstacles through the combined efforts of all the people who can ultimately turn them into an opportunity for a new takeoff.</p><p>The movement was aimed at bringing prosperity by sharing the burden of neighbors not only for today's generation but also for the next one. As the movement gained momentum and grew as a nationwide campaign involving every citizen, it contributed to upgrading Korea into the ranks of advanced nations.</p><p>Against this backdrop, the Ministry of Environment initiated the \"Green Start Campaign\" so that green growth can take root as the second Saemaeul Undong. Businesses, government agencies and academia have jointly established a nationwide network and disseminated specific guidelines for green lifestyles such as green driving.</p><p>A green lifestyle greatly contributes to curbing GHG emissions and also preventing climate change-driven environmental problems, which threaten the existence of human beings.</p><p>The Korean government initiated the Green Start Campaign consisting of two networks. One is the Green Start National Network, comprising 40 institutions that manage local networks and gather the opinions of the member organizations. The other is the Green Start Local Networks made up of 224 local governments among a total of 248. Local governments and 5,000 organizations including public agencies, businesses, schools and civic groups are joining the Green Start Campaign.</p><p>Currently, the campaign is promoting 10 guidelines that can easily be applied to our daily life. Among them, first, the campaign encourages households to maintain temperatures of 26\u00a1\u00c9 or above during summer and 20\u00a1\u00c9 or below during winter, to replace conventional light bulbs with energy-saving ones and to keep appliances unplugged when they are not in use.</p><p>Second, the campaign encourages office-workers to wear clothes appropriate for the seasons, turn off lights and air conditioners during lunchtime and to re-use scrap paper for printing and copying.</p><p>Third, the campaign encourages retail shops to keep energy-saving guidelines, use energy-saving lights and recommend customers to use eco-friendly goods.</p><p>Fourth, the campaign asks construction firms to reduce air pollution and noise during work and build temporary offices suitable for energy-saving.</p><p>Fifth, the campaign calls for a green campus where lights are turned off when lecture rooms are not used and students use mugs instead of disposable paper cups.</p><p>With the Green Start Campaign, Korea wants the green revolution to take root in daily life. Furthermore, Korea will contribute to making the world greener so that the mankind and our planet Earth can coexist in harmony.</p><p>Based on the foundation that Korea has laid for green growth so far, Korea will make a leap forward in green growth in 2010. Korea should implement green growth policies and plans in a consistent and effective manner, thereby benefiting from tangible outcomes.</p><p>The public sector alone cannot not carry out this significant task - like the Saemaeul Undong, the government should take the lead and, at the same time, work together with all citizens as well as the business community.</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["In July 2009, Korea charted the National Strategy and Five-Year Plan for Green Growth, which integrates and specifies green growth-related policy goals and tasks.

Many financial institutions have already participated in international initiatives on green finance such as GRI Reporting, UNEP/FI, U.N.PRI, U.N. Global Compact and CDP.</p><p>Fund allocations for green finance have started, but there is a long way to go. For example, Korea Development Bank and Korea Eximbank announced plans to provide significant policy loans to green industries, but the actual lending thus far has been below the original expectations.</p><p>There are numerous plans, but the specific processing tools for providing money have not been fully established.

I want to propose several strategies for developing green finance in Korea.</p><p>Firstly, public consensus on the need for the development of green finance must be built up. Green finance must be recognized not as a matter of choice but a necessity.</p><p>Secondly, social infrastructure such as a regulatory, technical and human infrastructure must be set up. Concerning the regulatory infrastructure, it needs to reflect environmental concerns in the statutes for investment, lending, credit rating and accounting. Also, environmental information must be released and considered as a requirement for listing and disclosure. Additionally, certification of green technology, enterprises and industry must be introduced in order to guide investments and lending. The technical infrastructure such as \"Green Enterprise Index,\" \"Green (Carbon) Risk Index\" or \"Green Enterprising Rating Agency\" will be necessary, and human resources must be trained and educated to be knowledgeable about green finance</p><p>Thirdly, more green financial products must be created with support from the government. Financial institutions can develop new products that integrate environmental factors into existing products and develop combined green financial products.</p><p>The government can help to launch a fund or provide tax benefits to green investors in the early stages. Although the government can play a key role in the beginning, it is important to note that the end goal should be a green finance system that operates on market principles.</p><p>Lastly, an emission trading system must be established. The system must promote active trading and foster specialized financial institutions and products.

First of all, the steel maker claims that Dangjin is at the heart of South Korea where both the marine and land transportations are very convenient. \"Most domestic steel mills are located in remote areas at the corners of the nation, thus raising their logistics expenses. In comparison, Dangjin is at the center of the country to offer cost competitiveness,\" Lee said. \"Dangjin is the only place on the West Sea where large vessels of more than 200,000 tons can dock. See why other steel makers are selecting Dangjin where up to 200 start-ups sprout up every year.\" A few other local steel manufacturers such as Dongkuk Steel and Dongbu Steel also have their production lines there. HyundaiSteel expects that the new blast furnace with an annual capacity of 4 million tons will help jack up its annual turnover to 9.2 trillion won this year, up 15.3 percent from a year before. The upward trend is expected to gain a fresh momentum late this year when another blast furnace will start cranking out steel with the same capacity. Hyundai is thinking of adding a third one in 2015. Observers point out that the blast furnaces would bring economies of scope to the Hyundai-Kia Automotive Group, whose flagship affiliates of Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors combined to rise to the world's No. 6 last year. Economies of scope refer to efficiencies associated with different types of products that are related to one another. HyundaiSteel contends that economies of scope will be applied to the group thanks to its unique business portfolio. \"HyundaiSteel produces iron and steel, which will be finely cold-rolled by Hyundai Hysco so that Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors can produce vehicles with them. When the cars retire, they would create steel scrap, offering raw materials for HyundaiSteel's electric arc furnaces,\" Lee said. An electric arc furnace is a furnace that melts scrap metal with an electric arc to come up with second-tier steel products while a blast furnace is one that making first-rate steel products from iron ore. There is another benefit for the country's second-largest conglomerate to enjoy. Thus far, Hyundai Motor and Kia Motors have depended on steel from POSCO, the world's fourth-largest player, to secure high-quality steel to build vehicles because HyundaiSteel could not produce it with its electric arc furnaces.</p>", "publisher": "Korea Times", "instances": ["5 million tons a year. \"We have channeled some 8.

SACHS] One year after the financial crisis ", "published": "2009-08-29", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">NEW YORK - It is now almost a year since the world economy teetered on the edge of calamity. In the span of three days, Sept. 15-17, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, the mega-insurance company AIG was taken over by the U.S. government, and the failing Wall Street icon Merrill Lynch was absorbed by Bank of America in a deal brokered and financed by the U.S. government. Panic ensued and credit stopped circulating. Non-financial companies could not get working capital, much less funding for long-term investments. A depression seemed possible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, the storm has broken. Months of emergency action by the world's leading central banks prevented financial markets from crashing. When banks stopped providing short-term liquidity to other banks and industrial companies, central banks filled the gap. As a result, the major economies avoided a collapse of credit and production. The sense of panic has subsided. Banks are once again lending to each other.</p><p>Although the worst was avoided, much pain remains. The crisis culminated in a collapse of asset prices at the end of 2008. Middle-class and wealthy households around the world felt poorer and therefore cut their spending sharply. Sky-high oil and food prices added to the pain, and thus to the downturn. Enterprises could not sell their output, leading to production cuts and layoffs. Rising unemployment compounded the loss of household wealth, throwing families into deep economic peril and leading to further cutbacks in consumer spending.</p><p>The big problem now is that unemployment continues to rise in the U.S. and Europe, because growth is too slow to create enough new jobs. Dislocations are still being felt around the world.</p><p>A huge debate has ensued around the so-called \"stimulus spending\" in the U.S., Europe, and China. Stimulus spending aims to use higher government outlays or tax incentives to offset the decline in household consumption and business investment. In the U.S., for example, roughly one-third of the $800-billion two-year stimulus package comprises tax cuts (to stimulate consumer spending); one-third is public outlays on roads, schools, power, and other infrastructure; and one-third takes the forms of federal transfers to state and local governments for health care, unemployment insurance, school salaries, and the like.</p><p>Stimulus packages are controversial, because they increase budget deficits, and thus imply the need to cut spending or raise taxes sometime in the near future. The question is whether they successfully boost output and jobs in the short term, and, if so, whether they do enough to compensate for the inevitable budget problems down the road.</p><p>The true effectiveness of these packages is not clear. Suppose that the government gives a tax cut in order to increase consumers' take-home pay. If consumers expect that their taxes will rise in the future, they may decide to save the tax cut rather than boost consumption. In that case, the stimulus will have little positive effect on household spending, but will worsen the budget deficit.</p><p>An early assessment of the stimulus packages suggests that China's program has worked well. The sharp fall in China's exports to the U.S. has been compensated by a sharp rise in the Chinese government's spending on infrastructure - say, on subway construction in China's biggest cities.</p><p>In the U.S., the verdict is less clear. The tax cut has probably been saved rather than spent. The infrastructure component has not yet been spent because of long lags in turning the U.S. stimulus package into real construction projects. The third part - the transfer to state and local governments - almost surely has been successful in maintaining spending on schools, health, and the unemployed.</p><p>In short, the U.S. stimulus effects on spending have probably been positive but small, and without a decisive effect on the economy. Moreover, concerns about the enormous U.S. budget deficit, now running at $1.8 trillion (12 perent of GNP) per year, are bound to increase, not only creating enormous uncertainties in politics and financial markets, but also dimming consumer confidence as households focus their attention on potential future budget cuts and tax increases. The U.S. has reached the practical limits of reliance on short-term stimulus spending, and will need to start cutting the budget deficit and fostering alternative pathways to growth.</p><p>When the crisis deepened a year ago, Barrack Obama introduced into the presidential campaign the theme of a \"green recovery,\" based on a surge of investment in renewable energies, new electric vehicles, environmentally efficient \"green\" buildings, and ecologically sound agriculture. In the heat of the battle against financial panic, policy attention turned away from that green recovery. Now the U.S. needs to return to this important idea.</p><p>Debt-burdened consumers in the U.S. and Europe will limit their spending for years to come as they rebuild their wealth and pension assets. But the resulting economic slack gives us the historic opportunity - and need - to compensate for low consumer spending with increased investment spending on sustainable technologies.</p><p>Government policies in the U.S. and other rich countries should stimulate those investments through special incentives. These include a cap-and-trade system for greenhouse-gas emissions, subsidies for research and development on sustainable technologies, feed-in tariffs and regulatory incentives for renewable energy, consumer subsidies and other inducements for the uptake of new \"green\" technologies, and implementation of \"green\" infrastructure programs, such as mass transit.</p><p>The rich world should also provide the poorest countries with grants and low-interest loans to buy sustainable energy technologies, such as solar and geothermal power. Doing so would add to the global recovery, improve long-term environmental sustainability, and accelerate economic development.</p><p>The crisis can yet be an opportunity to turn from a path of financial bubbles and excessive consumption to a path of sustainable development. In fact, seizing this opportunity is the only recipe for genuine growth that we have left.</p><p>Jeffrey D.

Researchers from the Korea Research Institute for Human Settlements, a state-run institute committed to studying means of enhancing the use of national territory, will deal with about two dozen themes related to formulating the territorial development strategy. - Ed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Kim Dong-ju</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two megatrends are sweeping the world: globalization and action over climate change. As the spread of free trade agreements quickens trans-border economic openings all over the world, national economies are fast being integrated into one world economy. While the role of territorial nations is diminishing, regions are gaining ever-increasing importance. In the industrialization era, regional competitiveness rested on cities and industrial towns which were central bases of population and industry. Now, with the wave of economic liberalization, high-speed transportation and communications networks, and agglomeration of economic activity and living space, city-regions have emerged as the core geographic unit for regional development. Major countries are pushing forward policies centered on vast economic zones that link large cities and their surrounding suburbs - metropolitan areas in the United States, city-regions in the United Kingdom and metropolitan regions in Germany.</p><p>As climate change is becoming a worldwide phenomenon, sustainable economic growth with less emission of greenhouse gases has emerged as a major challenge. Countries are actively promoting green growth policies to revive their economies, protect the environment and improve living standards. While being key drivers of national prosperity, cities and their suburbs are also responsible for a considerable portion of energy consumption and heat-trapping gas emissions. Therefore, metropolises and city-regions are shaping up as crucial areas in green growth efforts.</p><p>These developments require a new paradigm for territorial and regional development, capable of turning the currents of economic liberalization and climate change into new opportunities for growth. To this end, Korea needs to nurture dynamic city-regions so that its policy of mega-regional economic zones can bear fruit. City-regions which shape around key metropolises will play the driving force of regional development by forming wide-area clusters massing together population, industries and economic activity. Metropolitan areas should also be turned into the forefronts of environmentally-friendly development so that they can play a key role in an emergent green growth economy.</p><p>Development of city-regions also requires policymakers to give up the conventional thinking framed in individual cities and regions. It demands a new perspective of a network economy and a new strategy for comprehensive development interconnecting economically and geographically close cities and regions. They should be recreated into international city-regions equipped with cutting-edge technology, vibrant green industries, flourishing culture and arts, and advanced living conditions. A broadly shared consensus on the need of city-regional development should be built. Policymakers must map out strategies for development tailored to characteristics of the broader mega-economic regions they belong to.</p><p>Development directions</p><p>Following are key policy directions for Korea's efforts to develop city-regions.</p><p>1) FTA-based global economic hub: As trans-border economic liberalization speeds up, inter-regional trade will be expanded, substituting trade flows among nations. As a result, city-regions will play an increasingly important role as the center of global trade networks involving business, production and consumption. With the advent of an era of inter-regional trade, city-regions must become free economic zones and be developed into a hub of capital, human resources and information.</p><p>2) Driver of mega-regional economic development: Specialized development of city-regions and the resulting simultaneous growth of core metropolises and their suburbs will advance the government's new initiative for the \"five-plus-two\" system of mega-regional economic zones and will contribute to strengthening the nation's territorial competitiveness.</p><p>3) Low-carbon, green growth hubs: Green growth management can be carried out more effectively when a multiple of adjacent local governments work together in operating, managing and monitoring transportation, the environment, water and energy resources than when individual cities separately conduct those tasks. Integration of diverse green assets at the city-regional level will maximize their utility for environmental protection and economic growth.</p><p>4) Center of \"soft network development.\" High-speed transport and information networks have enabled people to reach anywhere in the nation within a day and are activating direct exchanges with overseas markets. These will drive a major change in the nation's residential structure into one centered on city-regions equipped with global infrastructure and high standards of living. Policymakers should abandon the \"hard space\" framework of regional policies based on the existing administrative districts and should embrace a \"soft space\" perspective, which derives regional competitiveness from city-regions' diverse networking.</p><p>Development model</p><p>To fulfill their potential as globally competitive growth hubs, city-regions must build organic networks at intra-regional, inter-regional and global levels.</p><p>At the city-regional level, new growth centers including industrial complexes and FEZs as well as education, research and infrastructure should be developed in an integrative manner so that a city-region's overall capabilities can be maximized and its specialty be promoted.</p><p>In addition, industrial and infrastructural links within mega-regional economic zones and between city-regions should be enhanced so that city-regions could serve as growth centers of the mega economic regions that they belong to.</p><p>Globally, city-regions should boost their relations with Northeast Asia and other major economic blocs in industry, transport, logistics and tourism. They should either strengthen international infrastructure including airports and seaports, or improve their accessibility to those transport hubs.</p><p>Location</p><p>In general, the location and boundaries of city-regions is determined by consideration of population distribution, geographic proximity, commuting patterns, industrial structure, functional links, and historical and cultural aspects. In addition, city-regions aspiring to become global competition hubs must have accessibility to global transport networks and feature knowledge-based facilities, such as corporate headquarters and international financial institutions.</p><p>Taking these into account, metropolitan areas - interwoven metropolises and their hinterland cities and counties - as well as groups of smaller cities or new growth bases with great potential of integrated development - can be considered as city-regions. In designating city-regions, opinions of local communities should be sufficiently reflected and the overall process should be led by the regions involved.</p><p>Rather than starting with too many city-regions, the nation needs to focus on a small number of strategic places and increase the number over time, given that city-regions should drive mega-regional growth and enhance global competitiveness.</p><p>Development strategies</p><p>1) City-regions as free economic zones: With growth of inter-regional trade, city-regions should be the center of investment, trade and business. They should become FEZs with investment and living conditions that are attractive to multinational companies and their staff. The government needs to consider deregulations and advantages in land use and taxation that are more drastic and generous than those available in existing FEZs and corporate cities. Turning city-regions into FEZs will facilitate the spread of FEZs across the nation and lay the foundation for the nation's emergence in the future as a global growth hub.</p><p>2) City-regions as IBEC industrial valleys: City-regions should have industrial competitiveness based on highly converged IBEC technologies (information technology, biotechnology, energy and environmental technology, and cultural and content technology) in connection with leading growth engine projects of mega-regional economic zones. City-regions can also utilize IBEC technologies to upgrade existing industries, resulting in the enhancement of the city-regions' overall growth basis. To nurture new, innovative industry sectors, the three-way network of business, education and research should be enhanced, business clusters should be promoted and if necessary, industrial parks devoted to those sectors should be considered.</p><p>3) City-regions as global networks: City-regions should be linked to major global destinations through high-speed transport and logistics networks such as international airports and seaports. Also, effective transport networks should be built around city-regions to interconnect mega-regional economic zones. Wide-area transport networks that link major posts such as new growth bases of city-regions will boost the nation's overall transport efficiency. Improving management of wide-area transport needs at the city-regional level is also important. Intelligent transport networks like a smart highway based on IT-ET convergence as well as low-carbon, green transportation systems should be expanded. Comprehensive policy studies are needed for more effective connections of metropolitan and national transport networks.</p><p>4) City-regions as \"smart growth\" bases: City-regions' competitiveness greatly depends on capabilities of housing, education and medical welfare services. To attract high-quality businesses and talents from overseas and improve the living standards of residents, housing, education and medical services should be upgraded. Specialty high schools and foreign schools should be established so that distinguished personnel and their families would want to live there. Regional hospitals should grow globally competitive and more medical care facilities for foreigners should be established. City-regions should extend integrated educational, medical and cultural services to rural areas. Aging industrial complexes and hinterlands of KTX high-speed rail stations should be renovated as part of development of advanced creative city-regions. Old housing, industrial towns and ports should be refurbished with improvement in terms of economy, the environment, culture and landscape so that they can contribute to city-regions' image and economic vitality. Making the best use of KTX stations' role as centers of exchanges in and outside city-regions, multifunctional facilities for business and culture and mega-regional transit systems should be built around them.</p><p>5) City-regions linked to water space: We need a new paradigm of territorial and regional policies which looks at the synergy effect of linking water and spatial development. Almost all major cities in Korea have rivers and large streams running through them. More attention should be directed to water space-linked city-regional and mega-regional development. Both public-interest and economic functions of waterfront should be delivered by positioning public facilities, museums and galleries there. Historic and cultural belts can be formed utilizing regions' landmark facilities and historic and cultural sites. Facilities for leisure activities, sports and refreshment should be in place around the waterside to improve living conditions and promote regional development. Especially, rural towns close to rivers will be able to benefit from river tourism combining ecological villages, experience programs and accommodation facilities.</p><p>6) Resource-recycling green city-regions: Green growth policies should be implemented through city-regional cooperation. Based on a national strategy and five-year plans announced in July, detailed green growth plans at central and local levels are under consideration. At the metropolitan level, environmentally-friendly model sites are being established. Plans by sector - buildings, transport, water resources, urban development, etc. - are being prepared. Integrated green growth at regional and city-regional levels should be pursued through combination of strategies pertaining to cities and sectors. One example is the establishment of mega-regional transport networks that can save energy and cut carbon gas emissions. Facilities for solar and other renewable energy resources and resource-recycling systems for waste and water should be established and managed at city-regional and mega-regional levels. Diverse green assets dispersed in city-regions should be networked and integrated. Integrated city-regional planning and management of green infrastructure such as open space, rivers, streams and seashores will help improve resource efficiency and reduce energy consumption.</p><p>7) Global soft cooperation among city-regions: Networks for city-regional development should be expanded into partnerships with major city-regions around the world. Global city-regional cooperation can assume various forms depending on their economic, industrial and cultural characteristics. Such cooperation is exemplified by the relationship between Busan in the southern coastal region and Kyushu of Japan. Korea's western coastal city-regions are also establishing relations with their Chinese counterparts including Shanghai and Beijing- Tianjin city regions. City-regional cooperation with developing countries will focus on sharing knowledge and experience of Korea's industrialization. Policymakers need to consider setting up coordination channels and working group meetings to explore global city-regional partnerships. Such city-regional cooperation will catalyze trans-border common growth across the world.</p><p>Future practical tasks</p><p>With the global rise of city-regions, Korea should promptly establish city-regional development plans. The most urgent tasks are:</p><p>First, the government should establish basic guidelines for promotion of city-regions and push for city-regional development strategies corresponding to the characteristics of each mega-regional economic zone.</p><p>Second, those strategies should be tailored to city-regions' competitive capabilities in consideration of diverse factors including their scale and industrial characteristics.</p><p>Third, an effective cooperative system is needed between the central administration and local governments. The latter should take the lead and former should play a supportive role in the city-regional policy process.</p><p>Fourth, metropolitan and provincial governments and lower-level city and county governments should share the cost of developing city-regions, while the central government needs to consider providing support through the national balanced development budget and other related expenditures.</p><p>Lastly, an institutional foundation for the formation and development of city-regions should be promptly established through related law revisions.</p><p>City-regional strategies should shift Korea's regional development from a mosaic type characterized by spatial divisions to a network type defined by links and integration of regions and sectors. Moreover, it will enhance Korea's geographical competitiveness by breaking away from the hub-and-spoke territorial structure - based on a dual structure of the Capital Region and the rest of the nation - and reshaping it into a polycentric hub-and-hub structure.</p>", "publisher": "The Korea Herald", "instances": ["Facilities for solar and other renewable energy resources and resource-recycling systems for waste and water should be established and managed at city-regional and mega-regional levels.

Some politicians, scholars and environmentalists, albeit a minority, began questioning if Korea should stay as dependent on nuclear energy as it is now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Amid severe shortages of electricity and doubts over nuclear power, the need for energy efficiency and renewable energy is likely to emerge as a subject of public interest once again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Global Green Growth Institute (GGGI), an international organization promoting sustainable economic development, held a summit in Songdo, Incheon, in early June. The summit focused on the practical side of green growth including policy, innovations and finance.</p><p>In many countries, renewable energy sources are cheaper solutions than fossil fuel options, but investment from both the public and private sectors is far from adequate.</p><p>The Korea Times' Business Focus interviewed the world's leading experts about the financial barriers facing green industries in an attempt to draw more investments, especially from the private sector. The interviewees are: Bloomberg New Energy Finance Chief Executive Officer Michael Liebreich; Dominic Waughray, head of environmental initiatives at World Economic Forum; Vikram Widge, head of climate finance and policy at International Finance Corporation and Mark Halle, vice president of the International Institute for Sustainable Development.</p><p>The experts suggested that public money should be used as leverage to make investments less risky for the private sector and attract more private money. Furthermore, subsidies for fossil fuel should be removed so that renewables can compete in the same market..</p><p>The interviews were conducted individually and compiled. The questions and answers were edited.</p><p>Q: How would you assess the current state of financing for green growth?</p><p>A Dominic Waughray: The current state of financing for green growth is actually reasonably vibrant over the last decade. Over $210 billion was invested into clean energy from private sources last year. Although this is 11 percent down from 2011, it's still a huge increase over the last decade.</p><p>Interestingly, if you look at the flow of financing from South to South in green investment, it increased quite dramatically ? it's up 47 percent every year over the last decade. Last year was the first time when more financing in green investment flew from South to South than from North to South. In the U.S., less investments may have to do with shale gas, while in Europe, the financial crisis led to removing subsidies for renewable energy. But in countries like China, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico or many other emerging countries, there is a much more vibrant sector. This might be where the growth would be in the longer run.</p><p>Michael Liebreich: First of all, it's a difficult question because there is no accepted definition of green growth. We have very specific datasets we gather in renewable energy and energy efficiency, and there is no controversy. You also have to bear in mind that public transportation or high-rise buildings are also more efficient than private vehicles and lot of small buildings. Is that green growth?</p><p>But to answer your question, no, it's not sufficient. It is a dangerous time, in a sense, because investment flow into clean energy had been growing but dropped last year. The debate in many countries is quite controversial, particularly around climate change.</p><p>Vikram Widge: I think we are doing a lot, but it's not enough. Even our institution, which deals with investment in the private sector, has increased our climate-related financing by 25 percent from 2012 to this year. But we still have a long way to go. The world at large has a long way to go.</p><p>Q: Investment into clean energy has traditionally flown from developed countries to developing countries? Are developing countries doing enough?</p><p>A Liebreich: The North-to-South flow in clean energy we tracked last year and in 2011 has changed a little bit, but is broadly $10 billion a year. In China, $65 billion was invested in clean energy, and most of it was Chinese money. Out of $8 billion invested in South Africa, probably more than half of that was South African money.</p><p>In terms of mitigating emissions, big industrialized or industrializing countries including Indonesia, Malaysia, Iran and Saudi Arabia have a huge population and are very dependent on petrochemical for everything, leaving huge footprints. They clearly need to do much more.</p><p>There is still the view that the developing world wants to do what the rich world has done. We will be in trouble if that's the direction of development. There is an opportunity to leapfrog to much better housing solutions, city design, use of public transport and energy technology. And that's green growth.</p><p>Mark Halle: There is an enormous investment in green growth projects in the developing world. Opportunities are there because they are not overly invested in the wrong kind of energy. They have opportunities to, in a sense, leapfrog from the situation where there isn't much energy available straight to clean energy, without passing through the phase of conventional energy. But to do that, they need to be assisted.</p><p>The real problem is within least developed countries. In those countries, we have to recognize the number one priority is providing energy access.</p><p>For any countries looking to provide its population with access to modern energy, you need to understand that the strategy should be a mix of renewable solutions and conventional ones. For example, an African country that produces oil could use the gas produced along with oil and together with renewable energy at an optimal ratio that gives the country energy access as quickly as possible.</p><p>Q: What do you think are the barriers for green growth financing, especially in the private sector?</p><p>A Widge: It's clear to me that clean energy is always cheaper than what you call dirty energy. People worry about the fact that you have to pay extra for clean energy. Fossil fuel subsidies are artificially lowering prices, but it has been accepted as normal over the decades.</p><p>I say this not as a representative of a multilateral institution but as a global citizen. We are looking at unprecedented changes in our climate if we stay at the emission rate we are at now. I think we have probably five years to take significant action if we are going to start to reverse this thing.</p><p>Halle: The principle barrier, if you want to sum it up in one word, is risk. Private investors put money into what they believe is going to yield good return in a short period of time. A lot of investment into the green growth area is still uncertain and it is still in competition with conventional investments, some of which have the government's support. Green growth would be less risky if the environmental policies surrounding it were stable.</p><p>Liebreich: There are a lot of situations where clean energy or energy efficiency would be a much better economic solution but many investors are not familiar with funding these approaches.</p><p>The issue in the financial sector is that the regulation of the banks and pension funds, the roles of rating agencies and so on don't push innovation. They are conservative and slow down change.</p><p>Plus, there are a lot of different things taking place around the world. In Korea the push is green growth. The big issue in Europe is the fiscal crises, which overwhelm any discussion. It reduced Europe's ability to act on green growth, clean energy or almost any other issues.</p><p>It's a granular picture.</p><p>Business Focus: Could you elaborate on the obstacles in the financial industry?</p><p>Liebreich: The easiest example is that the scientists have established how much carbon is emitted into the atmosphere, but if you look at the balance sheet of the 100 largest coal and oil companies, the carbon they have on their balance sheet is three times as much. These are financial assets that are valued on their balance sheets.</p><p>Actually, you cannot use all of them because if you burn them all, it will cause a very unstable climate environment. So there is a mismatch between the financial system, which says these are all good assets and the physical system of our planet that says you cannot burn that. Why is it an asset when you cannot use it?</p><p>Waughray: The first point is to realize the scale of the challenge for greening our infrastructure including transportation, energy and water system. The cost of just providing finance for all of the basic infrastructure, we estimate at the World Economic Forum, is about a trillion dollars a year through to 2020. To provide an extra incentive for green infrastructure will be another 0.7 trillion dollars. It's money that cannot be found from public sources alone, and one has to figure out how to attract private investors into this space.</p><p>Now the challenge is it fills a new class of asset. It doesn't feel like a traditional road or rail project, so it's difficult for investors to know if they'll get a return on their investment. They may feel that it is a passing phase and in 10 years nobody will be building solar panels.</p><p>The trick is to use the limited public money to bring down the risks. It might be a guarantee that the government will purchase energy from new clean energy power stations. It might be a political guarantee that the policies won't change over 20 years. It might be a new kind of mechanism that blends public money with private money, like offering a reimbursement for the first loss.</p><p>Our estimation is that if you blend public and private investments and brought down some of these risks, you could possibly attract four to five times as much private money as the public money invested.</p><p>In developing countries, in particular, private money coming into the country for infrastructure will be a positive addition on the GDP and create growth and jobs, unlike aid money, which is always off the balance sheet and doesn't have positive impact on the GDP.</p><p>And, of course, private capital is not sentimental. New green projects have to be really bankable and pass all the tests that all the normal projects would have to pass. It's not a subsidy. This has to be market-credible.</p><p>Q: What would be the ultimate cause for private companies to invest more into green growth?</p><p>A Waughray: The leadership, I would say. All of this is like psychology. When one thing happens, the ecosystem starts to change.</p><p>Imagine if the CEOs of 20 large institutional investors, pension funds and sovereign wealth funds demanded they put 20 percent of their assets into long-term green investment. That would really shift the market because asset managers would try to create suiting funds, developers will see lots of money in the projects and politicians would try to attract the money into their country or province.</p><p>Some of those asset owners might feel it actually depends on political leadership, so it should be a combination of leadership from both institutional investors and politicians.</p><p>It might not be that you need everybody, like the United Nations, to do this. If you had a coalition of committed members like G20, it could be quite powerful.</p><p>Halle: Getting coherence into the set of policy signals given to investors. We all believe we all need to move toward clean energy. At the same time, we are using government money to subsidize fossil fuels in many countries. We are actually paying people to use more fossil fuel, therefore, making it hard for renewables to compete on the same playing field. One of the things we need to do most urgently is to start getting rid of what we call perverse incentives.</p><p>Business Focus: In the U.S, leaders were denying climate change. At this moment, are world leaders agreeing that climate change is happening and the need to come up with measures?</p><p>Halle: I think many in leadership positions do and the question is, how you can make that a politically successful strategy? Most politicians that I know respond when there is a strong demand from electorates. If there are not, then they listen more carefully to organized interest groups. In the U.S., the fossil fuel industry is very well organized; they are successful in communicating with politicians. You have to counter that by gathering people with interest in the renewable industry.</p><p>You see it many times with consumer issues. There is no tolerance for unsafe products for heavy metal in food or for child labor. They to be very difficult to correct and all of a sudden they changed completely.</p><p>Liebriech: It's one of the responsibilities of the government to price externalities. The cheapest option may be building a coal-fired power plant outside Seoul, but we would use regulation or finance incentives to force cleaner or green growth solutions. Right now there are many things that make sense like geothermal energy, rooftop solar panels in any sunny country, good onshore wind farms and energy efficiency.</p><p>In Spain, Bulgaria and Greece, the regulators, which provide a source of funding so that investors commit capital, change the rules. One of the frustrations in this discussion is that these retroactive changes are entirely self-inflicted. These policy makers decided to encourage this development but they have not been able to make it stick politically or they make mistakes. It's simply political ineffectiveness, political inaptitude.</p><p>Business Focus: Under former President Lee Myung-bak, the economic policy focus was green growth. Under President Park Geun-hye, it is now a 'creative economy.'</p><p>Liebriech: There is a difference between shifting emphasis and retroactively changing terms of a particular project. Shifting emphasis is not great, to be honest, but it's not as bad as initially promising to pay 10 cents per kWh for wind power and now pay just 8 cents. That is really corrosive.</p><p>When I was here two years ago, it was impressive to see big Korean companies focusing and developing offshore wind technology and you've got some very substantial engineering companies. Let's hope that Korean companies remain focused. Hang on a second. Is this a creative economy because of Psy? Suddenly because Gangnam Style, you don't care about green growth? You can do green growth and Gangnam Style. There is enough capital to fund both.</p><p>Business Focus: In a creative economy, the government wants to merge information and communications technology and science to further develop value-added industries and create jobs.</p><p>Liebriech: You mean additive manufacturing. Then I am much more comfortable. If you combine material science, nanotechnology and bioscience, you have an opportunity to produce services and products with much less impact. With 3D printing, for example, you could potentially save an enormous amount of energy and footprint.</p><p>Q: What would be the most ideal form of green growth financing you envision at this moment?</p><p>A Widge: The perceived higher cost of green growth can be offset by the benefits you get both in terms of resilience and in terms of development impacts.</p><p>Let's take energy access as an example. There is a lot of cooking stove and water filtration projects in developing countries. In these cases, green substitutes are not only sustainable but also have improved health. As women have to collect less firewood, that improves the use of their time, which is a gender benefit. Furthermore, the cooking stove would emit less smoke and improve the health of women in the households who tend to inhale smoke.</p><p>If you start pricing these benefits correctly, you will find that the cost of the green substitutes isn't actually higher than that of the old ones. The problem is that we undervalue these benefits. There are both positive and negative externalities.</p><p>The government has to fix its policies. Gender and health benefits from the green stoves should be valued by the government, which should have the incentives for the private sector to deliver them. That's the public and private partnership.</p><p>Waughray: Right now we need to get more large-scale projects going, particularly in developing countries to show that there is a market and there is a return on the investment.</p><p>International Finance Corporation (IFC) has a model for what they call Climate Catalyst Fund, which blends government money and money in the form of equity from asset owners. You can pull this money together and chop it up into pieces and asset manager of that piece of equity to raise debt against, using the triple A rated balance sheet of IFC. Asset managers can likely get three to four times in debt compared to the equity slice they have. Then they have a fund that can deliver projects.</p><p>In addition to the combination of private and public expertise to manage this fund, you would link them to strengthen market trades between countries that benefit from the fund. That model is similar to how Marshall Plan that was constructed after World War II to rebuild Europe. It was not an aid transfer from the U.S. to Europe. It was a public-private construction of the infrastructure fund managed jointly by the public and private sectors.</p><p>Halle: The ideal form of financing is the market. We need to use every public policy instrument to make sure that the solution they choose for financial reasons is the same solution that's best for the future of our society. We need to ensure that green growth projects give investors the best rewards.</p><p>There are three specific suggestions to achieve this. The first one is to get rid of subsidies to fossil fuel because they are tilting the playing field. The second is to use the power of the government, particularly government procurement, to send the market signals to favor the green sector. The government should purchase 15 to 20 percent, sometimes more than that, of goods and services in the economy. If the government decides they will only purchase those products compatible with green growth, it will create the market, eliminating the tipping point and expanding market. The final thing is the government needs to look at the current distortion in the market. Many countries have monopolies in distribution of the energy. All of these things have falsified the market. It's not a question of allowing investors to make a maximum return on their money.
