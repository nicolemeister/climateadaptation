Critically, they are cost-effective and inclusive, especially when communities are involved in their design and upkeep.</p><h>How to tackle Kolkata floods?</h><p>Our recent study from the TERI School of Advanced Studies assessed the socio-economic viability of NBSs in two contrasting areas: Maheshtala and Rabindra Sarobar Lake. Using household surveys and ex-ante cost-benefit analysis (CBA), we explored public awareness, perceived benefits, and the long-term financial feasibility of NBS interventions.</p><p>In Maheshtala, a flood-prone municipality with ten irrigation canals connected to the Hooghly River, we proposed a localised version of the Dutch \"Room for River\" model. Restoration activities such as canal dredging, waste removal, and rainwater harvesting aim to reduce waterlogging and improve water quality. More than 70 per cent of surveyed households expressed willingness to pay higher municipal taxes for these interventions. The project showed a positive net present value (NPV) of Rs 22.4 million at a 2 per cent social discount rate, reflecting a long-term outlook that values sustainability and resilience.</p><p>At Rabindra Sarobar, a prominent urban lake in southern Kolkata, we proposed ecological restoration including de-siltation, tree planting, de-concretisation, and local rainwater harvesting. While better maintained, the lake faces issues like declining water levels and pollution. About 60 per cent of respondents, primarily educated visitors, were willing to voluntarily contribute to conservation efforts. The intervention had a positive NPV of Rs 3.3 million at a 19 per cent social discount rate, indicating strong short-term returns, likely due to the lake's visibility and recreational value.</p><p>Despite differences, both sites showed strong public recognition of NBSs as effective flood solutions. In Maheshtala, daily struggles with flooding drove support; around Rabindra Sarobar, the emphasis was on ecological preservation. The common thread was public willingness to support sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>However, implementing NBS citywide comes with challenges. Land acquisition, bureaucratic coordination, and public scepticism can delay progress. Our study also found that perceived risks, such as displacement, significantly reduced willingness to pay. Transparent planning and early community involvement are, therefore, essential.</p><p>The case for NBSs in Kolkata is not just ecological; it's economic and strategic. Climate change is intensifying extreme rainfall, exposing the limitations of outdated grey infrastructure. NBSs can bridge this gap. By integrating them into urban planning through tax incentives, zoning reforms, and civil society partnerships, Kolkata can become more resilient and livable. Kolkata is still green; we need to preserve the green corridors to enhance the city's resilience.</p><p>As climate risks escalate, the question is no longer whether to act, but how. The answer lies in nature. By investing in NBSs today, we can create a safer, greener Kolkata, one that is prepared not just for the next monsoon, but for the future.</p><p>Pandey is a Junior Research Associate at Ashoka Centre for a People-Centric Energy Transition (ACPET).

Brazil will have a total of US 247 million in investments to promote forest restoration and expand the use of nature -based solutions in the country. The Investment Plan of the Nature, People and Climate (NPC) program of Climate Investment Funds-CIF) funds was approved on Thursday, 27/2, during a meeting of the Fund Committee.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The plan foresees US 47 million in CIF concession resources, combined with US 100 million from the Climate Fund, via National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES), and US 100 million from the World Bank, which will be directed to the private sector to fund Amazon and Cerrado restoration projects.</p><p>The CIF NPC program supports the development of nature -based solutions to the confrontation of climate change, promoting the restoration of ecosystems and the strengthening of resilience of rural populations. With a global budget of US 400 million, the program recognizes the interdependence between land use, climate crisis and the means of subsistence of communities, encouraging countries to implement projects that combine mitigation and adaptation in an integrated way.</p><p>The Secretariat of International Affairs of the Ministry of Finance, in the role of Focal Point of the CIF in Brazil, coordinated the elaboration of the Brazilian Investment Plan and the articulation between the actors involved. The development of the plan was led by the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB), as a technical focal point of NPC Brazil, and was attended by the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change (MMA), BNDES, World Bank and Inter -American Development Bank (IDB).</p><p>The Brazilian plan will be implemented by BNDES, which will grant credit to the private sector to boost investments in forest restoration and sustainable productive chains. The goal is to transform degraded areas of the Tocantins-Araguaia Basin, known as the deforestation arch, into a new restoration arch, contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, recovery of native vegetation and creation of new economic opportunities. The plan foresees the restoration of 54,000 hectares of forests, with an estimated impact on a reduction of up to 7.75 million tons of CO2 and the generation of up to 21,000 direct and indirect jobs.</p><p>The Undersecretary of Financing to Sustainable Development of the Ministry of Finance, Ivan Oliveira, celebrated the approval of the investment plan and highlighted its importance for the advancement of forest restoration in Brazil. Restoration of degraded ecosystems is one of the fundamental strategies for facing the climate crisis and strengthening the resilience of territories and communities. With this plan, we are enabling an innovative financing model that reduces the cost of capital, increases the scale and encourages the private sector to act as a protagonist in the countrys environmental recovery, he said.</p><p>NPC Brazil is the First Investment Plan approved within the scope of the CIF Strategic Climate Fund (SCF) with 100% focus in the private sector. This innovative model uses blended financial financing to leverage investments in restoration and encourage the participation of companies in environmental recovery initiatives. In addition to reducing financial costs for credit borrowers, the program will promote the development of restoration productive chains, generating jobs and income for local communities. Additionally, for the first time, the ICF will direct resources to investments in the Brazilian Amazon, expanding its performance in the country and aligning itself with national policies, such as the National Plan for Native Vegetation Recovery (Planaveg). The version approved by the Fund underwent public consultation, ensuring an inclusive and collaborative process in this fundamental initiative for the advancement of nature -based solutions in Brazil.

According to news reporting from Gujarat, India, by NewsRx journalists, research stated, \"Ravine land is one of the most degraded lands which results from extreme soil erosion. The soil fertility in these lands is low which affects plant survival, making the cultivation of arable crops impractical.\" </p><p><br/> The news correspondents obtained a quote from the research from Research Center, \"However, with the use of soil moisture conservation (SMC) techniques, the productivity of these areas can be significantly enhanced. The present study aims to rehabilitate the ravine area by combining aromatic grass, tree planting, and SMC techniques. We hypothesized that silvo-aromatic system combined with SMC measures will lead to significant improvements in CO-sequestration, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil quality. The study involves planting Malabar neem (Melia dubia) along with lemon grass (Cymbopogon flexuosus) using a modified planting technique and SMC measures in seven different treatments in a randomized complete block design (RCBD). The effect of each treatment on soil health, productivity, and carbon sequestration was measured for six years (2019-2024). Results of the study revealed that the silvo-aromatic system (MLP) significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved the total tree biomass and total CO-sequestration with a 255 % increase over sole Melia (SMD). MLP performed statistically similar (P &lt; 0.05) with Melia under modified micro site + lemon grass (MLM) in increasing soil nitrogen (N) by 78.1 %, phosphorus (P) by 73.2 %, potassium (K) by 78.5 %, and soil organic carbon (SOC) by 79.3 %, compared to untreated fallow land. Under MLP, there was an observed increase soil microbial biomass carbon (93.8 mg kg), soil binding factor (598), soil moisture (24.9 %), treated-soil quality index (151.1), and CO-sequestration rate (0.98 Mg ha yr). Therefore, it is recommended that silvo-aromatic system may be an environmentally friendly way to achieve land degradation neutrality.\" <br/> According to the news reporters, the research concluded: \"It has greater potential for the restoration of ravine lands, enhancing land productivity, and lessening the effects of soil erosion, especially in Western India.\" <br/> This research has been peer-reviewed. <br/> For more information on this research see: Nature-based solutions for enhancing CO2 sequestration and rehabilitating degraded lands through silvo-aromatic system and soil moisture conservation techniques.

By hosting COP30 in Belem, Brazil aims to directly link climate policies with poverty reduction and forest conservation.How Belem\ufffd\u20ac\u2122s location reflects the urgency and challenges of COP30Location and infrastructure challenges \ufffd\u20ac\u201c COP30 will be held in Belem, Brazil, which is already struggling with infrastructure and accommodation. The city\ufffd\u20ac\u2122s high hotel prices, lack of enough rooms, and the use of cruise ships to host delegates highlight how climate negotiations intersect with real-world social and economic issues.Key focus on climate action \ufffd\u20ac\u201c COP30 is an important milestone for the Paris Agreement, where countries must update their climate action plans (NDCs) to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The event emphasises urgent global cooperation to limit warming to 1.5\u00b0C.Symbolism of Belem \ufffd\u20ac\u201c Choosing Belem, a city near the Amazon rainforest and marked by poverty, symbolises the need to connect climate action with social justice, deforestation control, and sustainable development.COP30 pushes for $1.3 trillion climate finance to support vulnerable nationsAnother key priority is climate finance. The $1.3 trillion annual funding roadmap is under discussion to help vulnerable nations adapt to climate impacts and shift to clean energy as reported by Associated Press (AP). Developing countries argue that they contribute the least to global emissions yet suffer the most from floods, droughts, and rising sea levels. COP30 aims to strengthen commitments for equitable financial support, ensuring no country is left behind in the climate transition.Amazon protection and nature-based solutions take center stage at COP30The Amazon rainforest, spanning multiple countries but largely within Brazil, is a critical carbon sink. Its deforestation, however, has reached alarming levels, at times turning parts of the Amazon into net carbon emitters. COP30 will prioritize:Halting illegal deforestationRestoring degraded ecosystemsIncentivizing sustainable land use practicesStrengthening indigenous land rightsThis focus aligns with the growing recognition that nature-based solutions are essential to achieving climate targets.Adding momentum, the United Nations\ufffd\u20ac\u2122 top court recently declared that access to a clean and healthy environment is a basic human right. This ruling strengthens arguments that states have a legal duty to reduce emissions and protect ecosystems. According to court President Yuji Iwasawa: \ufffd\u20ac\u0153Failure of a state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system may constitute an internationally wrongful act.\ufffd\u20acThis legal shift could influence COP30 negotiations, pushing countries toward stronger and enforceable climate commitments.Vision for COP30: A \ufffd\u20ac\u0153Summit of Solutions\ufffd\u20acDo Lago envisions COP30 as a turning point:\ufffd\u20ac\u0153We hope to be remembered as the COP of solutions, where people realized climate action creates opportunities and growth rather than sacrifice.\ufffd\u20acBy holding the summit in Belem\ufffd\u20ac\u201dwhere poverty, deforestation, and climate risk intersect\ufffd\u20ac\u201dorganizers aim to keep discussions grounded and outcomes impactful.

For this, NBS EduWORLD will create an NBS community that facilitates synergies between NBS professionals and education providers and ensures free and easy access to NBS knowledge and resources for all. To achieve this goal, NBS EduWORLD will summarise the state of play of NBS education in Europe and evaluate the initiatives already in place, determine how to expand and replicate them and establish a basis and framework for the project itself and future initiatives, resulting in guidance and (policy) recommendations. In parallel, the project will analyse NBS demonstrators, with an educational dimension (Tier-1), across Europe (NBS EduSystems), to support the testing and improvement of approaches and resources with NBS demonstrators with no or a limited educational dimension (Tier-2) and create the means and opportunities for all NBS practitioners to engage with educators, inter alia via Tier-3 NBS EduSystems. This will be done whilst supporting the overarching goal of promoting NBS as a viable career prospect for European citizens of all ages. To adequately engage educators who are at different points on their NBS journey, the project will provide specific activities for those who are not yet familiar with the concept and benefits of NBS, and those already aware but in need of support to progress to the next stage. These activities will be scaled up/out by extensive dissemination and communication activities to maximise the projects outreach and ensure its long-term success. Only by joining with NBS experts + Education Experts + Civil Society + supportive policies can we create an NBS EduWORLD - a community that makes a difference.</p><p><br/>Major organization : EUN PARTNERSHIP AISBL</p><p><br/>Address : Rue De Treves 61</p><p>1040 Bruxelles / Brussel</p><p>Belgium</p><p><br/>Country :Belgium<br/>Financier : EUROPEAN UNION (EU),</p><p><br/>Financier address : Financier Address: European Union (Eu) Rue De La Loi 200/Wetstraat 200, B-1049 Bruxelles/Brussels, Belgium Tel: 32-2-2999696, 2993085 Fax: 32-2-2961749 Ec.Europa.Eu/</p>", "publisher": "TendersInfo - Project Notices", "instances": ["Nature-Based Solutions Education NetworkBuilding A Nature-Based Solutions Futurenature-Based Solutions (Nbs) Are Means Of Mitigating Socio-Environmental Challenges Through Sustainable Management Of Natural Features And Ecosystem Services.

While Chennai is making steady progress through its climate action plans and green initiatives, the study highlights the need for further steps to tackle challenges such as heatwaves and flash floods.<br/> The research indicated that in selected wards, implementing green spaces, urban farms, permeable pavements and restored wetlands could significantly improve resilience to urban flooding. These measures would also help mitigate heat stress, reduce pollution and enhance overall liveability.<br/> Many proposed ideas are simple and cost-effective. For instance, in North Chennai wards, converting bare concrete rooftops into low-cost, low-maintenance gardens could increase local green cover by over 70 per cent. This would cool some of the city's hottest and most densely populated areas. In addition to reducing temperatures, rooftop gardens can absorb rainwater and provide household produce.<br/> Streets can also contribute to climate resilience. The report notes that switching to permeable surfaces in flood-prone areas would allow rainwater to seep into the ground, helping to recharge groundwater and reduce waterlogging.<br/>Chennai's wetlands form another essential part of the solution. Neighbourhood lakes and river catchments can act as natural sponges, absorbing stormwater and filtering pollutants. Preserving and expanding these ecosystems would not only protect against flooding but also support birds, fish and other native wildlife.<br/> The report cites existing on-ground initiatives that have demonstrated success. For example, the Chennai Urban Farming Initiative has introduced rooftop and mobile gardens in schools, homes and homeless shelters. These help cool buildings, grow food and create learning opportunities and jobs-especially for women and young people. In a city with limited land, using rooftops effectively is a smart and inclusive strategy.<br/> \"These changes require investment. We estimate that around \u20b92,203 crore would be needed to put key nature-based solutions into action across selected wards in the city,\" the report said. It also noted that the potential economic benefits, such as reduced flood damage, could yield annual savings of over \u20b9500 crore-meaning the investment could be recovered in just over four years.<br/> What makes the approach especially appealing is its flexibility. Projects can start small-such as a community wetland park or a few green rooftops-and scale up over time. The aim is not to overhaul the entire city at once, but to create context-specific solutions developed in collaboration with communities.<br/> Lakshmi Menon, Senior Analyst in the Adaptation and Risk Analysis group at CSTEP, said: \"In cities like Chennai and Mangaluru, even modest ward-level investments in green infrastructure can yield substantial long-term savings and ecological benefits.

Many proposed ideas are simple and cost-effective.", "Chennai, which frequently experiences heavy rains and floods, could save around \u20b9500 crore in reduced flood damages and co-benefits each year by investing \u20b92,203 crore in key nature-based solutions across selected city wards, according to a study by the Center for Study of Science, Technology and Policy (CSTEP). Nature-based solutions must be embedded in planning, budgeting and policy processes rather than treated as standalone initiatives, said the report titled Urban Greenprints: Leveraging Nature-based Solutions (NbS) to Address Urban Climate Risks. While Chennai is making steady progress through its climate action plans and green initiatives, the study highlights the need for further steps to tackle challenges such as heatwaves and flash floods. The research indicated that in selected wards, implementing green spaces, urban farms, permeable pavements and restored wetlands could significantly improve resilience to urban flooding. These measures would also help mitigate heat stress, reduce pollution and enhance overall liveability. Many proposed ideas are simple and cost-effective. For instance, in North Chennai wards, converting bare concrete rooftops into low-cost, low-maintenance gardens could increase local green cover by over 70 per cent.", "The report cites existing on-ground initiatives that have demonstrated success. For example, the Chennai Urban Farming Initiative has introduced rooftop and mobile gardens in schools, homes and homeless shelters. These help cool buildings, grow food and create learning opportunities and jobs-especially for women and young people. In a city with limited land, using rooftops effectively is a smart and inclusive strategy. \"These changes require investment. We estimate that around \u20b92,203 crore would be needed to put key nature-based solutions into action across selected wards in the city,\" the report said. It also noted that the potential economic benefits, such as reduced flood damage, could yield annual savings of over \u20b9500 crore-meaning the investment could be recovered in just over four years. What makes the approach especially appealing is its flexibility. Projects can start small-such as a community wetland park or a few green rooftops-and scale up over time. The aim is not to overhaul the entire city at once, but to create context-specific solutions developed in collaboration with communities. Lakshmi Menon, Senior Analyst in the Adaptation and Risk Analysis group at CSTEP, said: \"In cities like Chennai and Mangaluru, even modest ward-level investments in green infrastructure can yield substantial long-term savings and ecological benefits.", "It also noted that the potential economic benefits, such as reduced flood damage, could yield annual savings of over \u20b9500 crore-meaning the investment could be recovered in just over four years.

Today this region is reeling under immense pressure from forest loss, desertification and climate change linked to large-scale land use change and development projects. Climate change is warming the region faster than the rest of the world - already reaching 1.3 degrees of warming against 1.1 degrees average elsewhere. This has led to accelerated glacial melt, altering precipitation patterns and affecting the systems that support biodiversity, soil regeneration and water-cycling ecosystem services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a result, rural communities are dealing with increasing displacement, loss of lives and livelihoods, human-wildlife conflict, declining agricultural productivity, damaged infrastructure affecting access to basic services etc and more.

By protecting, restoring and sustainably managing critical ecosystems, their overall resilience is enhanced, increasing their ability to diffuse external shocks and thus reduce impacts not only on communities, but also on business supply chains. Some of the common methods include afforestation, landscape restoration, wetland management and more.</p><p>Data suggests that NbS could provide 37% of the mitigation needed by 2030 to meet the Paris Agreement targets. This could be done by restoring degraded lands into forests which could help sequester carbon from air. In the context of the Eastern Himalayas, NbS grounded in local ecosystems and indigenous practices like Community Conserved Areas (CCAs) in Arunachal Pradesh or the restoration of wetlands in Kaziranga National Park, Assam could help build climate resilience, promote conservation and enhance community well-being.</p><p>Importance of NbS in the Eastern Himalayan Region</p><p>The ecological vulnerability of India's Eastern Himalaya makes NbS an imperative for the region which is abundant in natural resources and hosts diverse communities that have adapted to the changing environment using NbS in some or the other forms. More systematic investment in these practices are needed, to take them from piecemeal community solutions to large-scale landscape interventions that can truly help mitigate some of the biggest challenges facing India's Eastern Himalaya: declining agricultural productivity, increasing extreme weather events and desertification.</p><p>The region has a rich body of traditional ecosystem and conservation practices that can be leveraged to transform its trajectory. Community forest management systems in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya, for example, have the potential to create both food and ecological security when designed in balance. The Apatani community in Arunachal Pradesh, for example, demonstrate how an integrated land management approach with forests and agri-systems designed together can provide for both livelihoods while regenerating soils.</p><p>Leveraging agroforestry traditionally practiced in jhum (shifting cultivation) lands, while moving away from the shifting cultivation method, could allow time for soil in farmlands in these areas to regenerate. Similarly scientific restoration and conservation of critical wetland ecosystems and forests alongside riverine ecosystems could mitigate the increasing flood damage faced by Assam every year, by selecting native trees that bind soil and reduce erosion - while enhancing the capacity of wetlands to absorb and percolate rain and floodwater into the water table, rather than facing immense run-off as is the current situation.</p><p>Challenges and Opportunities</p><p>Implementing NbS in India's Eastern Himalayas is easier said than done. The region faces some key challenges in its adoption across the region. For one, limited evidence exists to indicate how large-scale investments in NbS can provide downstream outcomes for communities and businesses. While investment is needed to scale up these solutions, investment is simultaneously needed in the research to establish the benchmarks for NbS impacts and standards. The current framework, created by the IUCN is an important step in the right direction, but more work needs to be done on a regional level to set metrics to identify successes.</p><p>The second challenge is leveraging investments. While there has been some traction from businesses and private funders, more evidence is needed to support the financing decisions. In the context of the Eastern Himalayas, one peculiar challenge that exists is the anticipated conflicting land-use priorities. With community-managed resources and economic aspirations, it is difficult to imagine a standard approach to implementing NbS in the region.</p><p>It would therefore require a community-driven approach to leveraging NbS which could be achieved by tailoring localized policies which integrate NbS into their framework. These could range from forest management policies to rural as well as urban development programs. This will help the capacity building of local communities and stakeholders in understanding and implementing NbS. Further governments could work with communities to develop NbS and encourage private investments to help scale up these solutions.</p><p>If tapped well, NbS could be a great solution for Eastern Himalayas regional challenges. With great resource expanse and diversity, the region could draw from local knowledge and long-standing ecosystem-based conservation approaches to restore degraded landscape, enhance community resilience and create socio-economic opportunities. With successful examples from the region, NbS could be deployed at scale and speed to help it build a much-needed buffer against the accelerating climate crises.</p>", "publisher": "Krishijagran.com", "instances": ["1 degrees average elsewhere.

As a result, rural communities are dealing with increasing displacement, loss of lives and livelihoods, human-wildlife conflict, declining agricultural productivity, damaged infrastructure affecting access to basic services etc and more. In turn, this has led to higher regional outmigration of youth and to a shrinking rural economy. Combatting this requires systematic efforts at scale. The complexity of this challenges calls for comprehensive solutions - Nature-based Solutions (NbS) that can help build both ecological and human resilience. What are Nature-based Solutions (NbS)?

Gopala Krishnan, MD, Southeast Asia and Middle East, GBCI<br/><br/>Adaptive Design<br/><br/>Adaptive design helps infrastructure respond and evolve alongside increasing environmental pressures. By adding flexibility through modular materials, data-connectivity, and mixed \"green-gray\" systems, it offers several advantages:<br/><br/>* Lower lifetime costs, as prevented failures and reduced energy use, make up for initial expenses.<br/><br/>* Better public health, as cooler temperatures and cleaner air lead to fewer heat-related illnesses.<br/><br/>* Quicker bounce-back after disasters, smart systems help in planning ahead instead of just reacting.<br/><br/>These benefits are real, and not just ideas. In Ahmedabad, South Asia's first Heat Action Plan combined public outreach, early-warning systems, and adaptive design elements like cool roofs. A 2019 study found this approach saved about 1,100 lives annually.<br/><br/>Nature-Based and Hybrid Solutions in Action<br/><br/>In Kolkata, municipal officials recently unveiled a new Climate Action Plan, a \"survival plan\" which includes 60 sectoral recommendations, with 30 earmarked for immediate activation. These range from white reflective roads and green public spaces to ward-level weather stations and clean-air zones. Such integration of nature-based and smart interventions is critical, given that more than 75% of India's population resides in districts highly vulnerable to extreme hydro-meteorological events.<br/><br/>In Mumbai, adaptive design through nature-based solutions is gaining ground with measurable results. According to Maharashtra's state forest department, mangrove cover in the region has risen from 186 km in 2012 to 320 km in 2022, reflecting both restoration and protective efforts. Urban authorities are piloting permeable concrete pavement blocks in Delhi, India's first trials which have shown the capacity to capture, treat, and recharge stormwater, significantly mitigating monsoon flood risks.<br/><br/>India's reach of adaptive design extends beyond cities. Through the Infrastructure for Climate Resilient Growth (ICRG) project, over 900 climate-resilient infrastructure assets from roads and check dams to culverts were built in 22 districts across 3 Indian states, entirely by \"barefoot engineers\" living in remote rural communities. Over 10,000 locals have been trained to build and maintain these projects, effectively creating climateready rural roads and water systems without dependence on external contractors.<br/><br/>Early Warning Systems<br/><br/>Digital innovations are fortifying adaptive design further. Ahmedabad is now piloting wearables in urban slums to monitor physiological signs during heat waves. Simultaneously, sensor networks in cities such as Lucknow and Kolkata continuously track temperature, humidity, and air quality, enabling real-time alerts to residents. At a national level, scientists warn that oppressive, high-humidity heatwaves could increase fivefold by the century's end under 1.5C warming, highlighting the need for anticipatory systems.<br/><br/>Policy and Investment to Scale Resilience<br/><br/>Funding for adaptation is accelerating. Mumbai's 2025-26 budget allocates Rs 16,321 crore (37.8% of capital expenditure) to climate-focused projects, including water harvesting, waste management, and flood protection-up from Rs 10,224 crore in the previous year. At the national level, programmes such as the Smart Cities Mission, NDMA heatwave protocols, and NDC-linked frameworks are increasingly embedding adaptive design within regulatory systems.<br/><br/>In May 2025, the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) initiated a revision of the National Building Code (NBC) to incorporate resilience against climate hazards, covering wind, seismic events, and sustainability norms like solar design and energy efficiency. This update includes provisions for climate-adaptive pavements, flood-resistant plinths, and renewable-energy-ready rooftops, signaling institutional mainstreaming of adaptive planning.<br/><br/>However, gaps remain especially in smaller towns and rural areas, where data is limited and technical capacity is low. Closing this gap requires \"no-regret\" solutions such as elevated roads, passive ventilation systems, and rainwater gardens deployable even without full climate forecasting. Enhancing community awareness and capacity through local champions and NGO partnerships, Ahmedabad's HAP further grounds resilience in a societal context.<br/><br/>The Road Ahead: Mainstreaming Resilient Design<br/><br/>India stands at a decisive juncture. With urbanisation racing forward and climate risks intensifying, embedding adaptive design into every new infrastructure project is not optional-it is essential. Achieving this requires:<br/><br/>* Institutional restructuring: Cities must create crossdepartment resilience cells and integrate adaptive design training into engineering curricula.<br/><br/>* Standardizing real-time monitoring: Bringing sensor networks online in Tier-II and rural areas to inform locally responsive signals.<br/><br/>* Scaling nature-based solutions: Systematically restoring wetlands, expanding green cover, and adopting permeable landscapes.<br/><br/>* Mobilizing finance: Leveraging blended models-like project finance instruments, green bonds, and insurance-backed mechanisms-to enable scalable resilience.<br/><br/>* Enabling policy translations: Updating building codes, zoning regulations, and procurement norms to require climate adaptation.<br/><br/>India's resilience depends not just on surviving climate events, but on thriving through them. It is time to realize infrastructure that doesn't merely endure climate shocks, but delivers hope, opportunity, and continued growth for generations ahead.<br/><br/>By aligning engineering excellence with ecological wisdom and digital foresight, our infrastructure can become the foundation of a climate-resilient, equitable future.<br/><br/>P.

This operation is part of the \"America en el Centro\" initiative.Adding more lanes to the Teculutan-Mayuelas section will benefit 86,600 residents and 2,057 businesses in Teculutan, Rio Hondo, and Gualan in the department of Zacapa. It will also benefit the 19,000 people who use this stretch of road daily and anyone else travelling on the northern part of Highway CA-9.

Have we secured Water for seven billion people? Have we been able to reverse the extinction of species? Have we achieved the goals that we've set for ourselves?</p><p>Returning to Roots</p><p>UNEP works closely with its 193 member countries apart from NGOs, civil society, businesses and stakeholders in order to undo the harm caused to the environment due to anthropogenic activities as well as address environmental challenges through the UN Environment Assembly, the world's highest-level decision-making body on the environment.</p><p>The travesty that hounds us is that we haven't been able to build the basic understanding about our environment, i.e., Soil, Water and Air. We haven't developed clear understanding on how these elements are interlinked with each other and impact all factors in the vicinity from ground Water to temperature to rainfall to humidity to biodiversity to agriculture to diseases to flood to droughts and all other factors termed as 'natural calamities.' And since the basic fundamentals aren't understood well, the obvious is what we see around: the implementation is naturally not as impactful as it could have been.</p><p>Today, we're trying to deal with each problem in silos, while all the problems are interlinked and connected. We saw the same issue in COP summits too, twenty-eight of them have happened with last one happening in Dubai last year. But the progress has been miniscule, compared to the mighty force of nations joining in. We advocated in the COP 28-Dubai as well that the world &amp; the world leaders to work on the path and pace correction too.

Often people mistakenly take biological / microbiological intervention as nature-based approach, while it is not. Like genetically modified seeds or cloning are not nature-based solutions, similarly inducing a lab grown organism isn't a nature-based solution. Let's understand it from a different perspective, let's say if you have a pest or rodent problem in the house. What are the possible solutions?</p><p>* You put a mouse trap, catch the mouse and leave them in the jungle away from home. That's the physical intervention. A slow process with lacunas, with low effectiveness</p><p>* You get the chemical-based pest control done, and after the spray the mouse will die wherever they get in contact with the chemical and the home will be filled up with decaying smell of dead rat bodies. That's chemical intervention. Now, you get busy in shifting the entire house to find out the dead bodies to dispose them off, and may be get exposed to the strong chemical fumes yourself as well.</p><p>* And then comes the biological approach, you leave ten deadly snakes in the home, who will catch hold of the rats and eat them up for good. But would you be able to live along with the deadly poisonous snakes in the same home? Though the solution was biological, but was that sustainable?</p><p>That's what happens when the path is incorrect.</p><p>A Nature-based Solution (NbS) is sustainable and holistic, only when it works on the basic principles of nature and life. The most sustainable phenomenon on the planet is nature itself, and it doesn't have any concept of waste or wealth, thus any process that leaves any waste residue, can't be in harmony with nature. For example, in an STP, sludge is the waste residue, in Smog tower, collected PM is the waste residue. Thus, these aren't sustainable processes.</p><p>Respect Wholesomeness of Natural Environment</p><p>Nature is cyclic and we just need to restore the cycle. For example, if we plan to restore a waterbody, which is the conjunction point of Soil, Water and Air, our approach shouldn't be to clean or beautify it. Rather, the efforts should be to restore the ecosystem services that come from them.</p><p>The exchange between the layers of Soil, Water and Air, gives birth to the ecosystem services, which solves plethora of problems including, Aquifer Correction and Recharge (UNSDG 13), Flood and Drought Mitigation and avoiding water logging in the vicinity (UNSDG 11), Maintaining a healthy aquatic life, and aquatic food chain (UNSDG 14), Consumption and Digestion of the nutrients ensuring the phenomena of eco-dredging through which the bottom deposits of sludge get consumed and the natural water holding capacity gets maintained (UNSDG 6), Photosynthesis within the aqua-ecology by autotrophic microbes resulting carbon sequestration and oxygenation of the atmosphere in the vicinity, also creating a blue carbon sink (UNSDG 13), Maintaining low ambient temperature in the vicinity to nullify UHI and PVHI effects (UNSDG 11), Air pollution mitigation (UNSDG 11), Water Pollution mitigation (UNSDG 6), Biodiversity conservation (Above and below Water) (UNSDG 14 &amp; 15), Safeguarding the vicinity from outbreak of Water and vector borne diseases (UNSDG 3), Restoring ambient temperature in the vicinity (UNSDG 13), and Making highly potent water available for aquaculture, agriculture and animal husbandry (UNSDG 8).</p><p>Let's take a pledge for path correction and understand the nature this World Environment Day!</p><p>The writer is founder of Vaidic Srijan and an NbS expert.</p><p>(Visited 3 times, 1 visits today)</p>", "publisher": "Iamrenew.com", "instances": ["The World Environment Day encourages reflection on our individual &amp; collective actions' impact on the planet and compels us to adopt 'nature-based solutions' (NbS) to protect habitats and mitigate climate change.

He says as well as the main benefit of reducing floods, 'nature-based solutions' often deliver other advantages. \"We've looked at how best to evaluate the options, and also gauge the expected co-benefits, which can include improvements in water quality, ecosystem health, air quality, noise reduction, and carbon storage, as well as positive outcomes for economic and social development. 'Nature-based solutions can provide a greater range of benefits than traditional 'grey engineering', particularly if they result in a net increase in biodiversity. Our research found that many countries are now considering how to use nature-based approaches to protect, manage and restore ecosystems. NIWA has developed a preliminary road map to guide the evaluation and implementation of 'nature-based solutions', and is collaborating with local authorities and other stakeholders, so the lessons learned can be shared across New Zealand.
