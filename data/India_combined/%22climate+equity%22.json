This convening will assemble leading voices from philanthropy, policy, and social enterprise to deliberate on a pressing question: What must change to embed gender equity into India's climate and development strategies, financial planning, and governance structures?</p><p>Now in its third edition, Lead with Equity has become a pivotal platform for stakeholders seeking to move beyond symbolic representation and foster systems where inclusion is central to both accountability and leadership. The 2025 edition emphasizes organizational transformation toward genuine gender justice. Key themes include equity in climate resilience, inclusive leadership within manufacturing, structured mentorship for women in impact-driven roles, and the deeper structural shifts required to redistribute power.</p><p>Featured speakers include Anuradha Das Mathur (Vedica Scholars), Meera Shenoy (Youth4Jobs), Dr. Nisha Dhawan (EMpower), Dr. Nidhi Pundhir (HCL Foundation), Sahil Tandon (Foundation CHANEL), Maithilee Shirgaonkar-Jamsandekar (Raintree Foundation), Moutushi Sengupta (Oneworld Colab), and Dr. Seema Bhatia Panthaki (AVPN). Attendees will engage in strategic roundtables, peer-led keynotes, and sector-specific dialogues aimed at identifying replicable models for equity-driven development.</p><p>Commenting on the initiative, EquiLead co-founder Anchal Kakkar stated, \"Equity can't be reduced to workshop checklists or representation goals. It has to affect how plans are made, how money is spent, and whose information is used to make climate and development programs. Lead with Equity is not a place to reach an agreement; it is a place to rethink what good leadership looks like in this decade.\"</p><p>This event builds on the momentum of earlier editions like She the Change 2023 , which catalyzed workplace policy reforms in over 15 organizations.

As of May, 11 rounds of negotiations have closed chapters on regulatory practices, customs, intellectual property, and mutual assistance, but there's been no progress on the contentious subject of the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM). With CBAM's implementation from January 2026, the clock is ticking for both sides to address this looming issue within their trade pact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The recent India-UK FTA, concluded in May 2025, notably sidestepped CBAM and carbon border taxes. This omission leaves Indian exports exposed to future UK carbon taxes (the UK's CBAM will arrive in 2027), although India has reserved the right to retaliate if its exports suffer. This approach - keeping CBAM outside formal trade negotiations - may not serve India's long-term interests, especially as the EU pushes ahead with CBAM as the bedrock of its climate and trade policy. The EU's firm stance includes expanding CBAM's reach across industries and streamlining compliance, even as many developing countries protest its \"unilateral, punitive, and discriminatory\" character.</p><p>Trade patterns already suggest CBAM's impact. The EU's imports of CBAM-regulated goods fell by 28 per cent in 2023 and dropped another 6 per cent in 2024, with trade flows shifting toward slightly modified versions of regulated products to circumvent CBAM. India, a top 10 exporter of CBAM-covered goods to the EU, has seen such exports grow 7.4 per cent annually over the past six years - faster than its overall EU-bound exports. In 2024, about 24 per cent of these CBAM goods by value went to the EU. Clearly, India's export interests are substantial, and with its share in the EU's import basket rising from 4.61 per cent in 2019 to 5.41 per cent in 2024, inaction on CBAM is no longer strategic.</p><p>Many developing nations, including India, Brazil, South Africa, Russia, and China, see CBAM as an infringement on their right to development and a threat to climate equity principles. But unlike others, India stands out for its determined green transition. It hit its 2030 target for 50 per cent installed non-fossil electricity five years early and is rapidly scaling up hydrogen and solar infrastructure. These achievements position India to credibly negotiate better CBAM terms and showcase domestic climate ambition. However, global climate governance remains inequitable. The US withdrew from the Paris Agreement (effectively from January 2026), reducing its climate funding obligations, while the EU has declined to exempt even the LDCs from CBAM. As other major economies, such as Japan, Australia, and Canada, move toward similar carbon border measures, the burden on less-developed economies will inevitably grow.</p><p>India has criticised CBAM as violating multilateral norms and called for such measures to be debated in broader international forums, not imposed by one trading bloc. Yet, without proactive FTA negotiation on CBAM, India risks losing leverage and export competitiveness. Instead, India must prioritise a dual strategy: Cementing its own green transition and seeking integration into global green value chains. A major criticism of the EU's CBAM from developing countries is the lack of a binding commitment to direct CBAM revenues toward supporting their green transitions. While EU officials insist CBAM is a climate tool, not a revenue-raiser, the absence of financial support exacerbates climate injustice. Rather than accepting the costs imposed by CBAM, India should consider implementing a domestic carbon tax or export levy, echoing the EU's system, to retain revenue and fund its own green transition. This approach would also foster policy parity and potentially qualify Indian exporters for deductions on CBAM liabilities at the EUborder if verified carbon costs are already paid domestically.</p><p>India is already laying the groundwork for a robust carbon pricing regime. Its carbon pricing instruments include a coal cess (now under the GST), climate levies under the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) system, and the ongoing development of a Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (CCTS). For example, current policy translates to an implicit carbon cost of ~$15-17/ton on Indian aluminium, and a transparent accounting of these levies could help Indian exporters avoid double taxation under CBAM.</p><p>India's Perform Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme has advanced energy efficiency but falls short of full CBAM equivalence. Strengthening domestic measurement, reporting, and verification frameworks and aligning Indian carbon pricing with the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) will be key to gaining CBAM recognition.</p><p>Learning from Thailand, which embedded its carbon tax within existing fuel taxes to minimise economic disruption, India can pursue a harmonised, trade-compliant climate policy while protecting its export interests.</p><p>Globally, as other major trading partners, like China and Turkey, consider their own CBAM-like policies, India, the world's sixth-largest supplier of CBAM-regulated goods to the EU, cannot afford to wait. The impending expansion of CBAM's sectoral scope will expose more of India's CBAM-affected exports. Multilateral engagement, robust domestic climate measures, and assertive FTA negotiations are essential to ensure India's economy remains resilient and competitive in a rapidly changing green trade order.</p><p>The author is Research Associate, Centre for Social and Economic Progress</p>", "publisher": "Indian Express", "instances": ["4 per cent annually over the past six years - faster than its overall EU-bound exports.

Amazons been using creative accounting to mislead the public about its emissions for years, and now, with how much leadership is pouring into developing AI and building out AI data centers, the problem is only going to get much worse.</p><p>Statement from Lashelle Johnson, LCVs Senior Director, State Climate &amp; Equity Policy:</p><p>Everyday people are going to pay for Big Techs unchecked expansion both on higher utility bills and more pollution. If these tech CEOs don't keep their commitments, step up, and lead on climate like they said they would, they risk responsibility for irreparable harm to people and the planet . Wind, solar, and batteries are the cleanest, cheapest and fastest sources of power and our grids need more, not less, to keep prices and pollution down.</p><p>Statement from Tyson Slocum, Energy Program Director for Public Citizen:</p><p>Big Tech and data center developers are among the most profitable corporations in the world, with the largest seven tech companies holding about $13 trillion in market capitalization. These companies have the financial resources to ensure that investments in communities prioritize zero-emission, sustainable energy solutions that will not only protect public health and water resources, but ensure affordable energy for consumers.</p><p>About the Sierra Club</p><p>The Sierra Club is Americas largest and most influential grassroots environmental organization, with millions of members and supporters.

The Greenway will provide essential climate-friendly transportation, filling critical gaps that connect to the Empire State Trail through a landscaped corridor designed to absorb and retain rainfall, sensitively manage stormwater, and mitigate future flood events.</p><p>New York State is contributing $43 million in funding from the Environmental Bond Act, administered by the Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), to address climate vulnerability in a disadvantaged community by elevating the shoreline to reduce risks from sea level rise and intense storms, while also expanding waterfront access for East Harlem. The site will be elevated approximately two feet to an elevation of 11 feet, helping provide protection from sea level rise to 2080 projections. The new park will add hundreds of trees and shrubs, and two acres of lawns, helping to reduce urban heat island impacts in East Harlem and absorbing and retaining stormwater.</p><p>Additional project features include passive lawns, seating, fitness areas, a playground, public art, and community spaces for a neighborhood with some of the highest population vulnerabilities and environmental burdens in the state.</p><p>The project is a collaboration between New York City Economic Development Corporation, New York City Parks, and many other agencies, including New York City Department of Environmental Protection's integration of necessary storm sewer upgrades within the project area to help manage stormwater and reduce flood risk for the neighborhood.</p><p>New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, \"New York State's Environmental Bond Act investment in the Manhattan Greenway is a textbook example of how Governor Hochul is centering equity and advancing climate resilience in careful consideration of specific community needs and vulnerabilities, here in the city and across the state. DEC's $43 million commitment to the Harlem River Greenway will help address climate vulnerabilities and disparities in one of the nation's most disadvantaged communities by elevating the shoreline to reduce risks from climate change-driven sea level rise and intense storms, while connecting East Harlem residents with expanded waterfront access. I am thrilled to see progress underway to connect local residents with the waterfront and new opportunities to get outside and enjoy Manhattan.\"</p><p>New York City Parks Commissioner Iris-Rodriguez Rosa said, \"We're so grateful for the State for their support in championing this investment in new open space and resiliency improvements along the East River. Construction is already underway on Manhattan Greenway Harlem River and we look forward to providing more updates to the community as the project progresses.\"</p><p>New York City Economic Development Corporation President &amp; CEO Andrew Kimball said, \"This is a major step forward to completing the Manhattan Greenway Harlem River project from 125th-132nd Street that will connect the East Harlem community back to the waterfront and build a more equitable and greener New York City. NYCEDC, alongside our State and local partners, is committed to expanding New York City's already robust greenways system, working to close critical gaps in the system in order to build a more sustainable, resilient, and interconnected future for New York City.\"</p><p>State Senator Robert Jackson said, \"The Harlem River has long been a dividing line-between access and exclusion, between concrete and canopy. But this $43 million investment begins to rewrite that legacy. Through the Environmental Bond Act, we are not just building a greenway-we are repairing environmental harm and reclaiming what our communities were denied for generations. We are transforming a scarred shoreline into a living corridor of resilience and equity, reconnecting East Harlem to its rightful riverfront. I commend Governor Hochul for her partnership in helping to advance this vision and for recognizing that environmental justice demands bold, targeted investments. This is what justice looks like in action-public space, clean air, and climate infrastructure rooted in dignity and democracy. Because everyone has a right to clean air and clean water.\"</p><p>State Senator Cordell Cleare said, \"This project represents the best of both worlds-strengthening the connection between our community and the Harlem River Waterfront while simultaneously building in resilience and environmental protections. This type of endeavor should be replicated all throughout Northern Manhattan, both East and West. I commend Governor Hochul for smartly prioritizing this initiative.\"</p><p>Assemblymember Jordan J.G. Wright of Harlem said, \"From Hurricane Sandy to the recent heat waves that New Yorkers have endured so far this summer, we know that extreme weather is the new normal. Protecting Harlem and its residents from potential flooding and other types of erratic weather, while also bringing new access to our local waterfront, is smart use of the Environmental Bond Act funding. The Harlem River Greenway Project creates jobs, brings more open space and riverfront activities to the community, and is a powerful step towards achieving environmental justice. Neighborhoods like Harlem deserve the protection of a newly designed seawall as well as greater access to the waterfront and all that it has to offer residents and businesses alike. I commend Governor Hochul for spearheading this important effort which will improve the quality of life for the people of Harlem and beyond.\"</p><p>Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"I am thrilled that New York State is investing in the Harlem River Greenway. This funding is an investment in climate equity that will provide the East Harlem community with much-needed new park space, bike and pedestrian paths, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Completing the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway has long been one of my top priorities and I am glad to see the State partner with the City to move toward that goal. Thank you to Governor Hochul for this important State investment in our borough.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"This investment in the Harlem River Greenway marks a turning point. For too long, our community has been cut off from its own waterfront, a barrier not only to recreation and green space, but to resilience in the face of climate change. With this $43 million commitment from the Environmental Bond Act, Governor Kathy Hochul is helping to reconnect Harlem residents to the river, while building a stronger, safer, and more sustainable shoreline. This project is about equity, climate justice, and investing in the health and well-being of Harlem families. I'm proud to stand with our partners in government as we finally bring this long-overdue transformation to life.\"</p><p>New York City Council Member Carmen De La Rosa said, \"For environmental justice communities like Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, investments in climate resiliency are not only necessary, they are urgent. As weeks of heavy rainfall flood our subways, our apartments, and our parks, it is communities like mine that feel the impacts the most. We look forward to the investments in Washington Heights, Inwood, and Marble Hill from the $43M Environmental Bond Act, and thank Governor Hochul for addressing the dire need for infrastructural improvements and climate change preparedness.\"</p><p>The project builds on Governor Hochul's efforts to encourage affordable outdoor recreation. The Fiscal Year 2026 Budget includes $200 million for State Parks to invest in and aid the ongoing transformation of New York's flagship parks and support critical infrastructure projects throughout the park system. The Governor's new Unplug and Play initiative also earmarks $100 million for construction and renovation of community centers through the Build Recreational Infrastructure for Communities, Kids and Seniors (NY BRICKS), $67.5 million for the Places for Learning, Activity and Youth Socialization (NY PLAYS) initiative helping New York communities construct new playgrounds and renovate existing playgrounds; and an additional $90 million for the continuation of the NY SWIMS initiative.</p><p>New York's Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act<br/><br/>On Nov. 8, 2022, New York voters overwhelmingly approved the $4.2 billion Environmental Bond Act. State agencies, local governments, and partners will be able to access funding to protect water quality, help communities adapt to climate change, improve resiliency, and create green jobs. Bond Act funding will support new and expanded projects across the state to safeguard drinking water sources, reduce pollution, and protect communities and natural resources from climate change. Progress on implementing funding continues, with New York State awarding approximately $1.8 billion, or 25 percent, of Bond Act funds to date.</p><p>This Harlem River project is the latest step in Bond Act investments to enhance shoreline resiliency, encourage economic development, revitalize neighborhoods, and bolster recreational opportunities.

The Harlem River Greenway Project creates jobs, brings more open space and riverfront activities to the community, and is a powerful step towards achieving environmental justice. Neighborhoods like Harlem deserve the protection of a newly designed seawall as well as greater access to the waterfront and all that it has to offer residents and businesses alike. I commend Governor Hochul for spearheading this important effort which will improve the quality of life for the people of Harlem and beyond. Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine said, \"I am thrilled that New York State is investing in the Harlem River Greenway. This funding is an investment in climate equity that will provide the East Harlem community with much-needed new park space, bike and pedestrian paths, and climate-resilient infrastructure. Completing the Manhattan Waterfront Greenway has long been one of my top priorities and I am glad to see the State partner with the City to move toward that goal. Thank you to Governor Hochul for this important State investment in our borough. New York City Council Member Yusuf Salaam said, \"This investment in the Harlem River Greenway marks a turning point. For too long, our community has been cut off from its own waterfront, a barrier not only to recreation and green space, but to resilience in the face of climate change. With this $43 million commitment from the Environmental Bond Act, Governor Kathy Hochul is helping to reconnect Harlem residents to the river, while building a stronger, safer, and more sustainable shoreline."]}, {"relevance_score": 65, "title": "India's Renewable Rise: Non-Fossil Sources Now Power Half the Nation's Grid", "published": "2025-07-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* India has achieved 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources, five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* This milestone underscores India's commitment to climate action and sustainable development, and signals that India's clean energy transition is accelerating under the leadership of Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* India's renewable energy growth is driven by policy-driven progress, with flagship programmes such as PM-KUSUM, PM Surya Ghar, and solar park development laying a strong foundation for this transformation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p>July 14 -- Press Information Bureau, Government of India issued the following news release:</p><p>- Achieves 50% clean power capacity five years ahead of target, setting global benchmark for sustainable growth</p><p>India has achieved a landmark in its energy transition journey by reaching 50% of its installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources-five years ahead of the target set under its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to the Paris Agreement.

With the visionary announcement by Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah to institutionalise three new Multistate Cooperative Societies for cow dung management, carbon credit valuation and compressed biogas (CBG) production within the cooperative framework, India has moved beyond mere climate rhetoric. We are entering an era of grassroots-led green revolution, and this time, it is not about food alone, it is about energy, ecology, and equity.</p><p>This bold shift isn't just administrative, it is civilisational. It marks a new model for climate governance rooted in the soil of Bharat, powered by its villages, and held together by the time-tested values of Sahuarita (cooperation). For decades, the climate debate was dominated by distant capitals, high-level negotiations, and top-down frameworks. But India has flipped the script. Through the Cooperative Economic Framework, we are building a decentralised climate economy from the ground up, starting from Primary Agricultural Co-op Societies (PACS) and scaling to national-level apex cooperative institutions. This isn't just a new economic model, it is a new democratic environmentalism, where the farmer becomes the financier of a greener future, and the village becomes the vanguard of net-zero ambition.</p><p>Every PACS has a potential climate command centre. These grassroots institutions, long associated, are now being repositioned as gateways to carbon markets and bio-energy hubs.</p><p>Imagine decentralised biogas sprouting in every block, feeding clean energy into the rural economy, generating carbon credits that can be monetised globally, and creating a new stream of income for farmers, especially in rain-fed, tribal, and hilly regions. From the cow shed to the carbon exchange, the entire value chain can now be organised, monitored, and scaled through the cooperative economic framework.</p><p>Integral to this transformation is the restructuring of rural resource cycles, especially around fodder management, water governance, and dead cattle economics. Millions of farmers struggle due to erratic fodder availability and mismanaged water resources, which in turn affect livestock productivity and rural resilience. Simultaneously, dead cattle markets, often a source of environmental decay and social tension, remain underutilised economic zones. By creating a multistate cooperative dedicated to integrated livestock resource management, India can formalise and monetise these neglected rural streams. Fodder banks, decentralised water recharge systems, and organised carcass processing units can provide dignified employment, biofertilizers, organic leather, and feedstock for CBG plants. Such a cooperative would not only uplift rural livelihoods but create a closed-loop bio-economy - fueling agriculture, improving nutrition, restoring ecology, and generating revenue across multiple layers of rural society. It is not merely a reform - it is a rural renaissance waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>And the beauty of this approach lies in its inclusivity. The PACS-to-Apex structure ensures that no region is left behind - not the snowbound villages of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, not the fragile communities of the Northeast, and certainly not the border settlements of Ladakh or Arunachal. In these places, traditional economic activities are constrained by geography, but the bioeconomy of cow dung and carbon offers a rare opportunity - one that aligns with the region's cultural values, ecological needs, and national priorities. When farmers in these areas gain the ability to generate income from climate stewardship, they are not just contributing to GDP - they are also strengthening national security. A prosperous border village is a stable border village. When livelihoods are secure, migration is reduced, local pride is restored, and external threats are diminished. The World Cooperation Economic Framework offers the architecture to take this model to scale. It ensures that financing, training, policy guidance, and market access do not remain siloed. It connects the micro to the macro. It allows the smallest PACS in a tribal hamlet to link with global climate finance and ESG funds. It transforms cow dung - a symbol of rural India's ignored potential - into a goldmine for clean energy, carbon credits, organic farming, and rural employment. Through this, India isn't just creating a circular economy - it is building a circular civilisation.</p><p>This is more than a Government scheme - it is a spiritual call to action. A call to revive our ancient ethos of living in harmony with nature now rearmed with modern science, blockchain traceability, and global carbon accounting. It is a call to stand tall on the world stage - not as climate victims begging for compensation, but as climate victors offering solutions.

In addition, the rating incorporates IMEA's strong operating risk profile, stable financial performance trends, and very low leverage.</p><p>The strong operating risk profile is driven by a low-cost burden and diversifying resource base. While IMEA's resources are still predominantly coal-fired, the agency continues to add renewable resources and uses short-term agreements for capacity and energy, as well as market purchases to meet demand. Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources, which coupled with rate-raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-looking stress scenario.</p><p>The ratings also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net-zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant standards that require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032. IMEA, a partial owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA carbon reduction milestones. Additionally, the Trimble County coal units in northern Kentucky, in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards, should they be upheld by the current administration.</p><p>Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation. Fitch will monitor developments with respect to meeting statewide and federal carbon reduction targets and assess any potential impact on IMEA's future costs, capital needs or operations as they become known over time.</p><p>SECURITY</p><p>The bonds are secured by the net revenues of the power supply system after payment of operating and maintenance expenses. Net revenues consist primarily of payments received by IMEA pursuant to long-term take-and-pay all-requirements power sales contracts with 32 participating members.</p><p>KEY RATING DRIVERS</p><p>This is a text exhibit 'USPF - GRE KCD'. See instructions in side pane.</p><p>Revenue Defensibility - 'aa'</p><p>Long-Term Contracts, Strong Member Credit Quality</p><p>IMEA's revenue defensibility is very strong due to its long-term all-requirements power supply contracts with members, autonomous rate-setting authority, and strong underlying credit quality of its largest members. IMEA serves its 32 members across the state of Illinois, pursuant to all-requirements contracts that include provisions for an implied, unlimited step-up across members. Additionally, the IMEA board has full authority over rate setting. The agency initiated the contract renewal process in March 2024 to extend the power supply contracts' termination date from Sept. 30, 2035 to May 31, 2055. IMEA has secured extensions for 84%, or 27 of the 32 members, which equates to approximately 50% of member revenue.</p><p>Revenue defensibility also considers the strong purchaser credit quality of the largest members, the cities of Naperville and St. Charles, and the agency's very strong rate flexibility. The credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles is characterized by midrange and very strong net margins and cash cushion, respectively. Both cities have sound demographic and socioeconomic trends within the respective service areas and maintain rate setting autonomy. Naperville and St. Charles have yet to extend their power sales contracts beyond 2035 but are still considering a long-term extension.</p><p>Operating Risk - 'a'</p><p>Diverse, Low-Cost Resource Base</p><p>The strong operating risk assessment is driven by the agency's low operating cost burden of 6.7 cents/kWh and access to a diverse mix of available purchased power and generation resources to meet its almost 1,000 MW of load requirements and maintain at least a 15% operating reserve margin. Generation resources include ownership interests in the Trimble County units and PSEC. Both plants are coal-fired units that could be impacted by state and federal regulations. Favorably, IMEA is increasingly diversifying its resource base with the addition of low-cost wind and solar energy power purchase agreements (PPAs). IMEA will complete debt service payments for both plants by 2035 and has set up a decommissioning fund for both plants starting on May 1, 2025</p><p>The operating risk assessment also reflects the low Fitch-calculated age of plant of 12 years and manageable capital expenditures, as the agency primarily spends on plant upkeep. The capital plan anticipates approximately $92 million in spending through 2029, which is expected to be funded with cash flow from operations. While near-term capital requirements are limited, proposed federal regulations to limit carbon emissions could require significant capital spending over the long term or limit dispatch, increasing PSEC and Trimble County's operating costs.</p><p>Financial Profile - 'aa'</p><p>Stable Margins, Very Low Leverage</p><p>IMEA's very strong financial profile assessment reflects consistently healthy operating margins, robust liquidity levels, and very low leverage, measured as net adjusted debt to adjusted funds available for debt service (FADS). Leverage was 4.7x in fiscal 2024 (ended April 30) and averaged 5.8x between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2024. Coverage of full obligations has consistently exceeded the 1.0x threshold and was 1.3x in fiscal 2024. The liquidity profile is neutral to the assessment. Unrestricted cash equaled 197 days on hand, while the agency's liquidity cushion, which factors in IMEA's $50 million in available lines of credit, was 284 days.</p><p>Fitch's Analytical Stress Test (FAST) scenario analysis reflects leverage on a downward trend in each year of the base case. The stress case, which is considered Fitch's rating case, shows leverage is expected to trend around 5.0x over the next five years due to no planned sizable debt issuances, continued debt amortization, and expectations for generally stable FADS.</p><p>With a relatively limited amount of debt remaining that will mature by 2035, Fitch also believes IMEA to be relatively well-positioned to meet longer-term challenges related to carbon reduction mandates and potential resource transition over the medium term.</p><p>Asymmetric Additional Risk Considerations</p><p>There are no additional asymmetric risk considerations affecting the rating at this time.</p><p>RATING SENSITIVITIES</p><p>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p><p>*Adoption and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations and emission limitations than those included in the CEJA;</p><p>*A leverage ratio that consistently trends above 8.0x through Fitch's rating case scenario;</p><p>*A meaningful weakening in purchaser credit quality that shifts the revenue defensibility assessment lower.</p><p>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p><p>*Actual and projected leverage in Fitch's rating case scenario consistently below 5.0x;</p><p>* An improvement in purchaser credit quality that leads to a stronger purchaser credit quality PCQ assessment.</p><p>PROFILE</p><p>IMEA is a joint action agency comprised of 32 members located throughout the state of Illinois. It supplies all-requirements power to its members through long-term take-and-pay power sales contracts (PSC) that will expire in 2035. IMEA's members serve approximately 145,000 residential and 21,000 commercial and industrial accounts.</p><p>IMEA's increased proportion of owned generation over the past decade affords it greater control over power supply, while reducing its historical dependence on purchased power and providing cost stability to its members. The share of IMEA's total planned capacity provided from purchased power has declined to about 25% from nearly 80% in 2010. An integral part of this process was the acquisition of an ownership share of PSEC and Trimble County Unit 2.</p><p>In late 2021, the state of Illinois passed CEJA, which requires all electric generators to provide 100% clean energy generation statewide by 2050. This is likely to be accomplished by phasing out fossil fuel power plants, like PSEC, over time. According to the legislation, PSEC must reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035,with a three-year grace period, and eliminate emissions totally by YE 2045.</p><p>While the law provides the framework for a significant shift in the generation and delivery of energy for utilities like IMEA, Fitch believes the legislation's extended time horizon provides sufficient flexibility to address the carbon reduction requirements. Additionally, all of IMEA's outstanding debt, including the debt issued to finance PSEC, is scheduled to be retired by 2035, limiting the potential costs and obligations of managing future power supply on IMEA and its members, including the fixed-costs associated with future potential stranded assets. A lack of debt beyond 2035 also provides a degree of flexibility to manage potential resource transition and/or adoption and implementation of new technologies.</p><p>Sources of Information</p><p>In addition to the sources of information identified in Fitch's applicable criteria specified below, this action was informed by information from Lumesis.</p><p>REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING</p><p>The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.</p><p>ESG Considerations</p><p>The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section.

Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources, which coupled with rate-raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-looking stress scenario. The ratings also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net-zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the current U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant standards that require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032. IMEA, a partial owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA carbon reduction milestones. Additionally, the Trimble County coal units in northern Kentucky, in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards, should they be upheld by the current administration. Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation."]}, {"relevance_score": 35, "title": "What's Next For Global Climate Action With Trump's Return", "published": "2025-03-24", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Trump's actions will disrupt these efforts, with profound consequences not only for India but for the entire Global South, writes Alak Desai</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Within hours of taking office, President Donald Trump announced that the United States would once again, withdraw from the Paris Agreement, effectively nullifying U.S.' international climate commitments. His re-election, at a time when the world battles record-breaking heatwaves, raging wildfires, erratic and sudden monsoons, and rising sea levels, carries significant implications for collective climate action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For a nation that significantly contributes to the disproportionate impact of climate change on the world with 11 per cent of the world's total GHG emissions in 2023, President Trump's policy outlook has already dealt a severe blow to global climate cooperation.</p><p>The administration's collective scepticism toward climate science poses a significant risk and their attempts to undermine scientific consensus on climate change are creating a dangerous culture of denial. Recent reactions to the California wildfires and blame games with local authorities indicate what the next few years will look like.</p><p>These actions have raised concerns globally, including in India. As the world's third largest emitter but also a climate-vulnerable nation, India relies heavily on principles of CBDR - global cooperation, and financial support to meet its ambitious climate goals. President Trump's actions will disrupt these efforts, with profound consequences not only for India but for the entire Global South.</p><p>President Trump's Climate Record</p><p>During his first term, there was a categorical deviation in US' leadership in global climate diplomacy, with an aggressive rollback of environmental policies, prioritisation of a pro-fossil fuel agenda, and withdrawal from key multilateral agreements - most notably from the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Additionally, the US withdrawal from various financial obligations left dependent countries struggling to address the funding gap for their climate initiatives. A combination of these policies, not only stalled global climate action progress but also created a competitive imbalance for nations working to meet their climate targets, further damaging international cooperation on climate action.</p><p>It is fair to say that his second term is likely to follow a similar trajectory, with specific actions such as declaring a National Energy Emergency, dismantling the U.S. International Climate Finance Plan, effectively ending financial support for global climate mitigation efforts, and promoting slogans like \"Drill, baby, drill!\" to reinforce his commitment to expanding domestic fossil fuel production, inevitably leading to an unmitigated spike in carbon emissions from the US.</p><p>Implications For India And The Global South Perspective</p><p>US disengagement from the Paris Agreement in 2016 created a leadership vacuum that other nations attempted and struggled to fill. For climate-vulnerable countries - despite contributing minimally to global emissions, this vacuum has been particularly damaging. Additionally, this complicated global efforts by undermining the principles of climate equity, which have been the conditional foundation of climate targets for developing and least developed countries.</p><p>Developing nations have long argued that the Global North, must shoulder a greater share of the burden in addressing climate change. President Trump's outlook, which prioritizes inward-looking policies, and economic gains over environmental sustainability, completely disregards the foundational principle of CBDR with his America First ideology.</p><p>India, positioned as a leader in the Global South, has a critical role to play in bridging the gap created by US' withdrawal. India's initiatives in renewable energy and climate diplomacy have positioned it as an important player in the global fight against climate change. However, it is considered that President Trump's policies could potentially pressure India to prioritize economic growth over environmental sustainability. With global cooperation weakened, and international trade threatened, India might be forced to limit its climate action goals to prioritize the country's economy.</p><p>Most importantly, this re-instated policy outlook is likely to further erode global climate diplomacy, making it harder for countries to negotiate favourable agreements or pressure high-emitting countries to take responsibility for their actions. India, as a developing nation with a growing economy, faces the dual challenge of pursuing sustainable development while addressing the urgent need to cut emissions, and the same juxtaposition stands true for other countries in the Global South.</p><p>What's Next</p><p>Withdrawal of a superpower and the 2nd largest emitter of greenhouse gases from the Paris Agreement, adds needless pressure to the climate crisis by increasing uncertainty in mitigating carbon emissions, and collaborative global climate action, with a direct impact on continuing the financing negotiations undertaken at COP29.</p><p>Despite the challenges posed by this, there are a few reasons for cautious optimism, the main one being an opportunity to strengthen regional alliances in response to the leadership vacuum, and collaborations with other geo-political blocs and developing nations, to maintain momentum on climate action.</p><p>India, as a pivotal leader in climate action and the Global South, has a unique opportunity to amplify its climate action ambitions. India must double down on its climate ambitions-amplifying renewable energy initiatives, fostering regional collaboration, and advocating for equitable global frameworks, particularly for climate financing and technology transfer.</p><p>Most specifically, with a growing focus on energy security across the Global South, continued efforts for enabling foreign private investments in the renewable energy sector and towards industrial green transition are critical to filling the gaps created by the potential lack of bilateral commitments. Further, there is an opportunity for India to be the source of best practices, which it has showcased by reasonably decoupling economic growth from increasing emissions.

This is by no means a new argument, but one that remains sidelined at international discussions, including the recently concluded COP28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Our recent report, \"Improving living standards within stringent carbon budgets: the critical importance of climate equity\", examines the intersection of three global priorities: rapid reduction of poverty, inequality and emissions. Recognising that the climate, poverty, and inequality crises are intertwined, the new findings in this paper---summarised below--- support longstanding calls for a more equitable way forward.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Inequality within countries has become an increasingly important driver of emission inequality</p><p>Over the past 30 years, inequality within countries has become an increasingly important driver of emission inequality, with carbon footprints closely linked to income and consumption. These inequalities can be severe. By 2019, 64% of carbon inequalitywas due to inequality of emissions between income groups within countries. What this means is that the wealthiest individuals in countries like India or Nigeria, for instance, may emit as much as Germans.</p><p>At the same time, our findings underscore that most Indians or Nigerians have very small carbon footprints, unlike the average or even poorer Germans. The population sizes of different consumption segments in Figure 1 illustrates this case.</p><p>Moreover, the bottom three-quarters of the global consumption distribution based in low- and middle-income countries outside Europe have considerably lower per capita expenditures, on average, than their counterparts in European upper-middle-income countries and high-income countries. This difference would be even starker if we consider other Western nations (e.g. United States, Canada or Australia) or other high-income countries (e.g. those in the Persian Gulf).</p><p>The continued deprivation of people in poverty wont save the planet from climate change</p><p>Additionally, even if we raise the living standards of billions of people who currently consume too little for their own well-being, their per capita emissions would still be very low and their aggregate emissions quite modest. In other words, continuing to deprive people in poverty will not save the planet from climate change.</p><p>The good news for countries at all levels of economic development is that there is not necessarily a stark choice between improving living standards and avoiding greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The very large differences in per capita emissions of high- and upper-middle-income countries (see Figure 2 for the heating/ electricity sector) demonstrates how societal and historical choices regarding infrastructure, urban form, and individual behaviour can lead to dramatically different levels of per capita emissions. Therefore, it is very much possible to achieve high living standards without high emissions.</p><p>Achieving high and more equitable living standards without high emissions</p><p>Increasing the living standards of people in and near poverty can also be supported by reducing consumption by the global rich. The challenge in this will be breaking away from path dependencies, behaviours and economic structures to facilitate individuals to choose lower emission livelihoods without lowering their well-being.</p><p>Additionally, there are low-carbon options available for reliable power, access to goods and services, and nutrition that can be considered. The relative affordability and viability of these options are shaped partially by exogenous factors such as technological costs, established infrastructure stock and availability of land, but also by endogenous factors such as regulatory environments, planning decisions, acquired capabilities and cultural norms.</p><p>To make this a reality, upper-middle and high-income countries need to raise the ambition of their Nationally Determined Contributions in line with their fair share of effort. The specific policies and investments required to achieve these goals will vary from country to country but may include reforming energy and agricultural subsidy regimes that favour unsustainable production and consumption, establishing integrated spatial and infrastructure investment plans that can underpin a pipeline of climate-safe, bankable projects in the transport sector, and reforming national dietary guidelines and where applicable procurement policies to favour plant-based diets.</p><p>At the same time, there needs to be a renewed global effort to improve the living standards for the poorest 50% of the global population, who mostly live in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

Speaking at a panel titled \"The New Economic Revolution: An African Perspective\" on February 11, 2025, he cited striking data that turns conventional wisdom on its head.</p><p>\"We actually asked Moody's Analytics to look at the risk profile of Africa, of investments and infrastructure over the last 14 years. Guess what they found? The rate of loss in Africa is 1.7%. That in Latin America was about 13%. The one in Eastern Europe was more about 10%.\"</p><p>These statistics paint a picture starkly different from the risk premiums typically demanded for African investments. The continent's actual performance suggests it might be one of the world's safest investment destinations-a reality masked by persistent negative stereotypes.</p><p>Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and chairman of multiple African businesses, spoke from direct experience: \"There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa.\" Elumelu, whose portfolio spans power, oil and gas, financial services, and healthcare across four continents, including investments in the Gulf states.</p><p>He emphasized that success lies in seeing opportunity where others see risk.</p><p>\"There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,\" said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.</p><p>\"You may decide to see risks or challenges, or you may see opportunities,\" Elumelu explained. \"But ability to identify opportunities and structure your approach in a way that addresses and mitigates those risks confers extra competitive advantage on you and your business.\"</p><p>To bridge this perception gap, the African Development Bank Group announced plans to establish a new Africa Investment Guarantee Agency. The institution will offer comprehensive coverage against climate, equity, political, and currency risks-addressing key concerns that have historically deterred international investors.</p><p>The timing could not be more critical. Africa stands at the nexus of several global transitions: demographic, energy, and agricultural. With 75% of its population under 35 years old, including 600 million people between ages 15 and 35, the continent is positioned to become the world's workforce. Its vast mineral resources-including critical materials for electric vehicles and renewable energy-make it indispensable to the global energy transition.</p><p>\"Whether it is lithium-ion batteries, whether it is electric vehicles, whether it's platinum, whether it's copper, whether it's graphite, whether it's any of this lithium-ion, all is in Africa,\" Adesina noted. \"So what Africa actually does with its resources will shape the future of the world.\"</p><p>The narrative of a \"resource curse\" that has long haunted Africa's development story also came under scrutiny at the summit. Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh rejected this framing entirely, introducing instead the concept of \"conscientious concessions\".</p><p>These, he explained, are deals that benefit investors, governments, and local communities alike.</p><p>\"It's so easy to speak about concessions from any one of these countries or from private sector that is 100 years, lots of waivers, employees coming from abroad, everything gets shipped out. That's not consensual. You're talking about bad deals, by the way, which turned things into a curse, and I think that's what people talk about,\" Sengeh explained. He pointed to recent developments in Sierra Leone's rutile mining sector, where domestic ownership is changing the dynamics of resource management.</p><p>The narrative of a \"resource curse\" that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.</p><p>\"If we think about not just pennies, but the people and the planet, then the deals and the agreements we sign, with our conscience, will work for the people, will bring economic value for everyone, for the investor, for the government, and the people who are there,\" Sengeh added.</p><p>The African Development Bank Group is actively working to facilitate such balanced agreements. \"We have the African Legal Support Facility at the African Development Bank to help Sierra Leone and DRC, several other countries, to be able to structure deals that are in their own interest,\" Adesina explained.</p><p>The Africa Investment Forum Market Days held in Morocco in December 2024 demonstrated strong investor appetite when barriers are removed, securing $29.4 billion in investment interest within just 72 hours! This contributed to over $225 billion in investment interests mobilized since the Africa Investment Forum's inception in 2018. This success is part of a broader push to industrialize the continent and move beyond raw commodity exports.</p><p>\"The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,\" Adesina emphasized. \"But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.\"</p><p>Major initiatives are already underway to build this infrastructure. The African Development Bank Group is investing $3 billion in special agro-industrial processing zones, while \"Mission 300,\" a partnership with the World Bank, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans. These projects represent significant opportunities for private investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution.</p><p>\"The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,\" said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. \"But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.\"</p><p>The African Continental Free Trade Area, with its $3.4 trillion market potential and population of nearly 1.5 billion people, adds another layer of opportunity. \"Africa is not going to beg its way into development,\" Adesina insisted. \"Africa is going to trade and invest its way into development.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, African leaders are clear about who will drive this transformation.

Over a span of 10 days, from December 2 to 13, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) heard over 100 countries including India. The ruling by the court's 15 judges, expected early this year, will be the first such and will explicitly provide clarity on two critical issues. The first issue is what responsibilities governments hold towards protecting the planet and humanity from the impacts of the climate crisis under international law. The second issue deals with the legal consequences that countries could face if they do not take climate action required for the well-being of present and future generations.</p><p>Typically, ICJ only deals with legal issues brought to them by country governments. One exception is a request for an advisory opinion that can be brought forward by the UN. An advisory opinion is in essence an international legal guiding framework. For instance, in 1996, the court was asked for an advisory opinion on the legality of the use of nuclear weapons during armed conflict and threats. The resolution to approach ICJ on climate issues was spearheaded in 2023, by Vanuatu, at the United Nations General Assembly. Countries surrounded by large oceans, such as Vanuatu, face an existential threat from the climate crisis, through sea level rise as well as a rise in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, cyclones and flooding.</p><p>Climate activists are hoping that the ICJ ruling will provide impetus for climate action, in a world where support for a green future seems to be declining. With the rise of political parties with anti-climate and pro-fossil fuel stances in the West - Donald Trump is a prime example - global climate cooperation appears to be in a shambles. This was reflected at COP29 talks, where none of the leaders of the world's largest carbon emitters were present, including the United States (US), China, Germany, and even India. COP29 was deemed a failure with a diluted climate finance deal.</p><p>Realistically, it is unclear how effective the ICJ judgment will really be in hastening climate action. It will be non-binding, without posing legal obligations on countries. Recent ICJ rulings, such as calling for Israel to stop military conflict in Palestinian territory, did not perturb the Benjamin Netanyahu government that continues its offensive on Gaza. Similarly, countries such as the US have also disregarded the ICJ ruling on Israel completely.</p><p>The advisory opinion lays a moral foundation for countries to be held legally accountable towards taking climate action. Perhaps the most significant effect of the ruling would be opening the door for citizens to take the legal route in their own countries and pressure their governments to take prompt and effective climate action. Agreements such as the Montreal Protocol are legally binding. Ratified by countries across the world, this protocol states that non-compliance could lead to measures such as suspension of technology transfer, financial transfer and consumption goods. On the other hand, countries such as Russia argue that the Paris Agreement and all other treaties to reduce carbon emissions are based on voluntary commitments.

With the rise of political leaders with anti-climate and pro-fossil fuel stances in the West - Donald Trump is a prime example - global climate cooperation appears to be in a shambles. This was reflected at COP29 talks, where none of the leaders of the world's largest carbon emitters were present, including the United States (US), China, Germany, and even India. COP29 was deemed a failure with a diluted climate finance deal.</p><p>Realistically, it is unclear how effective the ICJ judgment will really be in hastening climate action. It will be non-binding, without posing legal obligations on countries. Recent ICJ rulings, such as calling for Israel to stop military conflict in Palestinian territory, did not perturb the Benjamin Netanyahu government that continues its offensive on Gaza. Similarly, countries such as the US have also disregarded the ICJ ruling on Israel completely.</p><p>The advisory opinion lays a moral foundation for countries to be held legally accountable towards taking climate action. Perhaps the most significant effect of the ruling would be opening the door for citizens to take a legal route in their own countries and pressure their governments to take prompt and effective climate action. Agreements such as the Montreal Protocol are legally binding. Ratified by countries across the world, this protocol states that non-compliance could lead to measures such as suspension of technology transfer, financial transfer and consumption goods. On the other hand, countries such as Russia argue that the Paris Agreement and all other treaties to reduce carbon emissions are based on voluntary commitments. If countries do not meet their climate goals, no international body can do anything to ensure compliance.</p><p>Since Rio in 1992, India has always been at the centre of climate negotiations, calling for increased accountability from richer nations. Indian officials have often cited the historic responsibility of developed countries, on which differentiated climate actions between the Global South and North are premised. India continued to argue this point at ICJ, citing the disappointing results from COP29 while advocating for a climate equity perspective.

As is the case with all COP meetings, the two main issues to be discussed in Baku are the transfer of resources to developing countries to battle climate change and the worsening carbon footprints. There are several other issues which would be discussed and some are highlighted in this piece.</p><p>No climate change dialogue is complete without deliberations on transfer of resources to developing countries. In fact, availability of finance is going to be the prime subject for discussion at COP29. The magic figure of $100 billion per year has never materialised, though the actual requirement ranges from $1-6 trillion. The requirement for funds for climate change is now known by a new nomenclature called the New Collective Quantified Goal and the transfer of resources to developing countries (be it $100 billion or more) would be dealt under it from 2025 onwards. In the meantime, we also have the loss and damage fund mooted at COP27 in Egypt. It was operationalised during COP28 but the kitty committed to this fund is embarrassing to say the least, at less than $700 million. We also have a new voluntary fund in the making (Climate Finance Action Fund of about $1 billion) to assist developing countries through highly concessional loans and grants, and this has been proposed by Azerbaijan who is also expected to announce the first contribution to it.</p><p>Carbon footprint is estimated to be around 420 parts per million (ppm) carbon dioxide (CO2). For more than a decade now, the yearly increase has been in excess of 2 ppm and in 2023, it rose by 2.8 ppm from the previous year. However, these figures are estimates based on normative calculations and no one can really pinpoint the actual amounts, be it gross emissions or net figures after some of the carbon is absorbed by oceans, forests, and soil. What is more important than the absolute figures is the trend showing which way we are heading. Scientists have opined that to limit the increase in the earth's temperature to 2C, we should not cross 450 ppm CO2. This gives us around 10 years of breathing time and it also opens a Pandora's box of climate equity (which country will get how much allowance in the remaining carbon space). The truth is that if we are to talk of climate equity in cumulative terms right from the industrial revolution, the developed countries will have to work on how much carbon they can suck out of the atmosphere to give some leverage and the notion of equity to the developing world.</p><p>To tackle the problem of carbon footprint, we have the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) which lay out the action plan of each country based on its potential. The moot point is whether the NDCs put together will succeed in limiting the rise in the earth's temperature to 1.5C by 2100. Experts say that if the current NDCs are fully implemented, it will lead to a rise in temperature to anywhere between 2.5 and 3 C. NDCs, incidentally, can be fully implemented only if the transfer of resources to developing countries fructifies. This has been made clear by the developing world, who treat a part of their NDCs as conditional to the availability of finance. NDCs are due for revision in February 2025 as they have to be revised every five years. The revised NDCs are more likely to be discussed at COP30 (in Brazil) but the momentum is going to be set during COP29 itself.</p><p>Climate action today is based on opaque data which is largely unverified. The corporate world is especially guilty of overstating their green action, which has led to the term \"greenwashing\". In accordance with the provisions of the Paris Agreement, the first biennial transparency report (BTR) is due in December and thereafter, it will be reviewed every two years. This is expected to provide evidence-based strong NDCs, which will help in promoting trust among stakeholders. The BTRs, once submitted, will be reviewed by experts. The small island states and the least developed countries, however, have been permitted to submit their BTRs at their discretion.</p><p>Adaptation is another major issue on the agenda of COP29. The biggest challenge to adaptation is the availability of finance because adaptation measures usually do not have an income stream (as opposed to mitigation), and therefore lenders are shy of funding such activities. The private sector can play a major role in providing funds for adaptation, and this will only happen if the government de-risks such projects by providing co-funding and other incentives like tax benefits. Globally, today, the private sector's contribution in adaptation measures is less than 2%. Linked to the \"global goal on adaptation\" is the preparation of the national adaptation plan, which has to be drafted by each of the 198 countries under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change although less than 60 have prepared their plans till now. Preparation of such plans (and also NDCs) require technical expertise that many developing countries do not possess. What is required is capacity-building, which is another agenda for discussion at COP29.</p><p>The previous paragraphs only list a few items on the agenda, and there are many other issues/reports which are going to be discussed. Surprisingly, there is no mention of carbon markets in the agenda papers. Reports that would be discussed include those of various subsidiary bodies (for example, the Subsidiary Body for Implementation). Then we have the report on the Green Climate Fund, Global Environmental Facility, etc. Whether all this will lead to any concrete action remains to be seen. Frankly speaking, going by past experience, being optimistic would be considered foolhardy.</p><p>The author is senior visiting fellow, ICRIER.</p><p>Disclaimer: Views expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of FinancialExpress.com.

COP29 focused extensively on climate finance, especially on the importance of setting a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate finance, which was increased to $300 billion annually, as opposed to the $1.3 trillion estimated for successful climate transition. Continued deliberations on critical climate issues by global leaders, heads of state, climate policy experts, and multilateral banks and institutions, have moved away from inclusive climate action and towards mechanisms such as carbon markets, geoengineering, and lower climate financing towards adaptation. Recent trends surrounding net zero goals have also been worrying, with six major banks dropping out of the UN-backed Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA) in the United States (US), and four of the largest banks in Canada following suit.</p><p>While the focus of the annual COP by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is rightly global, it has been evident that to build meaningful global or national level climate action, countries need to employ a robust system for both localised participation as well as identify locally-led community-centred solutions, ensuring equity, fairness and justice for local people and communities. To bridge global ambitions with national goals with localised impact, nations especially from the Global South must identify and develop frameworks to engage subnational actors, strengthen local institutions, and empower local communities to become active climate leaders and ambassadors.</p><p>India has strongly committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2070 and aims to source 50% of its installed power capacity from renewables by 2030. It has laid out a comprehensive vision for climate action through initiatives like the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and sub-national climate priorities via the State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCCs). To advance localised climate action, the Ministry of Panchayati Raj launched the revamped Rashtriya Gram Swaraj Abhiyan (RGSA) in 2022, which focuses on empowering the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) to focus on the localisation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through nine distinct themes across all states and Union Territories. However, implementing these ambitious programmes demands a decentralised approach to drive locally led climate action across India's diverse geographical landscape and communities. Any form of locally led climate action entails robust engagement of people and communities in adaptation and mitigation planning and implementation. The availability of necessary finance mechanisms also adds to the strong capacity framework for achieving climate resilience. The Constitution has tiered the governance process into three levels: The central government, the state governments, and the panchayats and municipalities. Sustained engagement with the lowest tier of the government is essential to ensure sub-national and sub-regional climate action. At the grassroots level, panchayats can effectively align local indigenous knowledge systems to adapt to the communities' specific requirements, climate vulnerabilities and institutional capacities.</p><p>Over the last few years, the Conference of Panchayats (CoP) on Climate Change - an initiative by the Policy and Development Advisory Group (PDAG) and ASAR social impact advisors has demonstrated the importance of a sub-regional and state-level convening platform for deliberations, learnings and capacity building, enabling people and community-centred planning towards locally led climate actions. Since 2022, five divisional and one state-level CoPs have been hosted in Jharkhand, witnessing the active participation of elected head/ mukhiyas of over 250 gram panchayats along with local PRI members, self-help group members, block and district level officials and civil society organisations. This set of convenings has brought forth key climate challenges such as erratic rainfall, deforestation, declining water tables and climate-induced migration. Speakers also shared localised solutions for these issues, such as leveraging Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) funds for constructing soak pits and bunds to improve groundwater recharge. They also highlighted the need for community-driven approaches to climate action, like involving women-led self-help groups (SHGs) in afforestation and sustainable farming practices.</p><p>Taking cue from Jharkhand, a district-level CoP was held by a federation of gram panchayat/PRI members in Jamui district, Bihar in September 2024 and another CoP in Beed district of Maharashtra in December 2024. These convenings brought together elected Panchayat functionaries and leaders from over 50 gram panchayats, who shared acute challenges posed by erratic climate events. Further, localised adaptation solutions and community practised strategies including rainwater harvesting, solar-powered irrigation, and the promotion of millet cultivation and indigenous farming were highlighted.</p><p>These convenings have clearly emphasised the critical need for Gram Panchayats to integrate such measures into their respective Gram Panchayat Development Plans, the requirement for adaptive capacity and technical assistance for the local self-government bodies and the leveraging power of women's SHGs in water management and security practices and sustainable farming.</p><p>Recently, the elected representatives from 22 gram panchayats across five blocks and two municipalities in the coastal district of Ernakulam in Kerala came together for a Conference of Panchayats (CoP-Ernakulam) to discuss locally led adaptation measures against tidal flooding. The convening saw elected PRI members suggest tailored solutions against the consequences and the challenges in implementing them. They also emphasised the need to recognise tidal flooding officially as a disaster, with Ezhikkara and Edavanakkad gram panchayats passing this resolution in special gram sabhas.</p><p>The Economic Survey 2024 had advocated for a shift from a western lens focused climate crisis strategy to a 'local lens' based model that incorporates India's traditional sustainable practices. It emphasised on integrating the factors of local economic development and social justice as enshrined in the Constitution and the role of local self-governments in driving an indigenous climate agenda.</p><p>Institutionalising an initiative like the Conference of Panchayats (CoP) on Climate Change nationally could essentially mark a welcome step in this regard, ensuring India's climate conversations and actions are informed by indigenous knowledge, localised climate actions and climate leadership, while tailored to community needs and unique and diverse agro-climatic landscapes. This would also drive a much-needed policy deliberation on the provisioning of climate finance directly to gram panchayats and urban local bodies, empowering them to implement projects with local relevance, ranging from renewable energy adoption, sustainable agriculture and water conservation, biodiversity protection and heat stress adoption. By anchoring this model within India's governance structure, the country can create a cohesive climate action framework that is both locally positioned, nationally aligned and globally recognisable.</p><p>As India celebrates the 76th Republic Day, efforts to build the capacity of the Panchayati Raj Institutions on climate action will align well with India's climate goals and also reinforce the Prime Minister's vision of Vikshit Bharat with local self-governments as essential actors to drive India's ambitious national and sub-national climate agenda.</p><p>The Conference of Panchayats (CoP) has exemplified the power of local engagement and informed participation and decision-making, markers of a true representative democracy enabling climate equity and justice in practice.

It also failed to establish the essential agreements needed to ensure the success of next year's COP in Brazil.</p><p>The core of the problem, phasing out fossil fuel, left unaddressed</p><p>The COP29 fell short on solidifying a roadmap for a global fossil fuel phase-out. Financial flows towards the main problem, fossil fuels, still vastly outsize those to solutions. Globally, governments are spending approximately $ 7 trillion (that's a seven with twelve zero's) each year on fossil fuel subsidies. And the financial sector is funnelling (EURO)650 billion each year into fossil fuels, perpetuating dependency.</p><p>A Fossil-fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty is needed</p><p>The agreements made at COP29 are insufficient to limit global warming to 1.5C and address climate equity. Advocacy for a Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty is critical. Such a treaty would establish binding commitments to phase out fossil fuel in a just manner.</p><p>A Call for Leadership</p><p>Financial institutions must lead in pushing for this global agreement while championing the reallocation of capital towards renewable energy and sustainable systems. The financial sector must act where governments hesitate, financial institutions have a responsibility-not just to divest from fossil fuels but to accelerate the transition. At Triodos Bank, we see a clear path forward: finance must be a driver of positive systemic change. By ending fossil fuel financing and supporting equitable climate solutions, the sector can catalyse a just and resilient economy.</p><p>New climate finance goal is insufficient</p><p>The main expectation of the COP29 was to set a new bold climate finance target that would do justice to the climate adaptation and mitigation financing needs of developing countries. The countries hit hardest by the impact of climate change and that contributed the least to causing climate change. An agreement was reached on committing $300 billion per year by 2035 and a call to raise $1.3 trillion a year from a wide range of sources, including private investment. This is a fraction of the trillions that the global south needs to protect their people from climate change and transition to cleaner economies.</p><p>Some progress on the Loss and Damage Fund</p><p>A key achievement of the previous COP was an agreement on the Loss and Damage Fund, designed to support nations disproportionately affected by climate-induced disasters. The fund got officially operationalised during the COP29 and can start distributing money from 2025, these are small steps in the right direction.</p><p>Carbon Markets: progress, but important work ahead</p><p>COP29 operationalised a new international carbon market called the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM), paving the way for the trade of carbon units under a global standardised system. Important decisions now lie in the hands of technical bodies, which will work on methodologies and integrity issues like permanence, additionality and baselines for different types of carbon projects next year. It remains to be seen whether the agreement and next year's technical work allows the PACM to effectively and transparently move money to the right carbon removal and sequestration projects.</p><p>As we look ahead to the COP30 in Brazil, the stakes are high</p><p>The COP29's failure to secure essential agreements puts even more pressure on the next COP in Brazil, where countries (rich and poor) will most likely have to negotiate an even stricter climate policy, as the goal to keep global warming preferably below 1.5 degrees is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve. This underscores the need for transformative leadership. The financial sector cannot wait, banks and investors must lead by reallocating capital from financing fossil fuel to climate solutions. The time to act boldly is now.</p><p>Source: Triodos Bank</p><p>[Category: Financial/ Capital Market, ESG]</p>", "publisher": "Contify Banking News", "instances": ["The core of the problem, phasing out fossil fuel, left unaddressedThe COP29 fell short on solidifying a roadmap for a global fossil fuel phase-out.

India's role and readiness: India, one of the most climate-vulnerable nations, stands to benefit significantly from the L&amp;D Fund. Facing frequent climate extremes like heatwaves, India endures severe economic and social impacts. Beyond its vulnerability, India has emerged as a critical advocate for climate equity.

EPA's nearly 15,000 environmental professionals fight the climate crisis, safeguard America's air and water, regulate chemicals and pesticides, respond to chemical emergencies, enforce U.S. environmental laws, and lead innovative research. Because pollution transcends international boundaries, EPA's Office of International and Tribal Affairs works with international organizations and countries to address shared environmental challenges.</p><p>[Category: Energy, Metals &amp; Mining, Management Changes, Regulatory and Legal, ESG]</p><p>Source: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</p>", "publisher": "Contify Energy News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 36, "title": "Trump 2.0: A Slowdown For Climate Action In India And Emerging Economies?", "published": "2024-11-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">While cooperation on global climate negotiations and agreements may take a back seat, the Trump administration may still support bilateral technological and energy cooperation with India to counter China</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On June 1, 2017, Donald Trump, in his first term as US President, announced that the United States would withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, stating that the agreement would undermine the US economy and put it at a \"permanent disadvantage.\" Among the first thing, that President Joe Biden did shortly after assuming office in January 2021 was signing an executive order to rejoin the agreement. The United States formally rejoined the Paris Agreement on February 19, 2021.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The withdrawal here back then lasted just 107 days and, in the short term, did impact (not remarkably) the future of global climate change action and financial aid to developing countries. With Donald Trump winning the election for the second time and returning as the 47th President of the United States, global climate change action may get a jolt and can have consequences for the developing world in tackling the climate emergency.</p><p>As he assumes office, President Trump will be greeted by an ambitious set of policies to decarbonise the American economy, thanks to the outgoing President Joe Biden. President Biden's term saw the landmark Inflation Reduction Act, which, according to Goldman Sachs, will generate over $3 trillion in public and private investments in clean technologies by 2030.</p><p>Trump, in his previous tenure, had openly advocated for fossil fuels, and during his campaign this year, his mantra had been \"Drill baby, Drill,\" nudging the oil industry. On various occasions, he has mocked climate science and electric vehicles. Will there be a complete reversal on the climate change front and related policies? Only time will tell once President Trump assumes office. Still, going by history and the election campaign, there is consensus that climate change and energy policies will be a big focus in his second term. His stance could affect the global climate change negotiations, which could slow down in the medium term and hurt the developing world, including India.</p><p>Slowing Climate Action In The Developing World</p><p>Similar to 2017, if Trump takes an isolationist stance on the Paris Agreement, the move can undermine the collective resolve of other nations, potentially slowing the pace of commitments to curb emissions. COP26 and COP27 in Glasgow and Sharm El-Sheikh, respectively, saw the finalisation of the 'Rulebook' for the Paris Agreement. This Rulebook outlines the mechanisms for carbon markets, transparency, and accountability in emissions reductions, allowing countries to trade carbon credits in a regulated manner.</p><p>A Trump-led U.S. could disengage from these carbon market mechanisms, potentially reducing demand and investment in carbon trading globally. This may deter countries and corporations from making robust commitments to offset and reduce emissions. The decision in 2017 also impacted the carbon emission space and the carbon price.</p><p>India has led the efforts at previous COPs to call out the developed world to provide at least $1 trillion per year from 2025 to take a proactive stance towards fulfilling their climate finance commitments.</p><p>A key outcome of COP27 was the establishment of a \"Loss and Damage\" fund to help vulnerable nations cope with the impacts of climate change. Trump's stance of the US being disadvantaged through such agreements might deprioritise financing commitments, hindering the fund's effectiveness. The reluctance of one of the largest developed economies to contribute would put additional strain on other developed nations to meet the funding gap, risking the success of this vital aspect of climate equity and justice.</p><p>COP27 also saw a renewed emphasis on climate adaptation and resilience for nations most vulnerable to climate change. For India, a country both highly vulnerable to climate impacts and heavily reliant on international climate finance for adaptation, this could mean reduced access to crucial resources, potentially slowing down projects to build climate-resilient infrastructure.</p><p>Energy Cooperation</p><p>On the energy front, given Trump's support for the fossil fuel industry, including coal, oil, and natural gas, it could open up new avenues for India, particularly in importing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), helping it diversify and reduce dependence on conflict-torn Middle East suppliers.</p><p>\"In the energy sector, Trump's push for US energy independence could favor fossil fuel companies as he aims to reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. With deregulation in energy production and a focus on boosting domestic oil and gas output, the sector stands to benefit from a more favorable environment,\" says Raj Patel, CMO, MintCFD.</p><p>While global climate agreements may take a back seat, the Trump administration may still support bilateral technological and energy cooperation to counter China. Given the boom in India's renewable energy sector and its target to hit 500 GW of renewable energy by 2030, the new Trump administration could view the Indian clean energy market as a profitable sector for American businesses.</p><p>\"However, a Trump victory might also result in more energy cooperation, especially given India's expanding energy requirements. The details of Trump's policy and India's response will determine the overall effect,\" says Pravesh Gour, Senior Technical Analyst at Swastika Investmart.</p><p>The positives for India in the short and medium term could be that Trump's unpredictability could push India to press the pedal on self-reliance in the sector and build domestic capabilities to minimise the impact of any unfavourable US policy. On the climate front, keeping aside the funding part for the developing world, Trump's stance could give India more flexibility in balancing growth and sustainability.</p>", "publisher": "Business World", "instances": ["This may deter countries and corporations from making robust commitments to offset and reduce emissions.

Through ComEd's Whole Home Electric program, 450 low-income homes and apartment units have been electrified, with homes retrofitted with all-electric appliances and heating and cooling systems, which are expected to help reduce energy usage, lower net energy costs and lower carbon emissions for the customers and the surrounding community.</p><p>\"By electrifying 450 homes we're reducing emissions, improving air quality and gaining valuable insights into how to decarbonize a sector that is critical to achieving Illinois' clean energy goals,\" said Gil Quiniones, ComEd President and CEO. \"ComEd is proud to work hand in hand with partners like Elevate and Bickerdike to deliver innovative, clean energy technologies to communities that need them most. By empowering customers and lowering costs, we can put ourselves on the path to a cleaner and more equitable future.\"</p><p>The announcement was made at the Nuestro Hogar affordable housing units in Humboldt Park, one of the first multi-family projects electrified through the program. The project is one of several to receive significant upgrades, at no cost to the tenants, with the program exclusively serving low-income communities - those that have historically been impacted by air pollution.</p><p>\"This initiative is about more than just upgrading homes; it is about investing in the health and well-being of our communities,\" said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. \"By electrifying these homes, we are reducing energy costs and environmental impact while ensuring that families in Chicago have access to sustainable, modern living standards. This partnership with ComEd and Elevate is a testament to what is possible when we prioritize equity and innovation in our city's path to a cleaner, greener future.\"</p><p>ComEd first launched the Whole Home Electric program in 2022, with an initial $40 million investment, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower overall energy use and costs for low-income customers - those who can benefit most from energy savings. The program supports the goals of the state's Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA) which calls for expanding clean energy technology, like heat pumps, to help achieve a lower carbon future.</p><p>In partnership with environmental and community agencies, such as Elevate and Resource Innovations, ComEd has since helped electrify 180 single-family homes and 270 multi-family homes through the program, with upgrades coming at no cost to qualifying low-income customers. In the city of Chicago, a combination of 100 single-family and multi-family homes have been completed with Elevate, a local climate justice nonprofit.</p><p>\"Families across Chicago deserve not only affordable housing but homes that promote health and sustainability while reducing energy consumption,\" said Dr. Anne Evens, Elevate CEO. \"I'm proud to have been a partner in the electrification of Nuestro Hogar in Humbolt Park. Retrofits of existing buildings are crucial in preserving affordable and healthy housing. We will continue this vital work with partners like ComEd and Bickerdike to achieve climate equity for all.\"</p><p>With the building sector a significant contributor of overall greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. today, and responsible for about 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions in Chicago neighborhoods, the program helps to deliver a strong example of early efforts that are making a difference, with a goal of scaling this program for the future. So far, the homes completed through the program are estimated to reduce emissions by 2,500 metric tonnes of CO2 annually, which has an environmental impact equivalent to planting 3,000 acres of trees every year. Participating customers are also estimated to save up to $500 annually, on average, on energy bills.</p><p>Nuestro Hogar, an affordable housing property owned by Bickerdike, a community development nonprofit, was first built in 1923. The electrification and weatherization of the 100-year-old, 18-unit building was completed last year and has since saved over 300 megawatt-hours or 100 metric tons of CO2 annually, which is the equivalent to removing 22 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles from the road.</p><p>\"The electrification of Nuestro Hogar Apartments is more than just a modern upgrade; it's a vital step towards creating a sustainable and brighter future for our residents,\" said Joy Aruguete, CEO of Bickerdike. \"As an affordable housing developer, we are committed to ensuring that our community thrives in a healthier environment by moving away from non-renewable resources and toward reducing our carbon footprint. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to our partners ComEd and Elevate who have made this vision a reality.\"</p><p>Through the program, residential customers receive new heat pumps and replace fossil-fueled appliances with all-electric ENERGY STAR appliances like induction cooktops, electric clothes dryers, and other energy-efficient electric technologies, allowing them to reduce their overall energy bills and lower their carbon footprint. Since homes enrolled in Whole Home Electric tend to be older and located in areas historically impacted by pollution, the program also delivers weatherization and home safety upgrades as needed to ensure the maximum efficiency, and helping produce the highest energy savings for customers.</p><p>\"On behalf of the Department of Environment and Mayor Brandon Johnson, I am thrilled to congratulate all the partners involved on this incredible milestone in advancing environmental equity,\" said Angela Tovar, Chief Sustainability Officer for the City of Chicago. \"I look forward to seeing this work continue to grow and bring the benefits of clean energy to even more Chicagoans.\"</p><p>To be eligible to participate in the Whole Home Electrification program, customers must demonstrate annual income at or below 80 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI). Multi-family buildings that provide housing to income-eligible tenants and buildings owned or managed by Public Housing Authorities are also eligible to participate. There is no cost for single-family customers to participate. Income-eligible and public housing multi-family building owners may have a co-pay for certain measures.</p><p>Other qualifying criteria are determined through over the phone screening and a home assessment, completed by the program team. An additional assessment is performed for eligible projects by a qualified ComEd Energy Efficiency Service Provider (EESP), which determines the level of home modifications. The proposed home upgrades must collectively model annual energy bill savings to the customer. Most customers that participate in the Whole Home Electric offering are able to completely eliminate their gas or propane bills.</p><p>The Whole Home Electric program is just one example of how ComEd is working across sectors to expand the benefits of electrification, helping customers unlock energy savings and enhanced air quality that comes with it. ComEd offers a variety of heating and cooling efficiency programs, including a heat pump rebate of up to $1,400, which can be obtained from their local contractor. ComEd is also leading efforts to boost transportation electrification, with a series of rebates launched earlier this year totaling nearly $90 million.</p><p>About Elevate</p><p>Elevate is a nonprofit organization that works nationally and is headquartered in Chicago. Elevate designs and implements programs to ensure that everyone has clean and affordable heat, cooling, power, and water in their homes and communities -no matter who they are or where they live.</p><p>About Bickerdike</p><p>Bickerdike Redevelopment Corporation is a nonprofit, member-based organization dedicated to serving the community development needs of Chicago's north side since 1967.

In addition, the rating incorporates IMEA's strong operating risk profile and trend of stable financial performance and very low leverage.</p><p>The strong operating risk profile is driven by a low cost burden and diversifying resource base. While IMEA's resources are still predominately coal-fired, the agency continues to add renewable resources and utilizes short-term agreements for capacity and energy, as well as market purchases to meet demand. Capital needs are manageable and are expected to be funded from internal sources which, coupled with rate raising flexibility, should allow IMEA to maintain its strong operating income and financial metrics, even through Fitch's forward-look stress scenario.</p><p>The rating and outlook also consider Illinois' clean energy legislation (the Climate Equity and Jobs Act [CEJA]), which requires significant reductions in carbon emissions by fossil fuel-based plants throughout the state by 2038 and net zero emissions by 2050, in addition to the recently promulgated EPA power plant standards which require significant reductions in carbon emissions in coal-fired power plants by 2032.</p><p>IMEA, part owner of the Prairie State Energy Campus (PSEC), a large baseload coal facility constructed in 2012 and located in southern Illinois, is subject to the CEJA and EPA carbon reduction milestones. In addition, the Trimble County coal units (located in northern Kentucky), in which IMEA also has ownership interests, could potentially be impacted by the EPA's power plant standards.</p><p>Fitch does not believe IMEA's operating risk profile or general credit quality are materially impacted by CEJA as all of the agency's outstanding debt matures by 2035, which coincides with the start of the carbon reduction goals set out in the legislation. Fitch will monitor developments with respect to meeting statewide and federal carbon reduction targets and assess any potential impact on IMEA's future costs, capital needs or operations as they become known over time.</p><p>SECURITY</p><p>The bonds are secured by the net revenue of the power supply system after payment of operating and maintenance expenses. Net revenue consists primarily of payments received by IMEA pursuant to long-term take-and-pay all-requirements power sales contracts with 32 participating members.</p><p>KEY RATING DRIVERS</p><p>Revenue Defensibility - 'aa'</p><p>Long-Term Contracts, Strong Member Credit Quality</p><p>IMEA's revenue defensibility is very strong due to its long-term all-requirements power supply contracts with members, autonomous rate-setting authority, and strong underlying credit quality of its largest members. IMEA serves its 32 members across the state of Illinois, pursuant to all-requirements contracts which include provisions that provide an implied, unlimited step-up across members.</p><p>In addition, the IMEA board has full authority over rate setting. The agency initiated the contract renewal process in March 2024 to extend the power supply contracts' termination date from Sept. 30, 2035, which is beyond the final maturity of all its outstanding debt, to May 31, 2055. Within five months of the renewal period being opened, IMEA has secured extensions from 70% of its members.</p><p>Revenue defensibility also considers the strong purchaser credit quality of the largest members - the cities of Naperville and St. Charles - and the agency's very strong rate flexibility. The credit quality of Naperville and St. Charles is characterized by midrange and very strong net margins and cash cushion, respectively; both display sound demographic and socioeconomic trends within their respective service areas and maintain rate setting autonomy.</p><p>Operating Risk - 'a'</p><p>Diverse, Low Cost Resource Base</p><p>The strong operating risk assessment is driven by the agency's low operating cost burden of 6.66 cents/kWh and access to a diverse mix of available purchased power and generation resources to meet its almost 1,000 MWs of load requirements and maintain at least a 15% operating reserve margin. Generation resources include ownership interests in the Trimble County units and PSEC. Both plants are coal-fired units that could be impacted by state and federal regulations.</p><p>IMEA will complete debt service payments for both plants by 2035 and is in the process of setting up decommissioning funds for both plants. The agency is increasingly diversifying its resource base with the addition of low-cost wind and solar energy PPAs.</p><p>The operating risk assessment also reflects the low Fitch-calculated age of plant of 12 years and manageable capital expenditures, as the agency primarily spends on plant upkeep. The capital plan anticipates approximately $70 million in spending through 2028, which is expected to be funded with cash flow from operations. While near-term capital requirements are limited, proposed federal regulations to limit carbon emissions could require significant capital spending over the long term or limit dispatch, increasing PSEC and Trimble County's operating costs.</p><p>Financial Profile - 'aa'</p><p>Stable Margins, Very Low Leverage</p><p>IMEA's very strong financial profile assessment reflects consistently healthy operating margins, robust liquidity levels and very low leverage, measured as net adjusted debt to adjusted funds available for debt service (FADS). Leverage was 4.7x in fiscal 2024 and averaged 5.8x between 2020 and 2024. Coverage of full obligations has consistently exceeded the 1x threshold and was 1.3x in fiscal 2024. The liquidity profile is neutral to the assessment. Unrestricted cash equaled 197 days on hand while the agency's liquidity cushion, which factors in IMEA's $50 million in available lines of credit, was 284 days.</p><p>Fitch's Analytical Stress Test (FAST) scenario analysis reflects leverage on a downward trend in each year of the base case. The stress case, which is considered the rating case, shows leverage is expected to trend below 5.0x over the next five years due to no planned sizable debt issuances, continued debt amortization and expectations for generally stable FADS.</p><p>With a relatively limited amount of debt remaining that will mature by 2035, Fitch also believes IMEA to be relatively well-positioned to meet longer-term challenges with regard to carbon reduction mandates and potential resource transition over the intermediate term.</p><p>Asymmetric Additional Risk Considerations<br/><br/>There are no additional asymmetric risk considerations affecting the rating at this time.</p><p>RATING SENSITIVITIES</p><p>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Negative Rating Action/Downgrade</p><p>* Adoption and implementation of more stringent environmental regulations and emission limitations than those included in the CEJA;</p><p>* A leverage ratio that consistently trends above 8.0x through Fitch's rating case scenario;</p><p>* A meaningful weakening in purchaser credit quality that shifts the revenue defensibility assessment lower.</p><p>Factors that Could, Individually or Collectively, Lead to Positive Rating Action/Upgrade</p><p>* Improved clarity related to CEJA and other emissions regulations compliance strategies;</p><p>* Actual and projected leverage in Fitch's rating case scenario consistently below 5.0x;</p><p>* An improvement in purchaser credit quality.</p><p>PROFILE</p><p>IMEA is a joint action agency comprised of 32 members located throughout the state of Illinois. It supplies all-requirements power to its members through long-term take-and-pay power sales contracts that expire in 2035. IMEA's members serve approximately 145,000 residential and 21,000 commercial and industrial accounts.</p><p>IMEA's increased proportion of owned generation over the past decade affords it greater control over power supply, while reducing its historical dependence on purchased power and providing cost stability to its members. The share of IMEA's total planned capacity provided from purchased power has declined to about 25% from nearly 80% in 2010. An integral part of this process included acquiring an ownership share of PSEC and Trimble County Unit 2.</p><p>Climate and Equitable Jobs Act</p><p>In late 2021, the state of Illinois passed CEJA, which requires all electric generators to provide 100% clean energy generation statewide by 2050. This is likely to be accomplished by phasing out fossil fuel burning power plants, like PSEC, over time. According to the legislation, PSEC must reduce carbon emissions by 45% by 2035 (with a three-year grace period) and eliminate emissions totally by the end of 2045.</p><p>While the law provides the framework for a significant shift in the generation and delivery of energy for utilities like IMEA, Fitch believes the legislation's extended time horizon provides sufficient flexibility to address the carbon reduction requirements. All of IMEA's outstanding debt, including the debt issued to finance PSEC, is scheduled to be retired by 2035, limiting the potential costs and obligations of managing future power supply on IMEA and its members, including the fixed-costs associated with future potential stranded assets. A lack of debt beyond 2035 also provides a degree of flexibility to manage potential resource transition and/or adoption and implementation of new technologies.</p><p>New EPA Power Plant Standards</p><p>In May 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency released final standards regarding the regulation of carbon emissions for existing coal and new gas-fired power plants. The regulations require the closure or significant modification of existing coal-fired power plants by 2032.</p><p>IMEA management has no immediate plans to decommission or terminate its interest in coal resources and is evaluating its options with respect to the new EPA standard. Should the EPA standards withstand the legal challenges, the potential mandate to close or repower the Trimble County and PSEC units could dictate higher costs to IMEA and its wholesale customers over the next decade. However, IMEA continues to diversify its power supply portfolio by adding renewable PPAs and adopting long-term energy and risk management strategies such as increasing the agency's capacity to conduct energy hedging through 2035.</p><p>Source: Fitch Ratings</p><p>[Category: Energy]</p>", "publisher": "Contify Energy News", "instances": ["com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-affirms-illinois-muni-electric-agency-idr-power-supply-revs-at-aa-outlook-stable-26-09-2024The 'AA-' IDR and bond rating reflects the agency's very strong revenue defensibility which is rooted in IMEA's take-and-pay power sales contracts with its 32 all-requirements members, the independent legal ability to increase rates, and the strong credit quality of the largest members.

The report by the UK-based NGO Christian Aid said, four extreme weather events in the past six months, all scientifically shown to have been made more likely, and/or more intense by climate change, has killed over 2,500 people. The non-profit organisation, said insufficient progress has been made since COP28 in the UAE, to move away from fossil fuels, or to support lower-income countries, in coping with climate disasters. As the second week of mid-year climate talks in Bonn began on Monday, it said these numbers demonstrate that the costs of the climate crisis are already being felt. </p><p>\"Rich countries, responsible for the lion's share of the greenhouse gases that are heating the atmosphere, and fuelling extreme events, should recognise their historic responsibility, and increase their funding to the Loss and Damage Fund, to help other countries cope with, and recover from extreme weather,\" Christian Aid said. Delegates at the UN climate negotiations in Dubai in December, agreed on a new loss, and damage fund to address the impacts of climate change disproportionately affecting poor communities in the Global South. The $41 billion in damages is an underestimate, according to the charity. Only insured losses are typically reported, and many of the worst disasters have occurred in countries where few people or businesses have insurance, the report said. The human cost of disasters is also not fully captured in these figures, it added. According to the report, floods that killed at least 169 people in Brazil, and caused at least $7 billion in economic damages, were made twice as likely by climate change. In South, and Southwest Asia, flooding that killed at least 214 people, and caused $850 million in insured damages in the UAE alone was also made more likely by climate change, it said. Simultaneous heatwaves in West, South, and Southeast Asia, killed over 1,500 people in Myanmar alone, with heat deaths notoriously underreported, the report said. The report said the heatwave is expected to slow growth, and increase inflation, and in Southeast Asia, it would have been completely impossible without climate change. In South, and West Asia, it was made five, and 45 times more likely, respectively, and also hotter. Flooding from cyclones in East Africa, killed 559 people, and was made about twice as likely, and also more intense by climate change, it said. \"We cannot heal the burns caused by the climate crisis while we are still throwing fossil fuels on the fire,\" Mariana Paoli, Christian Aid's Global Advocacy Lead, who is from Brazil, said. \"We need rich countries, who are largely responsible for causing the climate crisis, to massively scale up funding for climate action. They need to show real creativity, and political will, tax polluters, and the super-rich to finance genuine climate action. We need to cancel historic debt owed to rich countries by poor ones, and instead ensure that money is used to improve climate equity, helping everyone to be safer from climate disasters,\" Paoli said. The report mentioned that countries in 2015, agreed to limit global average temperature rise to \"well below\" 2 degrees Celsius, and \"preferably\" to 1.5 degrees Celsius, to prevent further worsening of climate impacts, such as droughts, extreme rain, floods, sea level rise, cyclones, heatwaves, etc. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of leading climate scientists, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 43 per cent by 2030, (compared to 2019 levels), and at least 60 per cent by 2035, to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Earth's global surface temperature has already increased by around 1.15 degrees Celsius, compared to the average in 1850-1900, due to the rapidly increasing concentration of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, and methane in the atmosphere. Developing nations, argue they cannot be expected to reduce CO2 emissions faster, if developed countries, historically responsible for climate change, do not provide enhanced financial support. An agreement on New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), or a new climate finance goal, will be the key issue at the United Nations climate conference (COP29) in Baku, Azerbaijan, in November. NCQG is the new amount, developed countries must mobilise every year from 2025 onwards, to support climate action in developing countries. Rich countries are expected to raise more than the $100 billion they promised to provide every year from 2020, but repeatedly failed. </p>", "publisher": "Business Line", "instances": ["In South, and West Asia, it was made five, and 45 times more likely, respectively, and also hotter.
