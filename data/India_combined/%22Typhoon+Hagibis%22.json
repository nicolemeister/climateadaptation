This service allows small and medium-sized municipalities to introduce the service according to their budget by limiting some of the functions to the bare minimum. In addition, the service comes equipped with a menu to support operation after introduction, eliminating operational concerns of employees who actually use the service, and together we aim to promote digital transformation of disaster prevention, especially in small and medium-sized municipalities."]}, {"relevance_score": 19, "title": "Japan braces for 'very dangerous' Typhoon Nanmadol", "published": "2022-09-21", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> September 21 -- Japan's weather agency warned Saturday of \"unprecedented\" risks from a \"very dangerous\" typhoon heading towards the southern Kyushu island, urging residents to take shelter ahead of the storm.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>Typhoon Nanmadol was producing gusts of up to 270 kilometres (167 miles) an hour and classed as a \"violent\" storm, the agency's top level, on Saturday.<br/>By late afternoon it was approaching the remote Minami Daito island, 400 kilometres east of Okinawa island.<br/>The storm is expected to approach or make landfall on Sunday in Kyushu's southern Kagoshima prefecture, then move north the following day before heading towards Japan's main island.<br/>\"There are risks of unprecedented storms, high waves, storm surges, and record rainfall,\" Ryuta Kurora, the head of the Japan Meteorological Agency's forecast unit, told reporters.<br/>\"Maximum caution is required,\" he said, urging residents to evacuate early.<br/>\"It's a very dangerous typhoon.\"<br/>Kurora said the weather agency was likely to issue its highest alert later Saturday for the Kagoshima region.<br/>Called \"special warnings\", these are issued only when the JMA forecasts conditions seen once in a few decades.<br/>It would be the first typhoon-linked special warning issued outside of the Okinawa region since the current system began in 2013.<br/>\"The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse,\" Kurora told reporters, also warning of flooding and landslides.<br/>An evacuation \"instruction\"-level four on a five-level scale-is already in place for 330,000 people in Kagoshima, and authorities urged people to move to shelters or alternative accommodation before a top-level call was issued.<br/>Evacuation warnings in Japan are not mandatory, and during past extreme weather events authorities have struggled to convince residents to take shelter quickly enough.<br/>Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.<br/>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people.<br/>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka, killing 14 people.<br/>And in 2018, floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in western Japan during the country's annual rainy season.<br/>Ahead of Typhoon Nanmadol's arrival, flight cancellations began to affect regional airports including those in Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Kumamoto, according to the websites of Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways.<br/>Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.<br/></p>", "publisher": "India Engineering News", "instances": ["It would be the first typhoon-linked special warning issued outside of the Okinawa region since the current system began in 2013.

The Company accounted for the acquisition of TMR under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic Business Combinations. The operating activities of TMR are included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from March 22, 2019, and comparisons of the Company's results of operations for the fourth quarter and full year of 2019 to the fourth quarter and full year of 2018 should be viewed in that context.

In the fourth quarter of 2019, gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business included $29.5 million of reinstatement premiums primarily associated with Typhoon Hagibis, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which included $102.8 million of reinstatement premiums associated with the Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the other property class of business were $200.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $109.2 million, or 120.0%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities across a number of the Company's underwriting platforms and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Ceded premiums written in the Property segment were $2.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a decrease of $27.2 million, or 92.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease in ceded premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2019 was principally due to $26.0 million of ceded reinstatement premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2018 associated with Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events which did not reoccur in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>The Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $87.1 million and had a combined ratio of 118.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $35.0 million and a combined ratio of 110.6% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 were principally impacted by Typhoon Hagibis and the 2019 Aggregate Losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $235.5 million and added 52.5 percentage points to the Property segment combined ratio.</p><p>In comparison, the fourth quarter of 2018 was impacted by the Q4 2018 Catastrophe Events and changes in certain losses associated with aggregate loss contracts in 2018 (the \"2018 Aggregate Losses\"), which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $205.7 million and added 74.1 percentage points to the Property segment combined ratio. In addition, the underwriting results in the fourth quarter of 2018 were positively impacted by changes in the estimates of the net negative impact of the wildfires in California during the third quarter of 2018 (the \"Q3 2018 California Wildfires\"), Typhoons Jebi, Mangkhut and Trami, and Hurricane Florence (collectively, the \"Q3 2018 Catastrophe Events\") and Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, the Mexico City Earthquake, the wildfires in California during the fourth quarter of 2017 and certain losses associated with aggregate loss contracts (collectively, the \"2017 Large Loss Events\") of $55.2 million and $24.8 million, respectively, reducing the Property segment combined ratio by 17.7 and 7.9 percentage points, respectively.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment were $660.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $312.6 million, or 89.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was due to growth from new and existing business opportunities written in the current and prior periods across various classes of business within the segment, and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>The Casualty and Specialty segment generated underwriting income of $20.8 million and had a combined ratio of 95.9% in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to an underwriting loss of $47.4 million and a combined ratio of 119.3% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The improvement in the Casualty and Specialty segment combined ratio was driven by a decrease of 14.8 percentage points in the net claims and claim expense ratio, principally the result of lower current accident year losses in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which included loss estimates for liability exposures associated with the Q4 2018 California Wildfires. The Casualty and Specialty segment also experienced an 8.6 percentage point decrease in the underwriting expense ratio in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, resulting from a decrease in both the acquisition expense ratio and the operating expense ratio. The acquisition ratio decreased in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily as a result of the effects of purchase accounting amortization related to the acquisition of TMR and changes in estimated commissions. The operating expense ratio decreased 3.6 percentage points due to improved operating leverage from the business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Other Items</p><p>* The Company's total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains on investments, was a gain of $130.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to a loss of $35.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, an improvement of $165.9 million. The improvement in the total investment result was principally due to higher returns on the Company's equity investments trading, private equity investments and catastrophe bonds, partially offset by lower returns on its portfolio of fixed maturity investments trading. Also driving the investment result for the fourth quarter of 2019 were higher average invested assets primarily resulting from the acquisition of TMR, combined with capital raised during 2019 in certain of the Company's consolidated third-party capital vehicles, including DaVinciRe Holdings Ltd. (\"DaVinciRe\"), Upsilon RFO, Vermeer and Medici, and the subsequent investment of those funds as part of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio.</p><p>* Net loss attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in the fourth quarter of 2019 was $2.6 million compared to $49.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. The change was primarily driven by improved performance from DaVinciRe in the fourth quarter of 2019, compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, which was negatively impacted by significant losses in DaVinciRe associated with Hurricane Michael, the Q4 2018 California Wildfires and changes in the 2018 Aggregate Losses. In addition, the fourth quarter of 2019 included net income attributable to Vermeer and improved performance in Medici.</p><p>* In the fourth quarter of 2019, total fee income increased by $4.6 million, to $13.2 million, compared to $8.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily driven by an increase in the dollar value of capital being managed combined with improved underlying performance.</p><p>FULL YEAR 2019 SUMMARY</p><p>* Gross premiums written increased by $1.5 billion, or 45.2%, to $4.8 billion, in 2019, compared to 2018, driven by increases of $670.1 million in the Property segment and $827.3 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment.

The 2018 Large Loss Events resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $338.7 million, and a corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of 37.4 percentage points.

The decrease in the Casualty and Specialty segment net claims and claim expense ratio was principally due to lower current accident year losses, which reduced the net claims and claim expense ratio by 5.1 percentage points in 2019, compared to 2018, which was adversely impacted by liability exposures associated with the Q3 2018 California Wildfires and the Q4 2018 California Wildfires. The underwriting expense ratio in the Casualty and Specialty segment decreased 3.3 percentage points, to 31.2%, in 2019, compared to 34.5% in 2018, primarily due to a decrease in the operating expense ratio as a result of improved operating leverage.</p><p>Other Items</p><p>* Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2019 was $201.5 million, compared to $41.6 million in 2018, an increase of $159.9 million, principally due to improved performance from DaVinciRe and the addition of net income attributable to Vermeer in 2019, compared to 2018, which was negatively impacted by significant losses in DaVinciRe associated with Hurricane Michael, the Q4 2018 California Wildfires and changes in the 2018 Aggregate Losses.</p><p>* In 2019, total fee income increased by $24.3 million, to $114.2 million, compared to $89.9 million in 2018, primarily driven by an increase in the dollar value of capital being managed and improved underlying performance.</p><p>* The Company's total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, was $838.3 million in 2019, compared to $86.8 million in 2018, an increase of $751.5 million.

Relocated to Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks, California, because of the COVID-19 global pandemic, the defending champion has a chance to go back-to-back while making history in a place that is unquestionably familiar. The Hero World Challenge, the event that Woods hosts every December, spent 14 of its first 15 years here. Woods enters the Zozo Championship @ Sherwood with 82 PGA Tour wins all-time, tying him with Sam Sneed for the most in Tour history. The 44-year-old will have to get the record-breaking outcome without the support of a raucous crowd, as spectators remain off limits to limit the chance of viral transmission. Ironically, the 2019 Zozo Championship victory was Woods' last on the Tour. He's played a mere seven times since that final round in Japan, including just four tournaments since the COVID-19 pandemic started in March. Familiarity with the course could provide a boost, but the tournament's environment will be a far cry from the event Woods is accustomed to playing at Sherwood. The Hero World Challenge traditionally features a 16-man field, including the defending champion, the top 11 available players from the World Golf Rankings and four sponsor exemptions selected by the Woods' foundation. More faces, more competition and more at-stake - all things Woods is preparing to take on. \"Let's just say that the field is a lot bigger than normally when I have played here. I only had to beat 11 other guys, so that's very different,\" Woods said. \"This golf course - I need to get another look at it tomorrow on the front nine, because the greens are definitely different than last time we played here.

Argos results for the 2019 fourth quarter and full year are clearly unacceptable, said Argo Group Interim CEO Kevin Rehnberg. The industry is experiencing rising claims severity in several lines of business. We have taken appropriate action to adjust our current and prior accident year loss ratios in response to these conditions and to specific information received in the quarter. We believe the actions taken strengthen our balance sheet and position us for a more profitable future.

Prior accident year losses in both segments were the result of new information received in the quarter relating to claims trends across various lines of business, as well as a continued review of International business currently in run-off.

The decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to certain contracts that we did not renew, including certain contracts which no longer fit our underwriting criteria as a result of our shift in underwriting strategy.

These losses were driven primarily by event cancellation, property business interruption, and certain casualty and multi-line quota share contracts.</p><p>The economic impact of the ongoing pandemic will continue to create uncertainty around the ultimate scope of claims and potential for additional insurance losses.

The adverse underwriting loss development is a result of accumulated loss experience and cedent reserving increases, indicating that underlying casualty loss trends are higher than initial pricing and reserving, consistent with the industry impact of social inflation. In addition, the current elevated level of uncertainty makes historical data less applicable for future projections, and has contributed to an increase in the estimate of ultimate losses on certain accounts.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net $1.1 million and $5.4 million improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to net favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p><p>Investments</p><p>The following is a summary of our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thirdpointre.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Third-Point-Re-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.thirdpointre.com/investors/news/press-release-details/2021/Third-Point-Re-Announces-Fourth-Quarter-2020-Earnings-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities.

We were astonished by the warmth with which the delegation was greeted by Japanese counterparts. Quite remarkably, the travel itinerary and official engagements over 5 days visit remained unchanged and executed by our hosts as planned. Further, we were overwhelmed by the preparations for the visit of around 2,000 dignitaries from around 200 countries for the Coronation Ceremony of Emperor Naruhito of Japan the week after, which was unwavered by the wrath of super Typhoon Hagibis. We visited Roppongi Grand Tower, a 231 metre tall building in heart of Tokyo, developed by Sumitomo Realty &amp; Development Company. On our enquiry whether super Typhoon had any impact on the Grand Tower, the CEO seemed as unmoved as the gleaming skyscraper, standing out in the Roppongi skyline.</p><p>Japan is not new to disasters- the most devastating being Great Hanshin earthquake 1995, Great East Japan earthquake 2011 and Tsunami which triggered the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. Over the course of time, Japan's national spirit has been synonymous with utmost resilience, reinforced by Japan's ability to handle natural disasters in a well prepared and timely manner. Japan's political and economic commitment to disaster risk reduction and resilience has been a leading example for the whole world to see.</p><p>In India as well, natural disasters are a common phenomenon. Cyclone Fani wreaked havoc in Odisha. The preparedness of disaster management authorities was well appreciated across the world, when the coastal authorities in Odisha moved more than a million people from the area within Cyclone Fani's projected path onto higher ground, significantly reducing the death toll to 89. India's preparedness for natural disasters has increased a lot in recent times, but there is still a long way to emulate the Japanese spirit.</p><p>During the visit to Tokyo Tower, we saw a movie depicting the series of events in World War II, culminating in atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 when the whole nation came to a standstill. The movie recounted the carpet \"Bombing of Tokyo\", when the entire city was ravaged by a series of firebomb assaults, leaving an estimated 100,000 civilians dead and over 1 million homeless. Significant city monuments like Tokyo station were also destroyed. In the 1950s, Japan, still ravaged by the war, aimed to become modern, peaceful and part of the world's economic elite. One of the key elements in the construction of this renewed Japanese society was building of a monument to symbolize Japan's ascendancy as a global economic powerhouse. This led to the planning of Tokyo Tower by Hisakichi Maeda, to be taller than Empire State Building and Eiffel Tower, among the tallest structures in the world. The building of Tokyo Tower attracted thousands of Japanese construction workers and instilled a greater sense of nationalism in the hearts of Japanese people, at a time when it was needed the most. Tokyo Tower glorified their engineering and technical prowess and showed the world that it was way ahead of its time. By the end of 1958, the Tokyo Tower was finished and presented to the public as the world's tallest freestanding tower at the time, taller than Eiffel Tower. During the same period, the Japanese economy resurged and the tower signified the post-war recovery phase and the Japanese spirit.</p><p>In 1964, Japan became the center of attention for the world when they hosted the Tokyo Olympics with immense aplomb and success, announcing their comeback to the global stage. It was a massive undertaking at the national level, with some estimates suggesting that Tokyo spent the equivalent of its national budget at that time on a major integrated development program which transformed the city's infrastructure. Simultaneously, completion of many large-scale infrastructure projects was timed to coincide with the 1964 Olympics, including the launch of the globally famous Shinkansen bullet train. Tokyo Station was rebuilt as a heritage building by innovative selling of air rights to enable an integrated development of the entire area. The collective effort of the entire nation driving the resurgence of the nation's economy, is what impressed us the most.</p><p>India too has a rich history and culture. Over the course of the colonial rule, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, popularly remembered as Iron Man of India, successfully imbibed the spirit of solidarity within the citizens of the country. To realize his vision, 'Statue of Unity' was unveiled as world's tallest statue in 2018, taller than the Statue of Liberty. Many people initially expressed discontent at the expenditure on the statue being exorbitantly high. Lately, the monument has witnessed high tourist footfalls, making it one of the most visited destinations across the country. Like Tokyo Tower of Japan, the 'Statue of Unity' of India will serve as a symbol to imbibe a sense of national purpose in hearts of 130 crore Indians, immensely essential to embark on building a strong, prosperous and inclusive India and to ensure that the fruits of development reach the bottom of pyramid.</p><p>India is working towards the holistic achievement of the global Sustainable Development Goals, taking unprecedented leaps under the leadership of Hon'ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi. Running world's biggest health assurance scheme covering 500 million citizens, world's biggest financial inclusion scheme opening over 370 million bank accounts for the poor, India draws inspiration from 'Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas'. The efforts are ours, but their fruits are for global humanity. In 2014, India was lagging behind in sanitation and an Open Defecation Free (ODF) India seemed a far-fetched dream, with less than 50% of households in the country having access to sanitation facilities. Yet, India has been able to successfully implement the world's largest sanitation programme underSwachh Bharat Mission, building 110 million toilets in just 5 years, a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150 Birth Anniversary on 2 October,2019.Swach Bharat Mission has turned into a Jan Andolan, catalyzed by behavioral transformation led by 130 crore Indians. On one hand, India is committed to achieving the target of 450 GW of renewable energy and on the other hand India is leading the initiatives like International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, shining examples of her ever-growing global influence.</p><p>India is one of the fastest growing nations, with an annual average economic growth of 7.5% over the last 5 years, coupled with low inflation and low fiscal deficits. In the last 4 years, India has jumped 79 positions in the World Bank Ease of Doing Business (EoDB) rankings, currently ranked at 63, being the only large country in the world to witness such monumental progress. The jump of 25 places in EODB in Construction Permits is unprecedented, considering last year's jump was 129 places. Recently, reforms and policy measures in the country have ensured commitment towards a \"one nation one belief\" approach, charting its way towards realizing the vision of a USD 5 trillion dollar economy.</p><p>India needs to address the challenge of engaging with modernity and economic development with cultural preservation, learning from Japan. With focus on modernization, Japan has always aspired to achieve their development goals through state-led encouragement of a nation-wide and collective effort. Japanese people have always leaned on their own unique culture, despite the global wave of westernization. Their united effort at improving themselves, focusing on their internal strengths and competencies is commendable. Japanese spirit of embracing challenge with spirit and camaraderie has synergies with Indian ethos. The advanced, precision manufacturing and kaizen quality control principles are leading examples for the rest of the world. Thus, a lot of lessons can be taken from the Japanese national spirit of collectivism and unity. Similarly, our country can realize its vision for equitable growth by incorporating a sense of national pride amongst its citizens through projects of national integration, ensuring that each one of us contributes towards the natural goal of meeting the aspirations of New India.</p><p>Shri Durga Shanker Mishra is currently Secretary, Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA) and views expressed in the article are his own in personal capacity.</p>", "publisher": "Free Press Journal (India)", "instances": ["Our delegation for 11 India-Japan Joint Working Group Meeting on Urban Development reached Japan on 15 October, just 3 days after super Typhoon Hagibis, one of the most powerful in the last six decades, hit Japan and claimed 74 lives.

The lower combined ratios in the 2019 periods are primarily due to significantly lower, though still material, net catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower favorable prior accident year loss reserve development. Catastrophe losses were $224 million and $301 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, compared with $304 million and $500 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2018, respectively.</p><p>Insurance</p><p>Insurance segment net premiums written increased by 27.0% and 16.4% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods.</p><p>RSUI's net premiums written increased by 29.3% and 17.9% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods, reflecting growth in most lines of business due to increases in business opportunities, improved general market conditions, and meaningfully higher rates, particularly in the property, directors' and officers' liability and excess casualty lines of business.</p><p>RSUI's combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 104.3%, compared with 122.2% for the fourth quarter of 2018, and was 87.7% for 2019, compared with 94.1% for 2018. The lower combined ratios in the 2019 periods are primarily due to significantly lower net catastrophe losses, partially offset by lower favorable prior accident year loss reserve development. In the fourth quarter of 2019, favorable prior year loss reserve development across several of RSUI's lines of business was largely offset by unfavorable prior year reserve development in RSUI's professional liability line of business.</p><p>CapSpecialty's net premiums written increased by 21.2% and 12.6% in the three months and year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods, primarily reflecting continued growth in the healthcare, professional liability, specialty casualty and surety lines of business due to increases in business opportunities and CapSpecialty's expanded product offerings, and the impact of CapSpecialty's purchase of certain renewal rights in 2018 and 2019.</p><p>CapSpecialty's combined ratio for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 130.4% compared with 97.4% for the fourth quarter of 2018, and was 108.4% for 2019, compared with 97.7% for 2018. The higher combined ratios for the 2019 periods reflect significant unfavorable prior accident year loss reserve development in the fourth quarter of 2019, most significantly related to professional liability and other casualty lines of business written in recent years.</p><p>In connection with the leadership changes at CapSpecialty in 2019, the company has commenced several new initiatives to restructure its operations with the goal of improving long-term profitability. Consequently, CapSpecialty's premium growth in 2020 may be muted as less profitable lines are reduced.</p><p>Alleghany Capital</p><p>The following table summarizes earnings (losses) before income taxes and adjusted earnings (losses) before income taxes for the Alleghany Capital segment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>Disclaimer: The table has been omitted (The document can be viewed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx\">https://www.alleghany.com/investor-relations/press-releases/press-release-details/2020/Alleghany-Corporation-Reports-2019-Fourth-Quarter-and-Full-Year-Quarter-Results/default.aspx</url>)</p><p>The decrease in earnings before income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2019 from the fourth quarter of 2018 reflects a decrease in earnings in both the non-industrial and industrial operations. The decrease in non-industrial earnings before income taxes primarily reflects lower earnings at Jazwares due to a shorter holiday shopping season, reduced earnings from the Fortnite license, which launched and generated significant earnings in the fourth quarter of 2018, and increased costs due to the acquisition of Wicked Cool Toys, LLC in October 2019, which will only begin to materially contribute to earnings in the second half of 2020. The industrial operations loss in the fourth quarter of 2019 compared with earnings before income taxes in the fourth quarter of 2018 primarily reflects lower sales and margins at W&amp;W|AFCO Steel largely due to adjustments related to a significant project completed in the 2019 fourth quarter.</p><p>The increase in earnings before income taxes in 2019 from 2018 reflects an increase in earnings in both the non-industrial and industrial operations. The increase in non-industrial earnings before income taxes primarily reflects the impact of higher sales at Jazwares, most significantly due to strong performance of the Fortnite license, and to a lesser extent, the addition of Concord (acquired in October 2018) and organic sales growth at IPS. The increase in industrial earnings before income taxes primarily reflects higher sales and higher margins at W&amp;W|AFCO Steel and, to a lesser extent, higher sales at Kentucky Trailer. Increased sales at W&amp;W|AFCO Steel reflects organic growth and good execution on its backlog entering the year.</p><p>INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE</p><p>Alleghany reported net investment income for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 of $137 million and $550 million, respectively, an increase of 11.2% and 9.9%, respectively, from the corresponding 2018 periods.

Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas. As the public and private sectors balance an understanding of the science with smart business solutions, this will lead to new advances that lower the physical risk and improve overall awareness.\"</p><p>Other significant regional events during the year included:</p><p>* Wettest 12-month stretch in the contiguous U.S. on record dating to 1895 with river flooding across the Mississippi River watershed causing more than USD20 billion in economic losses</p><p>* Category 5 Hurricane Dorian made multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a 185 mph (295 kph) storm; tying with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane as the strongest landfalling storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean</p><p>* Cyclone Idai in Mozambique caused the most substantial humanitarian crisis killing 1,303 people and destroying more than 300,000 homes with USD2 billion economic losses.</p><p>* Windstorm Eberhard was the lone event in Europe to surpass USD1 billion in insured losses after tracking across Western and Central Europe in March.</p><p>* Globe's deadliest earthquake occurred in Albania on November 26, killing 52 people</p><p>* Monsoon rains led to a combined USD25 billion in flood-related damage in China (USD15 billion) and India (USD10 billion) alone</p><p>* Intense multi-year drought and record-setting spring and summer heat led to conditions able to ignite destructive bushfires in Australia.

We believe the actions taken strengthen our balance sheet and position us for a more profitable future.\"</p><p>\"We are experiencing substantial rate increases across our platform, with strong double-digit gains in International and certain U.S. liability lines. Our capital position remains strong, we are continuing to refine our product strategies and we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the specialty commercial insurance marketplace.\"</p><p>Key items affecting the fourth quarter include:</p><p>* Prior accident year losses of approximately $77 million or 18.0 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for the fourth quarter. Reserve increases were related to the Company's London, Bermuda Insurance and European business units within Argo's International Operations, as well as property, professional and liability lines within Argo's U.S. Operations. Prior accident year losses in both segments were the result of new information received in the quarter relating to claims trends across various lines of business, as well as a continued review of International business currently in run-off. Prior year losses also include the conclusion of Argo's annual review of Run-off reserves, which resulted in a $10 million reserve increase.</p><p>* Current accident year losses of approximately $30 million, or an additional 6 points when compared to the third quarter 2019 year-to-date current accident year loss ratio of 59%. The adjustment reflects a change in actuarial estimates based on a more uncertain claims environment and the recalibration of the current year based on prior accident year loss adjustments.</p><p>* Catastrophe losses and related reinstatement premiums of approximately $3 million, or 0.5 points on Argo's consolidated loss ratio for the fourth quarter. Catastrophe losses were primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis and were partially offset by a modest reduction to estimated losses for prior quarter events.</p><p>* Additional operating expenses of approximately $12 million or 2.9 points related to costs associated with a reduction in workforce, an allowance for doubtful accounts related to our European business unit, and adjustments to underwriting expenses based on certain costs previously allocated to investment functions and trade capital providers.</p><p>Based on these items discussed above, Argo expects to report an underwriting loss of approximately $114 million for the quarter.</p><p>Additionally, several non-operating charges will be reflected in fourth quarter results:</p><p>* As part of an ongoing strategic review and recent operating results, a goodwill impairment of approximately $16 million related to Argo's European business unit.</p><p>* Expenses of approximately $18 million related to losses and impairments on certain long-lived assets that are held for sale, primarily a corporate aircraft and real estate properties; the cancellation of contracts related to certain sponsorships and marketing services; and to severance costs associated with separation from Argo's former CEO.</p><p>* Other corporate expenses of approximately $8 million, which primarily resulted from costs related to the previously announced independent directors' review of certain governance and compensation matters and Argo's cooperation agreement with Voce Capital.</p><p>Argo Schedules Earnings Release for February 24, 2020</p><p>The company will release fourth quarter 2019 financial results after the close of U.S. financial markets on Monday, February 24, 2020.

(NYSE: ARGO) (\"Argo\" or the \"Company\") today announced financial results for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019. On February 12, the company issued preliminary comments on its financial results. In addition, on February 18, the company announced certain governance and management changes, including the appointment of Kevin Rehnberg as permanent CEO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We believe our organization has great potential, but our results for 2019 are not indicative of our future direction,\" said Rehnberg. \"Immediately upon my appointment as Interim CEO in November, we started a review process of all of Argo's operations. That review process is ongoing. The company has a strong foundation of specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses, focused largely on the most attractive specialty market - U.S. domiciled risks. The core of this foundation is not going to change, but it can certainly be enhanced. Some of our businesses are performing very well today, while others are not meeting return expectations. We are acting swiftly to address areas where the available return prospects are not achievable in the near term and do not fit our focused strategic direction.</p><p>\"Going forward, we are insisting upon a culture of results and accountability, as well as a set of operating principles that will help us to be a more focused and efficient organization,\" added Rehnberg. \"We are eliminating unnecessary spending and will deploy capital more strategically going forward. We believe Argo has an excellent specialty platform and world-class talent. We intend to work together to aggressively pursue our financial targets and deliver an improving return on equity over the near and long term. We look forward to sharing more about this strategy on our earnings call tomorrow and throughout the rest of the year.\"</p><p>\"The Board is fully supportive of Kevin's vision for the Company and impressed by all that has been achieved over the past few months, and we welcome him as Argo's permanent CEO,\" said Thomas Bradley, Chairman-elect of the Argo Board of Directors. \"He and the team have a strong track record of operational excellence and noteworthy results in the U.S. We are confident in Kevin's ability to execute those strategies companywide. We believe the Argo management team has been strengthened by recent hires, and we are confident in their ability to deliver on the Company's commitments to customers, employees and shareholders.\"</p><p>Segment Overview - U.S. Operations</p><p>* Gross written premiums in the 2019 fourth quarter of $465.1 million increased $38.3 million or 9% compared to the 2018 fourth quarter. The overall increase reflects an improving rate environment, continued focus on execution of strategic growth plans and digital initiatives, while still executing on appropriate risk selection and exposure management actions.</p><p>* Net earned premiums in the 2019 fourth quarter of $271.1 million were consistent with the 2018 fourth quarter net earned premiums of $271.3 million. The change in net earned premiums relative to the growth in gross written premiums is due to the ongoing strategic use of reinsurance programs as part of overall risk management initiatives and a one-time ceded premium adjustment of $22 million.</p><p>* The loss ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 71.6%, compared to 59.0% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 62.2%, compared to 58.0% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The 4.2 point increase in the current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio was driven by increases in the Liability, Professional, and Property lines loss ratios.</p><p>* Net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development for the 2019 fourth quarter was $25.5 million. The unfavorable prior accident year reserve development is related primarily to Liability lines, and to a lesser extent Property and Professional lines. These increases were partially offset by favorable prior year development in Specialty lines.</p><p>* The expense ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 33.2%, compared to 33.0% for the fourth quarter of 2018, a 0.2 point increase. The modest increase in the 2019 fourth quarter expense ratio reflected the ceded premium adjustment mentioned previously, as well as an increase in the acquisition expense ratio due to business mix.</p><p>Segment Overview - International Operations</p><p>* Gross written premiums in the 2019 fourth quarter of $247.6 million decreased 10% compared to the 2018 fourth quarter. The decrease reflects the effects of planned remedial underwriting actions, including the termination of certain programs and classes of business that did not meet our financial objectives. These planned reductions were partially offset by continued rate increases and targeted growth in select markets.</p><p>* Net earned premiums in the 2019 fourth quarter of $154.6 million decreased $26.5 million or 14.6% from the 2018 fourth quarter. The net earned premium declines in the quarter were due to the ongoing strategic use of reinsurance programs and an increased use of third-party capital, most notably within Property Reinsurance lines.</p><p>* The loss ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 100.3%, compared to 66.0% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 72.0%, compared to 60.4% for the 2018 fourth quarter. The increase in the current accident year ex-CAT loss ratio reflected a change in actuarial estimates based on a more frequent occurrence of attritional and large losses across most divisions in our Syndicate 1200 operation and the recalibration of the current accident year based on prior accident year reserve adjustments.</p><p>* Net unfavorable prior accident year reserve development for the 2019 fourth quarter was $40.9 million. The current quarter reserve movements were primarily the result of new information received relating to claims trends across various lines of business, the resolution and/or notification of several large losses, as well as businesses previously exited or where we have taken aggressive underwriting actions to improve profitability.</p><p>* Catastrophe losses incurred for the 2019 fourth quarter were $3.1 million, which primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis in Japan.</p><p>* The expense ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter was 48.8% compared to 38.5% in the prior year quarter. The increased expense ratio related to continued investments in technology and digital initiatives, severance costs associated with the exit of certain businesses, retention of certain costs previously allocated to third-party capital providers and the noted reduction of net earned premiums.</p><p>* During the fourth quarter of 2019, results for International included a goodwill impairment charge of approximately $16 million related to Argo's European business unit. This was a result of an ongoing strategic review and recent operating results of this business unit.</p><p>The full PDF release can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"https://d1hks021254gle.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Q4-2019-Argo-Earnings-Release.pdf\">https://d1hks021254gle.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Q4-2019-Argo-Earnings-Release.pdf</url></p><p>Investor Conference Call</p><p>Argo Group management will conduct an investor conference call starting at 11 a.m. EST on Tuesday, February 25, 2020.</p><p>A live webcast of the conference call can be accessed at <url normalizedValue=\"https://services.choruscall.com/links/argo200225.html\">https://services.choruscall.com/links/argo200225.html</url>.

Earthquakes, tornadoes, volcanoes, landslides and drought plagued earth the last ten years. Most scientists believe that this was due to nature as well as the climate change wrought due to humanity's inconsideration for the environment. In the year 2010 alone, a quarter of a million people worldwide died due to natural disasters, more than those killed by terrorism in the past 40 years.

The weather was weird and deadly, extreme and we experienced earthquakes and intense droughts. One of the reasons for widespread destruction was that urban and rural areas were more populated than the previous decades, and the quality of construction was quite poor. The people who live in poverty were the most adversely affected. Every time the ground shook, or a cyclone hit, more people lost their lives and property.</p><h>Haiti earthquake</h><p>In January, 220,000 people were killed in one of the most terrible earthquakes ever, in Haiti's Port-au-Prince. The people mainly lived in poorly constructed shanties and therefore, the area had a higher mortality rate. In February of the same year, an earthquake which was 500 times more intense than the Haiti earthquake 2010 struck Chile, in an area which was much less populated and with stronger buildings. The damage was less and 1000 people lost their lives.</p><p>Scientists claim that Earth is experiencing weird weather due to global warming. In the summer of 2010, there was a heat wave in Russia and flooding in the country of Pakistan, which together killed 17,000 people.</p><p>US and China experienced blizzards and extreme heat spells in the same year. The freeze was so extreme in southern USA that the cold blooded iguanas fell off the trees. Los Angeles experienced 113 F, the hottest day ever in recorded history. In May, Pakistan had the hottest day of 129 degrees F, which was at that time the hottest temperature recorded in inhabited location.</p><p>An Icelandic volcano disrupted air travel for five days, affecting 7 million people.

The improvement was primarily due to the favorable impact of General Insurance underwriting and reinsurance actions, favorable net prior year loss reserve development of $153 million (pre-tax) compared to unfavorable net prior year loss reserve development of $365 million (pre-tax) in the prior-year quarter, a reduction in pre-tax net catastrophe losses of $385 million compared to the prior-year quarter, and an increase of $833 million (pre-tax) in net investment income compared to the prior-year quarter.

The improvement in our financial performance over the course of last year was broad-based, with contributions from all of our segments, but most notable was the return to underwriting profitability in General Insurance. The full year combined ratio was 99.6% and the accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 96.0%. Life &amp; Retirement also delivered solid results in the face of continued headwinds from low interest rates and tightening credit spreads.

In addition to continued work as part of the turnaround of General Insurance, AIG 200 will be a top priority. AIG 200 is our multi-year, enterprise-wide transformation program focused on the long-term strategic positioning of AIG and designed to achieve operational excellence.

Favorable net prior year loss reserve development totaled $153 million and was primarily due to favorable net prior year loss reserve development for accident year 2017. Catastrophe-related losses, net of reinsurance, totaled $411 million, including $233 million from Typhoon Hagibis and $146 million from Texas tornadoes and California wildfires. The combined ratio was 99.8. The accident year combined ratio, as adjusted, was 95.8, comprised of a 61.6 accident year loss ratio, as adjusted*, an improvement of 230 basis points from the prior-year quarter, and an expense ratio of 34.2, an improvement of 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The decrease in accident year loss ratio, as adjusted, reflected the underwriting and reinsurance actions taken to improve business mix and loss performance, and to reduce volatility in the General Insurance book of business.</p><p>Life and Retirement - Fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income increased 35% to $839 million compared to the prior-year quarter. The increase reflected favorable impacts from equity market returns, favorable impacts from lower interest rates resulting in higher income on fair value option bonds and gains on calls, and higher assets driving higher base portfolio income, partially offset by spread compression due to lower reinvestment yields and slightly higher general operating expenses (GOE) from investments in the business compared to the prior-year quarter. Net flows were unfavorable compared to the prior-year quarter primarily due to lower Fixed Annuity sales and slightly higher group surrenders, partially offset by strong Index Annuity sales and higher group acquisition sales. Life and Retirement's Adjusted ROCE for the fourth quarter of 2019 was 13.0%.</p><p>Net Investment Income - Fourth quarter net investment income increased 30% to $3.6 billion reflecting higher alternative investment income of $209 million compared to a loss in the prior-year quarter. Annualized yield for alternative investment income was 12.26% for the fourth quarter of 2019, above AIG's 8% annualized assumption for the quarter, compared to -5.85% in the prior-year quarter.</p><p>Other Operations - Fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax loss of $586 million increased from an adjusted pre-tax loss of $420 million in the prior-year quarter, which included a loss of $133 million and a gain of $31 million, respectively, from consolidation, eliminations and other adjustments. Net of consolidation, eliminations and other adjustments, the slight increase in the pre-tax loss was primarily due to an increase in interest expense from consolidated investment entities of $44 million.</p><p>Legacy Results - Fourth quarter adjusted pre-tax income of $177 million compared to adjusted pre-tax loss of $150 million in the prior-year quarter. The fourth quarter of 2018 included a $105 million pre-tax charge resulting from loss recognition on certain Accident &amp; Health cancer and disability blocks. Excluding the charge, the increase in pre-tax income was primarily due to higher net investment income.</p><p>Book Value per Common Share - As of December 31, 2019, book value per common share was $74.93 compared to $65.04 at December 31, 2018 reflecting an increase in retained earnings as a result of 2019 net income and an increase in AOCI as a result of lower interest rates on the fixed maturity portfolio. Adjusted book value per common share increased 7% to $58.89 compared to the prior year end due to growth in retained earnings as a result of $3.3 billion of net income attributable to AIG common shareholders in the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.</p><p>Return on Common Equity (ROCE) - ROCE for the fourth quarter and the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was 5.7% and 5.3%, respectively, a significant improvement from the prior-year quarter and the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, due to higher net income attributable to AIG. Adjusted ROCE for the fourth quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2019 was 7.3% and 8.3%, respectively, an improvement from (4.6)% and 2.1% in the prior-year quarter and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively, due to higher adjusted after-tax income attributable to AIG common shareholders.</p><p>Liquidity and Capital - As of December 31, 2019, AIG Parent liquidity stood at approximately $7.6 billion, including $1.7 billion to be paid for an expected tax settlement with the Internal Revenue Service, which could be made as early as the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>GENERAL INSURANCE</p><p>The full release can be found at (<url normalizedValue=\"https://aig.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aig-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results\">https://aig.gcs-web.com/news-releases/news-release-details/aig-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results</url>)</p><p>Source: American International Group, Inc.</p>", "publisher": "Contify Insurance News", "instances": ["Duperreault added.

Approximately one quarter of the increase from the 2018 fourth quarter resulted from new businesses acquired during 2019 or new business initiatives or product lines. The remaining growth came from expansion in existing products and accounts, and rate increases across most lines of business. Net premiums earned in the 2019 fourth quarter were 15.4% higher than in the 2018 fourth quarter, and reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters.</p><p>The 2019 fourth quarter loss ratio reflected 0.9 points of current year catastrophic activity, compared to 6.0 points in the 2018 fourth quarter, which was impacted by Hurricane Michael and the California wildfires. The 2019 fourth quarter loss ratio also reflected a higher level of large attritional losses than in the 2018 fourth quarter.

In addition, the 2018 fourth quarter net premiums written included a higher level of reinstatement premiums, due to 2018 catastrophic events, as well as premium adjustments on a multi-year casualty contract. Net premiums earned by the reinsurance segment in the 2019 fourth quarter were 11.6% higher than in the 2018 fourth quarter, and reflect changes in net premiums written over the previous five quarters.</p><p>The 2019 fourth quarter loss ratio included 6.9 points of current year catastrophic activity, primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis, compared to 26.1 points of catastrophic activity in the 2018 fourth quarter primarily related to Hurricane Michael and the California Wildfires. In addition, the 2018 fourth quarter included a large attritional casualty loss arising from the California wildfires that increased the loss ratio by 5.0 points.

The growth in net premiums written primarily reflected an increase in monthly premium business due to growth in insurance in force. The increase in net premiums earned for the 2019 fourth quarter reflected the growth in insurance in force in the U.S. over the last twelve months combined with higher single premium earned as a result of policy terminations due to mortgage refinance activity. Insurance in force increased to $418.3 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $383.7 billion at December 31, 2018.</p><p>Arch MI U.S. generated $24.1 billion of new insurance written (\"NIW\") in the 2019 fourth quarter, compared to $16.7 billion in the 2018 fourth quarter, primarily reflecting a higher level of mortgage refinance activity. Monthly premium policies contributed 94.4% of NIW in the 2019 fourth quarter, compared to 91.4% in the 2018 fourth quarter.</p><p>The loss ratio for the 2019 fourth quarter benefited from better than expected claim experience. Estimated net favorable development in prior year loss reserves, before related adjustments, improved the 2019 fourth quarter loss ratio by 9.4 points, compared to 10.4 points in the 2018 fourth quarter, while estimated net favorable development in current year loss reserves improved the 2019 fourth quarter loss ratio by 5.1 points, compared to 4.1 points in the 2018 fourth quarter. This was driven by lower expected claim rates on first lien business and, to a lesser extent, frequency improvement and subrogation activity on second lien and student loans. The percentage of loans in default on Arch MI U.S first lien business was 1.54% at December 31, 2019, compared to 1.60% at December 31, 2018.</p><p>Corporate and Non-Underwriting</p><p>Corporate and non-underwriting results include net investment income, other income (loss), corporate expenses, transaction costs and other, amortization of intangible assets, interest expense, items related to the Company's non-cumulative preferred shares, net realized gains or losses, net impairment losses included in earnings, equity in net income or loss of investment funds accounted for using the equity method, net foreign exchange gains or losses and income taxes. Such amounts exclude the results of the 'other' segment.</p><p>Pre-tax net investment income for the 2019 fourth quarter was $0.29 per share, or $119.9 million, compared to $0.28 per share, or $115.6 million, for the 2018 fourth quarter. The growth in net investment income primarily reflected a higher level of income on fund investments. The annualized pre-tax investment income yield was 2.36% for the 2019 fourth quarter, compared to 2.49% for the 2018 fourth quarter, primarily due to the effects of a lower interest rate environment.</p><p>On a pre-tax basis, net foreign exchange losses for the 2019 fourth quarter were $38.0 million, compared to net foreign exchange gains for the 2018 fourth quarter of $20.4 million. For both periods, such amounts were primarily unrealized and resulted from the effects of revaluing the Company's net insurance liabilities required to be settled in foreign currencies at each balance sheet date. Changes in the value of available-for-sale investments held in foreign currencies due to foreign currency rate movements are reflected as a direct increase or decrease to shareholders' equity and are not included in the consolidated statements of income. Although the Company generally attempts to match the currency of its projected liabilities with investments in the same currencies, the Company may elect to over or underweight one or more currencies from time to time, which could increase the Company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and increase the volatility of the Company's shareholders' equity.</p><p>The Company's effective tax rate on income before income taxes was 7.7% for the 2019 fourth quarter and 8.7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 20.4% for the 2018 fourth quarter and 13.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018.
