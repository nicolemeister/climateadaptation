The summit will address the global challenge of climate change, calling for stronger international cooperation while empowering local communities to build resilience.</p><p>The COP30 agenda will focus on six interconnected priorities. Energy, industry, and transport transition towards renewable sources; protection and restoration of ecosystems-forests, oceans, and biodiversity-while tackling deforestation; sustainable agriculture and resilient food systems with equitable food access; climate-resilient cities and infrastructure, including water management; human and social development to reduce climate change's social impacts and cross-cutting enablers such as climate finance and technology transfer.</p><p>The inter-linkage between these priorities is starkly evident in Kendrapada, Odisha, one of 11 Indian districts identified at \"Very High\" risk for both flood and drought in the District-level Climate Risk Assessment for India. Similar patterns of vulnerability exist across India and beyond.</p><p>In Kendrapada, coastal erosion forces families into nearby villages without adequate rehabilitation, or to migrate to far-off cities. Rehabilitation sites often flood during the monsoon, submerging roads and isolating homes. Many displaced families have not received compensation, leaving them without farmland, legal ownership of new homes, or access to forests and kitchen gardens they once relied on.</p><p>Each week, buses carry young migrants nearly 2,000 km to cities like Ernakulam, Kerala, where they work long hours for low wages and send meagre remittances home.

Disaster-affected communities require comprehensive compensation that includes sustainable livelihood support, alongside robust social security measures such as pensions, housing, healthcare, and employment guarantees for climate-affected informal workers, facilitated through worker support centres. Expanding green cover is equally vital, both to arrest coastal erosion and biodiversity loss and to strengthen natural defences against cyclones and floods. The establishment of climate commissions at both national and state levels with people's participation can facilitate the monitoring of climate action plans and ensure compliance from the private sector while addressing the concerns of affected community.</p><p>On this World Humanitarian Day, let us uphold the spirit of global solidarity and local empowerment-not just in words, but through concrete climate action.

And what are the legal consequences for states causing significant climate harm, especially to vulnerable small island nations?</p><p>The ICJ's advisory opinion is the result of years of advocacy led by visionary law students from Pacific Island nations who refused to let their futures sink in political inaction.

The Court also ruled that the Kyoto Protocol's emission targets (1997-2020) remain legally relevant despite the Paris Agreement, empowering vulnerable nations with new tools for litigation. States may now seek compensation for pre-2020 harms, anchoring a 30-year continuum of responsibility - from Kyoto to Paris to the present.</p><p>The ICJ held that the duty to prevent environmental harm - first articulated in its Nuclear Weapons opinion - extends beyond direct cross-border damage to encompass global threats like climate change. This duty requires \"stringent\" due diligence and \"heightened vigilance\", tailored to each state's context and the scale of risk.

In his speech, Araghchi told leaders he had pushed for every member of the UN to condemn Israel strongly. He added Israel and the US should be held accountable for human rights violations. The Iranian foreign minister said the aftermath of the war \"will not be limited\" to one country. \"The entire region and beyond will be damaged,\" he added.</p><p>BRICS leaders also expressed \"grave concern\" for the humanitarian situation in Gaza, called for the release of all hostages, a return to the negotiating table and reaffirmed their commitment to the two-state solution.

In an address at the BRICS summit, PM Modi said India will work to redefine BRICS in a new form, which will be \"Building Resilience and Innovation for Cooperation and Sustainability'. Just as, during our chairmanship, we gave breadth to the G-20, gave priority to the issues of the Global South in the agenda, similarly, during our chairmanship of BRICS, we will take this forum forward in the spirit of people-centricity and humanity first,\" he said. PM Modi was speaking at a session on 'Environment, COP-30 and Global Health'. For India, climate justice is not an option, but a moral duty. India believes that without technology transfer and affordable financing to countries in need, climate action will remain confined to climate talks,\" he said. Modi argued that developed countries have a special and important responsibility in bridging the gap between climate ambition and financing. We have to take along all those countries which are facing food, fuel, fertilizer and financial crises due to various stresses. The confidence that developed countries have about the future, the same self-confidence should be there in these countries as well. With any kind of double standards, sustainable and inclusive development of humanity is not possible,\" he added."]}, {"relevance_score": 6, "title": "Climate justice victory at the ICJ - the student journey from USP lectures to The Hague", "published": "2025-07-30", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Vahefonua Tupola in Suva</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The University of the South Pacific (USP) is at the heart of a global legal victory with the International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivering a historic opinion last week affirming that states have binding legal obligations to protect the environment from human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The case, hailed as a triumph for climate justice, was driven by a student-led movement that began within USP's own regional classrooms.</p><p>In 2021, the government of Vanuatu took a bold step by announcing its intention to seek an advisory opinion from the ICJ on climate change.

Historically, this day has focused on legal rights, social equity, and political freedoms. However, in the contemporary world today, increasingly influenced by the effects of climate change, it is time to expand the meaning of justice to one of the most urgent and yet frequently neglected elements - climate justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The repercussions of climate change are no longer mere future threats. Catastrophic heatwaves, floods, droughts, forest fires, and intense storms and cyclones have become more frequent and destructive. These calamities result in loss and devastation, but they also reveal a more profound injustice: the unequal impact on different populations. The most impoverished and vulnerable - those who have contributed the least to global warming - are the ones who bear the brunt of these effects. Communities in developing nations, small island nations, indigenous groups, and marginalised populations are losing their homes, livelihoods, and even their lives. Furthermore, they often lack the necessary resources or systems to recover and adapt.</p><p>This is why climate justice matters. It is not just merely reducing carbon emissions or transitioning to renewable energy sources. It is fundamentally about equity. While climate change represents a global crisis, its burdens are not distributed evenly. Climate justice insists that those who have historically contributed the most to pollution must assume greater responsibility, while those who are most at risk should receive the necessary support to endure, rebuild, and flourish. It also emphasises that low-income communities and people of colour - both in developing and developed nations - are disproportionately affected by climate change, despite having played a minimal role in its causation.</p><p>Climate justice necessitates solutions that extend beyond mere environmental policies; it must address the social, economic, and racial disparities that render communities more vulnerable to climate shocks. This approach emphasises placing individuals at the core of climate initiatives, ensuring that no one is overlooked.</p><p>Acknowledging the significance and moral imperative of climate justice, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his speech at the BRICS Summit in Rio de Janeiro on July 7, 2025, firmly reiterated India's dedication to this cause. He proclaimed that for India, climate justice is no alternative but a moral duty. He emphasised that climate action should be driven by compassion, equity, and accountability. Drawing inspiration from India's ancient principles that honour nature as sacred, the Prime Minister reminded the global community that safeguarding the environment is integral to the nation's cultural and ethical identity. He underscored that India's approach to climate issues is centred on people and seeks to maintain a balance between advancement and conservation, growth and accountability.</p><p>The Prime Minister's remarks are particularly timely as the world gears up for COP-30, the international climate summit scheduled to take place later this year in Brazil. While agreements such as the Paris Climate Accord establish clear objectives, the reality is that numerous commitments remain unfulfilled, particularly regarding assistance for developing nations to adapt. A major shortcoming lies in climate finance. Wealthier nations had pledged to allocate $100 billion annually to aid developing countries. However, this promise has largely gone unfulfilled. For many nations, this represents not just a lack of funding - it signifies a deficit in justice. Without accessible financing, poorer countries are unable to develop clean energy infrastructures, invest in climate-resilient facilities, or recover from disasters. Fulfilling this commitment is not an act of benevolence - it is a responsibility.</p><p>Technology represents another vital element. Clean and green technologies - such as solar panels, energy-efficient appliances, and climate-resilient crops - are frequently costly and inaccessible for numerous countries that require them the most. Prime Minister Modi appropriately highlighted that access to these technologies must be equitable and inclusive. In the absence of this, the fight against climate change will remain one-sided and ineffective.</p><p>Another important aspect of climate change is the recognition of loss and damage. Certain climate impacts are irreversible - rising sea levels, lost homes, and ruined harvests constitute permanent losses. The establishment of a Loss and Damage Fund at the last climate summit was a positive development, yet genuine progress will necessitate making it fully functional and readily available to the nations and individuals who need it the most.</p><p>India, as a leading developing country, has undertaken bold and significant actions regarding climate initiatives, both domestically and internationally. The Mission LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) encourages sustainable practices in daily life - such as conserving electricity, minimising plastic consumption, and preserving water - empowering individuals to become advocates for climate action. Additionally, India has spearheaded the formation of global collaborations like the International Solar Alliance, which facilitates clean energy access in developing countries, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure, which assists nations in constructing infrastructure capable of withstanding natural disasters. Over the past decade, India has augmented its solar capacity by 4000 percent and has met its Paris climate commitments ahead of schedule. With a long-term objective of achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, India continues to demonstrate that responsible growth is achievable.</p><p>The Prime Minister also connected climate justice with public health, emphasising that \"viruses do not require passports\" and that global health systems should be inclusive and equitable. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that disparities in health infrastructure can exacerbate the effects of global crises. India's One Earth, One Health initiative, its digital health systems, and the Ayushman Bharat scheme - the largest health insurance programme in the world - provide examples of how to integrate environmental and health justice.</p><p>Looking ahead to 2026, when India will take on the presidency of BRICS, the Prime Minister reiterated that the voices and concerns of the Global South will remain paramount.

Historically, this day has focused on legal rights, social equity, and political freedoms. However, in the contemporary world today, increasingly influenced by the effects of climate change, it is time to expand the meaning of justice to one of the most urgent and yet frequently neglected elements - climate justice. The repercussions of climate change are no longer mere future threats. Catastrophic heatwaves, floods, droughts, forest fires, and intense storms and cyclones have become more frequent and destructive. These calamities result in loss and devastation, but they also reveal a more profound injustice: the unequal impact on different populations. The most impoverished and vulnerable - those who have contributed the least to global warming - are the ones who bear the brunt of these effects. Communities in developing nations, small island nations, indigenous groups, and marginalised populations are losing their homes, livelihoods, and even their lives.", "Catastrophic heatwaves, floods, droughts, forest fires, and intense storms and cyclones have become more frequent and destructive.

Communities in developing nations, small island nations, indigenous groups, and marginalised populations are losing their homes, livelihoods, and even their lives.

Climate justice insists that those who have historically contributed the most to pollution must assume greater responsibility, while those who are most at risk should receive the necessary support to endure, rebuild, and flourish.

Hailed globally as historic, a landmark, and a watershed, it recognised that continuing fossil consumption, production, and exploration was harmful and endorsed the view that states could seek action and reparation over climate damages.</p><p><br/><br/>The ICJ called on states to not only fulfil their obligations under the Paris Agreement but to apply stringent due diligence standards in formulating their national targets, which have to constitute the highest possible ambition, under the Nationally Determined Contributions. Importantly, it stated that the failure of the state to take appropriate action to protect the climate system from greenhouse gas emissions through continuing use of fossil fuels, granting of fossil fuel exploration licenses, or the provision of subsidies may constitute an internationally wrongful act which is liable to be compensated. Significantly, the advisory opinion said that climate harm can be addressed under customary laws as well as the UN human rights law,\u00a0the biodiversity and desertification conventions, and was not constrained by climate treaties alone, as argued by some of the chief polluting countries during the hearings at the ICJ.<br/><br/>The long-anticipated opinion came seven months after over 100 countries and organisations made oral and written presentations in a fortnight-long hearing in December 2024 at the Peace Palace. The campaign for this advisory opinion began six years\u00a0ago, in a classroom in Emalus, Vanuatu, and 29-year-old Vishal Prasad, campaign director at the Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change, said\u00a0young people dared to take on the impossible\u2014taking \u201cthe world\u2019s biggest problem to the world\u2019s highest court\u201d. This germ of an idea in a law university led to mobilising over 1,700 civil society organisations globally, led by Vanuatu and other Pacific Island nations, to demand climate justice and\u00a0present oral and written testimonies to the court.<br/><br/>In his testimony to the ICJ, Prasad,\u00a0who emerged as a global youth leader, narrated stories of devastation and loss to drive home the point of a grave imbalance among the countries that suffered devastation and those who perpetrated climate harm. Prasad told the Court about women in Tuvalu who recounted\u00a0harrowing experiences of graves being unearthed by coastal erosion, and of mothers who cried out to the moana [ocean] searching for their children.\u00a0He quoted Isabella Teuea from Kiribati, who said,\u00a0\u201cThe ocean, once a nurturing mother, has become a vengeful giant, swallowing the land it once cradled.

The presiding judge of the ICJ, Iwasawa Yuji, who read out the opinion, described climate change as a concern of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life. It was no longer possible to merely set targets for the sake of meeting obligations but to ensure that climate harm is mitigated, he said.<br/><br/>After the opinion, governments can no longer turn a blind eye to their legal responsibilities, said Prasad. Apart from the world\u2019s smallest countries making history, he said: \u201cThe opinion affirms a simple truth of climate justice: those who did the least to fuel this crisis deserve protection, reparations, and a future. This ruling is a lifeline for Pacific communities on the frontline.\u201d<br/><br/>Countries of the South Pacific that contribute minuscule amounts of greenhouse gas emissions are battered by storms and cyclones, which wreck lives and livelihoods, as Prasad testified. The government of Vanuatu said that despite emitting less than 0.02 per cent of total greenhouse gas emissions, the Pacific islands face the brunt of the impact of rising sea levels. Their average elevation above the waves is between 1 and 2 metres, and 90 per cent of the islands\u2019 population lives within 5 km of the coastline. Vanuatu is projected to lose 25 per cent of its GDP every year due to climate disasters.<br/><br/>The Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), which engaged in the ICJ process through\u00a0legal submissions and by providing various inputs, applauded the court\u2019s historic affirmation, which declares the era of fossil fuel impunity over and sets a new global standard for urgent action and accountability on climate justice.\u00a0Importantly, CIEL noted that the Court defined what justice means in the face of climate breakdown while ruling that countries must act with urgency, cooperate in good faith, and repair the damage already done. In doing so, the Court has set the stage for accountability and real action worldwide.<br/><br/>While the advisory opinion is not binding, it constitutes authoritative statements of binding international law and carries substantial legal weight. This opinion will guide climate litigation at the local, regional, and national courts, and provide a foundation for climate policymaking, grounding local legislation and global negotiations in legal obligation, CIEL pointed out. Rebecca Brown,\u00a0CIEL\u00a0president and CEO, said the ruling represents a groundbreaking legal decision in reaffirming the role of international law and global governance in demanding climate justice.<br/><br/>The case before the ICJ must rank among the biggest in human history, with 96 states and 11 intergovernmental organisations making presentations. These proceedings were held in the wake of the failure of the climate summit at Baku to advance the cause of climate justice with poor commitments on finance or any serious ambitions to reduce the use of fossil fuels. The hope that the annual UN climate summit would deliver any concrete plan with financial backing and ambition has faded over the years, and Ralph Regenvanu, Vanuatu\u2019s climate envoy, was not optimistic about any positive outcomes from that quarter. For him, the ICJ advisory opinion was on unexpected lines as it identified those committing climate harm as offenders who can be legally prosecuted and took a position on the continuing use, exploration, and production of fossil fuels.<br/><br/>The global campaign for climate justice led to the United Nations requesting the ICJ\u2019s advisory opinion on two key questions in 2023, namely, \u201cWhat are the obligations of States under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generations; (b) What are the legal consequences under these obligations for States where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to: (i) States, including, in particular, small island developing States, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change? (ii) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change?\u201d1<br/><br/>Also Read | Frontline Explains: India\u2019s climate emergency<br/><br/>Twenty days before the ICJ opinion, on July 3, 2025, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued a significant advisory opinion affirming that\u00a0states and corporations have binding legal obligations to address the climate crisis as a human rights emergency, according to CIEL. This advisory opinion was requested by the governments of Chile and Colombia, which also declared the climate crisis a human rights emergency, threatening life, dignity, and democracy itself, and dwelt on the responsibility of states to prevent irreversible environmental harm. It blamed the continuing use of fossil fuels and called on states to regulate its use.<br/><br/>According to the Vanuatu Climate Diplomacy Program, the ICJ is one of three international tribunals that were asked to issue guidance on states\u2019 legal obligations to address climate change. In May 2024, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea delivered the first-ever\u00a0advisory opinion on climate from an international court, which stated that countries must cut greenhouse gas emissions to protect the oceans.2\u00a0All these opinions set the bar for future court judgments and policy decisions on climate action. It remains to be seen how the climate negotiations are impacted by these significant advisory opinions and whether the historically polluting countries are prompted to reduce or more importantly pay for \u00a0their climate damage.<br/><br/>Meena Menon is a freelance journalist and visiting postdoctoral fellow at Leeds Arts and Humanities Research Institute, University of Leeds.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Frontline", "instances": ["The ICJ called on states to not only fulfil their obligations under the Paris Agreement but to apply stringent due diligence standards in formulating their national targets, which have to constitute the highest possible ambition, under the Nationally Determined Contributions.

The legal questions posed before the ICJ reflect the collective anxiety of a planet grappling with existential threats posed by climate change. For major maritime nations like India, and other developing nations including the low-lying island-states, this moment is critical in shaping a survival strategy. Furthermore, delivering a futuristic legal judgment that will re-define the future of international climate governance on today\u2019s commitment. Key questions before the ICJ include:</p><p><br/><br/>What are states\u2019\u00a0obligations under international law to protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions for present and future generations?<br/><br/>What are the legal\u00a0consequences for states that have significantly harmed the climate system, particularly affecting the small island developing states? Over 90 states and organisations participated in the proceedings submitting written statements. India clearly emphasised its commitment towards climate action while asserting its sovereign right to development and the need for continued fossil fuel subsidies for ensuring energy security and sustainability (ICJ AOP India, 2024).<br/><br/>A similar advisory opinion on climate change delivered by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) (Case No. 31) emphasises the importance of robust emissions reduction policies, environmental impact assessments, and international cooperation. However, it did not address state\u2019s responsibility for climate change impacts (ITLOS AO, 2024).<br/><br/>For small island developing states, these advisory opinions are important for their development and survival. Facing existential threats from rising sea levels, they seek legal recognition of the disproportionate harm they suffer.<br/><br/>The ITLOS and ICJ\u2019s opinion will influence future climate litigation and policy. Though non-binding, they will shape the discourse on global climate governance, setting precedents for international cooperation, accountability, and respect for sovereign rights.

With the visionary announcement by Union Home and Cooperation Minister Amit Shah to institutionalise three new Multistate Cooperative Societies for cow dung management, carbon credit valuation and compressed biogas (CBG) production within the cooperative framework, India has moved beyond mere climate rhetoric. We are entering an era of grassroots-led green revolution, and this time, it is not about food alone, it is about energy, ecology, and equity.</p><p>This bold shift isn't just administrative, it is civilisational. It marks a new model for climate governance rooted in the soil of Bharat, powered by its villages, and held together by the time-tested values of Sahuarita (cooperation). For decades, the climate debate was dominated by distant capitals, high-level negotiations, and top-down frameworks. But India has flipped the script. Through the Cooperative Economic Framework, we are building a decentralised climate economy from the ground up, starting from Primary Agricultural Co-op Societies (PACS) and scaling to national-level apex cooperative institutions. This isn't just a new economic model, it is a new democratic environmentalism, where the farmer becomes the financier of a greener future, and the village becomes the vanguard of net-zero ambition.</p><p>Every PACS has a potential climate command centre. These grassroots institutions, long associated, are now being repositioned as gateways to carbon markets and bio-energy hubs.</p><p>Imagine decentralised biogas sprouting in every block, feeding clean energy into the rural economy, generating carbon credits that can be monetised globally, and creating a new stream of income for farmers, especially in rain-fed, tribal, and hilly regions. From the cow shed to the carbon exchange, the entire value chain can now be organised, monitored, and scaled through the cooperative economic framework.</p><p>Integral to this transformation is the restructuring of rural resource cycles, especially around fodder management, water governance, and dead cattle economics. Millions of farmers struggle due to erratic fodder availability and mismanaged water resources, which in turn affect livestock productivity and rural resilience. Simultaneously, dead cattle markets, often a source of environmental decay and social tension, remain underutilised economic zones. By creating a multistate cooperative dedicated to integrated livestock resource management, India can formalise and monetise these neglected rural streams. Fodder banks, decentralised water recharge systems, and organised carcass processing units can provide dignified employment, biofertilizers, organic leather, and feedstock for CBG plants. Such a cooperative would not only uplift rural livelihoods but create a closed-loop bio-economy - fueling agriculture, improving nutrition, restoring ecology, and generating revenue across multiple layers of rural society. It is not merely a reform - it is a rural renaissance waiting to be unlocked.</p><p>And the beauty of this approach lies in its inclusivity. The PACS-to-Apex structure ensures that no region is left behind - not the snowbound villages of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, not the fragile communities of the Northeast, and certainly not the border settlements of Ladakh or Arunachal. In these places, traditional economic activities are constrained by geography, but the bioeconomy of cow dung and carbon offers a rare opportunity - one that aligns with the region's cultural values, ecological needs, and national priorities. When farmers in these areas gain the ability to generate income from climate stewardship, they are not just contributing to GDP - they are also strengthening national security. A prosperous border village is a stable border village. When livelihoods are secure, migration is reduced, local pride is restored, and external threats are diminished. The World Cooperation Economic Framework offers the architecture to take this model to scale. It ensures that financing, training, policy guidance, and market access do not remain siloed. It connects the micro to the macro. It allows the smallest PACS in a tribal hamlet to link with global climate finance and ESG funds. It transforms cow dung - a symbol of rural India's ignored potential - into a goldmine for clean energy, carbon credits, organic farming, and rural employment. Through this, India isn't just creating a circular economy - it is building a circular civilisation.</p><p>This is more than a Government scheme - it is a spiritual call to action. A call to revive our ancient ethos of living in harmony with nature now rearmed with modern science, blockchain traceability, and global carbon accounting. It is a call to stand tall on the world stage - not as climate victims begging for compensation, but as climate victors offering solutions. This is our surgical strike - not through bullets, but through biogas, not with missiles, but with methane management, not by harming - but by healing the Earth through cooperation.</p><p>We are witnessing a new economic independence movement - this time against carbon dependency and global climate injustice. As the world watches, India rises. And it rises not from the skyscrapers, but from its soil, its villages, and its unyielding cooperative spirit.From Sahkarita se Samriddhi to Sahkarita se Sanrakshan, the cooperative model is no longer just about managing credit - it is now India's frontline defence in the fight for global climate equity and national unity.</p><p>Let the world take note \"When Bharat's villages rise, the Earth heals - and the Nation stands stronger\". Let us remember that this journey is not just economic or environmental; it is deeply spiritual. This is the Vedic economics meeting of 21st-century governance. This is Yajna - a collective</p><p>sacrifice and contribution, where every farmer, every cow, every drop of water, and every seed of cooperation becomes part of a sacred offering to protect the Earth and uplift the Nation.</p><p>Let the world understand this clearly, India's climate action is not born of compulsion, but of conviction rooted in consciousness. And as Bharat's villages rise once again in the light of Sahkarita, the prayers of our ancestor's echo in unison,May all be happy, may all be healthy, may all see auspiciousness, and may none suffer.\" This is the dharma of cooperation. This is the soul of India rising.</p><p>(The writer is the Secretary General, Confederation of NGOs of Rural India.

It\u2019s time for rich nations to pay their climate debt and support a just transition powered by Africa\u2019s renewable energy potential. \u201dDescribing the ICJ\u2019s historic advisory opinion a watershed moment in the fight for climate justice, New Delhi-based climate activist and founding director of Satat Sampada Climate Foundation, Harjeet Singh, told IANS: \u201cIt\u2019s a resounding declaration that the era of impunity for polluters and complicit states is over. This landmark decision unequivocally imposes robust obligations on states to compel fossil fuel producers to drastic and immediate action, holding them categorically responsible for the damage they've unleashed. This mandates a fundamental shift, where states must rigorously regulate, constrain, and ultimately dismantle the fossil fuel industry's capacity to inflict further harm. \u201dHe said the court's findings pave the way for full reparations, meaning polluters must not only cease their harmful actions but also provide financial compensation for losses and damages incurred. This includes compensation for climate harm and, critically, an immediate cessation of greenhouse gas emissions above science-based safety thresholds. The ICJ was established by the United Nations Charter in June 1945 and began its activities in April 1946.", "Courts worldwide are likely to reference this ruling in their upcoming decisions. It will also strengthen legal arguments in ongoing and future climate lawsuits, especially those targeting corporate defendants like fossil fuel companies. The ruling clarifies that international law requires more than voluntary action, including obligations for historical polluters to reduce emissions and provide compensation to climate-affected communities. It also reaffirms the primacy of climate science, offering an opportunity to reinvigorate global climate talks with legal clarity on rights and responsibilities. The groundbreaking campaign for an advisory opinion was conceived in 2019 by law students from the University of the South Pacific. Working with the government of Vanuatu, Pacific Island Students Fighting Climate Change (PISFCC) and World\u2019s Youth for Climate Justice (WYCJ) helped secure a unanimous vote at the United Nations to request the opinion, with support from more than 1,500 organisations. --IANSvg/pgh"]}, {"relevance_score": 13, "title": "Brazil: AGU Participates in International Seminar Preparing for COP30", "published": "2025-06-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The Attorney General's Office of the Union (AGU) participated in an international seminar preparing for the COP30 climate conference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The seminar focused on climate justice, human rights protection, and the role of public defenders in South America.</p><p>* The National Prosecutor's Office for Climate and Environmental Defense (Pronaclima) was created by the AGU in January 2023 to promote climate and environmental matters.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>June 13 -- Attorney General's Office, Government of Brazil issued the following news release:</p><p>The chief prosecutor of the National Climate and Environment Defense Office (Pronaclima) at the Attorney General's Office (AGU), Mariana Cirne, spoke at the closing session of the event, focusing on environmental licensing as a tool for climate justice. \"The Attorney General's Office is working towards a climate transformation of the Federal Executive Power, and it relies on the indispensable partnership of public defenders,\" Cirne emphasized. \"We need to join forces so that instruments like environmental licensing can effectively implement climate justice.</p><p>Spaces like this congress show that we have common objectives to be achieved,\" she highlighted.

They are also grounded in global agreements to protect specific parts of the environment (like the Ozone Convention, Biodiversity Convention, Desertification Convention, and the United Nations law of the sea).</p><p>The advisory opinion said governments must take appropriate measures to prevent environmental harm.

Born Jorge Mario Bergardo, he chose his papal name in honour of Saint Francis of Assisi, known for his humility, simplicity and dedication to rebuilding the Catholic Church.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unique leadership style</p><p>From the outset, Pope Francis embodied the qualities of great religious leaders, including Saint Peter and Saint Paul. His humility and sense of humour were evident when he told the cardinals who elected him, \"May God forgive you for what you have done\".</p><p>Breaking with tradition, Francis opted for a simple white cassock and cross instead of formal papal attire. He also chose to ride a bus with the cardinals and pay his hotel bill, setting a tone for a more humble and servant-like papacy.</p><p>Fresh perspective</p><p>As the first Jesuit Pope, the first from the Americas and the first from the southern hemisphere, Pope Francis brought a distinct perspective to the role. He was a vocal advocate for social justice, particularly regarding poverty, inequality and environmental degradation. His commitment to interfaith dialogue promoted greater understanding and cooperation between different religions.</p><p>Advocacy &amp; reform</p><p>Pope Francis was a strong critic of economic injustice, speaking out against the exploitation of the poor and the environment. He highlighted the way the poor were treated in the world, the way the planet was exploited and the way the poor bore the main cost of the ecological crisis.</p><p>In 2019, he travelled to the United Arab Emirates, where he presided over a historic Mass on the Arabian Peninsula and addressed pressing global issues, including migration and climate change.</p><p>He reignited his influence as a global environmental leader with the release of his impassioned 94-page Apostolic Exhortation Querida Amazonia (Dear Amazon) on February 2, 2020. This document addressed the fate of the Amazon biome and its indigenous people, who faced deforestation, illegal logging, mining, ranching and agribusiness in Peru, Bolivia, Colombia and Brazil.</p><p>Despite facing criticism and controversy, particularly regarding his handling of clergy sexual abuse cases and his Apostolic Exhortation Amoris Laetitia, Pope Francis remained committed to reform and renewal within the Church.</p><p>Vision for the Church</p><p>Pope Francis marked 12 years of his Petrine ministry on March 13, 2025. During his papacy, a deeper understanding and appreciation of his leadership and his place in the larger context of contemporary Catholicism came into view. There was a widespread recognition that he had revived the vision of Vatican II for the Catholic Church. Consequently, his leadership was attentive to contemporary concerns of the Church and the world, such as migration, refugees, economy of exclusion, climate change, and marriage and family.</p><p>Dialogue, inclusivity</p><p>Pope Francis saw the importance of dialogue with religions, Churches, science and society for the common good. He encouraged pastoral care for L.G.B.T. individuals and was willing to discuss matters of women's leadership in the Church and married clergy. He dreamed of a synodal model of collegial leadership in the Church, giving due space to local Churches across the globe and working together through the challenges of the modern world, along with other faiths and ideologies, for the advancement of humanity.</p><p>Lasting legacy</p><p>Pope Francis's first apostolic exhortation, Evangelii Gaudium (The Joy of the Gospel), provided insight into the priorities of his pontificate. Through the powerful and stimulating messages of LaudatoS (Praise Be) and Amoris Laetitia (The Joy of Love), Pope Francis connected with a humanity that hungered and thirsted for a message of hope, compassion and consolation. His leadership, his commitment to reform, renewal and social justice remained unwavering, leaving a lasting legacy that extended far beyond the Catholic Church.</p>", "publisher": "The Telegraph (India)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 26, "title": "Austria : Charity soup dinner in Eisenstadt under the banner of climate justice and responsibility for creation", "published": "2025-03-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">LR Schneemann: We must become more and more aware that this planet is only available to us once.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, Friday, participants at the charity soup dinner in Eisenstadt's town hall, hosted by the Catholic Women's Movement and Mayor Thomas Steiner, were able to eat together, engage in conversation, and support aid projects for women in Colombia with a donation.

Sapan recently organised an online discussion event \u2018Beyond COP 29: Southasia\u2019s climate challenges \u2013 a call for Southasian solidarity\u2019, which unanimously endorsed a resolution in solidarity with the people of the region seeking relief and justice from the adverse impacts of climate change. Sapan passed a resolution calling for the $300 billion per year falls short of $1.3 trillion needed, shared solutions for floods, heatwaves and polluters must honour commitments to support Southasia\u2019 transition to clean energy. </p><p> The Resolution noted that Southasia, home to a quarter of the globe\u2019s population, faces disproportionate climate shocks, including rising sea levels, devastating floods, heatwaves, and droughts. Despite being one of the most vulnerable regions, Southasia bears an inequitable share of the costs of climate mitigation and adaptation. Sapan called on historical emitters to fulfil their equity-based commitments for emissions cuts and provide adequate financing for vulnerable regions like Southasia, declared the resolution. The 29th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, or COP, agreed in November to deliver at least $300 billion per year by 2035 to developing and vulnerable countries, a climate financing target that is three times more than the $100 billion-per-year goal countries first set 15 years ago, but far less than the $1.3 trillion per year that the vulnerable countries have sought. Sapan also urged regional stakeholders to adopt a collaborative transboundary approach to address shared challenges like air and water pollution, ensuring climate justice through collective action, says the resolution, urging regional stakeholders to embrace collaborative solutions for issues like air and water pollution, floods, and heatwaves. To this region climate change is not only a future threat, the devastating impacts to lives, livestock, infrastructure, economy, and habitat are in keeping with the triple planetary crisis.  The developing and underdeveloped countries of the region are disproportionately burdened with the cost of dealing with these impacts. Given the environmental and financial challenges faced by South Asia, Sapan calls upon the polluters, the historical emitters and perpetrators of climate change, to make good on their emissions cut commitments, based on equity and fair shares.  Experts have shown that this goal can be met without requiring any significant additional budgetary allocation from developed nations, beyond their already pledged increases. Sapan calls upon governments to negotiate an equitable access to finances and technology to transition from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives.  Since climate change knows no borders, shared solutions to shared problems will have to be worked out by taking a regional cooperative, collaborative approach. This includes issues related to climate change, like floods and heatwaves, as well as environmental pollution in the water bodies and air pollution. Sapan called on the governments and people of the region to work towards soft borders, engage in economic cooperation, knowledge and technical skills sharing and collaboration on all issues including climate change.

Historically, the majority of carbon emissions have come from developed countries, but the consequences disproportionately affect developing nations. A 2021 study by Oxfam revealed that the wealthiest 10% of the global population are responsible for over 50% of emissions, while the poorest 50% contribute less than 10%.

This means ensuring that developed nations live up to their financial commitments, including the $100 billion per year in climate finance that was promised under the Paris Agreement. In 2023, reports indicated that this target had still not been fully met. The Global South must push for clear pathways to secure this finance, including mechanisms to ensure transparency and accountability in climate finance flows.</p><p>Enhance climate diplomacy through regional blocs: The power of collective action through regional blocs like the African Union, the Caribbean Community, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation is critical.</p><p>At COP29, the Global South should use these platforms to negotiate the following with a united voice, which will amplify their bargaining power:</p><p>Shared climate adaptation plans such as creating cross-border systems for early warning and disaster response.</p><p>Common positions on climate finance to ensure that the funds are accessible and address regional priorities.</p><p>Joint advocacy for loss and damage, building on the landmark decision made at COP27 to establish a fund for vulnerable countries. This must have clear governance structures and funding streams.</p><p>Strengthen nationally determined contributions (NDCs) with local adaptation: A key commitment under the Paris Agreement is the submission of NDCs, which are national plans outlining climate actions. The Global South must ensure that their NDCs are ambitious and grounded in sustainable local realities. For instance, several African nations have committed to increasing their renewable energy capacities, with Kenya and Ethiopia leading the way in wind, solar, and geothermal energy production. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency, Kenya generated over 90% of its electricity from renewable sources in 2022.</p><p>In the Global South, sustainable agriculture and water management are other critical areas for adaptation. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization highlights that climate-resilient agriculture could improve yields by up to 30% by 2030, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. Include these data-driven adaptations in their NDCs, backed by clear funding mechanisms.</p><p>Leverage green finance and investment: Accessing finance for climate mitigation and adaptation is a big challenge for Global South. The developed world has not met its promised climate finance targets, and much of the money that has been pledged remains inaccessible due to bureaucratic hurdles. The Global South should look towards diversifying its sources of finance by tapping into green bonds, carbon markets, and private investment in renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>South Africa's Just Energy Transition Investment Plan, supported by a multi-billion-dollar international investment, aims to transition the country away from coal to renewable energy. Such a plan could be a model for others in the Global South. According to the World Bank, the global market for green bonds exceeded $1 trillion in 2023, signalling a growing appetite for climate-friendly investments. Explore mechanisms to attract this type of capital to finance projects like clean energy, climate-resilient infrastructure, and sustainable agriculture.</p><p>Harness technology: Technology transfer is a critical issue, particularly when it comes to renewable energy and early warning systems for natural disasters. Developed countries must honour their commitments under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's Technology Mechanism to support developing nations in acquiring clean technologies. However, the Global South should also take proactive steps to harness indigenous technologies and knowledge systems that have proven effective in addressing climate challenges. For example, water harvesting techniques that have been used for centuries in arid regions like Rajasthan and the Sahel in Africa can be scaled up.</p><p>The Global South must take advantage of the digital revolution to better monitor climate risks and manage resources. Satellite technology, mobile applications for farmers, and artificial intelligence-driven climate models are all critical tools. Governments should invest in technological infrastructure that facilitates climate adaptation.</p><p>Promote South-South cooperation: While global North-South cooperation remains essential, developing nations should also deepen South-South cooperation. These partnerships have the potential to be transformative, enabling shared expertise, technologies, and financial resources.

The majority of people surveyed were supportive of climate justice-related beliefs including the notions that poorer people suffer worse impacts from climate change (78% agreement), people from worst-affected communities should have more of a say in decisions concerning climate change (78%), and that capitalism and colonialism are underpinning elements of the climate crisis (70%). Endorsement of these climate justice-related beliefs was also positively associated with engagement in climate actions and support for just climate policies. Climate justice broadly encompasses recognition that (1) climate change impacts are unequally felt across society; (2) the worst affected groups often have the least say in the selection and implementation of societal responses to climate change, and (3) climate change-related policymaking processes often fail to recognise the legitimate interests of politically voiceless communities, consequently contributing to further disenfranchisement of marginalised groups. It is a framework that enables those involved in policymaking to identify and tackle the multiple different ways in which the climate crisis intersects with longstanding patterns of social injustice.

Then I got exposed to the potential of climate change aggravating many of the environmental issues prevalent on northeast India.</p><p>The documentary \"An Inconvenient Truth\" was my eye-opener as it answered a lot of questions that had lingered in my mind since childhood. It opened my eyes to the fact that our region was one of the early climate-change impacted regions of the world.</p><p>I wanted to do something about it, but I had limited options with my different educational background. Travelling to Antarctica in 2013 was life changing in many ways. Besides first-hand experience of warming impacts on the fragile ecosystems of the remote continent, I learnt more about the consequences of polar melting on the planet. Just a few months later, I was trained as a Climate Reality Leader at Istanbul by former US Vice President Al Gore, the man who won the Nobel Prize for \"An Inconvenient Truth.\"</p><p>Attending the UN climate negotiations and other international events has been an eye opener for me. I was shocked that the indigenous people populated Eastern Himalayan did not have representatives in these forums, despite being one of the early impacted and most vulnerable regions, confirmed by several studies in the past decade. This is not right, and we need to ensure that the negotiations address the needs and concerns of the people of our region. We must have access to the adaptation and loss and damage funds, having had to sacrifice our development aspirations for decades.</p><p>At the same time, I realized that the global realization that the traditional wisdom and knowledge systems of indigenous people presents a great opportunity to mainstream the age-old indigenous way of life, and motivate the youth to embrace and preserve these traditions which always prioritized sustainable coexistence with nature. The Indigenous People's Climate Justice Forum aims to ensure that the global community recognizes the challenges and delivers climate justice to the people of the Eastern Himalayas.</p><p>How, when and why did you become a climate activist?</p><p>On the 2nd of March, 2013, citizens of 15 Pacific Islands nations urged the world community to take action before it is too late for them; these countries face complete annihilation by rising sea levels. The 350.org organized Pacific Warrior Day of Action had asked for solidarity from the global community in support of their theme - \"We are not drowning. We are fighting against climate change. Will you stand with us?\"</p><p>I was in Antarctica on a climate change expedition at that time. I am proud to have had the opportunity to hold up a solidarity banner and stand with the people of Fiji, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, Solomon Is, Vanuatu, Tokelau, Niue, Cook Is, Federated States of Micronesia, Marshall Islands, Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu, and Kiribati as the only activist from the entire continent.</p><p>Three months later, in June, I went to get trained as a Climate Reality Leader in Istanbul. The city was in turmoil over the decision to hack down trees in Gezi Park for a new development project, and things got out of hand during the training with violent attempts to suppress the protests. Over the next few days, I was caught in the whirlpool of police and public action amidst escalating tensions. To cut a long story short, a group of us from the training were hounded into a shelter as riots erupted all around us. I learnt my lesson the hard way- to fight for environmental rights was never going to be easy. I graduated as a Climate Reality Leader in the same week that I discovered that there was an effective antidote for tear gas burn. But that's a story for another day.</p><p>Tell us about your polar expeditions and how did they shape your journey as an activist?</p><p>I was a member of the International Antarctic Expedition 2013 led by Robert Swan, the first man to have walked to both the poles. We were on a mission to gain firsthand experience of climate change impacts on the fragile Antarctic ecosystems.</p><p>I will never forget the moments from the 9th of March, when we were summoned to the top deck at 7 AM for the Iceberg Ceremony at Antarctic Sound. We saw us the large tabular icebergs that had floated north from the collapsed Larsen B ice shelf 11 years earlier.</p><p>I still remember what Robert Swan said and I quote him- \"Back in 2002, most people did not believe in climate change. When it started to collapse, scientists said it will take a long time to collapse, but after the cracks were first noticed, it went very fast and collapsed in less than 4 weeks. Now, you have seen climate change impacts already happening here, you must help spread the word and ensure the world leaders take decisive action before it is too late.\"</p><p>Another highlight was the visit to the 'E-Base' on King George Island, which runs entirely on renewable energy. It is also the only private base on Antarctica set up by Robert Swan several years earlier.</p><p>In 2015, I spent two weeks at the Churchill Northern Studies Centre in the Canadian Arctic. It opened my eyes to the cascading consequences of warming on the ecosystems of the arctic, observe the unfolding impacts on biodiversity ranging from polar bears to fishes, birds and amphibians, permafrost melting and the struggles of the human communities.</p><p>Four years later, I was thrilled when Robert Swan himself invited me to be a part of the Climate Force Arctic Expedition in 2019. The expedition team comprising of 86 scientists, naturalists, corporate leaders, writers, filmmakers, civil society leaders and other experts from 27 countries.</p><p>I was also invited to deliver an audio-visual presentation about the proposed Marine Arctic Peace Sanctuary for all marine areas north of the Arctic Circle. I also talked about the impending water crisis in the northeastern region and the vulnerabilities and resilience of the Eastern Himalayas.</p><p>We flew to Longyearbyen, the world's northernmost town, which is located at only 800 miles from the North Pole. We visited the Svalbard Global Seed Vault, which was designed as an impregnable deep-freeze to protect the world's most precious seeds from any global disaster, is located at Longyearbyen. However, in the summer of 2017, meltwater permeated the seemingly invincible structure, and it was closed for repairs during our visit.</p><p>It was disconcerting to learn that parts of Svalbard, including Longyearbyen had warmed by over 5 degrees Celsius in the past 20 years, threatening the lifestyles of the people and biodiversity of the region. We learnt about the changing dynamics of predator and prey interactions in the warming arctic ecosystems from wildlife biologists with decades of ongoing research in the polar regions. Animals like the seals, walrus and polar bears were facing survival threats because of the loss of sea ice.</p><p>The National Geographic Explorer expedition ship that took us further north. After several days exploring the remote islands of the high Arctic, our route was blocked by an endless expanse of sea ice at 820 North. The loss of sea ice has implications for global weather and is vital for the survival of animals like seals and polar bears. Our ship turned back without disturbing the sea ice, even though it is an ice-strengthened vessel capable of breaking through sea ice.</p><p>My third Arctic expedition was by public transport across Lapland, engaging with activists and indigenous communities in the four countries of the region.</p><p>What do you think are the biggest environmental threat for Assam in particular and North East India?</p><p>The Eastern Himalayan region is one of the biologically richest areas on Earth, with an abundance of endemic and rare species inhabiting the diverse landscapes. This region is also home to many indigenous communities with unique cultures and traditions that are steeped in nature. We celebrate our biological diversity in art and music. Although blessed with natural largesse, our region is vulnerable to natural disasters and sits on the cusp of an impending climate and ecological crisis.</p><p>Across the region, the loss of forest cover, invasive vegetation and disappearance of native biodiversity have emerged as direct threats to the food security of millions. The impact of climate change on native biodiversity used as food and medicine by indigenous communities is an unknown but an expected consequence. Despite these impacts, the region is unrepresented in the global discussions about climate justice.</p><p>The lives, livelihoods and food security of the Lepchas, Bodos, Nyishis, Nagas, Meiteis, Ahoms, and other indigenous people and local communities across the Eastern Himalayan region are being undermined by the unfolding climate and biodiversity crises.

The SMILY Academy will help young entrepreneurs to incorporate traditional knowledge systems in their businesses.

How can they ensure a greener and better planet for the future?</p><p>Humanity is indebted to young people for their leadership of the movements for social justice and the modern environment movement is perhaps the best example of the power of the youth. From Denis Hayes to Severn Cullis Suzuki, Felix Finkbeiner to Greta Thunberg, every generation has produced inspirational young leaders who shaped the modern environmental movement. India has produced an impressive list of young changemakers and climate activists including Ridhima Pandey and Vinisha Umashankar and I call upon the youth readers to find their own local environmental heroes, or better still, be one yourself!</p><p>Last year the United Nations General Assembly recently adopted the ambitious Pact for the Future during the Summit of the Future in New York. One of the five focus areas is youth and future generations. The pact for the Future included the first ever Declaration on Future Generations, with concrete steps to take account of future generations in our decision-making, including a possible envoy for future generations. It is a commitment to more meaningful opportunities for young people to participate in the decisions that shape their lives, especially at the global level.</p><p>There has never been a better time for young people to take charge.

They won the world a tremendous victory today.  This ruling elevates national climate commitments everywhere by confirming that countries must reduce emissions enough to protect the universal rights to life, food, health and a clean environment. All countries, particularly rich ones, now have to cut their emissions faster and phase out fossil fuels. Rich countries have to increase their financing to Global South countries to help them reduce emissions and protect their people from past and future harm. This is not a wish-list - it is international law.  We now have a powerful tool for holding countries to account for their obligations, especially in protecting the world's most marginalised people and future generations of humanity.

During the court's deliberations, Australia sided with other fossil fuel exporters and major emitters - including Saudi Arabia, the United States and China - to argue state obligations on climate change are restricted to those set out in climate-specific treaties such as the Paris Agreement.</p><p>But the court disagreed.

Under the Paris rules, countries must set targets to cut domestic emissions, but they are not required to report emissions created when their fossil fuel exports are burned overseas.</p><p>Donaghue and the Australian delegation also suggested responsibility for harms caused by climate change could not be pinned on individual states.

Held at Auckland University, around 200 young people aged between 14 and 30 (more than half under 18) have registered to attend the simulation of the UN's annual climate meeting, to be held later this year in Belm, Brazil.  The event - supported by Save the Children, Youth Climate Collective and Nga Ara Whetu (Centre for Climate, Biodiversity and Society) - builds on last year's first-ever COP simulation event, with interactive workshops, climate policy negotiations and debates on some of the most pressing issues facing youth today. The event will also include a panel discussion and talk from British High Commission's Lead Climate Change Advisor Rick Zwaan.  Participants will take on roles representing different groups, from journalists to policy makers, indigenous communities to NGOs. Working in teams, they will create, debate and negotiate agreements, like real global leaders, with each session designed to build leadership, negotiation, systems thinking and collaboration skills in a supportive and action-focused environment.  At the end of the day, the insights and policies developed will be collated into an Aotearoa Youth Climate Statement,which will be delivered to the New Zealand Government and presented at COP30 in Brazil by a delegation of young leaders.
