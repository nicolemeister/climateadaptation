The verifying agencies will assess the details and submit a report on the quantity of timber that can be potentially harvested. Central government issues regulatory framework for promoting agroforestryFor up to 10 trees, the applicant will have to upload photos of the trees on the portal which would compute the circumference and girth of the tree. The photos will be use to identify the species and estimate potential yield. Post felling, the applicant will be required to upload photos of the stumps on the NTMS portal. The verifying agency, upon issuance of the verification report, shall generate a felling permit for agricultural lands with more than 10 trees, in a prescribed format,\" the notification said, adding that a No Objection Certificate for felling of trees shall be issued to the applicant automatically through the portal for agricultural land with less than 10 trees.

longer just wood-it's a test of governance. This week, the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal, became the nexus of a new chapter in Indo-UK cooperation as it hosted a high-level knowledge exchange on forest standards, certification, and product traceability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Supported by India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and the UK Government under the UK PACT (Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions) initiative, the workshop marks a critical pivot toward formalising India's forest and agroforestry economy within globally recognised sustainability frameworks. For a sector long shaped by informal trade and invisible ecosystems, this gathering represents both a structural and strategic inflection point.</p><p>The Politics of Proof</p><p>Forests occupy a uniquely complex policy space-simultaneously acting as climate buffers, biodiversity repositories, and critical sources of rural livelihoods. Yet forest-derived products-from timber to non-timber forest produce-continue to struggle with fragmented traceability, informal trade channels, and inconsistent compliance with international sustainability standards.</p><p>The introduction of the Indian Forest and Wood Certification Scheme (IFWCS)-PRAMAAN in December 2023, as outlined by IIFM Director Dr. K. Ravichandran during the workshop, signals India's first institutional effort to address that asymmetry. PRAMAAN is not just a national certification initiative; its underlying ambition is global. It seeks mutual recognition across jurisdictions-enabling Indian-certified wood and agroforestry products to enter high-regulation markets like the EU and UK.

This week, the Indian Institute of Forest Management (IIFM), Bhopal, became the nexus of a new chapter in Indo-UK cooperation as it hosted a high-level knowledge exchange on forest standards, certification, and product traceability. Supported by India's Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and the UK Government under the UK PACT (Partnering for Accelerated Climate Transitions) initiative, the workshop marks a critical pivot toward formalising India's forest and agroforestry economy within globally recognised sustainability frameworks. For a sector long shaped by informal trade and invisible ecosystems, this gathering represents both a structural and strategic inflection point. The Politics of ProofForests occupy a uniquely complex policy space-simultaneously acting as climate buffers, biodiversity repositories, and critical sources of rural livelihoods.

The rules are designed to support ease of doing business for those involved in tree-based farming. By promoting domestic timber production through agroforestry, the approach seeks to close the demand-supply gap, support wood-based industries with locally sourced raw materials, and boost exports. The model rules aim to establish a streamlined regulatory framework by providing simplified procedures for registering agroforestry lands and managing tree harvesting and transit.

These activities will be monitored until 2055, with ofi's carbon footprinting experts estimating they can cut carbon emissions by 1.5 million tons of CO2 over the next 30 years.</p><p>The project aims to cultivate more than 72,000 hectares of agroforestry, as part of a transition to regenerative agriculture. This includes planting an estimated 2.8 million trees, which will be 3rd party verified, from the nursery to the farm. The baselines for these activities have been established using ofi's AI-powered Carbon Stock Monitoring tool and will be used continuously to track the geolocation of the trees and that they are growing to comply with the objectives set out by Nestl and ofi.</p><p>The global partnership builds on 15 years of Nestl and ofi collaborating on sustainable cocoa and is their largest joint agroforestry initiative to date. It is designed to support Nestl's Cocoa Plan and 2050 Net Zero targets while also contributing towards ofi's Cocoa Compass sustainability ambition, which introduced new targets for regenerative agriculture. These feed into ofi's overarching sustainability strategy, Choices for Change, with a vision of being the preferred partner for positive change.</p><p>Implementation has already started in all three locations, with a series of comprehensive training and educational exercises to help farmers become more forest-positive by focusing on the benefits of agroforestry and carbon capture. Key components include:</p><p>1. Training on climate-smart agricultural practices: Farmers will receive extensive training on sustainable farming techniques, including good agricultural practices (GAP), like planting shade trees amongst cocoa. They will also learn how to better manage crop residues, such as composting and mulching cocoa pod husks, to improve soil health and help reduce GHG emissions.</p><p>2. Empowering farmers to become environmental stewards: Training will be provided to farmers on wider environmental and sustainability issues, including those related to the African Regional Sustainability Standard (ARS) and EUDR regulations on sustainable cocoa. This is designed to give them a deeper understanding of the landscape and empower them to become stewards of their environment.</p><p>3. Financial incentives for farmers: Participating farmers will also be incentivized through financial rewards for planting and maintaining forest trees, encouraging active participation and commitment to the partnership goals.</p><p>4. Measuring the effectiveness of carbon capture: By promoting reforestation and carbon capture, the partnership aims to enhance biodiversity and improve soil health, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient cocoa supply chain.

The Jodhpur Handicraft Exporters Federation, in a memorandum to the central government, has expressed urgent concerns over the regulation's stringent compliance requirements, urging for immediate intervention to safeguard the livelihoods of millions involved in the industry.</p><p>The EUDR aims to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation linked to commodities such as timber, soy, palm oil, and coffee, by ensuring that only deforestation-free supply chains are permitted within the European market. However, the federation contends that this regulation, while addressing important environmental concerns, could have unintended consequences for India's handicraft sector, particularly in Jodhpur, a city renowned for its wooden handicrafts.</p><p>Naresh Bothra, president of the Jodhpur Handicraft Exporters Federation, said: \"The majority of wooden handicrafts exported from India are made from Mango, Acacia, and Sheesham - species that are primarily grown under agroforestry systems. These species are cultivated in a way that does not contribute to deforestation or the degradation of natural forests. These trees are part of India's agroforestry practices, which have a minimal environmental footprint.\"</p><p>\"We have been raising our concerns through various forums for a long time. Through the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH), the Federation has also informed the relevant ministries of the central government about the difficulties that the proposed regulations may cause and has called for intervention,\" he said.</p><p>The federation referred to the data from the Forest Survey of India (FSI), which highlights that India's Tree outside Forest (TOF) cover stands at 1,779.35 million cubic metres. Of this, Mango and Acacia contribute around 13 million cubic metres annually, with the handicraft sector consuming 0.5% of the total growing stock. This minimal consumption underscores the sustainability of the sector and its reliance on legally sourced and agroforestry-based wood.</p><p>Bothra stressed that these new requirements could lead to severe consequences for the industry. \"The practicalities of implementing such documentation for every tree used in the handicraft production process are almost impossible,\" he said.

The Jodhpur Handicraft Exporters Federation, in a memorandum to the central government, has expressed urgent concerns over the regulation's stringent compliance requirements, urging for immediate intervention to safeguard the livelihoods of millions involved in the industry. The EUDR aims to eliminate deforestation and forest degradation linked to commodities such as timber, soy, palm oil, and coffee, by ensuring that only deforestation-free supply chains are permitted within the European market. However, the federation contends that this regulation, while addressing important environmental concerns, could have unintended consequences for India's handicraft sector, particularly in Jodhpur, a city renowned for its wooden handicrafts. Naresh Bothra, president of the Jodhpur Handicraft Exporters Federation, said: \"The majority of wooden handicrafts exported from India are made from Mango, Acacia, and Sheesham - species that are primarily grown under agroforestry systems. These species are cultivated in a way that does not contribute to deforestation or the degradation of natural forests.

These targeted sectors hold high potential for climate-resilient employment and require a skilled workforce capable of managing ecosystems and deploying green technologies. Despite their potential, women and youth in Africa remain largely underrepresented in Africa's sustainable growth sectors. Increasing their participation, especially in employment-intensive green industries, could accelerate inclusive and resilient economic development across the continent.

However, beneath the promises and the digital gloss, the reality is sobering. Instead of dismantling outdated regulatory mindsets, the new rules effectively reinforce them, only this time via an app-based platform. Far from ushering in a truly market-driven era of farm forestry, they entrench the same old culture of controls, permissions, and suspicion.</p><p>Digitisation without True Deregulation</p><p>At the heart of the policy is the National Timber Management System (NTMS) portal. This online system requires farmers to register every plantation in detail: geolocated photographs, species information, planting dates, and ownership proofs. Before any felling takes place, farmers must file an application, upload pre-felling images, and indicate intended harvest dates.</p><p>After felling, they are required to submit \"stump images\" as evidence. A verifying agency or designated officer will then conduct an inspection and issue a transit permit.</p><p>While this workflow is pitched as a simplification, it is essentially the same licensing raj, repackaged as digital compliance.</p><p>The burdens that once involved files and signatures in forest offices are now transferred to online forms and verification visits.</p><p>This is not deregulation; it is digitisation of regulation. For the average smallholder, the net effect is unchanged: planting trees continues to carry hidden transaction costs, procedural delays, and the fear of harassment.</p><p>Persistent Presumption of Guilt</p><p>The model rules are underpinned by a deeply entrenched presumption: farmers are not to be trusted to manage trees on their own land without oversight. This is an archaic mindset dating back to colonial forest laws when timber was seen as a strategic state resource.</p><p>Even today, no one asks a farmer to register a field of paddy or seek permission to harvest sugarcane or mustard. Yet when it comes to trees, the State insists on retaining a supervisory hand.</p><p>This presumption of guilt has been a primary reason why farmers across India hesitate to invest in long-gestation timber crops.</p><p>The fear is real: any minor paperwork error can result in seizure of produce, imposition of penalties, or worse.</p><p>By failing to remove the requirement for permissions and inspections, the new rules have missed the opportunity to build trust and signal a clean break with the past.</p><p>Species Liberalisation Still Out of Reach</p><p>One of the biggest deterrents to agroforestry has been uncertainty around species regulations. Different states have different lists of trees that require permits, creating confusion and inhibiting investment.</p><p>A truly market-driven approach would have established a clear national negative list - that is, only those rare, ecologically sensitive, or protected species requiring permissions, with all other species deemed free for harvest.</p><p>Instead, the model rules preserve a complicated process of permissions for most high-value species, leaving it to each State Committee to prescribe lists. This effectively continues the same patchwork of restrictions that farmers have grappled with for decades.</p><p>The result: smallholders will think twice before planting commercially valuable species like teak, rosewood, or sandalwood, fearing entanglement in red tape.</p><p>Markets Not Addressed</p><p>This is a significant missed opportunity. A successful agroforestry model requires both freedom to harvest and support to monetise. Instead, the policy concentrates on regulatory compliance while leaving market facilitation entirely unaddressed.</p><p>Discretion Without Accountability</p><p>The rules also place considerable powers in the hands of State Committees, which are free to decide verification mechanisms, empanel agencies, and define species lists.</p><p>While flexibility is important, the experience across states suggests that such discretion often results in inconsistent implementation and increased bureaucratic opacity.</p><p>In practice, farmers will continue to face unpredictable interpretations and arbitrary delays, defeating the promise of \"ease of doing business.\"</p><p>Superficial Transparency</p><p>Much has been made of the NTMS portal's potential to create traceable supply chains compliant with international norms such as the EU's deforestation-free regulations.</p><p>But here, too, the design is fundamentally flawed. Instead of making traceability optional - something that progressive farmers and buyers can choose for premium markets - the system forces all farmers to participate, regardless of whether they are targeting export buyers or selling locally.</p><p>This one-size-fits-all approach imposes compliance costs on the smallest farmers while doing little to incentivise genuine market differentiation.</p><p>The Road Not Taken</p><p>India's agroforestry aspirations have always been built on the principle that farmers should be empowered to plant trees as they plant crops: free from excessive interference, with the state playing a facilitating rather than policing role.</p><p>A genuinely transformative policy would have included:</p><p>Presumption of freedom: Farmers can harvest and sell any tree grown on their land, unless it falls under a narrow, notified list of protected species.</p><p>Time-bound approvals: If any permissions are needed, they must be granted within a fixed window (e.g. 15 days) or deemed approved.</p><p>Optional certification: Farmers targeting premium or export markets could opt in to traceability mechanisms without imposing mandatory burdens on everyone.</p><p>Credit and insurance facilitation: Recognising standing trees as collateral and promoting insurance products for long-cycle crops.</p><p>Market development: Creating e-marketplaces, price information systems, and procurement linkages with industries.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>India has committed to significant increases in tree cover outside forests, with agroforestry playing a central role in climate action, rural employment, and livelihood diversification. But aspirations must be matched by policy that genuinely empowers rather than controls. By retaining the same architecture of permissions and replacing paper files with portals, the new model rules do little to build trust, unlock investment, or treat farmers as partners in sustainable development.</p><p>Until we abandon the presumption that private timber must be policed, agroforestry will remain an underperforming sector weighed down by outdated instincts of control. In that sense, these rules are a retrograde step, masquerading as reform, and risk squandering a historic opportunity to make Indian farm forestry an engine of prosperity.</p><p>(The writer is former Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and presently heads NbS and Strategy at IORA Ecological Solutions)</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Pioneer.

Superficial TransparencyMuch has been made of the NTMS portal's potential to create traceable supply chains compliant with international norms such as the EU's deforestation-free regulations. But here, too, the design is fundamentally flawed. Instead of making traceability optional - something that progressive farmers and buyers can choose for premium markets - the system forces all farmers to participate, regardless of whether they are targeting export buyers or selling locally. This one-size-fits-all approach imposes compliance costs on the smallest farmers while doing little to incentivise genuine market differentiation. The Road Not TakenIndia's agroforestry aspirations have always been built on the principle that farmers should be empowered to plant trees as they plant crops: free from excessive interference, with the state playing a facilitating rather than policing role. A genuinely transformative policy would have included:Presumption of freedom: Farmers can harvest and sell any tree grown on their land, unless it falls under a narrow, notified list of protected species. Time-bound approvals: If any permissions are needed, they must be granted within a fixed window (e. g. 15 days) or deemed approved. Optional certification: Farmers targeting premium or export markets could opt in to traceability mechanisms without imposing mandatory burdens on everyone.", "g. 15 days) or deemed approved. Optional certification: Farmers targeting premium or export markets could opt in to traceability mechanisms without imposing mandatory burdens on everyone. Credit and insurance facilitation: Recognising standing trees as collateral and promoting insurance products for long-cycle crops. Market development: Creating e-marketplaces, price information systems, and procurement linkages with industries. ConclusionIndia has committed to significant increases in tree cover outside forests, with agroforestry playing a central role in climate action, rural employment, and livelihood diversification. But aspirations must be matched by policy that genuinely empowers rather than controls. By retaining the same architecture of permissions and replacing paper files with portals, the new model rules do little to build trust, unlock investment, or treat farmers as partners in sustainable development. Until we abandon the presumption that private timber must be policed, agroforestry will remain an underperforming sector weighed down by outdated instincts of control. In that sense, these rules are a retrograde step, masquerading as reform, and risk squandering a historic opportunity to make Indian farm forestry an engine of prosperity.

According to Dwivedi, The campaign's focus rested on improving farmers' understanding through field demonstrations, direct interactions, and expert consultations over a period of fifteen days, he said and added the key goals of the campaign included dissemination of information on improved agricultural methods, adoption of modern technologies suitable for Kharif crops, promoting crop selection using soil health cards, and ensuring the efficient use of approved inputs. Principal Scientist AK Handa said that during the campaign, a team of seventeen scientists along with technical staff from CAFRI visited ninety villages in the region and conducted awareness and outreach activities. The team worked to increase awareness regarding agroforestry systems, distributed quality seedlings, provided literature on smart farming, and delivered site-specific guidance to the farming community. Demonstrations on soil health management and agroforestry-based models were conducted alongside interactive sessions. The campaign concluded on June 12 with an online programme attended by the Union minister of agriculture, Govt of India, Shivraj Singh Chauhan, and the director-general of ICAR, ML Jat.

The project was rolled out by National   Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) Consultancy Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of NABARD, in collaboration with Karnataka horticulture and forest departments   and funded by Rabo Bank, a multinational banking and financial services company from the Netherlands. The move is aimed at helping farmers   grow crops that guzzle greenhouse gases, earn carbon removal units through biomass management and tree plantations. The pilot project involves 3,500 mango farmers in Koppal district. </p><p>According to horticulture department   officials, the pilot focuses exclusively   on mango plantations that are less than five years old. \"We identified 11 eligible plant species,   but this time only mango was taken up. Border tree plantations are also mandatory under the project. The forest department will provide saplings   for free, and we will be signing an agreement with them in two weeks,\" says Shamla Iqbal, secretary, horticulture   &amp; sericulture department. The pilot, signed last July, has seen delays in farmer payments due to the complex compliance and auditing requirements.   \"This is a learning process for all partners. Some delays were inevitable.   Farmers will receive payments after biomass assessment and carbon credit calculations are completed,\" she clarifies. The horticulture department hopes that once the first round of payments   is made, more farmers will come forward to join the initiative. The earnings potential for farmers   under this scheme is still being assessed.   Officials cited the success of a similar initiative in Andhra Pradesh's Anantapur district, where farmers reportedly   earn between Rs 20,000 and Rs 40,000 per hectare from carbon credits. If everything goes as planned, groundwork such as border plantations and further biomass assessments may begin in Karnataka by Sept. Full-scale implementation depends on the outcome   of ongoing audits and clearances. But many farmers are not buying itAs a new era in climate-linked farming   takes shape, several farmers' groups are pushing back, calling the initiative exploitative and unjust. Associations   argue that farmers cannot be allowed to bear the brunt of any company's pollution. Chukki Nanjundaswamy, farmer activist associated with the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS), says: \"It is a natural product turned into yet another commodity, just like seeds that once belonged to farmers but now make them mere buyers. Carbon credits are driven by western nations responsible   for climate change, yet they expect the global south to find solutions. Big banks funding coal and power projects are now using carbon credits for greenwashing.   With mango prices crashing, farmers' vulnerability is being exploited.   We cannot be held responsible for a global climate crisis - carbon credits are nothing but a greenwash.\" N Chinnappa Reddy, president, Kolar District Mango Growers Association,   says: \"We have little information   from NABARD. They told us only the basics - that certain plants would earn us money - but two years have passed with no progress. We don't even understand the basics of carbon credits. If you ask us about our view, we honestly don't even know the basics   of carbon credits.\" Karnataka has around 1.5 lakh hectares under mango cultivation and over 2.8 lakh mango farmers with key mango growing districts   including Kolar, Ramanagara. India's potential vs farmers' skepticismWith organisations like the European Union and several global corporations looking to buy carbon credits (CC) from other countries, and a domestic market set to launch next year, experts say the CC demand is expected to grow. However, farmer skepticism and lack of clarity on payment models remain   major challenges. \"Carbon credits can come from either   avoidance - using alternative technologies   to cut emissions - or carbon capture, such as direct air capture (DAC) or carbon capture, utilisation, and storage   (CCUS). Agriculture offers a huge opportunity in CCUS,\" says Subhradeep Das, a developmental economist. \"India doesn't yet have a domestic carbon market. Currently, companies participate in voluntary carbon markets,   with buyers like tech giants (Microsoft,   Google) and oil and gas firms. South India, with its large farmlands, cash crops, and agroforestry potential, stands out as a hub for such initiatives,\"   he says. \"Global carbon credit prices remain volatile due to geopolitical   factors, but demand is set to surge by 2030 with Paris Agreement targets.\" Josh Wycliffe, a resident of Kolar and COO of the International Solar Alliance,   a treaty-based intergovernmental   organisation under the UN system, says: \"Though regulatory hurdles exist,   farmer risk is low since plantations are already in place.

In an article in the journal Current Opinions in Environmental Sustainability, published in February 2023, authors Amy Quandt, Henry Neufeldt, and Kayla Gorman highlighted the socioeconomic and biophysical benefits of agroforestry in adaptation. Some of the biophysical benefits include the creation of microclimates with lower air temperatures, reduction in evapotranspiration by shading crops, windbreaks to minimize soil loss and erosion, and protection of crops from strong winds. Agroforestry also improves soil quality by increasing soil nitrogen and carbon. The socioeconomic benefits include improved food security and increased resilience of farmers by providing a varied source of income\u2014through crops, forestry, and animal husbandry.  <br/><br/>Of the various agroforestry techniques, silvopasture has been the most discussed and debated. As noted above, silvopasture is a land management practice that brings together tree planting, agriculture, and pastures for animal husbandry in one place. This can take many forms, such as trees acting as a natural barrier between pasture land and other crops, or trees planted in alternate rows with other crops, or trees spaced out over the pasture land. Silvopasture, in its various avatars, provides a large number of ecological benefits such as improvement in soil and water quality, increased water retention by the roots, enhanced carbon sequestration in trees and soil, and better microclimatic conditions by moderating extreme heat, etc. These benefits also extend to higher productivity of animals and more shaded areas for them, which is a great support during periods of intense heat.  <br/><br/>Well-managed silvopasture farms can therefore cater to the needs of food, fodder, fuel, and fiber. In addition to the ecological benefits discussed above, it also greatly supports the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the UN, such as food security for a rising population and both adaptation (making the farmer more resilient and risk-averse) and mitigation (increased carbon sequestration in trees and soils) measures in the fight against climate change.  <br/><br/>Even though silvopasture provides many benefits, there are challenges as well. For one, it requires resources as well as information, which many poor farmers in both developing and developed countries lack. For example, the trees planted should be woody, shade-providing, and drought-resistant. However, such trees have long growth cycles and require time and patience to tend to.  <br/><br/>Conclusion  <br/><br/>Agroforestry in general, and silvopasture in particular, offer great ecological benefits by integrating agriculture, tree plantations, and pastures on the same land in a symbiotic relationship. They also contribute to mitigation efforts (increasing carbon sequestration in trees and soils) and adaptation efforts (reducing farmers\u2019 risk and increasing their resilience).
