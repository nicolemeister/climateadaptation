That\u2019s roughly equivalent to the entire population of the\u00a0European Union\u00a0and the number has been steadily rising \u2014 up 40 per cent over those two decades.</p><p><br/><br/>With intense, destructive fires often in the news, it can seem like more land is burning. And in parts of the world, including western North America, it is.<br/><br/>Globally, however, our team of fire researchers also found that the total area burned actually declined by 26 per cent over those two decades.<br/><br/>How is that possible?<br/><br/>We found the driving reasons for those changes in Africa, which has\u00a0the vast majority of all land burned, but the total burned area there has been falling. Agricultural activities in Africa are increasingly\u00a0fragmenting wildland areas\u00a0that are prone to burning. A cultivated farm field and roads can help stop a fire\u2019s spread. But more farms and development in wildland areas also means more people can be exposed to wildfires.<br/><br/>Drawing on our expertise in\u00a0climate\u00a0and\u00a0wildfire\u00a0sciences and\u00a0geospatial modeling, we analyzed global wildfire activity over the past two decades. The results highlight some common misperceptions and show how the fire risk to humans is changing.<br/>Global burned area down, intense fires up<br/>Wildfire is a natural process that has existed for as long as vegetation has covered the Earth. Occasional fires in a forest are healthy. They clear out dead wood and leaf and branch litter, leaving less fuel for future fires to burn. That helps to keep wildfires from becoming too intense.<br/><br/>However, intense fires can also pose serious threats to human lives, infrastructure and economies, particularly as more people move into fire-prone areas.<br/><br/>North and South America have both experienced a\u00a0rise in intense wildfires\u00a0over the past two decades. Some notable examples include the\u00a02018 Camp Fire\u00a0in California and the\u00a02023 record-breaking Canadian wildfires, which generated widespread smoke that blanketed large parts of Canada and the eastern United States and even reached Europe.<br/><br/>The increase in intense wildfires aligns with the intensification of fire weather around the world. Heat, low humidity and strong winds can make wildfires more likely to spread and harder to control. The number of days conducive to extreme fire behavior and new fire ignitions has increased by\u00a0more than 50 per cent over the past four decades globally, elevating the odds that the amount of land burned in a particular region\u00a0sets a new record.<br/><br/>But fire weather is not the only influence on wildfire risk. The amount of dry vegetation and whether it\u2019s in a continuous stretch or broken up, influences fire risk. So do\u00a0ignition sources, such as vehicles and power lines in wildland areas. Human activities can start fires and fuel climate change, which further\u00a0dries out the land, amplifying wildfire activity.\u00a0Fire suppression practices\u00a0that don\u2019t allow low-intensity fires to burn can lead to the accumulation of flammable vegetation, raising the risk of intense fires.<br/>North America is a fraction of total burned area<br/>In recent years, a growing number of wildfire disasters in North America, Europe and Australia have captured global attention. From the deadly\u00a02025 Los Angeles fires\u00a0to the devastating\u00a02019-2020 Australian bushfires\u00a0and the\u00a02018 wildfire in Athens, Greece, flames have increasingly encroached upon human settlements, claiming lives and livelihoods.<br/><br/>However, wildfire exposure isn\u2019t limited to these high-profile regions \u2212 we simply hear more about them.<br/><br/>The United States, Europe and Australia collectively account for less than 2.5 per cent of global human exposure to wildfire. Human exposure to fire occurs when people\u2019s homes fall directly within the area burned by a wildfire.<br/><br/>In stark contrast, Africa alone accounts for approximately\u00a085 per cent of all wildfire exposures\u00a0and 65 per cent of the global burned area.<br/><br/>Remarkably, just five central African countries \u2014 the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Mozambique, Zambia and Angola \u2014 experience half of all global human exposure to wildfires, even though they account for less than 3 per cent of the global population. These countries receive sufficient moisture to support plant growth, yet they are dry enough that trees and plants burn in frequent fires that in some places occur multiple times per year.<br/>Regional trends and drivers of wildfire<br/>We found that wildfire exposure increased across all continents except Europe and Oceania, but the underlying drivers of the increase\u00a0varied by region.<br/><br/>In Africa,\u00a0agricultural expansion\u00a0has led to more people living in fire-prone areas.<br/><br/>In North America, particularly the United States,\u00a0intensifying fire weather\u00a0\u2014 the hot, dry, windy conditions conducive to spreading fires \u2014 has led to increasingly\u00a0uncontrollable wildfires that threaten human settlements.<br/><br/>In South America, a combination of rising drought frequency and severity, intensifying heat waves and agricultural expansion has amplified wildfire intensity and increased the population in fire-prone regions.<br/><br/>In Asia, growing populations in fire-prone areas, combined with more days of fire-friendly weather, led to increased human exposure to wildfires.<br/><br/>In contrast, Europe and Oceania have seen declining wildfire exposures, largely due to more people moving to cities and fewer living in rural, fire-prone zones.<br/>What to do about it<br/>Communities can take steps to prevent destructive wildfires from spreading.<br/><br/>For example, vegetation management, such as prescribed fires, can avoid fueling intense fires. Public education, policy enforcement and engineering solutions \u2014 such as vegetation reduction and clearance along roads and power lines \u2014\u00a0can help reduce human-caused ignitions.<br/><br/>As climate change intensifies fire weather and people continue to move into fire-prone zones, proactive mitigation will be increasingly critical.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Indian Agriculture News", "instances": ["The amount of dry vegetation and whether it\u2019s in a continuous stretch or broken up, influences fire risk.

The report found that factors such as the amount of vegetation, time elapsed since the last fire in an area and hazard burning reduction all impact the intensity of fires but that climate change was the \"overwhelming factor\" in the increase in frequency and intensity since 1988.

But the ecological costs of huge, repetitive, high-severity wildfires on ecosystems could be colossal.<br/>Out of controlAnd it's unclear how much the natural world can tolerate such dramatic disturbance. Wildfires are increasing in severity around the world. The Australian bushfires are larger than some of the deadliest recorded. Incidences are also increasing in ecosystems where wildfires are uncommon, such as the UK uplands. Not to mention the widespread deliberate burning of areas of high conservation value for agriculture, as has been recently reported in large parts of the BrazilianAmazon for beef production and in Indonesia for palm oil.<br/>Unsurprisingly, given the shocking numbers of animals that must have perished as a result of these wildfires, many are questioning whether burned ecosystems can recover from such dramatic losses of biodiversity. In Australia, for example, some estimate that the fires could drive more than 700 insect species to extinction.<br/>The world's biodiversity is already severely struggling - we are in the midst of what scientists describe as the sixth mass extinction. A recent report has highlighted that about a quarter of assessed species are threatened with extinction. Australia already has the highest rate of mammal loss for any region in the world, signaling the fragility of existing ecosystems that might struggle to function in a warming, fire-prone world.<br/>Fears for familiar and charismatic animals affected by the bushfires, such as koalas, have been expressed by conservationists. The outlook for already critically endangered species, such as the regent honeyeater and western ground parrot, meanwhile, is uncertain. But to establish the true ecological costs of wildfires it is important to consider biodiversity in terms of networks, not particular species or numbers of animals.<br/>All species are embedded in complex networks of interactions where they are directly and indirectly dependent on each other. A food web is a good example of such networks. The simultaneous loss of such large numbers of plants and animals could have cascading impacts on the ways species interact - and hence the ability of ecosystems to bounce back and properly function following high-severity wildfires.<br/>A fragile systemAnd so it's key that we consider biodiversity loss due to wildfires in terms of entire networks of interacting organisms, including humans, rather than simply one or two charismatic animals. I have studied and recently published research about the loss of plants and animals due to wildfires in Portugal, using new methods in ecology that can examine the resilience of ecosystems to species extinctions. My team found that networks of interacting plants and animals at burned sites became fragile and more prone to species extinctions.<br/>Our study looked at the impacts of a large wildfire in 2012 on one of the many ecological interactions that keep ecosystems healthy - insect pollination. We examined the responses of moths, which are important but often overlooked pollinators, to wildfire by comparing those we caught in burned and neighboring unburned areas.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The hummingbird hawk-moth. Research in Portugal is revealing the importance of moths as pollinators.\u00a0<br/>Claudio306/Shutterstock.com<br/>\u00a0<br/>By collecting, counting, and identifying the thousands of pollen grains they were carrying, we were able to decipher the plant-insect\u00a0network of interacting species. In this way, it was possible to examine not only the responses of the plants and animals to wildfire but crucially the impacts on pollination processes.<br/>We then used these networks to model the resilience of the ecosystem more generally. We found that burned areas had significantly more abundant flowers (due to a flush of plants whose seeds and roots survived in the soil) but less abundant and species\u2010rich moths. The total amount of pollen being transported by the moths in burned areas was just 20 percent of that at unburned areas.<br/>Our analysis revealed important differences in the way these species interacted as a result of the wildfire. Although the study was only a snapshot in time, we were able to show that plant-insect communities at burned sites were less able to resist the effects of any further disturbances without suffering species extinctions.<br/>And so as people start rebuilding their homes, livelihoods, and communities in Australia following the devastating bushfires, it is crucial that governments and land managers around the world take sensible decisions that will build resilience into ecosystems. To do this, ecological interaction networks need to be considered, rather than specific species. Cutting-edge network approaches that examine the complex ways in which entire communities of species interact can and should help with this.<br/>Over 45 years ago, the American evolutionary ecologist and conservationist Dan Janzen wrote: \"There is a much more insidious kind of extinction: the extinction of ecological interactions.\" We should all be concerned not just about the loss of animals, but about the unraveling of species interactions within ecosystems on which we all depend for our survival.<br/></p>", "publisher": "IT Next", "instances": ["At least 28 people have died.

People finally seem to be taking this seriously, but there is an undercurrent of opinion about the \"naturalness\" of wildfires. Some are still questioning the role of climate change in driving the Australian bushfires.

ADAPT will test the hypothesis that fire-proneness is a prerequisite for the evolution of fire-adaptive traits, where it will uniquely examine whether a shift in fire-regime post-dates the appearance of branch shedding, suggesting that the trait was the result of multi-agent selection co-opted to improve fitness of some conifers; or prior to the evolution of branch shedding, suggesting that the trait evolved in response to selection by fire and that fire has been a selective force over 100s of millions of years of Earth history. Fire-adapted traits are what continue to ensure survival of plants in Earth's fire-prone ecosystems.

More UV can get through, and ice and snow is highly reflective, bouncing these rays around.</p><p>In humans, high UV exposure increases our risk of skin cancer and cataracts. But we don't have fur or feathers. While penguins and seals have skin protection, their eyes aren't protected.</p><p>Is it doing damage? We don't know for sure. Very few studies report on what UV radiation does to animals in Antarctica. Most are done in zoos, where researchers study what happens when animals are kept under artificial light.</p><p>Even so, it is a concern. More  UV radiation in early summer could be particularly damaging to young animals, such as penguin chicks and seal pups who hatch or are born in late spring.</p><p>As plants such as Antarctic hairgrass, Deschampsia antarctica, the cushion plant, Colobanthus quitensis and lots of mosses emerge from under snow in late spring, they will be exposed to maximum UV levels.</p><p>Antarctic mosses actually produce their own sunscreen to protect themselves from UV radiation, but this comes at the cost of reduced growth.</p><p>Trillions of tiny phytoplankton live under the sea ice. These microscopic floating algae also make sunscreen compounds, called microsporine amino acids.</p><p>What about marine creatures? Krill will dive deeper into the water column if the UV radiation is too high, while fish eggs usually have melanin, the same protective compound as humans, though not all fish life stages are as well protected.</p><p>Four of the past five years have seen sea ice extent reduce, a direct consequence of climate change.</p><p>Less sea ice means more UV light can penetrate the ocean, where it makes it harder for Antarctic phytoplankton and krill to survive. Much relies on these tiny creatures, who form the base of the food web. If they find it harder to survive, hunger will ripple up the food chain. Antarctica's waters are also getting warmer and more acidic due to climate change.</p><h>An uncertain outlook for Antarctica</h><p>We should, by rights, be celebrating the success of banning CFCS -a rare example of fixing an environmental problem. But that might be premature. Climate change may be delaying the recovery of our ozone layer by, for example, making bushfires more common and more severe.</p><p>Ozone could also suffer from geoengineering proposals such as spraying sulphates into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight, as well as more frequent rocket launches.</p><p>If the recent trend continues, and the ozone hole lingers into the summer, we can expect to see more damage done to plants and animals -compounded by other threats.</p><p>We don't know if the longer-lasting ozone hole will continue.

It's hard to think of another event anywhere in the world in living memory that has killed or displaced that many animals. This ranks as one of the worst wildlife disasters in modern history,\" said WWF-Australia CEO Dermot O'Gorman.<br/>\"When you think about nearly three billion native animals being in the path of the fires it is absolutely huge, it's a difficult number to comprehend,\" Dickman said.<br/>While the scientists cannot say how many animals died, Dickman said the prospects for animals which escaped the flames were \"probably not that great\" because of a lack of food and shelter or being forced into habitat already occupied.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In January, Dickman, working with WWF scientists, produced an early estimate that 1.25 billion animals were impacted. However, that calculation focused only on the states of New South Wales and Victoria. He said the research shows people that mega fires are changing the environment and depleting native biodiversity and change is necessary.<br/>\"How quickly can we decarbonise? How quickly can we stop our manic land clearing? We land clear at a rate that's one of the highest in the world,\" Dickman said.<br/>Van Eeden said for this project the team examined a fire impact area of 11.46 million hectares.<br/>\"We believe a continent-wide assessment of the number of animals that might be impacted has never been done in Australia before or anywhere else in the world. Other nations can build upon this research to improve understanding of bushfire impacts everywhere,\" Van Eeden said.<br/>\u00a0<br/>O'Gorman said with extreme fires becoming more frequent because of climate change, the interim findings \"give other countries a window into the future of mega fires and their devastating impact on wildlife\". He said the research had also been released in time to be considered by the review of Australia's flagship environment law -- the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act.<br/>\"Following such a heavy toll on Australia's wildlife, strengthening this law has never been more important. WWF will continue to advocate for policies that benefit both people and nature, restore what has been lost, and ensure we build back a more resilient Australia,\" O'Gorman said.<br/>The recommendations in the interim report call for addressing knowledge gaps on wildlife densities and responses to fire, improving habitat connectivity to help mobile species escape fire, identifying and protecting unburnt habitat crucial to threatened species, improving fire prevention and management, and establishing rapid response teams to help species impacted by fire.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Indian Media News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 56, "title": "Even experts struggle to tell which social media posts are evidence-based.

Previously successful VEEP applicants are eligible to apply for the new program. Applications open 2 March and close on 31 March for projects to be completed by 30 December 2020. Quotes from Acting Minister for Tourism, Sport and Culture, Eva Lawler:The New Visitor Experience Program aims to support the Territorys tourism industry and operators to bounce back from the impacts of the Australian bushfires and coronavirus. This is a critical industry for the Northern Territory, supporting 17,100 direct and indirect jobs and thousands of small to medium local businesses, and the Territory Labor Government continues to support it to be strong and thriving. The New Visitor Experience Program offers local tourism operators support to develop new visitor offerings and experiences, attract positive reviews and recommendations, as well as providing flow-on benefits for other industry sectors in the Territory. Yesterday we announced the Key to the NT initiative, a new free partnership program to promote NT tourism operators and experiences to the interstate self-drive market. Further initiatives will be announced this week as part of our $2 million Immediate Tourism Resilience Plan."]}, {"relevance_score": 27, "title": "NIWA - 2020 Australian wildfires reveal significant hole in our understanding of ozone", "published": "2022-08-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Source: MIL-OSI Submissions</p><h>Source:NIWA</h><p>      Smoke from the devastating Australian wildfires impacted the atmosphere in a way that's never been seen before.  Scientists at NASA and New Zealand's National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) have been studying the effects from the wildfire's smoke on our ozone. They have detected unprecedented chemical changes in the stratosphere, roughly 16-20 km above the Earth's surface, which is where one third of our protective ozone layer resides.  The changes involved several chlorine-containing gases, which usually do not change much in this region. The main differences involved hydrogen chloride (HCl) - a gas that can be converted into a reactive form that destroys ozone. In the months following the bushfires, NASA's Aura satellite observed that HCl levels had dropped by about half. There were also increases in chlorine monoxide (ClO).  The changes occurred gradually over a four- to five-month period after the fires, before reversing over another four months.  Study lead Dr Susan Strahan is a Senior Research Scientist at the University of Maryland Baltimore County and the NASA Goddard Flight Center. She says that this discovery revealed an important gap in our understanding of ozone chemistry.  \"We were unable to replicate what we were seeing in any models, meaning that the reactions taking place in the stratosphere on these smoke aerosols are unknown. We don't know what they are, and we can't calculate their effects on ozone.  \"This is worrying because anything that messes with the chlorine family of gases - like HCl - has the potential to harm the ozone. Just one atom of chlorine can destroy over 100,000 ozone molecules before it is removed from the atmosphere. From the observations of elevated chlorine monoxide (ClO), we think that ozone in the mid latitudes experienced some depletion following the 2020 fires,\" said Dr Strahan.  Further measurements were taken by NIWA's Atmospheric Research Station at Lauder in Central Otago, located on New Zealand's South Island. The station was perfectly placed to make the observations - New Zealand experiencedapocalyptic orange skies and brown snow-peaked mountainsas the smoke blew over the country, located some 2,000km away from the fires.  NIWA Researcher Dan Smale is based at Lauder. He says that the smoke offered a great chance to study the impact of massive wildfire events on the atmosphere.  \"Nothing like this has ever been seen in the Lauder data record before. Like volcanic eruptions, mega wildfires release millions of tons of smoke particles high into the air. The Australian bushfires were the biggest and most destructive ever recorded and seem to have caused unknown reactions affecting ozone chemistry, which is both tantalising from a science point of view and worrying from an environmental point of view.  \"Our findings identify a knowledge gap in the processes that control ozone. With wildfires predicted to become more frequent and intense as the planet warms, the likelihood of ozone depletion is increased. Laboratory studies on the chemical reactivity of wildfire smoke particles are urgently needed.\"  Infamously known as \"Black Summer\", the 2020 Australian wildfires burnt approximately 14.3 million hectares of land, destroying 3,000 homes, and killing at least 34 people and up to 3 billion animals.

Quotes from Acting Minister for Tourism, Sport and Culture, Eva Lawler:Tourism is a lifeblood for the Territory  thats why weve made an unprecedented Turbocharging Tourism investment of $165. 8 million over four years to drive visitation to the NT which has seen significant results for our economy, jobs and the tourism industry. Our tourism industry supports 17,100 direct and indirect jobs and thousands of small to medium local businesses.

TO FURTHER ramp up its marketing efforts and to lure more Indian tourists for the ICC T20 Cricket World Cup, Australian Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Simon Birmingham, announced a funding boost of AUD1 million dollars to Tourism Australia. At a recent event attended by Australian cricketing legend Glenn McGrath and Indian cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle, Minister Birmingham said that while the recent Australian bushfires have been unprecedented, Australia is open for business and tourism businesses are geared up to welcome Indian travellers. Tourism Australia's current advertising campaign 'Experience the game and beyond' has been encouraging Indian cricket fans to book a ticket, watch a few games, and also get out into the regions to explore the incredible tourism experiences on offer. The ICC Official Travel Agents have so far reported over 6,400 bookings for the ICC T20 World Cups with increasing enquiries being regularly generated. This is in addition to the 12,600 tickets that have been purchased from India through the general public ticket sales. Given the importance of the tournaments and to facilitate easy access to Indian cricket enthusiasts, the Australian Department of Home Affairs will be prioritising all visa applications for those who are travelling to the ICC T20 Cricket World CupMinister Birmingham said, \"We know that many Indians, like many Australians, are cricket mad and will travel overseas to support their teams. Ticket sales out of India have almost reached 20,000, and with six months to go until the men's tournament, there is huge potential to boost sales even further."]}, {"relevance_score": 41, "title": "Even a 'limited' nuclear war would starve millions of people, new study reveals", "published": "2022-08-31", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> August 31 -- Even a relatively small nuclear war would create a worldwide food crisis lasting at least a decade in which hundreds of millions would starve, according to our new modeling published in Nature Food.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In a nuclear war, bombs dropped on cities and industrial areas would start firestorms, injecting large amounts of soot into the upper atmosphere. This soot would spread globally and rapidly cool the planet.</p><p><br/>Although the war might only last days or weeks, the impacts on Earth's climate could persist for more than ten years. We used advanced climate and food production models to explore what this would mean for the world's food supply.<br/>Catastrophic scenarios<br/>Conflicts between nuclear-armed powers are an ongoing concern in multiple parts of the world. If one of these conflicts escalated to nuclear war, how would it affect the world's food supply? And how would the impacts on global food production and trade scale with the size of such a war?<br/>To try to answer these questions, we used simulations of the global climate coupled with models of major crops, fisheries and livestock production. These simulations let us assess the impacts of nuclear war on global food supply for 15 years after the conflict.<br/>We simulated six different war scenarios, because the amount of soot injected into the upper atmosphere would depend on the number of weapons used.<br/>The smallest war in our scenarios was a \"limited\" conflict between India and Pakistan, involving 100 Hiroshima-sized weapons (less than 3% of the global nuclear arsenal). The largest was a global nuclear holocaust, in which Russia and the United States detonate 90% of the world's nuclear weapons.<br/>The six scenarios injected between 5 million and 150 million tons of soot into the upper atmosphere. For context, the Australian summer bushfires of 2019-20, which burned an area greater than the United Kingdom, injected about one million tons of smoke into the stratosphere.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Although we focused on India and Pakistan for our regional-scale war scenarios, nuclear conflict involving other nations could result in similar amounts of smoke and thus similar climate impacts.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The Australian bushfires of 2019-20 injected a million tonnes of soot into the upper atmosphere, but even a 'limited' nuclear war would have a much greater impact. Credit: NASA Earth Observatory\u00a0<br/>Widespread starvation<br/>Across all scenarios, impacts on the world's climate would be significant for about a decade after a nuclear war. As a consequence, global food production would decline.<br/>Even under the smallest war scenario we considered, sunlight over global crop regions would initially fall by about 10%, and global average temperatures would drop by up to 1-2\u2103. For a decade or so, this would cancel out all human-induced warming since the Industrial Revolution.<br/>In response, global food production would decrease by 7% in the first five years after a small-scale regional nuclear war. Although this sounds minor, a 7% fall is almost double the largest recorded drop in food production since records began in 1961. As a result, more than 250 million people would be without food two years after the war.<br/>Unsurprisingly, a global nuclear war would be a civilization-level threat, leaving over five billion people starving.<br/>In this scenario, average global temperatures would fall by 10-15\u2103 for the first five years after the war, while sunlight would crash by between 50-80% and rainfall over crop regions would drop by over 50%. As a result, global food production from land and sea would fall to less than 20% of pre-war levels and take over a decade to recover.<br/>No such thing as a limited nuclear war<br/>Behavioral change could avert some starvation after a relatively small nuclear war, but only regionally. We found that reducing household food waste and diverting feed from livestock to humans would lessen a regional nuclear war's effect on food supply, but only in major food-exporting countries such as Russia, the United States and Australia.<br/>Although great improvements have been made in recent decades, global food distribution remains a major challenge. Despite present-day food production being more than sufficient to nourish the world's population, over 700 million people suffered from undernutrition worldwide in 2020.<br/>In a post-nuclear-war world, we expect global food distribution would cease entirely for several years, as exporting countries suspend trade and focus on feeding their own populations. This would make war-induced shortages even worse in food-importing countries, especially in Asia, Europe and the Middle East.<br/>Our results point to a stark and clear conclusion: there is no such thing as a limited nuclear war, where impacts are confined to warring countries.<br/>Our findings provide further support for the 1985 statement by U.S. President Ronald Reagan and Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, reaffirmed by the current leaders of China, France, the U.K., Russia and the U.S. this year: \"A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought.\"<br/></p>", "publisher": "India Engineering News", "instances": ["The smallest war in our scenarios was a \"limited\" conflict between India and Pakistan, involving 100 Hiroshima-sized weapons (less than 3% of the global nuclear arsenal).

The remote continent is becoming increasingly accessible-during the 2019-20 season, the number of sightseeing visitors reached 74,000, with the vast majority traveling by ship. Scientific activities on the continent are also significant, with more than 70 research stations collectively housing thousands of researchers.</p><p><br/>\u00a0<br/>This activity, which is projected to increase in future, leaves a physical footprint with lasting consequences. In seeking to study or marvel at one of the last (nearly) undisturbed places on earth, humans are having a growing impact that can be measured and quantified.<br/>Under the Antarctic Treaty, tourist and scientific operators are required to remove waste from the continent. Trash and human waste are flown or shipped off the continent for disposal at warmer latitudes. But some forms of waste are not so easily squirreled off the continent. All activity in Antarctica-be it powered drills for scientific ice coring or vehicles for transport-burns fuel. As we burn fuel to keep warm, or to move around, our activities release microscopic particles of \"black carbon\" (smoke and soot).<br/>Elsewhere in the world, black carbon is released in enormous quantities by forest fires and human activity. It travels great distances-the soot from the Australian bushfires in 2019-20 traveled around the world. Yet in Antarctica, which is isolated from the rest of the world by a strong \"barrier\" of circumpolar winds, the sources of black carbon are typically more local.<br/>New research in the journal Nature Communications has extensively quantified the levels of black carbon in the snow near human settlements. Scientists first collected samples from 28 locations across a 2,000km stretch of the most-traveled section of Antarctica, stretching from the Antarctic Peninsula to the interior of the West Antarctic ice sheet.<br/>\u00a0<br/>A scientist at work in Antarctica's Ellsworth Mountains. Credit: Felipe Trueba / EPA\u00a0<br/>By analyzing the quantity and type of light-absorbing particles in snow samples, the researchers document how soot emitted by humans is affecting the properties of Antarctic snow near high-traffic areas.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Samples were passed through filters and analyzed for their optical properties to identify the quantity and type of particulates. Many types of impurities that absorb light exist in Antarctic snow, though in minuscule quantities-the background level of black carbon in Antarctic snow is around 1 nanogram (one billionth of a gram) per gram of snow.<br/>To differentiate between dust and black carbon, the researchers used the \"angstrom exponent\". Put simply, smaller particles will absorb a greater band of light than larger ones-so the type of particles in the snow samples could be inferred from how the filtered particles interacted with light in the laboratory.<br/>All samples from near human settlements showed black carbon levels greatly above the typical Antarctic background levels, a clear sign of human emissions. Elevated levels of black carbon will influence how snow absorbs light, a property known as \"albedo\". Snow with a lower albedo will melt faster. As a result, the black carbon content in the collected snow samples could be used to infer whether snow melt rates might have increased due to human activity.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Black carbon concentrations were lower at less accessible sites. Credit: Cordero et al / Nature Comms, CC BY-SA\u00a0<br/>Scientists emit even more per capita than tourists<br/>The results are sobering. In affected areas near human settlements on the Antarctic Peninsula, human-produced black carbon may be causing surface snow to melt by up to 23mm every summer. When examining tourist activities specifically, the authors calculate that each visitor between 2016 and 2020 was effectively melting around 83 metric tons of snow, due largely to emissions from cruise ships.<br/>Scientific activities are not exempt-in fact, scientific research stations contribute to an order of magnitude higher per capita snow melt rate through the operation of fuel-intensive equipment and vehicles, sometimes year-round.<br/>This research confirms similar studies elsewhere around the role of black carbon emissions in accelerating ice and snow melt. For instance, fires in the Amazon rainforest were found to have increased the melting rate of glaciers in the Andes. In Antarctica, the documentation of black carbon near settlements echoes other research on microscopic pollution, such as microplastics being found in sea ice and penguins. These findings show that human impacts may be more pervasive and insidious than they appear from a distance.<br/>As human activity in Antarctica increases, so will the accompanying effects. Research on these real and potential harms provides vital information on how they might be best mitigated or avoided altogether. To minimize harm to wildlife and the environment, we need to ensure both research and tourism are carefully managed.<br/></p>", "publisher": "India Engineering News", "instances": ["Trash and human waste are flown or shipped off the continent for disposal at warmer latitudes.
