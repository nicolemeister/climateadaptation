This achievement surpasses its 2025 goal of 20%, reflecting the strong traction that regenerative agriculture is gaining within coffee farmers, according to the latest 2030 progress report.</p><p><br/><br/> The company is supporting coffee farmers transition to practices like optimised fertilisation, soil cover, mulching and composting, with the aim of improving productivity and lowering their costs. The adoption of these practices is also helping reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in coffee. In 2024, participants of the plan achieved a reduction ranging from 20% to 40% of GHG emissions per kilogram of green coffee.<br/><br/> The challenges posed by climate change were acutely felt in the coffee sector this past year, across several coffee-producing countries, where farmers experienced adverse weather conditions. This has resulted in record-high global prices for both arabica and robusta coffee and less coffee available, underscoring the urgent need for more resilient coffee supply chains.<br/><br/> Axel Touzet, head of Nestl\u00e9's coffee brands strategic business unit, said, \"Regenerative agriculture is at the heart of the Nescaf\u00e9 Plan and our efforts to build resilience in our coffee supply chain. This third Progress Report shows that farmers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of these practices, as shown by the increased adoption rates. This encourages us to continue the work we do with our partners, suppliers and farmers in the regions where we source our coffee.\"<br/><br/> As coffee trees age, they naturally become less productive and more susceptible to the effects of climate change, which can further diminish yields. Renovating and rejuvenating coffee farms is essential to maintain productivity, and in 2024, the plan continued its longstanding coffee plantlet program by distributing 21 million coffee plantlets to support improved yields and climate adaptation.<br/><br/> The plan currently covers more than 400 000 hectares of coffee farmlands. In 2024, over 1 400 of the plan's field staff and agronomists trained more than 200 000 coffee farmers in 16 countries in regenerative agriculture. These experts are actively assisting farmers with topics, such as soil erosion and runoff, organic matter management and optimised fertilisation.<br/><br/> In this year's progress report, it highlights the work done with two of its partners: the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) and TechnoServe.\u00a0<br/><br/> Coffee production is a business, and farmers need to make informed decisions about topics like coffee varieties, farm investments and inputs. The company partners with The Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) to enhance farmers' business skills.

Unlike conventional implements that disturb the soil, SRT calls for tools that manage crop residues, enable shallow sowing, and promote precision input use. This opens a valuable niche for agri-tech innovators and machinery manufacturers to develop lightweight, multi-functional, and affordable equipment that meets regenerative standards. Indian engineering firms and startups are uniquely positioned to lead this transition and tap into a growing domestic and global market for climate-smart agri-tech. Breeding the FutureSeed companies and public research institutions have an opportunity to breed and promote crop varieties tailored for the SRT system. These include short-duration, drought-resistant, and high-residue crops that synergise with SRT's principles."]}, {"relevance_score": 48, "title": "Protecting nature at scale: Unilever's commitment to regenerative agriculture", "published": "2025-07-07", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Unilever aims to apply regenerative agriculture methods to one million hectares of farmland by 2030.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The company is focusing on crops with the highest impact on the land in its supply chain, including soybeans, rapeseed oil, vegetables, and rice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* Unilever has 23 active projects covering 130,000 hectares by the end of 2024, with plans to increase coverage to 2 million hectares by 2030.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>July 7 -- Unilever PLCissued the following news release:</p><p>Regenerative agriculture can help restore soil health, conserve water, and enhance biodiversity.

Original Press Release:June 11 -- Nestl issued the following news release:Nestl's largest coffee brand, NESCAF, sourced 32% of its coffee from farmers implementing regenerative agriculture practices in 2024. This result exceeds the 20% target NESCAF had set for 2025. According to the latest progress report on the NESCAF Plan 2030 sustainability program, published today , the result also reflects the strong acceptance of regenerative agriculture among coffee farmers. NESCAF supports coffee farmers in transitioning to practices such as optimized fertilization, soil cover, mulching, and composting to improve productivity and reduce costs. These practices also contribute to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from coffee farming. By 2024, participants in the NESCAF Plan achieved a 20% to 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions per kilogram of green coffee [1] .

The challenges posed by climate change were clearly felt in the coffee sector last year. Coffee farmers in various countries suffered from difficult weather conditions. This led to record prices for both Arabica and Robusta coffee and reduced coffee availability globally. These circumstances underscore the urgent need for more resilient coffee supply chains. Axel Touzet, Head of Nestl's Coffee Brands Strategic Business Unit, said: \"Regenerative agriculture is at the heart of the NESCAF Plan and our efforts to build resilience in our coffee supply chain. This third progress report shows that farmers are increasingly aware of the benefits of regenerative practices and are adopting them more frequently. This encourages us to continue working with our partners, suppliers, and farmers in the regions where we source our coffee. As coffee plants age, they naturally become less productive over time and more vulnerable to the effects of climate change, which can further reduce yields. Renovating and rejuvenating coffee farms is critical to maintaining their productivity. In 2024, the NESCAF Plan continued its long-standing coffee plant distribution program, distributing 21 million coffee plants to farmers to support yields and climate adaptation.", "This encourages us to continue working with our partners, suppliers, and farmers in the regions where we source our coffee.

In 2024, the NESCAF Plan continued its long-standing coffee plant distribution program, distributing 21 million coffee plants to farmers to support yields and climate adaptation. The NESCAF Plan currently covers more than 400,000 hectares of coffee cultivation. In 2024, over 1,400 employees and agronomists trained more than 200,000 coffee farmers in 16 countries in regenerative agriculture. These experts actively support farmers on topics such as soil erosion and runoff, organic matter management, and optimized fertilization. In this year's progress report, NESCAF highlights its collaboration with two of its partners: the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) and TechnoServe. Coffee production is a business, and farmers need to make informed decisions about issues such as coffee varieties, farm investments, and inputs. NESCAF is working with the German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) to improve farmers' business skills.

In 2024, two new plants came into operation in Rubbiano (PR): one of 1.5 MWp for the Sauces site and another of 0.3 MWp for the Bakery site. In summer, thanks to self-generated energy from renewable sources, they can already cover the energy requirements for one day a week of production of sauces, pesto and ready-made sauces. Plus, in the last two years, the volume of recycled and recovered water for production site plants in areas subject to water stress has risen by +164%. At the Rubbiano plant alone, the volume of water recovered within the industrial cycle in the last two years is the equivalent of 24 Olympic-size swimming pools.</p><p>INCLUSION AND EQUALITY AT THE HEART OF BARILLA'S COMMITMENT TO PEOPLE</p><p>Almost 9,000 people make up the heart and driving force of the Barilla Group. Since 2020, the Group has achieved gender pay parity and we introduced a new maternity and paternity leave policy in 2023, which guarantees all parents in the Group a minimum of 12 weeks of fully paid leave, regardless of gender, marital status or sexual orientation. In 2024, we also launched a partnership with LEAD Network, a non-profit organisation that supports the advancement of women in the retail and consumer goods sectors across Europe.

Agriculture, a cornerstone of human survival, is also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Regenerative agriculture emerges as a vital response, aiming not just to minimise harm but to actively restore soil health, enhance biodiversity, and build resilience against climate challenges. Research suggests that regenerative farming on 40 per cent of the world\u2019s cropland could save around 600 million tonnes of emissions annually, highlighting its transformative potential for environmental recovery and sustainable food systems.</p><p><br/><br/>At the heart of regenerative agriculture is the recognition that healthy soil is the foundation of sustainable farming. Conventional practices often strip the land of nutrients, leaving it vulnerable to erosion and carbon loss. Regenerative methods, however, focus on rebuilding soil structure and organic matter. No-till farming, for instance, reduces soil disturbance, allowing carbon to remain stored underground while improving water retention and microbial activity.<br/><br/>Planting cover crops is another cornerstone of this approach. These plants, grown between main crops, shield the soil from erosion, add vital nutrients, and enhance fertility. Such practices not only boost agricultural productivity but also play a crucial role in sequestering carbon\u2014capturing it from the atmosphere and locking it in the soil. Research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) suggests that widespread adoption of regenerative practices could offset up to 23 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, making it a key tool in combating climate change.<br/><br/>Biodiversity is an essential component of resilient ecosystems, and regenerative agriculture prioritises its enhancement. Diverse crop rotations break pest and disease cycles, reducing the need for chemical interventions that can harm the environment. Agroforestry\u2014the integration of trees and shrubs into farmland\u2014provides habitats for pollinators and other beneficial species while also acting as windbreaks and improving soil stability.<br/><br/>These practices not only support ecological balance but also safeguard the long-term health of the land. By creating a harmonious relationship between farming and nature, regenerative agriculture ensures that agricultural systems can endure environmental shocks, such as droughts and floods, which are becoming more frequent in a changing climate.<br/><br/>The impact of regenerative agriculture extends beyond environmental benefits, offering significant social and economic advantages. Healthier soils and improved ecosystem services often lead to better crop yields and reduced reliance on expensive inputs like synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. Over time, this can increase farm profitability, providing a much-needed economic boost to rural communities. Studies show that transitioning from conventional agriculture to regenerative methods can increase the return on investment for farmers by 15 to 25 per cent.<br/><br/>Moreover, regenerative practices contribute to food security by improving the resilience of crops to extreme weather conditions. As these methods gain traction, they also create opportunities for new markets centered around sustainably grown products, offering consumers choices that align with environmental values. Notably, the global regenerative agriculture market is projected to reach $16.8 billion by 2027, reflecting growing demand and investment in this field. However, transitioning to regenerative agriculture is not without challenges. Farmers may face initial financial burdens and require technical training to adopt these new practices effectively.<br/><br/>Government policies play a pivotal role in enabling the widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture. Financial incentives, such as subsidies for no-till equipment or payments for carbon sequestration, can ease the economic burden on farmers. Investment in research and development is also crucial to refine techniques and quantify their long-term benefits.<br/><br/>Collaboration between governments, private enterprises, and farming communities is essential for creating a supportive ecosystem. For example, corporations are beginning to integrate regenerative principles into their supply chains, driven by the dual goals of reducing emissions and ensuring sustainable raw materials. These efforts, combined with consumer demand for environmentally friendly products, can help build robust markets for regenerative goods, further incentivising farmers to adopt these practices.<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture represents more than a shift in farming techniques; it is a holistic approach to reshaping the relationship between humans and the land. By prioritising soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and sequestering carbon, it addresses some of the most pressing challenges of our time. While obstacles remain in its widespread implementation, the potential rewards from mitigating climate change to revitalising rural economies are profound.<br/><br/>As the global community seeks solutions to an uncertain future, regenerative agriculture offers a blueprint for sustainable food systems that nourish both people and the planet. By investing in this approach, we have the opportunity to turn agricultural lands into engines of ecological restoration and climate resilience, ensuring a healthier, more sustainable world for generations to come.<br/><br/>The author is \u00a0Founder, Creduce<br/></p>", "publisher": "Business Line", "instances": ["As climate change intensifies and ecosystems face unprecedented strain, the way we produce food is under scrutiny.

By working together, businesses, policymakers, and farmers can create a resilient food system that benefits people, the planet, and the economy.</p><p>Six recommendations to scale regenerative agriculture practices across the EU</p><p>Based on comprehensive studies and various stakeholder interviews in the agri-food value chain, the report presents six key recommendations to enable the transition to regenerative agriculture in collaboration with value chain experts.</p><p>1. Create an EU-wide, outcome-based definition of regenerative agriculture. This definition can serve as the foundation of an EU-wide benchmarking system, aligning with the Strategic Dialogue's recommendations. It would align clear metrics on outcomes such as minimize GHG emissions, increased cultivated biodiversity, and improved soil health (increased soil organic carbon), while setting progressive adoption targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 to align with EU climate goals. More information on aligned KPIs here.</p><p>2. Develop an EU-wide measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) program to standardize outcome measurement methodologies. This EU-wide program would standardize data collection and reporting, focusing on key metrics like carbon sequestration and soil health. It would build on the work done by DG AGRI through the Carbon Removal Certification Framework (CRCF) to ensure robust and credible monitoring, reporting, and verification systems. Investments in cost-effective technologies and the use of existing data, such as satellite imagery, can ensure scalability and accuracy.</p><p>3. Incorporate outcome-based criteria into CAP Pillar I payments. Farmers would receive practice-based payments during the transition and outcome-based rewards tied to measurable environmental improvements, leveraging the existing eco-schemes framework.</p><p>4. Create an Agri-Transition Fund through the European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance the transition. This fund, managed through the European Investment Bank (EIB), would facilitate three important components in a farmer's financing stack: a land bank conditioned on regenerative practices, insurance products to mitigate risks such as extreme weather or reduced yields during transition, and capital loans to help farmers cover the initial investments of transition.</p><p>5. Improve knowledge-sharing programs to accelerate adoption of Regen Ag. Peer-to-peer farmer networks, digital resource hubs, and in-person training sessions would facilitate the exchange of best practices. Integrating Regen Ag into agricultural education and advisory services would ensure long-term capacity building.</p><p>6. Develop a public-private market to link payments to the provision of ecosystem services. This framework would link private investments to environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, water quality improvements, and biodiversity gains. Tax incentives and technical support can encourage private-sector participation while providing financial rewards to farmers.</p><p>Central to these proposals is the Agri-Transition Fund, led by the European Investment Bank, which aims to address the financial risks farmers face during the multi-year transition to regenerative agriculture. This fund offers innovative tools such as a regenerative land bank to support sustainable practices and insurance products to protect farmers from challenges like yield reductions and extreme weather. The Agri-Transition Fund can provide a robust framework to ensure farmers have the financial stability and confidence needed to embrace regenerative practices and secure a sustainable future.</p><p>Aligning on an outcome-based definition for regenerative agriculture and implementing MMRV systems will lay a solid regulatory foundation. Short-term initiatives, including financing and knowledge-sharing programs, will enable immediate progress, while the integration of CAP and the development of ecosystem services marketplaces will drive systemic change. Together, these steps align with the EU's vision for a more sustainable agricultural future.</p><p>Quotes from:</p><p>Stefania Avanzini, Director OP2B:</p><p>\"Collaboration is key to transforming our agricultural systems.

By working together, businesses, policymakers, and farmers can create a resilient food system that benefits people, the planet, and the economy. Six recommendations to scale regenerative agriculture practices across the EUBased on comprehensive studies and various stakeholder interviews in the agri-food value chain, the report presents six key recommendations to enable the transition to regenerative agriculture in collaboration with value chain experts. 1. Create an EU-wide, outcome-based definition of regenerative agriculture. This definition can serve as the foundation of an EU-wide benchmarking system, aligning with the Strategic Dialogue's recommendations. It would align clear metrics on outcomes such as minimize GHG emissions, increased cultivated biodiversity, and improved soil health (increased soil organic carbon), while setting progressive adoption targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 to align with EU climate goals. More information on aligned KPIs here. 2. Develop an EU-wide measurement, monitoring, reporting, and verification (MMRV) program to standardize outcome measurement methodologies.", "Integrating Regen Ag into agricultural education and advisory services would ensure long-term capacity building. 6. Develop a public-private market to link payments to the provision of ecosystem services. This framework would link private investments to environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, water quality improvements, and biodiversity gains. Tax incentives and technical support can encourage private-sector participation while providing financial rewards to farmers. Central to these proposals is the Agri-Transition Fund, led by the European Investment Bank, which aims to address the financial risks farmers face during the multi-year transition to regenerative agriculture. This fund offers innovative tools such as a regenerative land bank to support sustainable practices and insurance products to protect farmers from challenges like yield reductions and extreme weather. The Agri-Transition Fund can provide a robust framework to ensure farmers have the financial stability and confidence needed to embrace regenerative practices and secure a sustainable future. Aligning on an outcome-based definition for regenerative agriculture and implementing MMRV systems will lay a solid regulatory foundation. Short-term initiatives, including financing and knowledge-sharing programs, will enable immediate progress, while the integration of CAP and the development of ecosystem services marketplaces will drive systemic change. Together, these steps align with the EU's vision for a more sustainable agricultural future.", "This framework would link private investments to environmental outcomes such as carbon sequestration, water quality improvements, and biodiversity gains.

How can FMCG companies integrate regenerative agriculture and support smallholder farmers while maintaining cost efficiency and scalability?</emphasis><br/><br/>The FMCG companies can advocate and support smallholder farming operations by training them on improved crop rotation, agroforestry practices, affordable equipment, and access to technology for all sustainability techniques. Farmer cooperatives and contract farming can take forms to provide a stable market economy at scale. Precision agriculture and digital marketplaces will make optimal use of resources to lower costs. Rewards, such as prizes for sustainable food and carbon credit opportunities, will encourage farmers to adopt environmentally friendly practices. Companies can balance cost efficiency and environmental impact if they match their effort to the consumer demand for sustainability.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 2. What role can new-age technology (such as blockchain or AI) play in ensuring transparency, traceability, and consumer trust in food sourcing?</emphasis><br/><br/>New-age technologies such as blockchain and AI are changing the face of the food supply chain through improved transparency, traceability, and consumer trust. Blockchain provides a safe, tamper-proof digital ledger that goes through the processing steps of food items from the farm to the fork. It can thus identify where the contamination or fraud came from and at the same time offer detailed information on a product's farming practices and history of transportation to the consumers. Blockchain further ensures smart contracts that comply with sustainability and ethical sourcing standards.<br/><br/>Similarly, AI plays a pivotal role by using predictive analytics to optimize inventory and ensure waste reduction, guaranteeing efficient supply chain operations. AI-powered tools can improve quality control by detecting defects in raw materials or finished goods, with consistent quality. AI helps brands by aligning their strategic sourcing that evolving ethical and sustainability expectations, which offers deep insights into consumer preferences to build consumer trust.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 3. How can food brands balance the need for ethical labor practices with the complexities of global supply chains and ensure fair wages and working conditions?</emphasis><br/><br/>Brands work within complex global supply chains characterized by multi-tiered networks, diverse geographies, and sometimes conflicting labor laws. Ethical labor practices can be hard to ensure, but building sustainable and responsible businesses relies on them. Brands can find the balance by prioritizing ethical standards, promoting supply chain transparency, obtaining fair wages, leveraging technology, empowering workers, advocating for legal and policy alignment, engaging stakeholders, and reporting progress. Food brands can dive into global supply chains and be a part of robust business models, gaining fair wages and better working conditions for workers in cases where they are effectively integrated into the core operations with partnerships.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 4. What are the key strategies FMCG companies can adopt to reduce the environmental impact of sourcing ingredients like palm oil, soy, and cacao while maintaining sustainability goals?</emphasis><br/><br/>FMCG companies can adopt several strategies to balance environmental impact and sustainability goals:<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Protecting Natural Ecosystems</emphasis><br/><br/>Ensure ingredients are not sourced from a deforested or converted natural ecosystem. Use globally recognized tools to identify and protect high-carbon stock forests, high conservation value areas, intact forest landscapes, peat soils, and ecologically sensitive landscapes.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Sustainable Sourcing Strategies</emphasis><br/><br/>Implement robust certification standards (e.g., RSPO for palm oil), develop traceability systems, and maintain a clear chain of custody from agricultural origins to manufacturing. Regular supplier audits should be conducted, and suppliers must protect ecosystems, implement no-burning policies, and follow best management practices.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Human Rights and Social Responsibility</emphasis><br/><br/>FMCG companies should respect and promote human rights in their supply chains, protect the land rights of indigenous communities, and adhere to Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) principles. Eliminating forced and child labor, ensuring safe and fair working conditions, and empowering smallholder farmers are also essential.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Transparency and Monitoring</emphasis><br/><br/>Conducting risk assessments of sourcing materials, mapping supply chains, and using technology to trace sustainability are necessary steps. FMCG companies should aim for traceability to the farm or plantation level and ensure compliance through independent verification.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. Regenerative and Innovative Approaches</emphasis><br/><br/>Invest in projects that restore degraded landscapes, support regenerative farming practices, and monitor risks with new technologies. Focus on restoring soil health, improving water quality, increasing biodiversity, and enhancing climate resilience.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Collaborative Ecosystem</emphasis><br/><br/>Partnering with multi-stakeholder platforms, NGOs, trade unions, academic institutions, local communities, and governments helps us drive industry-wide sustainable transformation. Companies should support and improve commodity standards and advocate for systemic changes in global supply chains.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Remediation and Accountability</emphasis><br/><br/>Develop grievance mechanisms, address non-compliance, take action against suppliers who fail to meet standards, and continuously update policies to ensure long-term progress toward sustainability goals.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 5. What are the best practices for FMCG companies in reducing food waste throughout the supply chain, from production to retail, while aligning with sustainability goals?</emphasis><br/><br/>FMCG companies can reduce food waste across the supply chain while advancing sustainability goals through strategic interventions. At the production level, smart farming technologies like IoT sensors and AI enable precise resource management, reducing waste and inefficiencies. Companies can also repurpose byproducts for secondary markets or animal feed, minimizing disposal. In the supply chain, advanced demand forecasting powered by AI ensures production aligns with consumer needs, preventing overstocking. Efficient logistics, including cold-chain technologies, reduce spoilage during transportation. At the retail level, practices like dynamic pricing encourage the sale of products nearing expiration, while clear labeling helps consumers make informed decisions and avoid unnecessary waste.<br/><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Q. 6. How are consumer demands for sustainability and ethical sourcing impacting food pricing, and how can brands balance profitability with these growing expectations?</emphasis><br/><br/>The increase in the consumer demand for sustainability and ethical sourcing is altering food pricing and profitability dynamics. Sustainable and ethically sourced products involve higher costs due to environmentally friendly production practices, fair wages, and certifications, leading to premium pricing. Most consumers are willing to pay more for such products, forcing the brands to balance affordability with sustainability. By adopting new technologies like AI, blockchain, and IoT, the process for profitability becomes streamlined and less costly. Another way to justify premium pricing is to communicate the tangible benefits of sustainable practices, such as better health or reduced environmental impact. Finally, scaling up production as demand increases can reduce per-unit costs. Transparent communication about sourcing practices and environment-friendly impact further builds consumer trust.<br/></p>", "publisher": "News on Fast moving consumer goods in India", "instances": ["May 26 --\u00a0In an era where sustainability and ethical sourcing are no longer optional but essential, FMCG companies face increasing pressure to evolve their supply chains.

Regenerative Organic Certified (ROC) is one of the leading standards, adopted by almost 300 certified farms and covering 15.2 million acres. Paul Alvarez from the Regenerative Organic Alliance will give details of the ROC standard, stating its key pillars, adoption, and impact.<br/><br/> Heidi Diestel, fourth generation farmer, will share her experiences in adopting regenerative agriculture practices. Diestel Family Ranch has been rearing sustainable turkeys since 1949. This year, it became the first turkey company to adopt the Regenerative certification. In a separate panel, regenerative agriculture experts will discuss approaches to increase adoption rates and make it mainstream: how can farmers be encouraged to make the transition? What are the obstacles to higher adoption rates?<br/><br/> Supply chains for regenerative organic ingredients. As the number of certified farms grows, the supply of ingredients from regenerative agriculture is increasing. Alex Heilman, co-founder of MAD Markets, will give details on how the company is building distribution infrastructure for such ingredients. MAD Markets is connecting regenerative agriculture farmers with food processors, brands, and retailers. It recently acquired Timelesss Seeds and its processing facilities to serve this purpose.<br/><br/> Organic market update &amp; labels. Organic is the dominant eco-label in the food industry, with American sales of organic products approaching $65 billion. USDA Organic seal is well-established, however new labels are emerging. Linley Dixon, co-director at Real Organic Project, will give details of this new farmer-led grassroots movement, as well as label that represents organic foods soil grown and pasture raised.<br/><br/> Tom Chapman, co-CEO of the Organic Trade Association, will present the latest market data and trends on US organic food industry. He will show how consumer behaviour has changed since the pandemic. What are consumer perceptions of USDA Organic? How does USDA Organic compare with competing labels? What are the knowledge gaps in consumers and what are the future opportunities?<br/><br/> The Real Organic Project, Organic Trade Association, and Regenerative Organic Alliance will comprise a panel to discuss the future direction of organic labelling. As the organic food industry matures, will we see more fragmentation in terms of organic labels? How should the USDA NOP evolve? What developments are on the horizon?<br/><br/> Adopting sustainability schemes. The number of sustainability schemes and eco-labels is increasing in the food industry, making it difficult for some operators to select and adopt schemes / labels. Leading operators will share their experiences with certification schemes at the summit.<br/><br/> Brita Lundberg, fourth-generation farmer and chief storyteller at Lundberg Family Farms, will be speaking about certification of its sustainable rice products. The family farm has adopted Regenerative Organic Certified, Non-GMO Project Verified, USDA Organic and other schemes. A leading natural food retailer will also give some insights into its preferred sustainability schemes.<br/><br/> Lara Burns from SPINS will speak about consumer behaviour towards eco-labelled foods. What do American consumers look for in eco-labels? What are the motives to buy certified food products? What certification schemes are showing the highest growth?<br/><br/> New technologies and sustainable ingredients. Case studies will be given of operators utilising new technologies to create food ingredients with sustainability merits. Lisa Dyson, founder and CEO of Air Protein, will show how the company is making protein flours from air. It is using bacteria cultures to ferment oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide molecules into proteins that can be used by the food industry.<br/><br/> Some operators are using Artificial Intelligence to produce sustainable ingredients. One such company is the start-up Climax Foods which is making plant-based proteins using machine learning frameworks. Oliver Zahn, founder and CEO, will show how AI is helping it make plant-based casein and cheeses. It has already launched vegan blue cheese in foodservice and retail outlets.<br/><br/> The use of new technologies in upcycling and ingredient management will also be discussed. Paul Bradley from TraceGains will show how its enterprise solutions can help food &amp; beverage operators meet their sustainability goals.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Food & Beverages News", "instances": ["December 13 -- The Sustainable Foods Summit will discuss the future direction of regenerative agriculture and sustainability schemes.

Fabien Balaguer, Executive Director of the French Agroforestry Association: \"By choosing to engage alongside the French Agroforestry Association, Nestl France is part of a positive collective dynamic, essential for the future of agriculture. The commitment of companies is fundamental to help us promote agroforestry practices and encourage a transition towards more sustainable and resilient agriculture. For Charles Leonardi, General Manager of Sustainable Development at Nestl France: \"Supporting farmers in their transition to regenerative agriculture is our priority, particularly through agroforestry, which helps restore ecosystems, improve biodiversity and strengthen the resilience of farms. Since 2021, in addition to the Earthworm Foundation's Living Soils program, we have initiated 120 projects to plant nearly 200,000 trees, the equivalent of 180km of hedges in Hauts-de-France. We are continuing this commitment by expanding our support for ever more sustainable agricultural practices and are proud to collaborate with AFAF to support our dairy sector.

At the centre of this discussion is a critical but traditionally neglected element- soil health. </p><p><br/><br/>Healthy soil is not merely about producing more food; it is about producing better food that will feed millions while sustaining farmers\u2019 livelihoods. Over 99.7 per cent of our food comes from the soil. However, soil health degradation worldwide has reduced agricultural productivity, water availability, and the health of forest and pasture ecosystems. This decline has also impacted human nutrition, with around 9.2 per cent of the world\u2019s population, that is around 735 million people were chronically undernourished.<br/><br/>India\u2019s Green Revolution-driven agricultural boom brought prosperity to millions from hunger. But three decades of intensive cultivation, high chemical fertilizer use, and monocropping have taken their toll. Government estimates indicate that almost 30 per cent of India\u2019s soil is degraded, which is close to 146.8 million hectares. Of this, around 29 per cent is lost to the sea, 61 per cent is transferred from one place to another, and 10% is deposited in reservoirs. All of these have resulted in reduced productivity, poor crop quality, and rising vulnerability to floods and droughts.<br/><br/>Nutrients- starved crops are produced by barren soils, which later result in wide-scale malnutrition, especially amongst rural communities. Degradation of soil leads to damaging effects on the economy, environment, food security, and health.<br/><br/>Restoring soil health is not only about preventing land degradation; it also holds the potential to rediscover the nutrient content in food. The overall nutrient value of crops has declined due to the excessive use of chemicals and synthetic fertilisers. Healthy soil, rich in organic matter, has the potential to enhance the nutrient value of various crops. When farmers adopt natural farming methods that promote soil regeneration, the taste of the produce is said to improve. This can be taken as an indication of the difference in nutrient value of the produce increases with soil health improvement.<br/><br/>By adopting sustainable practices such as organic farming, cover cropping, biofertilizers, and crop rotation, farmers can naturally enhance soil fertility.<br/><br/>Regenerative agriculture offers a holistic approach to farming that actively restores soil health while improving farm productivity. It emphasizes the use of natural inputs like biofertilizers and biopesticides, local indigenous seed varieties that are more climate-resilient and nutrient-rich than high-yielding varieties (HYVs), and innovative processing tools. Techniques such as multi-layer cropping allow farmers to grow two or more crops on the same plot simultaneously.<br/><br/>A central goal of regenerative agriculture is to build Soil Organic Carbon (SOC), which is crucial for maintaining soil fertility. This is achieved through composting organic waste like kitchen scraps, crop residues, and livestock manure and applying mulch to protect the soil surface. These practices improve the soil\u2019s texture, enhance its water-holding capacity, and support the growth of beneficial microbes, which contribute to long-term soil productivity.<br/><br/>Another core principle is diversifying crop cycles. Rotating crops or integrating pulses, vegetables, and traditional grains enriches both the soil and the diet. These crops, especially the pulses, return essential nutrients to the land, reduce pest pressure, and break disease cycles. Many farmers are also reviving traditional soil-friendly methods, such as using cow dung, plant-based solutions, and homemade biofertilizers. These natural practices not only reduce dependency on synthetic chemicals but also allow the soil to heal slowly but surely restoring its vitality for future generations.<br/><br/>The connection between soil health and food security is both critical and urgent.

He noted its importance for vital crops such as millets, pulses, and oilseeds, and highlighted its role in helping extension agencies, farmers, and policymakers adopt sustainable farming methods on a larger scale. The compendium introduces five core principles of regenerative agriculture: minimizing soil disturbance, maximizing crop diversity, maintaining soil cover, keeping living roots in the soil year-round, and integrating livestock. These practices are designed to improve soil health, boost carbon sequestration, and enhance resilience to climate change. Speaking at the event, Dr. Stanford Blade, Director General-Interim of ICRISAT, commended Odisha's dedication to sustainability. He emphasized the initiative's potential to uplift farmers' livelihoods, restore ecosystems, and fortify community resilience.

A company purchases those CCs to offset its emissions and proudly announces carbon neutrality. Between these, lies a labyrinth of hope, hypocrisy and opportunity. </p><p><br/><br/>CCs depict a story of environmental accounting, balancing growth with climate vulnerabilities. Like currencies, CCs carry hidden costs and contradictions. <br/><br/>There are two types of carbon markets: mandatory and voluntary. They are about $800 billion and $3 billion, respectively, and expected to reach $1.88 trillion and $24 billion by 2030. One CC represents one tonne of CO\u2082 equivalent reduced, avoided, or removed from the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The Kyoto Protocol (1997) laid the foundation for mandatory carbon markets, where companies are legally expected to limit their GHG emissions and permitted to operate under \u2018cap-and-trade\u2019 system. There is a cap on their emissions but entities can purchase CCs to negate their emissions to the set cap. Voluntary markets evolved later (2000), driven by socially conscious action. <br/><br/>The journey starts with a \u2018Developer\u2019 designing emission reduction projects following acceptable and specific technologies or takes existing projects under her/his wings. The project (reforestation, regenerative-agriculture, renewable-energy, methane-capture etcetera) is then registered with one of the carbon standards (Gold Standard/ VCS/Climate Action Reserve/Plan Vivo). \u2018Independent third-party auditors\u2019 assess, evaluate and monitor emission reductions. Verified emission reductions are converted into CCs. Companies/individuals buy these CCs. They are then \u2018retired\u2019 and taken off markets by \u2018Registries\u2019. The quality of CCs and integrity of the system is monitored by \u2018watch-dogs\u2019. <br/><br/>First, CC trade is a sort of \u2018Faustian bargain\u2019, reducing Earth\u2019s complexity to a spreadsheet. In India, forestry projects use satellite algorithms to predict deforestation rates, while agricultural initiatives extrapolate soil carbon samples, but the margin of error is vast. A Nature article (2024) exposed systemic overestimates in carbon projects. <br/><br/>Second, additionality in carbon markets refers to the principle, that a carbon offset project should result in emission reductions that would not have occurred without the project or the revenue from selling CC (like wind-farms generating millions of CC by displacing coal-fired electricity). But additionality is a hall of mirrors. A report (2024) on world\u2019s largest carbon offset projects found that over 47.7 million carbon credits were problematic, meaning projects are unlikely to deliver real emission reductions, aka greenwashing. <br/><br/>Third, India is the second-largest supplier of carbon offset projects (afforestation, biogas plants). But benefits from these projects often don\u2019t reach communities. A World Rural Forum (2023) study found that only 0.3 per cent of climate change funding reaches communities. A 2025 investigation by the Nature found that half of the forestry projects in India have failed/ discontinued due to lack of community rights and benefit sharing. <br/><br/>Fourth, \u2018permanence\u2019 is not guaranteed if/when forests get burned/removed, or farmers stop regenerative-agriculture practices. We can\u2019t sell certainty in an uncertain world. In 2021, Cyclone Tauktae devastated forests of Gujarat, releasing centuries of stored carbon, erasing CCs sold. Registries usually withhold 20 per cent as buffer, but these safeguards crumble, in climate-amplified disasters. <br/><br/>Environmentalists aver CC is a responsibility and not a commodity to be traded. An afforestation project might have restored 10,000 acres of degraded land. But down the road, a coal-power plant purchases those CC, delaying its own transition to renewables. This duality is the essence of CC. It is a tool that can heal or harm, depending on hands that wield it. <br/><br/>India\u2019s voluntary carbon market is about $500 million and operates with minimal oversight, where almost 90 per cent of the value is lost/consumed in the supply chain. But opportunities exist to set fair norms. Start-ups like C-GEM are endeavouring to provide negotiating platforms to communities. Mitti Labs and Varaha use AI/ML to analyse data, exposing inflated baselines in real time. <br/><br/>Hopefully, the Carbon Credit Trading Scheme (2024), will show its regulatory teeth and enforce integrity. <br/><br/>As India prepares to embrace its net-zero targets, the question should be, what we seek from CCs, should be of transforming them from offsets to instruments of justice, serving communities and markets. <br/><br/>Gupta is Co-Founder C-GEM and Suryakumar is former Deputy Managing Director, NABARD.

PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system. This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year. Building on years of successful collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and PFI, this initiative expands into a larger effort to transform today's agricultural practices for the betterment of farmers, communities, and the environment. Benefits to FarmersParticipating farmers will receive agronomic guidance, incentive payments to help reduce the risk of adopting new practices, and access to technical resources to support their transition to regenerative practices, allowing them to expand their sustainable footprint with support from experienced organizations.

Iowa is the United States' largest producer of corn, contributing to more than 15% of the nation's supply in 20241. Through trusted local organizations - led by Practical Farmers of Iowa (PFI), a nonprofit organization with deep roots in the Midwest farming community - this partnership will provide farmers with the knowledge they need to implement regenerative techniques and help them produce crops more sustainably. PFI will offer farmers tailored advice and recommendations based on their region and planted crops-insights grounded in local realities. This type of collaboration is key to scaling regenerative farming practices that can ultimately support farmers and strengthen the resilience of the global food system. This initiative also supports both companies' ambitious goals: PepsiCo's recently expanded goal to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres globally by 2030, and Cargill's goal to advance regenerative agriculture on 10 million acres of North American farmland by the same year. Building on years of successful collaboration among PepsiCo, Cargill, and PFI, this initiative expands into a larger effort to transform today's agricultural practices for the betterment of farmers, communities, and the environment. Benefits to FarmersParticipating farmers will receive agronomic guidance, incentive payments to help reduce the risk of adopting new practices, and access to technical resources to support their transition to regenerative practices, allowing them to expand their sustainable footprint with support from experienced organizations. PFI will lead implementation with farmers, managing enrollment and overseeing measurement, reporting, and verification to ensure credible, science-based outcomes. These practices are designed to improve soil health, increase resilience to climate impacts, and enhance long-term farm productivity-while connecting farmers to sustainability-focused supply chains.

Regenerative agriculture (RA) improves soil health by promoting biodiversity, carbon sequestration, restoring entire agricultural ecosystems, and thus goes beyond sustainability. Natural farming (NF) is a sub-set of RA and is an Indian expression. Philosophically NF is minimalist in nature \u2014 reaching a stage of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, where natural processes are established. Sustainable agriculture balances environmental responsibility with productivity, encompassing both RA and NF. </p><p><br/><br/>An overarching expression, agroecology, defined by FAO, provides a 13-principles framework to usher in agriculture which balances local ecology with local economy. RA is a widely used expression globally. <br/><br/>The macro and micro picture for agriculture does not look comfortable. Mean surface air temperature in 2024 was 1.54 \u00b0C above the pre-industrial average. A recent study (IPE Global and Esri India), indicates 85 per cent of districts are prone to extreme weather events.

Yet, 57 per cent of the rural households depend on agriculture, indicating its importance and the necessity to make it resilient. Spread of RA through transformative processes is crucial. <br/><br/><br/><br/>Many successful RA farms exist across the country, despite Green Revolution. They have demonstrated resilience to erratic weather patterns. These are promoted by champion farmers, civil society and philanthropies. Each parcel is of a few acres. Exact numbers are not known, as the produce is used for personal consumption, and a little is sold in local markets. These are exemplars, despite their small size, because of their signalling effect. <br/><br/>Of late, \u2018natural shops\u2019 are mushrooming in urban areas, selling trust-based agriculture products with no/less chemicals. For example, Indore based, Kamdar\u2019s Organic Farmers\u2019 Producer Company sells chemical-free staples, under a brand \u2018Satvik\u2019 through 300 local stores. Its gross revenue was \u20b91 crore in FY2024. <br/><br/>Likewise, turnover of Bengaluru-based Sahaja Samrudha Organic Producer\u2019s Company was \u20b918 crore and Anantapur based Dharani Farming and Marketing Cooperative (Timbacktu Collective) was \u20b95.2 crore. <br/><br/>These exemplars should be transitioned to the next level. Politically changing entrenched agriculture practices is not easy. Hence, Indian philanthropies have a big role to play, through coalitions, pooling resources and reprioritization of investments. <br/><br/>Exemplars must be enhanced, in their depth, breadth and coverage, establishing a scientific basis for RA and creating a critical mass for transformation. A ballpark requirement for this programme is \u20b92,500 crore (50 NGOs/4 different locations per NGO/2500 hectares per location/\u20b950,000 per hectare for 5 years). This is a very small investment in relation to \u20b91.2 lakh crore invested by the private philanthropy in FY2023 (India Philanthropy Report: 2024). <br/><br/>Fifty civil society organisations, which have successfully demonstrated RA across geographies, may be invited to submit project proposals. Each project should be comprehensive, designed as per local ecology, requirements, saturating entire landscape, as per RA principles. <br/><br/>The programme must work on all three aspects of agriculture; cost reduction, productivity enhancement and managing markets. Existing community institutions like SHGs/FPOs/cooperatives may be involved. <br/><br/>The writer is former deputy managing director, NABARD.

A quick look at the subtle differences in meaning would help. Organic agriculture avoids synthetic chemicals and GMOs. Regenerative agriculture (RA) improves soil health by promoting biodiversity, carbon sequestration, restoring entire agricultural ecosystems, and thus goes beyond sustainability. Natural farming (NF) is a sub-set of RA and is an Indian expression. Philosophically NF is minimalist in nature \u2014 reaching a stage of \u201cdoing nothing\u201d, where natural processes are established. Sustainable agriculture balances environmental responsibility with productivity, encompassing both RA and NF. An overarching expression, agroecology, defined by FAO, provides a 13-principles framework to usher in agriculture which balances local ecology with local economy.

Many of this waste is incinerated or landfilled, causing concerns due to its increasing environmental impact and the wasting of valuable resources.</p><p>In this pilot, a biochar was produced by carbonizing beverage residues (used green tea leaves) from Suntory Group's manufacturing processes. This was then combined with TOWING's multifunctional microbial groups, such as microbes that accelerate the decomposition of organic fertilizers, to create high-performance biochar.</p><p>In the future, the two companies plan to produce high-performance biochar from other manufacturing byproducts generated within its supply chain, thereby expanding and promoting upcycling.</p><p>2. Using High-performance Biochar in Regenerative Agriculture[*3] to Balance Crop Efficiency Improvements and Agricultural GHG Emissions Reductions</p><p>Agriculture and forestry account for approximately 13%[*4] of global GHG emissions, with chemical fertilizers, which require large amounts of fossil-derived raw materials to produce, being a significant contributor. While the use of organic fertilizers, one of the regenerative agriculture methods, is said to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the use of chemical fertilizers, it faces challenges of low fertilizer efficiency and reduced yields compared to the use of conventional chemical fertilizers.</p><p>The use of high-performance biochar together with organic fertilizers on agricultural land is expected to improve fertilizer efficiency, leading to improved crop quality and yield. Additionally, this approach is anticipated to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions by suppressing the use of chemical fertilizers.<br/><br/>In this pilot program, the two companies plan to study and compare the effects of conventional organic fertilizers with organic fertilizers treated with high-performance biochar at Suntory Group's contract farm where tea plants[*5] are grown. The first harvest has already been completed where results show that crops grown in soil treated with high-performance biochar maintained the same quality while improving the yield compared to the use of conventional organic fertilizers. Based on these outcomes, the two companies will continue to conduct this pilot program to verify the effects of high-performance biochar and the various conditions necessary to improve crop efficiency. The goal is to establish a regenerative agriculture method that can achieve the same yield rate as the conventional farming methods.</p><p>Suntory Group has long supported regenerative agriculture as one way to reduce GHG emissions in the agricultural sector. The group collaborates with suppliers and contract farmers to transition to sustainable farming practices, such as cover cropping[*6], organic fertilization, and no-till farming. Notable projects include barley cultivation in the UK (2022) and sugarcane cultivation in Thailand (2024). Led by Suntory Global Innovation Center in collaboration with TOWING, this pilot program is attracting attention because it has the potential to establish a regenerative agriculture process through improved efficiency in the use of organic fertilizers and to build a new resource recycling model that utilizes unused biomass resources. Suntory Holdings has also invested in TOWING to strengthen their strategic partnership.</p><p>Masaaki Fujiwara, Chief Sustainability Officer of Suntory Holdings, comments, \"Suntory Group aims to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across our entire value chain by 2050, as outlined in our Environmental Vision toward 2050. To achieve this goal, we are continually testing various methods and technologies such as regenerative agriculture, and we see high-performance biochar as a new technology that can contribute to achieving this vision.

Achieve Upcycling by Using Manufacturing Byproducts as Ingredients to Create High-Performance BiocharAgricultural waste, such as food loss and crop residues, is said to account for approximately one-fifth[*2] of Japan's total industrial waste each year.", "Many of this waste is incinerated or landfilled, causing concerns due to its increasing environmental impact and the wasting of valuable resources. In this pilot, a biochar was produced by carbonizing beverage residues (used green tea leaves) from Suntory Group's manufacturing processes. This was then combined with TOWING's multifunctional microbial groups, such as microbes that accelerate the decomposition of organic fertilizers, to create high-performance biochar. In the future, the two companies plan to produce high-performance biochar from other manufacturing byproducts generated within its supply chain, thereby expanding and promoting upcycling. 2. Using High-performance Biochar in Regenerative Agriculture[*3] to Balance Crop Efficiency Improvements and Agricultural GHG Emissions ReductionsAgriculture and forestry account for approximately 13%[*4] of global GHG emissions, with chemical fertilizers, which require large amounts of fossil-derived raw materials to produce, being a significant contributor. While the use of organic fertilizers, one of the regenerative agriculture methods, is said to reduce GHG emissions by decreasing the use of chemical fertilizers, it faces challenges of low fertilizer efficiency and reduced yields compared to the use of conventional chemical fertilizers. The use of high-performance biochar together with organic fertilizers on agricultural land is expected to improve fertilizer efficiency, leading to improved crop quality and yield. Additionally, this approach is anticipated to contribute to the reduction of GHG emissions by suppressing the use of chemical fertilizers. In this pilot program, the two companies plan to study and compare the effects of conventional organic fertilizers with organic fertilizers treated with high-performance biochar at Suntory Group's contract farm where tea plants[*5] are grown. The first harvest has already been completed where results show that crops grown in soil treated with high-performance biochar maintained the same quality while improving the yield compared to the use of conventional organic fertilizers.", "In this pilot, a biochar was produced by carbonizing beverage residues (used green tea leaves) from Suntory Group's manufacturing processes.

The group collaborates with suppliers and contract farmers to transition to sustainable farming practices, such as cover cropping[*6], organic fertilization, and no-till farming. Notable projects include barley cultivation in the UK (2022) and sugarcane cultivation in Thailand (2024). Led by Suntory Global Innovation Center in collaboration with TOWING, this pilot program is attracting attention because it has the potential to establish a regenerative agriculture process through improved efficiency in the use of organic fertilizers and to build a new resource recycling model that utilizes unused biomass resources.

For example, returning to an entirely organic food production process devoid of fertilizers would create healthier food, but also crank up the costs on consumers and strain farmland.</p><p>Earlier in the week, Marshall held a roundtable with Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins and Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to try and bridge that gap.</p><p>Soil health seems to be the common ground, he said. So healthy soil meets healthy food meets healthy people.

The Plant Biostimulant Act would spur usage of organisms that can be placed into the soil and that latch onto the roots of plants that absorb nitrates and more water, he said.</p><p>The bill ties in directly with his passion for regenerative agriculture, which uses fewer fertilizers, water and other status-quo farming techniques to produce healthier foods on more sustainable farmland, which, in turn, would yield a cheaper, more nutritious diet for Americans.</p><p>Its growing more with less, he said.</p><p>Among the various, bipartisan pieces of legislation from both chambers are bills that would push mobile cancer screenings with grant funding, add mental health warnings for kids scrolling through social media, require more transparency in food ingredients, expansion of employer healthcare coverage for chronic diseases, and measures that would allow bleeding edge soil health technology and processes to be considered conservation practices and eligible for Farm Bill funding, among others.</p><p>Most bills need to get 60 votes to pass in the Senate, Marshall noted, and that led to a desire to incorporate as many bipartisan measures in the package as possible. Its also a topic that, in spite of the political polarization in Washington, unites us, rather than divides us.</p><p>Still, with President Donald Trump in office, he sees the chance for the measures to pass as a kind of now or never moment.</p><p>Were seeing a time in our lives where the incidence of cancer, the age of cancer, is growing younger and younger, the age of Alzheimers onset is growing younger and younger, and we believe its an inflammatory reaction to the food that were eating that leads to all that, he said.</p><p>We think heart disease, hypertension, is really an inflammatory reaction to the food were eating and the constantly high sugar levels in our blood system, he continued.

Getting those two in a room together, along with experts on regenerative agriculture, which is a more holistic approach to farming that targets soil health by restoring and enhancing ecosystems, is just a part of his plan.

Its growing more with less, he said. Among the various, bipartisan pieces of legislation from both chambers are bills that would push mobile cancer screenings with grant funding, add mental health warnings for kids scrolling through social media, require more transparency in food ingredients, expansion of employer healthcare coverage for chronic diseases, and measures that would allow bleeding edge soil health technology and processes to be considered conservation practices and eligible for Farm Bill funding, among others. Most bills need to get 60 votes to pass in the Senate, Marshall noted, and that led to a desire to incorporate as many bipartisan measures in the package as possible. Its also a topic that, in spite of the political polarization in Washington, unites us, rather than divides us. Still, with President Donald Trump in office, he sees the chance for the measures to pass as a kind of now or never moment."]}, {"relevance_score": 39, "title": "Bayer Launches ForwardFarm in India to Demonstrate Positive Effects of Regenerative Agriculture", "published": "2024-09-10", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bayer has launched its 'Bayer ForwardFarming' initiative in India, focusing on sustainable rice cultivation and regenerative agriculture to support 150 million smallholder farmers and enhance food security.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bayer has launched its global initiative, 'Bayer ForwardFarming', in India.

Key Highlights of the Partnership:Equipping Farmers with Next-Gen Tools: Thanks to cutting-edge techniques like HDPS and regenerative agriculture, farmers can now meet the growing demand for sustainable, eco-friendly cotton that complies with global goals for sustainable fashion. Restoring Soil Vitality &amp; Fighting Climate Change: Through the use of biochar in farming practices, this collaboration seeks to turn agricultural land into potent carbon sinks, greatly increasing the soil\u2019s ability to sequester carbon and aiding in global climate solutions. Impact on the Economy and Society: The program represents a significant advancement in both environmental protection and economic empowerment. It helps ensure higher revenues for farmers, improving their standard of living and fostering social prosperity in cotton-growing regions by increasing cotton yields and quality. With this partnership, CITI-CDRA and Beetle Regen Solutions are opening a new chapter in Indian cotton farming\u2014one in which economic resiliency and environmental sustainability coexist. Together, they are blazing a trail that will establish Indian cotton as a pioneer in regenerative agriculture and serve as a model for the entire agricultural world.", "Key Highlights of the Partnership:Equipping Farmers with Next-Gen Tools: Thanks to cutting-edge techniques like HDPS and regenerative agriculture, farmers can now meet the growing demand for sustainable, eco-friendly cotton that complies with global goals for sustainable fashion.

Furthermore, the Sakliky story will serve as an example that can be applied to many other staple foods, from bread and pasta to milk and tea. This will not only provide new income opportunities for our farmers but also pave the way for more nutritious food for our people. akmak also stated that this fortification study conducted with lker was carried out in light of the knowledge and experience gained from an international project led by Sabanci University, which ran for 12 years in 15 countries.</p><p>What is hidden hunger?</p><p>According to FAO, hidden hunger is a situation where people do not get enough of the essential vitamins and minerals needed for growth and development because the nutritional quality of the food they consume is inadequate. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/about/meetings/icn2/news-archive/news-detail/en/c/265240/\">https://www.fao.org/about/meetings/icn2/news-archive/news-detail/en/c/265240/</url></p><p>Sakliky Field Enriched Grain Biscuits are only available at Migros.</p><p>Disclaimer: The Above Content is Auto-Translated</p><p>[Category: Packaged Foods &amp; Meats, Agricultural Products, Agriculture, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Yildiz Holding</p>", "publisher": "Contify Retail News", "instances": ["For example, in whole wheat flour produced from fortified wheat at lker 's production facilities, zinc levels were found to increase by 46% compared to unfortified flour.

A SUSTAINABLE APPROACH India ranks second worldwide   in farm outputs, according   to the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). Industry experts feel the sector is contributing to the GDP, employment and food security of the nation, while driving sustainable growth. \"Over the next five years, India's agriculture is expected to be propelled by climate-smart policies and investments in sustainable tech, focusing on adaptation, resource efficiency, and resilient   crops. Technological innovations, like digital farm management   and biotechnology, will boost productivity, build climate resilience, and reduce   environmental impact,\" says Vivek Sen, director, Climate   Policy Initiative (CPI) India. SA is redefining the sector's future. \"It cares about the conservation   of resource bases and focuses   on responsible production   and consumption. The five-fold action plan takes a holistic view of integrating - economic viability, ecological   integrity, adaptability to changing conditions, wider acceptability, and a humane, farmer-centric approach. These ensure food, feed, fuel and fibre for all,\" says Dr Prithwiraj Dey, assistant professor Gr-I, Agricultural   &amp; Food Engineering Department,   IIT Kharagpur. CLASSIC EXAMPLES OF SA \ufffd\u20ac\u2039The best practices in the sector   are aimed at increasing production and saving natural   resources.
