The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

Initial work is set to commence during the second quarter of 2025. The majority of Multiconsult's work under this contract is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2026, with the entire project planned to be completed by 2028.</p><p>Press Release article 8 of 10, 1257 words</p><p>April 05: Multiconsult : Chairman's Statement</p><p>Governed by our drive to enable value-creating projects, Multiconsult has continued the journey with profitable growth through 2024. The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure.

To support the architectural aspects of certain parts of the project, Multiconsult will hire personnel from fully owned subsidiary, LINK Arkitektur AS.</p><p>\"The Northern Lights project plays a key role in the reduction of industrial emissions in Europe and fits well into our strategy of being an enabler of the green transition. Therefore, I am very pleased that Multiconsult has received a contract also for the second phase of this groundbreaking project,\" says Multiconsult's CEO Grethe Bergly.</p><p>For Multiconsult, the scope of work includes detailed design and site supervision of civil works for the substation building, foundations for all equipment, and the outdoor area.

The majority of Multiconsult's work under this contract is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2026, with the entire project planned to be completed by 2028.</p><p>Press Release article 8 of 11, 1257 words </p><p>April 05: Multiconsult : Chairman's Statement</p><p>Governed by our drive to enable value-creating projects, Multiconsult has continued the journey with profitable growth through 2024. The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects. This includes upgrading Norway's transmission grid and projects regarding renewable energy initiatives.</p><p>Think beyond</p><p>Press Release article 9 of 11, Source: WEC, 40 words </p><p>April 02: Multiconsult announces dividend</p><p>Multiconsult today announced a final dividend of NOK10.0 per share.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects. This includes upgrading Norway's transmission grid and projects regarding renewable energy initiatives.</p><p>Think beyond</p><p>Press Release article 8 of 11, Source: WEC, 40 words </p><p>April 02: Multiconsult announces dividend</p><p>Multiconsult today announced a final dividend of NOK10.0 per share.

ESG</p><p>2.1 April 13 2023: Multiconsult : Chairman's Statement</p><p>With the background of a challenging geopolitical environment, including the war in Ukraine, socioeconomic pressures and the increased urgency required to reduce and halt climate change, Multiconsult has succeeded in providing good and future oriented solutions for our clients. Our continuous work to make sure we always understand the client's challenges and provide solutions to meet their expectations means we forge strong relationships with them as well as our partners and thus deliver results for both clients and investors. 2022 saw a change in urgency in the demand for sustainable transitional solutions. In turn this will create increased demand for the competence and solutions Multiconsult can provide. We are well positioned to deliver on our strategic ambition to be the preferred partner towards the green shift and we have increased our climate and renewables related revenue.</p><p>ENABLING EMPLOYEES TO SUCCEED</p><p>Our highly skilled and competent employees are our greatest asset, and the very foundation of our business. Throughout 2022 we have invested in skills development and training for our employees. When measured the employee engagement and satisfaction we have achieved excellent results on net promotor scores among our employees.</p><p>We have also introduced new leadership principles in the organisation, as well as emphasized the power of our culture.</p><p>The annual benchmarking for students and professionals also rated various subsidiaries in the group as highly attractive amongst their peers.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand.

Our continuous work to make sure we always understand the client's challenges and provide solutions to meet their expectations means we forge strong relationships with them as well as our partners and thus deliver results for both clients and investors. 2022 saw a change in urgency in the demand for sustainable transitional solutions.

We are well positioned to deliver on our strategic ambition to be the preferred partner towards the green shift and we have increased our climate and renewables related revenue.</p><p>ENABLING EMPLOYEES TO SUCCEED</p><p>Our highly skilled and competent employees are our greatest asset, and the very foundation of our business. Throughout 2022 we have invested in skills development and training for our employees. When measured the employee engagement and satisfaction we have achieved excellent results on net promotor scores among our employees.</p><p>We have also introduced new leadership principles in the organisation, as well as emphasized the power of our culture.</p><p>The annual benchmarking for students and professionals also rated various subsidiaries in the group as highly attractive amongst their peers.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand.

The majority of Multiconsult's work under this contract is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2026, with the entire project planned to be completed by 2028.</p><p>Press Release article 5 of 12, 1257 words </p><p>April 05: Multiconsult : Chairman's Statement</p><p>Governed by our drive to enable value-creating projects, Multiconsult has continued the journey with profitable growth through 2024. The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player.

In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player.

In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure.

On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects.

environment, including the war in Ukraine, socioeconomic pressures and the increased urgency required to reduce and halt climate change, Multiconsult has succeeded in providing good and future oriented solutions for our clients. Our continuous work to make sure we always understand the client's challenges and provide solutions to meet their expectations means we forge strong relationships with them as well as our partners and thus deliver results for both clients and investors. 2022 saw a change in urgency in the demand for sustainable transitional solutions. In turn this will create increased demand for the competence and solutions Multiconsult can provide. We are well positioned to deliver on our strategic ambition to be the preferred partner towards the green shift and we have increased our climate and renewables related revenue.</p><p>ENABLING EMPLOYEES TO SUCCEED</p><p>Our highly skilled and competent employees are our greatest asset, and the very foundation of our business.

The expertise of our nearly 4000 experts is in high demand and our silled and dedicated employees create solutions that positively impact citizens and society every day. The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy. In November we launched our revised strategy, Thini Beyond, which sets the direction for the coming years for the llulticonsult Group. Our team of experts within engineering and architecture are prepared to play a iey role in deliveringthe solutions required to meet future challenges and opportunities. Our updated strategy builds on i^ulticonsult Group's robust mariet positions both in Norway and internationally. As we strengthen our group identity, we launched a new l^lulticonsult profile by the end of 2024, aligning with a long-term perspective on sustainable and profitable development.</p><p>Working together</p><p>The challenges facing us as a society require players in the value chain that innovate, utilise new technology, and form interdisciplinary partnerships to develop solutions for urban areas, communities and infrastructure that meet future demands. It is great to see how the various subsidiaries within the group have strengthened their collaboration throughout 2024 on these issues and working closely with our clients to find solutions to their challenges. On several hospital and urban development projects, LINK Arkitelctjr and Multiconsult Norge are working in partnership to find the best solutions for clients and society. In Oslo, A-lab and partners are developing a new central district on the OldVeterinary College grounds, with Multiconsult Norge asthe engineering partner. Our architects and engineers are involved in several partnering contracts and believe this is the way fonvard to ensure value creation to all parties involved in a project.</p><p>Continued profitable growth</p><p>From a solid profitable foundation Multiconsult has delivered steady growth and strong profit margins in 2024. In a challenging market, we have grown organically by 10 per cent, and we have maintained our position as an attractive employer. Throughout the year, we have upheld a strong and diversified order backlog throughout the year and won several major contracts leading to an overall order intake of NOK 6.5 billion.</p><p>The architecture businesses have been significantlyimpacted by the slowdown in the building and property market. Despite this, we see a positive development In this segment, a result of hard work across the whole segment from a foundation of strong expertise. By diversifying the project portfolio and strong client relations, our architects are a preferred partner In hospitals, housing and defence projects. This has led to significant Improvements In LINK Arkltektur In Denmark and steady performance In Sweden and Norway.</p><p>Through acquisitions, we have strengthened both capabilities and market position In the past year. Following the acquisition of Petter J. Rasmussen AS we are positioned In a thrlvlngarea southwest in Norway, supportingour clients with both architecture and engineering services. SItepartner AS enhances our position in the execution phase of projects with Its construction and project management consultants in the Norwegian market. In Sweden, integrating specialist expertise witliin water, stormwater, and wastewater from VA-ResursAB into Iterio AB is a Icey step towards strengthening our position in tliis expanding market.</p><p>Organisation prepared for the future</p><p>At the core of our vision and culture is the drive to create an environment where competence is nurtured and thrives. It is our employees - their efforts, inspiration and engagement -that are the driving force in the group. Investing in our employees is vital to maintaining our competitive edge.</p><p>Great leadership is central to developing culture and skills, and participants from across our subsidiaries have completed ourtop management program Expand Your Leadership. This provides a strong foundation for the group's leadership capabilities going forward.</p><p>investing in technology, partlcularLy Artificial Intelligence (Al) has been centralthroughout 2024. We are participating in groundbreaking developments in several projects, and in combination with developing new digital products, this gives us a great opportunity to remain at the forefront of skills development while enabling more efficient and sustainable processes across the group.</p><p>As sustainability reporting becomes Increasingly Important, we also need to train and prepare our leaders for the reporting requirements we will face going forward. During 2024, we conducted training for all top managers In the group.</p><p>in 2023 we introduced an extended employee ownership programme, and this year we once more experience a great interest in investing in Multiconsult. With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand.

The demand related to energy transition remained strong and the request for solutions concerning climate adaptation and nature preservation is on the increase.</p><p>Since launchingour strategy in 2021, significant changes in our surroundings related to geopolitics, climate changes, changes in supply chains and cost of materials necessitated a revision of the current strategy.

With 44 per cent participation in this year's programme and with 85 per cent of employees holding shares in the company, co-ownership represents a strong drivingforce as a substantial proportion of our employees hold a stake in the results created by the group.</p><p>An element of the revised strategy, T7)ink Beyond, is about our ability to keep a finger on the pulse, this also applies to understanding how our employees are doing. Through regular surveys, it is rewarding to see how employee engagement remains at a high level, a testimony that our employees thrive In their workplace.</p><p>Through 2024, we have maintained a top five position as attractive employer both for engineering students and experienced professionals, this strong position makes us well positioned for continued recruitment In the coming years.</p><p>Learning together</p><p>Multiconsult has an ambition to shape the industry as an integrating player. In addition to our impact in projects across the group, we participate in and arrange a number of events and meetings. In October we gathered almost 200 stakeholders in Oslo to share experiences on howto succeed in transformation of existing buildings. During 2024, we have also held several seminars and events on topics such as EU taxonomy, urban development, the reuse of construction materials, renewable energy, architecture and many othertopics, promoting both ourcompetence and ouremployees.</p><p>As a partner in Construction City Cluster In Oslo, we played a pivotal role in launching a talent development programme alongside other companies in the construction industry. The programme fosters collaboration and skill development by allowing project managers and engineers to work across different organisations in the value chain. This approach is particularly relevant for talent development, as it provides participants with valuable insights and experiences that traditional courses cannot offer. By bridging the gap between different professionalenvlronments and industries, the programme aims to enhance competitiveness and lay the foundation for future collaboration.</p><p>Investing In technology, particularly Al, has been central through 2024, and through several initiatives we are exploring Al and digital solutions. One of these initiatives includea framework agreement with the Nonwegian Hospital Construction Agency for Al-driven documentation in hospital projects. In a partnership with Anker DB, we are enhancing data quality In construction.</p><p>Increased demand in key sectors</p><p>Throughout 2024, the impacts of climate change have affected society and infrastructure. Ourskilled employees contribute daily to climate adaptation solutions, securing existing structures and providing robust future solutions.</p><p>The demand for nature, climate, and sustainable solutions increased significantly. Preservation and restoration of nature will be important topics in 2025. We supportourclients In addressing these challenges and have delivered on several projects regarding restoration of nature and climate mitigation measures.</p><p>The enei^, industrial, and defence sectors have been major drivers of new projects In 2024, reflecting a growing demand. Our role in enet^transmisslon Infrastructure Isvitalfor Industrial development, and we have reinforced our position as a leader In the energy transition through numerous projects. This includes upgrading Norway's transmission grid and projects regarding renewable energy initiatives.</p><p>Think beyond</p><p>Press Release article 6 of 13, Source: WEC, 40 words </p><p>April 02: Multiconsult announces dividend</p><p>Multiconsult today announced a final dividend of NOK10.0 per share.

The project involves a three-stage process, including component audits, climate adaptation, and installation of modern onboard systems. Four locomotives will receive ATC (Automatic Train Control), while the other four will be equipped with ETCS (European Train Control System). All units will feature radio control capabilities. Railcare is overseeing the entire process, from design and integration to managing approval with the European Railway Authority (ERA), ensuring compliance with operational standards in Sweden and Norway.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESMNOR-EE4X46CU</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESMNOR2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DH7-4N51-F111-G1CS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">335376</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"117\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 M-Brain All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M-Brain Norway News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57871\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 26, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other (Periodical)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Abstract</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.company\"><classificationItem><className>GRENLAND RAIL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>RAILCARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Sweden</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Norway</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.industry\"><classificationItem><className>Engineering, Railway Rolling Stock, Trains, Locomotives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rail Transport, Railways</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.organization\"><classificationItem><className>OBB</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>EU, Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Other Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Contracts Awarded</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Machinery Investment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D330</classCode><className>RAIL TRAFFIC CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CA1V</classCode><className>TRAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DN6K</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC326</classCode><className>SWEDEN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC323</classCode><className>NORWAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC346</classCode><className>AUSTRIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
