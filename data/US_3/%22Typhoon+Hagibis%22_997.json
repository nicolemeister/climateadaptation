Japan is certainly not shielded from it, although the bull/ bear debate on Japan has been going on since well before the coronavirus was reported. A weaker-than-expected GDP reading for the fourth quarter had many investors leaning bearish on the Japanese market, but it seems the tide is starting to turn. </p><p>So is now the time for the bulls or the bears to come out in Japan?

Q4 2019 hedge fund letters, conferences and more[2]Bulls / bears on Japan: coronavirus impactsThe biggest factor in the bulls/ bears debate on Japan right now is the coronavirus[3]. In a report dated Feb. 17, Nomura analyst Takashi Miwa set out three scenarios for the impact the outbreak will have on nations around the world, including Japan. His base case assumes that major Chinese cities remain locked down until the end of February. In this scenario, he estimates that Japan's annual real GDP will shrink 0.5%. That's 0.7 percentage points below his previous forecast and includes both the coronavirus impact and the weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter GDP number. His base case assumes a decline of 42 percentage points in inbound tourist arrivals and tourist spending. It also assumes a drop of 10 percentage points in exports to China during the first quarter. He assumes a similar decline in corporate capital expenditures, although not quite as much as exports. He also predicts a \"slightly negative impact\" on domestic private consumption. This scenario assumes a decline of 1 percentage point in overall real GDP for the first quarter. It also assumes a rebound in the second and third quarters, although not enough to recover the demand that was lost in the first quarter. Miwa doesn't expect Japan's central bank to offer any kind of policy response in his base case. He notes that the Bank of Japan is \"running low on additional policy instruments\" to address the GDP slowdown. Additionally, the response of the yen versus the U.S. dollar to the coronavirus news has not been significant, so there is some flexibility for the central bank to address appreciation in the yen.Behind the real GDP decline in Q4Earlier this week, it was reported that Japan's GDP plunged 1.6% quarter over quarter, which was worse than the Bloomberg consensus of a 1% decline. Since growth in the third quarter was revised down from 0.4% to 0.1% quarter over quarter, output declined 0.4% year over year in the fourth quarter. Capital Economics economist Marcel Thieliant said in a report dated Feb. 17 that private consumption plunged 2.9% quarter over quarter. The government froze the tax rate on food at 8%, which did help. Spending on services was better, but spending on durable goods plunged 12.8% quarter over quarter. He expects consumer spending to bounce back in the first quarter unless consumer confidence takes a significant hit from the coronavirus outbreak. In a separate report, Thieliant and fellow Capital Economics economist Tom Learmouth said the two main causes of the sharp decline in manufacturing output for the fourth quarter were the sales tax increase in October and Typhoon Hagibis. They pointed out that both Japan and Germany saw their industrial production fall in step with each other. This is significant as the two nations both depend heavily on the auto industry for their manufacturing output. Since both nations were affected, they argue that external factors contributed to the decline in manufacturing output.Bulls and bears on Japan: bondsAccording to Thieliant and Learmouth, yields on 10-year Japanese government bonds have been hovering close to the midpoint of the Bank of Japan's \"around zero\" target this year. Gold priced and Japanese government bond yields have diverged in recent months. However, while demand for gold has increased due to the coronavirus outbreak, safe-haven demand for Japanese bonds has been lower. The spread between U.S. Treasuries and Japanese government bonds has declined in the last month. However, the yen has not strengthened against the U.S. dollar. The Capital Economics team also noted that equity markets have been holding up fairly well despite the coronavirus outbreak.Bulls and bears on Japan: equitiesThe Nikkei has underperformed U.S. equities in the last two months despite the fact that the yen hasn't strengthened against the dollar. Thieliant and Learmouth say that was because Japanese corporate earnings have been weak. However, they believe Japanese equities started the year with attractive valuations compared to U.S. equities. They predict that the Nikkei 225 will rise to 26,000 by the end of 2021. Investors are starting to notice the attractive valuations in Japanese equities[4]. Nomura analyst Naka Matsuzawa said weekly flow data revealed that foreign investors were \"major net buyers\" of Japanese equities the week of Feb. 3. They bought 791.7 billion worth of Japanese equities in what was the first week of net buying in six weeks. Foreign investors essentially replaced some of the 1.7 trillion worth of Japanese equities they had sold in the five weeks before. Most of the buying was futures, and he believes it was due to the unwinding of excessive hedging.

Sunday's Pool B match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi was also canceled hours before it was due to take place.</p><p/><p>A pivotal Pool A match between Japan and Scotland did go ahead with the host nation going on to secure a place in the quarterfinals. Formula One events scheduled for Sunday also went ahead as planned.</p><p>While authorities made it clear that the decision to cancel games was necessary to ensure the safety of players and fans, many were critical of the tournament's inability to reschedule games and apparent unpreparedness for the extreme weather -- despite the World Cup being held during typhoon season.</p><p>In canceled games, two points are awarded to each team in line with tournament rules.

It is unclear exactly when it was first coined but what is indisputable is that the term gained popularity in the late 1980s and 1990s as the men's teams became the preeminent forces in the Five Nations Championship.</p><p>Ahead of the Five Nations match between the teams at Twickenham in March 1997, Chris Hewett wrote in the Independent: \"Each individual [championship] encounter generates and thrives within its own unique atmosphere and Le Crunch, as this particular match always seems to be labelled these days, is way out there on its own.\"</p><p>When was the first match?</p><p>The first test match between the two men's teams was played in Paris on 22 March, 1906. England won that contest 35-8 and followed that up with a 41-13 victory in Richmond on 5 January, 1907, the first time the two teams had played each other on English soil.</p><p>England's women played France for the first time in the semi-final of the inaugural women's Rugby World Cup, at Cardiff Arms Park on 12 April, 1991. As in the first men's meeting 85 years earlier it was England who won, 13-0, to book their place in the final. By that time, a Great Britain women's team had already faced France on four occasions, beginning on 19 April, 1986 in Richmond, when the French won 14-8.</p><p>Where is it played?</p><p>Parc des Princes was the venue for the first men's match in 1906 and from 1974 until 1996, France's home matches were all held at the stadium. Since 1998, the Stade de France built for the FIFA World Cup that year has hosted Les Bleus' home matches. Between 1908-72 another stadium in Paris, Stade Colombes, hosted France's men. Various club grounds have played host to matches between France and England's women's teams. In 2020, 14,000 spectators watched England beat their rivals 19-13 at Stade du Hameau in Pau in February, while Stade des Alpes in Grenoble hosted the teams nine months later.</p><p>France's first two visits to England were hosted at Richmond's Athletic Ground and Welford Road in Leicester respectively. Since 1911, Twickenham has been the venue for England's home matches. Like their French counterparts, England's women have travelled around the country. On 16 November, 2019 some 9,699 fans witnessed the team's dramatic 17-15 victory at Sandy Park in Exeter.</p><p>Do the teams play for a trophy?</p><p>No, neither the men's nor the women's teams play for a specific piece of silverware, such as the Calcutta Cup, when they face each other.</p><p>Who wins it?</p><p>Since their first match in Paris in 1906, France and England's men's teams have met 107 times. England have won 59 tests to France's 41, while there have been seven draws. The biggest margin of victory enjoyed by England was 37-0 in 1911 the first match at Twickenham while they amassed 55 points at the famous stadium in beating Les Bleus 55-35 in 2015. France have twice beaten England by 25 points 37-12 at Colombes in 1972 and 31-6 at Stade de France in 2006. The French have never scored more than 37 points against the English.</p><p>Of the 47 women's tests between the two countries, England have won 33 and France 14. The highest scoring match came at Castle Park in Doncaster during the 2019 Six Nations, with hosts England winning 41-26. England's biggest win was 57-0 on 15 February, 2003. The biggest margin of victory enjoyed by France was 19-0, which came on 21 April, 1999.</p><p>Who has played in Le Crunch the most times?</p><p>No male player has represented England on more occasions than Jason Leonard, so it should come as little surprise that the World Rugby Hall of Fame inductee has also played in 'Le Crunch' the most times. His 18 tests against France came between 1991-2003 and comprised 12 wins and six defeats. However, four of Leonard's appearances came as a replacement meaning his former team-mate Rory Underwood holds the English record for number of starts. All 15 of Underwood's appearances against France which included eight wins, six defeats and one draw came as a starter.</p><p>Frenchman Fabien Pelous also made 15 starts in 'Le Crunch' matches. In total, he played 17 times against England between 1996-2007, and finished on the winning side on 10 occasions, losing the other seven. Legendary winger-cum-centre Philippe Sella also represented Les Bleus 15 times against England. Sella won only six of those matches between 1983-95 however, losing eight and playing out one draw. Both Pelous and Sella have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame.</p><p>Who has scored the most tries?</p><p>Both Sella and Michel Crauste scored four test tries against England more than any other Frenchman. Crauste's tries, which were worth three points each, came in nine matches between 1958-66. England's leading try-scorer in the fixture is Daniel Lambert, who touched down eight times in just three matches between 1907-11. The winger also kicked five conversions and two penalties. Current England speedster, Jonny May, might well overtake Lambert's mark. The winger has scored seven tries in eight tests against France since 2014.</p><p>Who has scored the most points?</p><p>World Rugby Hall of Fame inductee Jonny Wilkinson is the fixture's highest points scorer. Wilkinson scored 161 points in 14 matches against Les Bleus, and his tally is more than double that of the highest Frenchman, Dimitri Yachvili, who notched 80 points. Current England captain Owen Farrell has amassed 106 points in just 10 matches against the French.</p><p>Has anyone ever been sent off?</p><p>Only two players have ever been shown a red card during a men's England v France fixture and both came in the same match. England travelled to the Parc des Princes on 15 February, 1992 hoping to take a stride towards a second successive Five Nations grand slam. They did so, but only after French front-row forwards Gregoire Lascube and Vincent Moscato had been given their marching orders, the former for a stamp on Martin Bayfield and latter for a head-butt on Jeff Probyn. Both players were subsequently banned for 28 weeks and neither played for France again.</p><p>Has Le Crunch taken place at Rugby World Cup?</p><p>Yes. The pair's first Rugby World Cup meeting came at the inaugural women's Rugby World Cup when England beat France 13-0 to reach the final. Six months later, the men's teams played out an ill-tempered RWC 1991 quarter-final that eventual finalists England won 19-10. The men met again in the RWC 1995 bronze final, which France won 19-9, and the RWC 2003 semi-final, in which England triumphed 24-7. It was the English who again emerged victorious when the teams met in the last four at RWC 2007 before France exacted their revenge in the quarter-finals of RWC 2011. The teams were also drawn to play in Pool C at RWC 2019 but their match was cancelled due to the impact of Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>Following their first meeting in Cardiff in 1991, England's women beat France in Galashiels three years later to book their place in the final of RWC 1994. The teams met again in the pool stage of RWC 2006, when England won 27-8, and the RWC 2017 semi-finals, in which the English triumphed 20-3. The teams will meet each other again at New Zealand 2021, having been drawn together in Pool C. France's women have never beaten England at a Rugby World Cup.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1124320957</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:626H-DXY1-JCBF-S4KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1355\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"03\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>March 12, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRMK</classCode><className>MEN'S SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A3NR</classCode><className>SOCCER TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRKM</classCode><className>WOMEN'S SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001587</classCode><className>SOCCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DFRX</classCode><className>FIFA WORLD CUP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001851</classCode><className>WOMEN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX115</classCode><className>PARIS, FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>GX351</classCode><className>CARDIFF, WALES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS0008X1X</classCode><className>ILE-DE-FRANCE, FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And for good reason. Damage from climate-related disasters was in the billions of dollars in 2019 alone. California wildfires caused $25 billion in property damage, while Typhoon Hagibis in Japan cost an estimated $15 billion. </p><p>Other extreme weather events, including rampant brush fires in Australia, widespread droughts in East Africa and severe flooding in South Asia, have had devastating consequences.Insurers seeking to underwrite weather-related risks face growing challenges. While the availability of insurance can help mitigate some of the impacts of climatic shifts, insurers stand to lose billions of dollars from catastrophic weather events. As a result, some insurers have had to significantly increase premiums in particularly risk-prone areas, while others have found it difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 to economically write or renew coverage.Already, some state regulators have taken steps to limit insurers' ability to decline these types of risks. For example, in response to the Sandalwood and Hillside wildfires, the California Insurance Commissioner issued a mandatory, one-year moratorium prohibiting insurance companies from declining to renew policies issued to residents in wildfire disaster areas. Under the prior regulation, carriers were prohibited from terminating policies for homeowners who sustained a total loss in a wildfire; the moratorium expanded that rule to include homeowners living adjacent to wildfire emergency areas who had not been directly impacted by the fires.The stated purpose of the moratorium was to allow time for the state and insurance carriers to work on lasting solutions that would aid both in reducing wildfire risk and stabilizing the insurance market. The decision came amid growing evidence that homeowners insurance had become increasingly difficult for certain Californians to obtain from traditional carriers. By necessity, those carriers that did offer insurance to homeowners living in wildfire areas had to charge higher premiums. The moratorium, then, was designed to provide homeowners with affordable insurance options until the devastation caused by wildfires subsides.California was the first state to impose such requirements. But regulators in other at-risk states may follow suit. That could force insurers to take on significant additional risks arising out of climate-related events, such as flood and drought. To address these concerns, traditional carriers and start-ups have begun to develop new technologies (InsurTech) that are tailored to provide innovative solutions to the unique risks associated with climate change.One such start-up is Jupiter Intelligence (Jupiter). Founded in 2017, Jupiter provides asset-level, data-driven risk analyses designed to predict the likelihood of extreme weather events. The platform uses a program that continuously refreshes satellite and sensor data. Jupiter integrates probabilistic climate prediction with comprehensive risk analyses to project the likelihood of and risks associated with flood, fire, heat, drought, cold, wind and hail events.Their customers include insurers and risk managers, who utilize Jupiter's services to assess risks associated with extreme weather, sea-level rise, storm intensification, and increasing temperatures over time. Some major carriers, like QBE, one of the world's largest property and casualty insurers, have begun working with Jupiter to assess climate risk. According to David McMillan, Group Chief Operations Officer at QBE, 'Jupiter and QBE are collaborating to improve underwriting and pricing processes and to offer climate risk adaptation expertise to our customers.'Another company providing similar services is Kin Insurance (Kin). Kin's goal is to update traditional underwriting models in order to provide customized coverage for homeowners living in coastal areas. Founded in 2016, Kin began as a tech-driven home insurance provider in Florida, offering products tailored to the needs of customers in a region known for severe weather events. Kin functions by leveraging thousands of publicly-available data points to recommend appropriate coverage to homeowners.In August 2019, Kin announced that it had raised $47 million in funding to launch Kin Insurance Network. It has used this funding to become a licensed homeowners insurance carrier in Florida.Like Kin, NYC-based WorldCover was created in response to climate-related disasters. It works to provide drought insurance to farmers in Africa. When first launched, WorldCover was available only in Ghana and covered only one crop: maize. Since then, the company has expanded to multiple markets in East and West Africa, covering four categories of crops: cereals, legumes, root vegetables and perennials. WorldCover uses a combination of satellite imagery and on-the-ground sensors to understand local weather patterns in order to create insurance options for farmers facing some of the world's worst droughts. The company uses its satellites to monitor rainfall patterns and trigger payouts immediately.Companies outside of the United States also specialize in climate risks. MeteoProtect is a French-based global insurance and reinsurance broker dedicated exclusively to weather risk management. MeteoProtect issues parametric policies, which pay out when a pre-agreed event \u2014 such as a hurricane or tornado of a specific intensity \u2014 occurs.The company uses climatology or meteorology to measure the 'climate resilience' of businesses with a solution it calls 'Weather Neutral.' Using this technology, MeteoProtect is able to offer insurers real-time exposure assessment and contract pricing. MeteoProtect uses its data to integrate climate risks into mainstream insurance portfolios, which allows insurers to balance their overall exposure to climate variability and transfer undesired risks through weather derivatives. In April 2020, Cooper Gay France, the European brokerage and wholesale managing general agency, acquired MeteoProtect's brand and technology.Traditional carriers are also investing in new technologies to address climate-related risks. Allianz, an industry leader, offers customized policies to assist customers in managing weather extremes such as sea level rise, rainfall, temperature fluctuation and wind surges. Swiss Re recently launched FLOW, an index-based product designed to protect companies in Europe from the financial impact of high or low river water levels. Unlike traditional insurance coverages, which typically require loss investigations, FLOW provides fixed pay-out amounts based on a defined index. For example, when water flows drop below an agreed-upon level, a payment is automatically triggered.While the rise of InsurTech is necessary and beneficial, it is also likely to have regulatory implications. For example, anti-rebating laws generally prohibit insurers from offering policyholders anything of value, apart from insurance. These laws present challenges for InsurTech companies that seek to market telematics devices that monitor a user's personal data. In response, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners has moved to amend its Model Unfair Trade Practices Act, with the goal of rewriting anti-rebating prohibitions.Some InsurTech products also offer virtual agent services. This may present licensing issues, as many states require professionals who sell, solicit, or negotiate insurance to obtain an insurance producer's license specific to that state. The use of virtual agents also raises potential claims handling and trade practices act considerations.That said, efforts are underway to free InsurTech's advancement from some of the restrictions typically applied to insurance industry innovations. For example, in March 2019 the Kentucky legislature enacted House Bill 386, which established the first InsurTech 'sandbox' in the country. The law establishes a two-part regulatory safe harbor, or sandbox, that permits insurers to submit technologies for participation in an initial beta test and, if approved, an extended period of relief from regulation. Administered by the Kentucky Department of Insurance, the sandbox is intended to provide innovators with a safe space to test and launch insurance-related technologies not contemplated by the Insurance Code.While Kentucky's approach suggests that states can see the benefits of InsurTech to insurers and policyholders, traditional carriers and start-up companies must remain aware of existing regulations and other bureaucratic impediments to the introduction of new technologies. Nevertheless, investment, development and implementation of InsurTech products will be crucial as the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters looks to be on the rise. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-JSUP105411160200666067125876100117</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JSUP-5263</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:610V-37X1-F03R-N081-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484257</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1487\"/><timeReceived>5:51 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>JD Supra</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 6, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>Antitrust &amp;

Our fourth quarter results also included $18.6\u00a0million attributable to catastrophe losses and the ongoing impacts of COVID-19, for a total impact of 10.2 percentage points on the combined ratio,\" commented Dan Malloy, Chief Executive Officer. \"Our previously announced merger with Sirius Group is expected to close on February 26 and we are looking forward to welcoming our new colleagues.\"</p><p>Sid Sankaran, Chairman of the Company commented, \"While we are not satisfied with the underwriting results in 2020, with the exceptional talent, global footprint and robust balance sheet of the combined company, we will have a strong base for building an innovative, disciplined and sustainable business. We are aiming to enhance our existing relationships and improve the economics of our key lines of business, while looking at ways that we can grow intelligently and leverage technology to improve how we manage risk, use data and develop new strategic opportunities.\"</p><p>Additional Information on Financial Results</p><p>The following table shows certain key financial metrics for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written</p><p>Gross premiums written increased by $31.4 million, or 23.4%, to $165.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 from $134.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to $45.5 million of new casualty premium written in the period, including $19.0 million from Arcadian.</p><p>Gross premiums written decreased by $43.8 million, or 6.9%, to $588.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 from $631.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in gross premiums written was primarily due to certain contracts that we did not renew, including certain contracts which no longer fit our underwriting criteria as a result of our shift in underwriting strategy. This decrease was partially offset by new contracts bound in the current year.</p><p>Net underwriting results</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $7.0\u00a0million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 3.8 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Delta and Hurricane Zeta, compared to $16.3\u00a0million in the three months ended December 31, 2019, or 8.2 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $36.6\u00a0million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 6.0 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to Hurricane Laura and other 2020 catastrophes, compared to $29.0\u00a0million in the year ended December 31, 2019, or 4.1 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and Typhoon Hagibis.</p><p>The COVID-19 outbreak is causing unprecedented social disruption, global economic volatility, reduced liquidity of capital markets and intervention by various governments around the world.\u00a0 For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recognized net losses of $11.6 million and $46.7 million, respectively, net of additional premiums, or 6.4 and 7.6 percentage points, respectively, on the combined ratio, relating to COVID-19. These losses were driven primarily by event cancellation, property business interruption, and certain casualty and multi-line quota share contracts.</p><p>The economic impact of the ongoing pandemic will continue to create uncertainty around the ultimate scope of claims and potential for additional insurance losses. Our estimate is based on currently available information provided by cedents. These estimates include losses only related to our estimate of claims incurred as of December 31, 2020.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an increase in net underwriting loss of $37.2 million and $34.6 million, respectively, related to net adverse development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs. The adverse underwriting loss development is a result of accumulated loss experience and cedent reserving increases, indicating that underlying casualty loss trends are higher than initial pricing and reserving, consistent with the industry impact of social inflation. In addition, the current elevated level of uncertainty makes historical data less applicable for future projections, and has contributed to an increase in the estimate of ultimate losses on certain accounts.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a net $1.1\u00a0million and $5.4\u00a0million improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to net favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p><p>Investments</p><p>The following is a summary of our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment return for our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment income for our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment return by investment strategy on total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities. Activist positions also performed strongly, helping offset losses earlier in the year in this category. The credit strategy contributed gains from both the corporate credit and structured credit portfolios. In the other strategy, gains were driven by private investments.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net investment results were primarily attributable to long event/fundamental equities, in particular a renewed focus on growth and technology positions. Short equity investments and hedges partially offset overall gains for the equity strategy. Investments in investment grade corporate credit and residential mortgage backed securities contributed strong performance in the credit strategy. The other strategy contributed modestly to net gains for the year due to private investments.</p><p>Sirius Merger</p><p>On August 6, 2020, Third Point Re, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \"Merger Agreement\"), by and among the Company, Sirius International Insurance Group, Ltd.

Such measures, including basic and diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, are referred to as non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Management believes these measures allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying business. These measures are used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in the attached financial information in accordance with Regulation G.</p><p>About Third Point Re</p><p>Third Point Re is a Bermuda-headquartered holding Company listed on the New York Stock Exchange (TPRE). The Company underwrites Specialty, Property and Casualty business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Third Point Reinsurance Company Ltd. and Third Point Reinsurance (USA) Ltd., which both have 'A-' (Excellent) financial strength ratings from AM Best.

Coleman - Chief Financial Officer<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investorrelations@thirdpointre.bm\">investorrelations@thirdpointre.bm</email><br/>+1 441-542-3333</p><p>THIRD POINT REINSURANCE LTD.NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS &amp; KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS</p><p>Non-GAAP Measures</p><p>Basic Book Value per Share and Diluted Book Value per Share</p><p>Basic book value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures and there are no comparable GAAP measures. Basic book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding, excluding the total number of unvested restricted shares, at period end. Diluted book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, we assume that proceeds received from in-the-money options and/or warrants exercised are used to repurchase common shares in the market. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Change in basic book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in basic book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period book value per share. Change in diluted book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in diluted book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows our management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings.\u00a0 In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.</p><p>Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity Attributable to Third Point Re Common Shareholders</p><p>Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is calculated by dividing net income available to Third Point Re common shareholders by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders. We believe that return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is an important measure because it assists our management and investors in evaluating the Company's profitability.</p><p>Key Performance Indicator</p><p>Net Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC</p><p>Net investment return represents the return on our net investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on net investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our net investment assets managed by Third Point LLC.\u00a0The net investment return reflects the combined results of our investments in TP Fund, collateral assets and certain other investment assets managed by Third Point LLC. Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, our investment manager.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY88258&amp;sd=2021-02-23\"/> View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-announces-fourth-quarter-2020-earnings-results-301233956.html</p><p>SOURCE Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY88258&amp;Transmission_Id=202102231610PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY88258&amp;DateId=20210223\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-NY8825820210223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:622P-B6N1-JB72-10P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3366\"/><timeReceived>4:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 23, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Without waiting for a reply, she clasps her hands together, closes her eyes and sends up a silent prayer. Seconds later, the sky clears.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the new animated movie \"Weathering with You,\" we see a Tokyo where rain has poured over city streets for months. The fate of the city, and whether or not the rain will let up, lies in the hands of a supernatural human and her friends.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This fantastical scenario is the climate-conscious backdrop to director Makoto Shinkai's newest film, which debuted in U.S. theaters on Jan. 17. The movie grossed over $5 million during its opening weekend, according to Forbes Magazine.</p><p>Shinkai, who has expressed his desire to depict life truthfully on screen, began making short films in 1999. He gained international recognition when \"Your Name\" broke into American box offices in 2016, receiving high praise for its clean animation and touching storyline. The release of the film earned Shinkai a spot as one of Variety's top ten animators to watch that year.</p><p>\"Weathering with You\" follows the story of two teenagers: Hodaka Morishima, a 16-year-old boy who runs away to Tokyo to escape a suffocating home environment, and Hina Amano, an 18-year-old girl who bounces from one odd job to the next to provide for her younger brother after their mother dies. Rather than stopping to reflect on their trauma, the two of them are determined to keep moving forward.</p><p>After their chance encounter in the streets of Tokyo, Hina leads Hodaka to the roof of an abandoned building. He watches in disbelief as she prays and the rain stops. This is how Hodaka learns that Hina is a \"sunshine girl\" - a mythical figure with control over the elements who can temporarily bring out the sun.</p><p>The webpage Hina and Hodaka create to market her \"sunshine girl\" powers. Courtesy of the Makoto Shinkai Wiki.</p><p>But as Hina's popularity grows and she brings out the sun for more and more people - even clearing the sky for the city's biggest fireworks festival- the repercussions of her power become apparent. Strange patches of glowing light start to appear on parts of her body, and her powers throw nature off-kilter. Hina, Hodaka and their friends must find a way to save her before her condition worsens, and the city before the elements threaten to sink it.</p><p>Scorching summers and strong typhoons have become the norm in Japan in recent years. In summer 2019, a heatwave killed 57 people and sent more than 18,000 to hospitals in just one week, according to The Japan Times. Typhoon Hagibis made landfall later that year, killing over 30 people and injuring nearly 200 others, NPR reported. Shinkai's movies have shifted with the weather, previously depicting it as a breathtaking background element, and more recently as a force with destructive power.</p><p>\"In my works up until now, I've always portrayed the weather as something beautiful,\" said Shinkai in an interview with Crunchyroll. \"But in reality, especially in Japan, the weather has become a real threat to humans.\"</p><p>\"Weathering with You\" is a piece of work in a growing body of art that incorporates the human experiences of climate change and disastrous weather events. Experts say climate fiction, or cli-fi, will prove central in the fight against climate change. \"I'm interested in how you can use this sort of long-form storytelling narrative approach to communicate complex ideas,\" said James Jones, Associate Professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University, \"because climate change is complicated ... and there are lots of cascading consequences.\" Jones is also a Senior Fellow at the Woods Institute for the Environment, and an avid cli-fi reader himself. Neuroscience studies of storytelling have shown that people tend to have a stronger response when information is presented in a narrative format, in part because a powerful story fully engages the reader or viewer through investment in the narrative and characters. For example, when public service announcements (PSAs) are engaging, oxytocin and a hormone related to attentiveness are released in the brain, and donations to relevant charities become 261 percent more likely, according to a study conducted by neurobiologist Paul Zak in 2015. Another benefit of achieving successful engagement is the activation of the body's stress pathways, which can alter how audiences perceive the threat of climate change.</p><p>Hodaka watches as Hina prays the rain away on the day they meet. Courtesy of GKids press kit.</p><p>Human beliefs about the world are determined by what we see on a daily basis. If a city experiences a cold winter and a warm summer, for example, its citizens will have less anxiety about climate change because they're not seeing clear evidence of it in their everyday lives. Known as the positivity bias, this psychological effect is considered a major barrier to raising climate change awareness.</p><p>But stress has the power to override it.</p><p>Cli-fi with a strong narrative, relatable characters and emotional plot lines can draw audiences in and activate stress pathways, erasing the positivity bias and making it possible for them to experience a shift in their thinking about climate change.</p><p>Another aspect of successful cli-fi is telling a relatable story where the characters are navigating everyday tasks and challenges, like finding a job and building interpersonal relationships. When elements of a changing climate are present, but secondary to these day-to-day concerns, audiences can first connect to the characters' struggles. These initial connection points pave the way for the reader or viewer to start digesting a story's deeper climate change themes - and see parallels to their own lives in the process.</p><p>The never-ending downpour depicted in \"Weathering with You\" seems fantastical at first. But Hina and Hodaka's fighting to keep moving forward and helping each other along the way is such a human story that it becomes possible to connect with them and see parallels between their reality and ours. The rain that seemed purely fictional becomes a metaphor for unusual weather patterns. The absence of Japanese wildlife that usually thrives during the summer conjures thoughts of changing ecosystems. And the slow but constant flooding of Tokyo's streets mirrors the reality of rising sea levels.</p><p>But there are positive parallels, too - Hina and Hodaka's continued search for solutions reminds us that, even when something feels wildly outside of human control, like climate change, the situation is not completely hopeless. A cli-fi like \"Weathering with You\" is special not only because it raises awareness of environmental issues, but also because it reminds us that there is an active role we can play in fighting for a better future.</p><p>Contact Kaylee Beam at kbeam97 'at' stanford.edu.</p><p>.css-10w0hkr{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-10w0hkr{width:650px;}}Kaylee Beam.css-qmqbsq{margin:0 auto;width:100%;}@media (min-width:1100px){.css-qmqbsq{width:600px;}}</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-4545589</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC9-4FB1-DY7P-T06J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1175\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Stanford Daily: Stanford University</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Stanford</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>CA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><className>Business &amp;

It documents impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019 includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, leading international experts, scientific institutions and United Nations agencies. The flagship report provides authoritative information for policy makers on the need for Climate Action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the UN Climate Change Conference in December that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.</p><p>2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Nino event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.</p><p>\"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5C or 2C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,\" said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in a foreword.</p><p>\"This report outlines the latest science and illustrates the urgency for far-reaching climate action. It brings together data from across the fields of climate science and lists the potential future impacts of climate change - from health and economic consequences to decreased food security and increased displacement,\" he said.</p><p>The report was launched at a press conference given by the UN Secretary-General and WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at UN headquarters on 10 March.</p><p>\"Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,\" said WMO Secretary-General Taalas.</p><p>\"We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonably mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Reported record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise,\" said Mr Taalas.</p><p>\"Temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. Changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. Sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in Greenland and Antarctica. This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas,\" said Mr Taalas.</p><p>OCEANS</p><p>Marine heatwaves: More than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.</p><p>Ocean warming has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. It is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems. In 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly 2 months of unusually warm temperatures. At least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.</p><p>Ocean Acidification: In the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual CO2 emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. The change of pH reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.</p><p>Ocean Deoxygenation: both observations and models indicate that oxygen is declining in the open and coastal oceans, including estuaries and semi-enclosed seas. Since the middle of the last century, there has been an estimated 1%-2% decrease (77 billion-145 billion tons) in the global ocean oxygen inventory.</p><p>Marine Ecosystems: Deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5C warming, and to less than 1% at 2C warming.</p><p>Sea level has risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record.</p><p>Ice: The continued long-term decline of Arctic sea ice was confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.</p><p>Until 2016, Antarctic sea ice extent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.</p><p>The Greenland ice sheet has recorded nine of the 10 lowest surface mass balance years in the last 13 years. And 2019 was the 7th lowest on record. In terms of total mass balance. Greenland lost about 260 Gt of ice per year over the period 2002-2016, with a maximum of 458 Gt in 2011/12. The loss in 2019 was 329 Gt, well above the average.</p><p>Glaciers: Preliminary results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.</p><p>Climate-related Impacts</p><p>The report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. This is based on input from a wide variety of United Nations partners. (See in Editor's note for full list)</p><p>High impact events</p><p>Tropical cyclones: Tropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was above average. The Northern Hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones. The 2018-19 Southern Hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones. Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March as one of the strongest known on the east coast of Africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. Idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780 000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. The cyclone also resulted in at least 50 905 displaced persons in Zimbabwe, 53 237 in southern Malawi and 77 019 in Mozambique. One of the year's most intense tropical cyclones was Dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the Bahamas. The destruction was worsened as it was exceptionally slow-moving and remained near-stationary for about 24 hours. Typhoon Hagibis made landfall west of Tokyo on 12 October, causing severe flooding.</p><p>Adapted from WMO Press release on the WMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019.

Once the storm passes, the TCCOR-1 status will change to recovery, and finally, an all clear will be issued.</p><p>CFAY's Naval Security Force (NSF) is using lessons learned from Typhoon Faxai to improve communications before, during and after the storm passes the base.</p><p>\"We've updated all of our recall lists and will start blocking streets when we hit TCCOR 1,\" said Master-at-Arms Petty Officer 1st Class Joel Brown, NSF's assistant anti-terrorism officer. \"We also have rooms in the Transient Personnel Unit barracks for watch personnel, so, they will be on the base ahead of the storm.\"</p><p>Pierside, CFAY's port operations department also is bringing forward what was learned from Typhoon Faxai and putting in extra hours to prepare.</p><p>\"We sortied the fleet, so we sent several ships out to sea, including allied partners, and diverted incoming ships to areas away from Yokosuka and the storm's path,\" said Cmdr. Anthony Matos, CFAY's port operations officer. \"We got a lot of stuff into Dry Dock 6, including John S. McCain, for safe haven.\"</p><p>Matos explained that his crew of more than 50 Sailors and nearly 50 Japanese civilian workers have been optimizing the harbor to basically weather the storm by seeing how to best preserve the infrastructure while maintaining safety. They are doing this by installing storm brows, repositioning shore power cables, and removing all moveable items off of the piers.</p><p>\"My biggest concern at this point is to prevent loss of life,\" added Matos. \"So every reaction we have, everything we do is going to be focused on this one overarching objective I want to keep my folks, Sailors, everyone on the waterfront safe.\"</p><p>The damage that was done on CFAY by Typhoon Faxai included downed trees, broken windows, flooding, and some damage to the piers and sea wall with about 100 tons of debris collected in the days following the storm. Luckily, no injuries on base were reported.</p><p>\"We are preparing for this storm with the belief that one of this strength has not been seen in Yokosuka for several years,\" said Capt. Rich Jarrett, CFAY's commanding officer. \"All the lessons learned during the last typhoon are being applied, and then some, to safeguard personnel and our assets.\"</p><p>CFAY provides, maintains, and operates base facilities and services in support of the U.S. 7th Fleet's forward-deployed naval forces, 71 tenant commands, and more than 27,000 military and civilian personnel and their families.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1123246887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7V-NVV1-JCBF-S00K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"662\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 10, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009U2N</classCode><className>HARBOR &amp; PORT SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N336611MC</classCode><className>SHIPBUILDING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp; ARMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOA4</classCode><className>WEATHER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DOAM</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001710</classCode><className>TERRORISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX002018</classCode><className>TERRORISM &amp; COUNTERTERRORISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST0009U2N</classCode><className>HARBOR &amp; PORT SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928110MM</classCode><className>ARMED FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N336611MC</classCode><className>SHIPBUILDING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Japan and Scotland are due to meet in Yokohama on Sunday, though the game remains in doubt because of the devastating storm.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday night local time as hurricane-force winds battered infrastructure and killed two people. Tokyo and nearby Yokohama are at the center of the storm.</p><p>Weekend games between New Zealand and Italy as well as France and England had already been canceled Thursday, with Saturday's Formula One qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix also canceled.</p><p>If Japan and Scotland are not able to play, the game will be declared a 0-0 draw with both teams receiving two points. Ireland would then play South Africa in the next round as group winners with Japan taking on New Zealand.</p><p/><p>READ: Typhoon Hagibis makes landfall in Japan, leaving at least one dead</p><p>A resounding win</p><p>Not that Ireland were concerned with that for the 80 minutes against Samoa in Fukuoka, western Japan, some 1,100 kilometers away from Tokyo. Having already lost once in this tournament -- a 19-12 defeat to Japan that few saw coming -- coach Joe Schmidt's team would have been eager to lay down a marker ahead of the knockout phase.</p><p>The first score came after just three minutes when captain and hooker Rory Best finished from the back of a driving maul.</p><p>Winger Jacob Stockdale received the Samoan restart and charged up the field where he was clattered by Seilala Lam. The referee deemed the challenge illegal and replays justified the brandished yellow card for a high shoulder.</p><p>The Irish forwards enjoyed the man advantage and dictated the early exchanges. It was another front-rower who dotted down when Tadhg Furlong scored his second try of the competition on 10 minutes. The burly prop gave a show-and-go before finishing from eight meters out.</p><p>The game threatened to become a rout when Sexton -- who scored 18 points on the night -- was on the receiving end of a delightful inside ball from his fullback Jordan Larmour and had an easy run to the line. Sexton converted and the score read 21-0 after 21 minutes.</p><p>READ: A nation united in belief as host Japan secures famous victory</p><p>READ: Host Japan stuns Ireland</p><p/><p>That trio of tries finally galvanized the Pacific Islanders who won a line out in Irish territory and worked through several phases. Captain Jack Lam burrowed and retrieved the ball two meters out and was too strong for his opposing No. 8 CJ Stander to score.</p><p>That proved to be a momentum shift and the pendulum swung even further towards the men in blue when Ireland's inside center Bundee Aki was shown a straight red for a dangerous tackle on fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. There appeared no malice in the act, but referees are under strict instruction to harshly punish errant shoulders that make contact with the head or face.</p><p>Ireland were forced to consolidate with a man down but grew back in the game as the halftime whistle approached. The bonus point for four tries scored was made safe just before the interval when Sexton had his second after a well worked move from a scrum. He missed the extra points from the conversion as he led his team into the break 26-5 ahead.</p><p/><p>View the latest Rugby World Cup news, feature stories, photos and videos on CNN.com.</p><p>Rugby World Cup 2019 in pictures</p><p>Sterner tests await</p><p>Though depleted in the backs, the Irish forwards continued to dominate and they folded the Samoan pack from a scrum on 48 minutes. The resulting penalty was quickly taken and neat interplay saw Larmour achieve a deserving five-pointer. Sexton slotted the extras in his last act of the match.</p><p>Two more Irish tries -- from Stander and replacement Andrew Conway -- meant the 2018 Six Nations champions registered their highest score in Japan.</p><p>Ireland will face tougher opposition in the next round as it seeks to reach the semifinals of a World Cup for the first time in its history. New Zealand's All Blacks or South Africa's Springboks await. Which one will be determined by the eventual outcome in Japan and Scotland.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191012ireland-samoa-rugby-world-cup-spt-intl1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X86-2041-DY60-M0N7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><timeReceived>10:19 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ireland-samoa-rugby-world-cup-spt-intl</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Once the storm passes, the TCCOR-1 status will change to recovery, and finally, an all clear will be issued.</p><p>CFAY's Naval Security Force (NSF) is using lessons learned from Typhoon Faxai to improve communications before, during and after the storm passes the base.</p><p>\"We've updated all of our recall lists and will start blocking streets when we hit TCCOR 1,\" said Master-at-Arms Petty Officer 1st Class Joel Brown, NSF's assistant anti-terrorism officer. \"We also have rooms in the Transient Personnel Unit barracks for watch personnel, so, they will be on the base ahead of the storm.\"</p><p>Pierside, CFAY's Port Operations Department also is bringing forward what was learned from Typhoon Faxai and putting in extra hours to prepare.</p><p>\"We sortied the fleet, so we sent several ships out to sea, including allied partners, and diverted incoming ships to areas away from Yokosuka and the storm's path,\" said Cmdr. Anthony Matos, CFAY's port operations officer. \"We got a lot of stuff into Dry Dock 6, including John S. McCain, for safe haven.\"</p><p>Matos explained that his crew of more than 50 Sailors and nearly 50 Japanese civilian workers have been optimizing the harbor to basically weather the storm by seeing how to best preserve the infrastructure while maintaining safety. They are doing this by installing storm brows, repositioning shore power cables, and removing all moveable items off of the piers.</p><p>\"My biggest concern at this point is to prevent loss of life,\" added Matos. \"So every reaction we have, everything we do is going to be focused on this one overarching objective - I want to keep my folks, Sailors, everyone on the waterfront safe.\"</p><p>The damage that was done on CFAY by Typhoon Faxai included downed trees, broken windows, flooding, and some damage to the piers and sea wall with about 100 tons of debris collected in the days following the storm. Luckily, no injuries on base were reported.</p><p>\"We are preparing for this storm with the belief that one of this strength has not been seen in Yokosuka for several years,\" said Capt. Rich Jarrett, CFAY's commanding officer. \"All the lessons learned during the last typhoon are being applied, and then some, to safeguard personnel and our assets.\"</p><p>CFAY provides, maintains, and operates base facilities and services in support of the U.S. 7th Fleet's forward-deployed naval forces, 71 tenant commands, and more than 27,000 military and civilian personnel and their families.

At least 95 people were killed, and more than 93,250 structures were damaged or destroyed, said Aon's Global Catastrophe Recap October 2019 report, which is compiled by Aon's catastrophe modeling team, Impact Forecasting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report then went on to detail the losses from the wildfires that raged in California during the month, exacerbated by strong Diablo &amp; Santa Ana winds, although their impact was less than 2017/18 fires.</p><p>California's during the period Oct. 10-17 included the Saddle Ridge Fire (Los Angeles County) and Sandalwood Fire (Riverside County), which are expected to bring economic damage in excess of $100 million, with most of the losses covered by insurance.</p><p>Extremely critical wildfire conditions also brought numerous ignitions across Northern and Southern California from Oct. 23 into early November, said the report. The most significant fires included the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County with 374 structures destroyed; the Tick Fire in Los Angeles County with 29 structures affected; the Getty Fire in Los Angeles County with 10; the Hillside Fire in San Bernardino County with six; the Maria Fire in Ventura County with four, and the Easy Fire in Ventura County with two structures destroyed. Total economic and insured losses were expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, the report said.</p><p>Also in the U.S. during October, a severe weather outbreak spawned nearly 30 tornado touchdowns, damaging winds, and large hail across the Plains and Southeast on Oct. 20-21 when at least four people were killed. Most impacts , where a confirmed EF3 tornado with up to 140 mph (220 kph) winds struck several neighborhoods in North Dallas. Further tornado and storm-related impacts were cited in parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Economic and insured losses were likely to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps higher.</p><p>\"Vulnerabilities around tropical cyclones, flooding, and wildfires were again exposed during October. Events such as Typhoon Hagibis in Japan and wildfires in California served as a reminder of the repetitive, or clustering, nature of certain perils on a year-to-year basis that can often be hard to predict,\" said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist within Aon's Impact Forecasting team.</p><p>\"With ample exposure located in high-risk locations all around the world, it becomes increasingly important to utilize the latest tools available to better prepare for future weather and climate-related scenarios in both mature and developing markets,\" he added.</p><p>Other global natural catastrophe events during October include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Hurricane Lorenzo, the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic Hurricane on record, as a Category 1 storm.

One new case was confirmed on Wednesday -- a Disaster Medical Assistant Team male doctor in his 30s who went on board the ship.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Passengers over 70 years old who have tested negative were the first to exit the ship on board taxis and buses, with some expected to transition to shoreside facilities and others to board chartered flights, according to the ship's captain. The disembarkation will take several days. Once passengers have left the ship, they will be permitted to travel freely. </p><p>Several countries including Australia, Canada and the UK were organizing chartered planes to repatriate their nationals. </p><p>Japan's efforts to institute quarantine measures aboard the Diamond Princess may have slowed transmission on land, but the disembarkation has sparked wider concerns, with some pointing to a potential breach of public safety. </p><p>On Monday, it was revealed that a total of 14 evacuated American passengers developed symptoms only after leaving the ship. </p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commended Japan's quarantine measures but said they may not be sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals in the ship.</p><p>\"The CDC believes the rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,\" it said in a statement released Tuesday. </p><p>\"To protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from returning to the US for at least 14 days after they have left the Diamond Princess.\"</p><p>Other experts have also raised the alarm. A Japanese infectious disease specialist who visited the quarantined cruise ship alleged there is inadequate infection control on board.</p><p>\"Inside the Diamond Princess, I was was so scared ... there was no way to tell where the virus was ... bureaucrats were in charge of everything,\" said Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University in a YouTube video published Tuesday.</p><p>\"I think those people who leave the cruise ship today or tomorrow should be monitored for another 14 days because there is high danger of secondary transmission,\" Iwata, told CNN. </p><p>Japan issues health guidelines</p><p>Japan has stepped up efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus after an uptick in cases nationwide sparked concern among the public and cast a shadow over the economy and Tokyo's preparations to host the Summer Olympics.</p><p>The country's health ministry issued guidelines on Monday for people experiencing symptoms similar to the coronavirus in an effort to to prevent worried citizens from inundating hospitals by providing them with specific hotlines to call.</p><p>People who are feeling lethargic, experiencing shortness of breath, or who have had a temperature of 37.5 Celsius or higher for four days should call nationwide healthcare centers that are in charge of responding to the outbreak, the health ministry advises.</p><p>A total of 613 cases of the virus, officially called Covid-19, have been confirmed in the country -- the largest outbreak outside China, including the hundreds of cases from the Diamond Princess.</p><p>On Friday morning, cases unrelated to the ship stood at 31, but by Wednesday that number had risen to 68 following a spike in cases across the country in the past few days. An elderly woman in Kanagawa prefecture is the only person in Japan to have died of the virus. </p><p>The guidance comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a meeting with medical experts over the weekend and Japan's health minister warned on Sunday that the nation is \"entering a new phase\" in the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>\"We want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings. We want the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places,\" health minister Katsunobu Kato said Sunday, after a discussion by a panel of experts. They said Japan was still in the early stages of infection.</p><p>Kato said that as it would be difficult to track the source of the infections, Japan could see a rise in cases. He stressed that it was important for medical facilities to prepare themselves in advance to tackle a potential spread of the infection in Japan. </p><p>Outbreak response</p><p>The coronavirus has spread from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in central China, to more than 25 countries, killing 2,005 people and infecting more than 75,000 people.</p><p>Face masks have become scarce in Japan since early February. Amid the shortage, an old tweet from the Tokyo police's department's disaster countermeasures division from August 2019 that provides instruction on how to make a DIY mask gained renewed chatter online as people turn to increasingly creative measures to protect themselves.</p><p>Japan has already started to take a number of precautions to overcome and prevent the spread of the virus. </p><p>Two Japanese airlines -- All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines -- announced a reduction or suspension of flights to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak on February 4. </p><p>On Monday, the Japanese Imperial Household announced it would cancel next weekend's public birthday celebration for Emperor Naruhito over fears that large crowds could encourage the spread of coronavirus.</p><p>The Tokyo Marathon will also only be open to elite athletes due to public health concerns about the novel coronavirus, according to an announcement by event organizers on Monday. So far, Tokyo 2020 Olympic organizers have asserted the preparations for the Games, which are due to officially begin on Friday, July 24, will continue. </p><p>More Japanese companies are adopting the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and in offices.</p><p>Japanese telecoms giant NTT is the latest to join a slew of firms encouraging their employees to telework in a bid to protect its workers from the virus.</p><p>Earlier in February, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten told employees who had recently returned from China to work from home for two weeks, according to public broadcaster NHK. The incubation period of the virus is believed to be 14 days.</p><p>Economic impact</p><p>Amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak, speculation is growing around the affect it will have on Japan's tourism industry and economy.</p><p>This year, Japan's popular destinations have seen a slump in tourist numbers as China announced a ban on outbound group travel as part of its battle to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in January.</p><p>That particularly affected Japan, which had approximately 9.6 million visitors from China in 2019 -- accounting for a third of foreign tourist expenditure in the country.</p><p>Japan has struggled to recover from three recessions in the past eight years.

A main difference has been an increase in loss trends for which reinsurance price increases only partially compensated. After a record three-year period of natural catastrophes losses, demand for reinsurance remains robust. Nevertheless, pricing gaps persist, as the reinsurance market capacity remains abundant and emerging risks such as climate change and social inflation are still to be fully incorporated into reinsurance prices.</p><p>In this context, SCOR has built on its longstanding client relationships to proactively manage the pricing cycle, focusing on business compliant with its profitability targets and risk appetite.</p><p>Reinsurance treaties renewal book at January 1, 20201):</p><p>Gross Premiums renewed Evolution vs. January 2019 Notable drivers (in EUR millions) P&amp;C Lines2) 2,277 -6.4% United States, China Global Lines3) 881 0.0% n.a.

Such an outcome further demonstrates the relevance of SCOR's fully equipped 360\u00b0 risk-taking platform, as outlined in the \"Quantum Leap\" strategic plan.Looking forward to the April, June &amp; July renewals, the market is expected to stay firm, with the possibility of further hardening as loss affected contracts come up for renewal. SCOR will rebuild the sustained profitability of its Japanese portfolio based on its long-standing client relationships. Given its modest US casualty portfolio, SCOR is well positioned to benefit from further market changes arising from upcoming US renewals.2019 Premium and natural catastrophe updateFor the full year 2019, SCOR Global P&amp;C experienced a strong gross written premiums growth, of 15.8% at constant exchange rates, to EUR 7.1bn. This was driven both by Reinsurance (+16.2%) and Specialty Insurance (+14.4%). The growth arises from the strong 2019 successive renewals, and also benefits from the very robust H2 2018 renewals particularly in the US.SCOR estimates the cost of natural catastrophes in Q4 2019 at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax.The fourth quarter of 2019 has registered a high severity of natural catastrophe events worldwide, in particular coming from typhoons in Japan. SCOR estimates the cost of Japanese typhoon Hagibis at EUR 227 million after retrocession and before tax based upon cedants' information and assuming an insured market loss in the region of USD 8 billion. Our efficient retro program would allow SCOR to materially dampen the increase in the loss, should Hagibis deviate beyond our current estimate of market loss assumption.Following an upward market loss revision of Japanese typhoon Faxai and the impact of other events during the fourth quarter, SCOR estimates the cost of Q4 2019 QTD natural catastrophes at EUR 343 million after retrocession and before tax, and at EUR 665 million after retrocession and before tax for the full year. While remaining within SCOR's risk appetite and thanks to its efficient capital shield policy, SCOR Global P&amp;C expects to record an actual net combined ratio below 100% for full year 2019, including natural catastrophe costs. In 2019, SCOR continues to demonstrate its shock-absorbing capacity and pursues the execution of its strategic plan \"Quantum Leap\" with a very strong solvency position and an unchanged dividend policy.Jean-Paul Conoscente, CEO of SCOR Global P&amp;C, comments: \"As the reinsurance market did not fully react to loss perspectives as we had initially anticipated, SCOR maintains a disciplined underwriting approach as evidenced during the January 2020 renewals. Despite plentiful reinsurance capacity, persistently low interest rates and upward expected losses, SCOR significantly improves its P&amp;C profitability, while accompanying the growth of its key reinsurance clients. Thanks to its Specialty Insurance arm, SCOR leverages further the hardening witnessed in commercial lines, expected to continue throughout the year. Given that the January 2020 renewals are focused on EMEA with benign loss experience, we expect more pronounced favorable market conditions through the spring/summer 2020 renewals and maintain our \"Quantum Leap\" assumptions for the duration of the plan.\"** *Contact detailsMediaAnette Rey+33 (0)1 58 44 82 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:82arey@scor.comInvestor\">82arey@scor.comInvestor</email> RelationsIan Kelly+44 (0)203 207 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:8561ikelly@scor.com\">8561ikelly@scor.com</email><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.scor.comLinkedIn:\">www.scor.comLinkedIn:</url> SCOR | Twitter: @SCOR_SEGeneralNumbers presented throughout this report may not add up precisely to the totals in the tables and text.

The decrease in the combined ratio was mainly driven by lower current year catastrophe losses, partially offset by current accident year losses in the Global Property and Specialty &amp; Casualty segments. The fourth quarter of 2019 included 19 points of current year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, compared to 33 points of current year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, for the fourth quarter of 2018. The fourth quarter of 2019 also included 4 points of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development compared to 5 points of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development for the fourth quarter of 2018.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">Gross written premiums for the fourth quarter of 2019 were $380 million, an increase of 25% compared to the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by Specialty &amp; Casualty ($46 million) and Global Property ($41 million). Pre-tax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, were $75 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 compared to $114 million for the fourth quarter of 2018. Highlights by reportable segment for the fourth quarter of 2019 include the following: Global Property produced a $(75) million underwriting (loss) and a 143% combined ratio driven mainly by catastrophe losses and current accident year losses. Current year catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, were $74 million for the quarter primarily from Typhoon Hagibis ($65 million) and Typhoon Lekima ($8 million). Global A&amp;H produced $3 million of underwriting income, including net service fee income, and a combined ratio of 97%. Specialty &amp; Casualty produced a $(15) million underwriting (loss) and a combined ratio of 115%, driven mainly by current accident year losses for Aviation (including $8 million from the first quarter of 2019 Ethiopian Airlines flight crash) and Casualty. Partially offsetting these losses was net favorable prior year loss reserve development of $3 million. Runoff &amp; Other produced $1 million of underwriting income driven mainly by net favorable prior year loss reserve development.</emphasis></p><p>For the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, Sirius Group's combined ratio was 111% compared to 103% for the year ended December\u00a031, 2018. The increase in the combined ratio was driven primarily by net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development and higher current accident year losses in the Global Property and Specialty &amp; Casualty segments.\u00a0Sirius Group's 2019 combined ratio included 7 points of net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development compared to 1 point of net favorable prior year loss reserve development in 2018.

Highlights by reportable segment for 2019 included the following: Global Property produced an underwriting (loss) of $(129) million and a 120% combined ratio driven by catastrophes losses of $192 million, net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums, from Typhoon Hagibis ($65 million), Typhoon Faxai ($53 million) and Hurricane Dorian ($40 million). In addition, 2019 included higher current accident year losses, and net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $92 million. Global A&amp;H produced $42 million of underwriting income, including net service fee income from IMG and Armada of $27 million, and a combined ratio of 97%. Specialty &amp; Casualty produced an underwriting loss of $(51) million and a combined ratio of 114%, driven mainly by higher current accident year losses in Aviation (including $12 million from the 2019 Ethiopian Airlines flight crash) and Casualty. Underwriting results were also negatively impacted by net unfavorable prior year loss reserve development of $12 million, primarily from the Casualty Reinsurance book. Runoff &amp; Other produced an underwriting (loss) of $(13) million mainly due to operating expenses.</emphasis></p><p>Investments and Other</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"un\">During the fourth quarter of 2019, the investment portfolio returned 0.4% in original currencies and 0.8% in U.S. Dollars.

Adjusted book value is derived by summing Total common shareholders' equity, the Series B preference share amount reflected in mezzanine equity, and the Earned portion of future proceeds from stock option awards. Outstanding warrants are excluded as they are anti-dilutive as of the respective reporting dates. Adjusted tangible book value is derived by subtracting Goodwill, Intangible assets and Net deferred tax liability on intangible assets from Adjusted book value.</p><p>At December\u00a031, 2019, Adjusted book value, Adjusted book value per share, Adjusted tangible book value, and Adjusted tangible book value per share include the earned effects of\u00a0share-based compensation awards issued during 2019.</p><p>Adjusted book value per share is derived by dividing the Adjusted book value by the Adjusted shares outstanding.

Operating (loss) attributable to common shareholders as used herein differs from net (loss) attributable to common shareholders, which the Company believes is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, by the exclusion of net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, net foreign exchange gains (losses) and the associated income tax expense or benefit. The Company's management believes that Operating (loss) attributable to common shareholders is useful to investors because it is more reflective of the Company's core business, as it removes the variability arising from fluctuations in the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio, equity investments trading, investments-related derivatives, and net foreign exchange gains (losses) and the associated income tax expense or benefit of those fluctuations. The following is a reconciliation of net (loss) attributable to common shareholders to Operating (loss) attributable to common shareholders:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY42582&amp;sd=2020-03-05\"/> View original content to download multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sirius-international-insurance-group-ltd-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2019-results-301018708.html</p><p>SOURCE Sirius International Insurance Group, Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY42582&amp;Transmission_Id=202003051718PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY42582&amp;DateId=20200305\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>CONTACT: Sirius Group, Investor Relations, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investor.relations@siriusgroup.com\">investor.relations@siriusgroup.com</email>, (212) 312-2525</p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-NY4258220200305</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC0-WRK1-JB72-12MM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3279\"/><timeReceived>5:18 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

We believe the actions taken strengthen our balance sheet and position us for a more profitable future.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We are experiencing substantial rate increases across our platform, with strong double-digit gains in International and certain U.S. liability lines.

Reserve increases were related to the Company's London, Bermuda Insurance and European business units within Argo's International Operations, as well as property, professional and liability lines within Argo's U.S. Operations. Prior accident year losses in both segments were the result of new information received in the quarter relating to claims trends across various lines of business, as well as a continued review of International business currently in run-off. Prior year losses also include the conclusion of Argo's annual review of Run-off reserves, which resulted in a $10 million reserve increase.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Current accident year losses of approximately $30 million, or an additional 6 points when compared to the third quarter 2019 year-to-date current accident year loss ratio of 59%.

These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements are qualified by the inherent risks and uncertainties surrounding future expectations generally and also may differ materially from actual future experience involving any one or more of such statements. In addition, any estimates relating to loss events involve the exercise of considerable judgment and reflect a combination of ground-up evaluations, information available to date from brokers and cedants, market intelligence, initial tentative loss reports and other sources. The actuarial range of reserves and management's best estimate is based on our then current state of knowledge including explicit and implicit assumptions relating to the pattern of claim development, the expected ultimate settlement amount, inflation and dependencies between lines of business. Our internal capital model is used to consider the distribution for reserving risk around this best estimate and predict the potential range of outcomes. However, due to the complexity of factors contributing to the losses and the preliminary nature of the information used to prepare these estimates, there can be no assurance that Argo Group's ultimate losses will remain within the stated amount. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and uncertainties, see Argo Group's filings with the SEC. The inclusion of a forward-looking statement herein should not be regarded as a representation by Argo Group that Argo Group's objectives will be achieved. Argo Group undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.</p><p>Forward-looking statements include all statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can be identified by the use of words such as \"expect,\" \"intend,\" \"plan,\" \"believe,\" \"do not believe,\" \"aim,\" \"project,\" \"anticipate,\" \"seek,\" \"will,\" \"likely,\" \"assume,\" \"estimate,\" \"may,\" \"continue,\" \"guidance,\" \"objective,\" \"outlook,\" \"trends,\" \"future,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"should,\" \"target,\" \"on track\" and similar expressions of a future or forward-looking nature.

Japan and Scotland are due to meet in Yokohama on Sunday, though the game remains in doubt because of the devastating storm.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday night local time as hurricane-force winds battered infrastructure and killed two people. Tokyo and nearby Yokohama are at the center of the storm.</p><p>Weekend games between New Zealand and Italy as well as France and England had already been canceled Thursday, with Saturday's Formula One qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix also canceled.</p><p>If Japan and Scotland are not able to play, the game will be declared a 0-0 draw with both teams receiving two points. Ireland would then play South Africa in the next round as group winners with Japan taking on New Zealand.</p><p/><p>READ: Typhoon Hagibis makes landfall in Japan, leaving at least one dead</p><p>A resounding win</p><p>Not that Ireland were concerned with that for the 80 minutes against Samoa in Fukuoka, western Japan, some 1,100 kilometers away from Tokyo. Having already lost once in this tournament -- a 19-12 defeat to Japan that few saw coming -- coach Joe Schmidt's team would have been eager to lay down a marker ahead of the knockout phase.</p><p>The first score came after just three minutes when captain and hooker Rory Best finished from the back of a driving maul.</p><p>Winger Jacob Stockdale received the Samoan restart and charged up the field where he was clattered by Seilala Lam. The referee deemed the challenge illegal and replays justified the brandished yellow card for a high shoulder.</p><p>The Irish forwards enjoyed the man advantage and dictated the early exchanges. It was another front-rower who dotted down when Tadhg Furlong scored his second try of the competition on 10 minutes. The burly prop gave a show-and-go before finishing from eight meters out.</p><p>The game threatened to become a rout when Sexton -- who scored 18 points on the night -- was on the receiving end of a delightful inside ball from his fullback Jordan Larmour and had an easy run to the line. Sexton converted and the score read 21-0 after 21 minutes.</p><p>READ: A nation united in belief as host Japan secures famous victory</p><p>READ: Host Japan stuns Ireland</p><p/><p>That trio of tries finally galvanized the Pacific Islanders who won a line out in Irish territory and worked through several phases. Captain Jack Lam burrowed and retrieved the ball two meters out and was too strong for his opposing No. 8 CJ Stander to score.</p><p>That proved to be a momentum shift and the pendulum swung even further towards the men in blue when Ireland's inside center Bundee Aki was shown a straight red for a dangerous tackle on fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. There appeared no malice in the act, but referees are under strict instruction to harshly punish errant shoulders that make contact with the head or face.</p><p>Ireland were forced to consolidate with a man down but grew back in the game as the halftime whistle approached. The bonus point for four tries scored was made safe just before the interval when Sexton had his second after a well worked move from a scrum. He missed the extra points from the conversion as he led his team into the break 26-5 ahead.</p><p/><p>View the latest Rugby World Cup news, feature stories, photos and videos on CNN.com.</p><p>Rugby World Cup 2019 in pictures</p><p>Sterner tests await</p><p>Though depleted in the backs, the Irish forwards continued to dominate and they folded the Samoan pack from a scrum on 48 minutes. The resulting penalty was quickly taken and neat interplay saw Larmour achieve a deserving five-pointer. Sexton slotted the extras in his last act of the match.</p><p>Two more Irish tries -- from Stander and replacement Andrew Conway -- meant the 2018 Six Nations champions registered their highest score in Japan.</p><p>Ireland will face tougher opposition in the next round as it seeks to reach the semifinals of a World Cup for the first time in its history. New Zealand's All Blacks or South Africa's Springboks await. Which one will be determined by the eventual outcome in Japan and Scotland.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191012ireland-samoa-rugby-world-cup-spt-intl1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8M-0C51-DY60-M17P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"723\"/><timeReceived>4:24 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 12, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>ireland-samoa-rugby-world-cup-spt-intl</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Once the storm passes, the TCCOR-1 status will change to recovery, and finally, an all clear will be issued.</p><p>CFAY's Naval Security Force (NSF) is using lessons learned from Typhoon Faxai to improve communications before, during and after the storm passes the base.</p><p>\"We've updated all of our recall lists and will start blocking streets when we hit TCCOR 1,\" said Master-at-Arms Petty Officer 1st Class Joel Brown, NSF's assistant anti-terrorism officer. \"We also have rooms in the Transient Personnel Unit barracks for watch personnel, so, they will be on the base ahead of the storm.\"</p><p>Pierside, CFAY's Port Operations Department also is bringing forward what was learned from Typhoon Faxai and putting in extra hours to prepare.</p><p>\"We sortied the fleet, so we sent several ships out to sea, including allied partners, and diverted incoming ships to areas away from Yokosuka and the storm's path,\" said Cmdr. Anthony Matos, CFAY's port operations officer. \"We got a lot of stuff into Dry Dock 6, including John S. McCain, for safe haven.\"</p><p>Matos explained that his crew of more than 50 Sailors and nearly 50 Japanese civilian workers have been optimizing the harbor to basically weather the storm by seeing how to best preserve the infrastructure while maintaining safety.

At least 95 people were killed, and more than 93,250 structures were damaged or destroyed, said report, which is compiled by Aon's catastrophe modeling team, Impact Forecasting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report then went on to detail the losses from the wildfires that raged in California during the month, exacerbated by strong Diablo &amp; Santa Ana winds, although their impact was less than 2017/18 fires.</p><p>California's during the period Oct. 10-17 included the Saddle Ridge Fire (Los Angeles County) and Sandalwood Fire (Riverside County), which are expected to bring economic damage in excess of US$100 million, with most of the losses covered by insurance.</p><p>Extremely critical wildfire conditions also brought numerous ignitions across Northern and Southern California from Oct. 23 into early November, said the report. The most significant fires included the Kincade Fire in Sonoma County with 374 structures destroyed; the Tick Fire in Los Angeles County with 29 structures affected; the Getty Fire in Los Angeles County with 10; the Hillside Fire in San Bernardino County with six; the Maria Fire in Ventura County with four, and the Easy Fire in Ventura County with two structures destroyed. Total economic and insured losses were expected to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, the report said.</p><p>Also in the U.S. during October, a severe weather outbreak spawned nearly 30 tornado touchdowns, damaging winds, and large hail across the Plains and Southeast on Oct. 20-21 when at least four people were killed. Most impacts , where a confirmed EF3 tornado with up to 140 mph (220 kph) winds struck several neighborhoods in North Dallas. Further tornado and storm-related impacts were cited in parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Louisiana, and Tennessee. Economic and insured losses were likely to reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps higher.</p><p>\"Vulnerabilities around tropical cyclones, flooding, and wildfires were again exposed during October. Events such as Typhoon Hagibis in Japan and wildfires in California served as a reminder of the repetitive, or clustering, nature of certain perils on a year-to-year basis that can often be hard to predict,\" said Steve Bowen, director and meteorologist within Aon's Impact Forecasting team.</p><p>\"With ample exposure located in high-risk locations all around the world, it becomes increasingly important to utilize the latest tools available to better prepare for future weather and climate-related scenarios in both mature and developing markets,\" he added.</p><p>Other global natural catastrophe events during October include:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Hurricane Lorenzo, the easternmost Category 5 Atlantic Hurricane on record, as a Category 1 storm.

In that case, the final result is declared a draw and each team receives two points, an outcome that could have a big impact on the tournament's knockout draw. </p><p>If a match starts but is abandoned in the first-half, then a draw is also ruled, but if it is abandoned in the second-half then the score at the time the game is stopped is taken as the final score. </p><p>Were Ireland's game against Samoa to be canceled and Scotland beats Russia and Japan in its final two pool games --- picking up a four-try bonus point in one of those games --- then Ireland, the world's top-ranked team ahead of the tournament, would go out.</p><p>The players and coaches, however, are remaining resolute.</p><p>\"Come on, we're from Scotland,\" said prop Gordon Reid, whose side faces a must-win game against host Japan in Yokohama Sunday. </p><p>\"We have had worse weather -- rain, hail, everything in one day. It doesn't matter. It's fine. We have coped well with a lot more. </p><p>\"We are from Glasgow, from Ayrshire. We're not as posh as some from Edinburgh, but we are from Scotland. We are used to this kind of thing. Whatever it is, rain or shine, snow, it doesn't matter.\"</p><p>Ireland forwards coach Simon Easterby was similarly unfazed.</p><p>\"By all accounts things can change reasonably quickly,\" he told reporters in Fukuoka. \"But we are playing here on Saturday against Samoa unless we're otherwise informed.\"</p><p>England scrumhalf Ben Youngs did reveal that his team had been anticipating a change of game plan against France, utilizing the forwards and restricting the amount of long passes.</p><p>\"There will be a lot of pick-and-goes from the forwards -- if (the typhoon) arrives,\" said Youngs. </p><p>\"One thing (coach) Eddie (Jones) has always said is that we have to be adaptable and make sure we're able to change things. When you wake up in the morning it could be different, so we'll just have to wait and see. </p><p>\"We're anticipating rain and horrible conditions and we will train like that.\"</p><p>Japan has a long history of withstanding typhoons. </p><p>In legend they are known as The Kamikaze -- the divine winds -- a reference to the two mighty typhoons placed providentially seven years apart which destroyed two separate Mongol invasion fleets in the 13th century. </p><p>The typhoon's current trajectory suggests that it could also affect this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, although no plans to alter the race schedule have been put in place so far. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In that case, the final result is declared a draw and each team receives two points, an outcome that could have a big impact on the tournament's knockout draw.</p><p>If a match starts but is abandoned in the first-half, then a draw is also ruled, but if it is abandoned in the second-half then the score at the time the game is stopped is taken as the final score.</p><p>Were Ireland's game against Samoa to be canceled and Scotland beats Russia and Japan in its final two pool games ? picking up a four-try bonus point in one of those games ? then Ireland, the world's top-ranked team ahead of the tournament, would go out.</p><p>The players and coaches, however, are remaining resolute.</p><p>\"Come on, we're from Scotland,\" said prop Gordon Reid, whose side faces a must-win game against host Japan in Yokohama Sunday.</p><p>\"We have had worse weather -- rain, hail, everything in one day. It doesn't matter. It's fine. We have coped well with a lot more.</p><p>\"We are from Glasgow, from Ayrshire. We're not as posh as some from Edinburgh, but we are from Scotland.

When you wake up in the morning it could be different, so we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p>\"We're anticipating rain and horrible conditions and we will train like that.\"</p><p>Japan has a long history of withstanding typhoons.</p><p>In legend they are known as The Kamikaze -- the divine winds -- a reference to the two mighty typhoons placed providentially seven years apart which destroyed two separate Mongol invasion fleets in the 13th century.</p><p>READ: France survives scare against battling Tonga</p><p>The typhoon's current trajectory suggests that it could also affect this weekend's Japanese Grand Prix at Suzuka, although no plans to alter the race schedule have been put in place so far.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191008rugby-world-cup-typhoon-hagibis-japan-spt-intl1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7B-5841-DY60-M3XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><timeReceived>2:11 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 8, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>rugby-world-cup-typhoon-hagibis-japan-spt-intl</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

The disembarkation will take several days. Once passengers have left the ship, they will be permitted to travel freely.</p><p>Jan Swartz, President and CEO of the vessel's operator Princess Cruises, told CNN that this is an \"unprecedented situation.\" \"Nobody going on vacation thinks that they're going to be notified in the last days that they've got an extension ... and they're not going to be allowed to leave their cabins,\" she added.</p><p>Swartz greeted passengers as they disembarked. She also highlighted the actions of the ship's crew. Japan did not allow the roughly 1,000 crew members to be quarantined unless they took ill, instead asking them to serve the rest of the passengers throughout the two-week period.</p><p>\"I think the guests and our crew who came together to help support each other, from 57 different countries and regions around the world, really lifted each other's hearts.\"</p><p>Several countries including Australia, Canada and the UK were organizing chartered planes to repatriate their nationals.</p><p>Disembarkation sparks concerns</p><p>Japan's efforts to institute quarantine measures aboard the Diamond Princess may have slowed transmission on land, but the disembarkation has sparked wider concerns, with some pointing to a potential breach of public safety.</p><p>On Monday, it was revealed that a total of 14 evacuated American passengers developed symptoms only after leaving the ship.</p><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) commended Japan's quarantine measures but said they may not be sufficient to prevent transmission among individuals in the ship.</p><p>\"The CDC believes the rate of new infections on board, especially among those without symptoms, represents an ongoing risk,\" it said in a statement released Tuesday.</p><p>\"To protect the health of the American public, all passengers and crew of the ship have been placed under travel restrictions, preventing them from returning to the US for at least 14 days after they have left the Diamond Princess.\"</p><p>Other experts have also raised the alarm. Kentaro Iwata, an infectious disease specialist at Kobe University who visited the ship, told CNN that he didn't think it was a proper quarantine.</p><p>Iwata has worked on various infectious outbreaks such as Ebola and Sars over the last 20 years, but says he has never been as worried about getting infected himself.</p><p>\"I was so scared because there was no way to tell where the virus is and everybody was not careful about it,\" Iwata told CNN.</p><p>\"There was no single infection control person inside the ship -- the bureaucrats were in charge of everything.\"</p><p>Iwata called for an extended quarantine period for those passengers leaving the Diamond Princess.</p><p>\"I think those people who leave the cruise ship today or tomorrow should be monitored for another 14 days because there is high danger of secondary transmission,\" Iwata told CNN.</p><p>Japan issues health guidelines</p><p>Japan has stepped up efforts to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus after an uptick in cases nationwide sparked concern among the public and cast a shadow over the economy and Tokyo's preparations to host the Summer Olympics.</p><p>The country's health ministry issued guidelines on Monday for people experiencing symptoms similar to the coronavirus in an effort to prevent worried citizens from inundating hospitals by providing them with specific hotlines to call.</p><p>People who are feeling lethargic, experiencing shortness of breath, or who have had a temperature of 37.5 Celsius or higher for four days should call nationwide healthcare centers that are in charge of responding to the outbreak, the health ministry advises.</p><p>A total of 692 cases of the novel coronavirus have been confirmed in the country -- the largest outbreak outside China -- including the 624 cases on the Diamond Princess.</p><p>On Friday morning, cases unrelated to the ship stood at 31, but by Wednesday that number had risen to 68 following a spike in cases across the country in the past few days. An elderly woman in Kanagawa prefecture is the only person in Japan to have died of the virus.</p><p>The guidance comes as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe held a meeting with medical experts over the weekend and Japan's health minister warned on Sunday that the nation is \"entering a new phase\" in the coronavirus outbreak.</p><p>\"We want to ask the public to avoid non-urgent, non-essential gatherings. We want the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions to avoid crowded places,\" health minister Katsunobu Kato said Sunday, after a discussion by a panel of experts. They said Japan was still in the early stages of infection.</p><p>Kato said that as it would be difficult to track the source of the infections, Japan could see a rise in cases. He stressed that it was important for medical facilities to prepare themselves in advance to tackle a potential spread of the infection in Japan.</p><p>Outbreak response</p><p>The coronavirus has spread from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak in central China, to more than 25 countries and regions, killing 2,010 people and infecting more than 75,000 people globally.</p><p>Face masks have become scarce in Japan since early February. Amid the shortage, an old tweet from the Tokyo police's department's disaster countermeasures division from August 2019 that provides instruction on how to make a DIY mask gained renewed chatter online as people turn to increasingly creative measures to protect themselves.</p><p/><p>Japan has already started to take a number of precautions to overcome and prevent the spread of the virus.</p><p>Two Japanese airlines -- All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines -- announced a reduction or suspension of flights to mainland China due to the coronavirus outbreak on February 4.</p><p>On Monday, the Japanese Imperial Household announced it would cancel next weekend's public birthday celebration for Emperor Naruhito over fears that large crowds could encourage the spread of coronavirus.</p><p>The Tokyo Marathon will also only be open to elite athletes due to public health concerns about the novel coronavirus, according to an announcement by event organizers on Monday. So far, Tokyo 2020 Olympic organizers have asserted the preparations for the Games, which are due to officially begin on Friday, July 24, will continue.</p><p>More Japanese companies are adopting the practice of encouraging their employees to work from home to prevent exposing them to the virus on congested public transport and in offices.</p><p>Japanese telecoms giant NTT is the latest to join a slew of firms encouraging their employees to telework in a bid to protect its workers from the virus.</p><p>Earlier in February, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten told employees who had recently returned from China to work from home for two weeks, according to public broadcaster NHK. The incubation period of the virus is believed to be 14 days.</p><p>Economic impact</p><p>Amid fears over the coronavirus outbreak, speculation is growing around the affect it will have on Japan's tourism industry and economy.</p><p>This year, Japan's popular destinations have seen a slump in tourist numbers as China announced a ban on outbound group travel as part of its battle to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak in January.</p><p>That particularly affected Japan, which had approximately 9.6 million visitors from China in 2019 -- accounting for a third of foreign tourist expenditure in the country.</p><p>Japan has struggled to recover from three recessions in the past eight years. It has also absorbed a sales tax hike and grappled with the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis, a powerful storm that hit the country last fall.</p><p>There are concerns the virus could push the country into another recession.</p><p>The world's third-largest economy shrank 1.6% in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to a government estimate released Monday. The decline from the third quarter is the biggest contraction since 2014.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20200217japan-health-guidelines-coronavirus-hnk-intl1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y7N-PWM1-JBPX-X015-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1445\"/><timeReceived>4:39 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 17, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>japan-health-guidelines-coronavirus-hnk-intl</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX002082</classCode><className>ISOLATION &amp;

Our year to date investment return of 12.8% has contributed significantly to overall profits for the year. With underlying insurance and reinsurance market conditions both improving across many of the lines of business that we write, we believe we are well positioned to deliver increasingly attractive returns to shareholders and remain on track to achieve our goal of underwriting profitability in 2020.\"</p><p>Additional Information on Financial Results</p><p>The following table shows certain key financial metrics for the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>Property and Casualty Reinsurance Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written</p><p>Gross premiums written increased by $14.1 million, or 11.7%, to $134.2 million for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019 from $120.1 million for the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to $85.6 million of new premium written in the period, partially offset by the net impact of contract extensions, cancellations and contracts renewed with no comparable premium in the comparable period.</p><p>Gross premiums written increased by $53.5 million, or 9.3%, to $631.8 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2019 from $578.3 million for the year ended December\u00a031, 2018. The increase in gross premiums written was primarily due to $93.0 million related to two retroactive reinsurance contracts written in the period and $68.3 million of new property catastrophe business. This increase was partially offset by contracts that we did not renew in the current year as well as the net impact of contract extensions, cancellations and contracts renewed with no comparable premium in the comparable period.</p><p>Net premiums earned</p><p>The decrease in net premiums earned in the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019 compared to the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018 was primarily due to retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts that were written and fully earned in the prior year period of $69.9 million compared to $34.3 million in the current year period, partially offset by a higher in-force underwriting portfolio in the current year period.</p><p>The increase in net premiums earned in the year ended December\u00a031, 2019 compared to the year ended December\u00a031, 2018 was primarily due to a higher in-force underwriting portfolio and retroactive exposures in reinsurance contracts that were written and fully earned in the current year period of $85.1 million compared to $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.</p><p>Net underwriting results</p><p>For the three months ended December\u00a031, 2019, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $16.3 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 8.2 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Typhoon Hagibis, compared to $18.5 million in the three months ended December\u00a031, 2018, or 8.8 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to the California wildfires and other catastrophe events.</p><p>For the year ended December\u00a031, 2019, we incurred net catastrophe losses of $29.0 million, net of reinstatement premiums and profit commission adjustments, or 4.1 percentage points on the combined ratio, primarily related to Hurricane Dorian, Typhoon Faxai and Typhoon Hagibis, compared to $18.5 million in the year ended December\u00a031, 2018, or 3.0 percentage points on the combined ratio, related to the California wildfires and other 2018 catastrophe events.</p><p>Although we did not specifically write property catastrophe contracts in 2018 or in prior years, we were exposed to California wildfire losses through liability reinsurance of the utilities in California during 2018 and incidental exposure that we had to catastrophic events on two Florida homeowners contracts, as a result of Hurricane Michael, and on two whole account reinsurance contracts.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019, we recorded a net $1.1 million and $5.4 million improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p><p>The improvement in the net underwriting results for the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019 compared to prior year periods, after giving effect to catastrophe losses and reserve development, was primarily due to a shift in the mix of business, including earnings on new property catastrophe and specialty business.</p><p>For the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net $0.3 million and $5.2 million improvement in the net underwriting results, respectively, related to favorable development of prior years' loss reserves net of the related impact of acquisition costs.</p><p>Investments</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment return for our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment income (loss) for our total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>The following is a summary of the net investment return by investment strategy on total net investments managed by Third Point LLC for the three and twelve months ended December\u00a031, 2019 and 2018:</p><p>For the three months ended December 31, 2019, the portfolio generated positive performance across each investment strategy.\u00a0 The majority of returns were derived from the long equity portfolio with strong contributors across different sectors, strategies, and geographies.\u00a0 Within credit, both corporate and structured credit added to gains for the period.\u00a0 In the other portfolio, private investments contributed modest gains for the quarter.</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2019, the net investment results were primarily attributable to strong returns in all core activist long equity positions.\u00a0In credit, profits in the structured credit book were partially offset by losses from one large sovereign credit investment.\u00a0 In the other portfolio, private investments contributed modest gains for the year.</p><p>Conference Call Details</p><p>The Company will hold a conference call to discuss its fourth quarter 2019 results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on February\u00a028, 2020.

Such measures, including basic and diluted book value per share and return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, are referred to as non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures may be defined or calculated differently by other companies. Management believes these measures allow for a more complete understanding of the underlying business. These measures are used to monitor our results and should not be viewed as a substitute for those determined in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations of such measures to the most comparable GAAP figures are included in the attached financial information in accordance with Regulation G.</p><p>About the Company</p><p>The Company is a public company listed on the New York Stock Exchange which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Reinsurance (USA) Ltd. (\"Third Point Re USA\"), writes property and casualty reinsurance business. Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA each have an \"A-\" (Excellent) financial strength rating from A.M. Best Company, Inc.</p><p>Contact</p><p>Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.<br/>Christopher S. Coleman - Chief Financial Officer<br/><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:investorrelations@thirdpointre.bm\">investorrelations@thirdpointre.bm</email><br/>+1 441-542-3333</p><p>THIRD POINT REINSURANCE LTD.NON-GAAP MEASURES AND RECONCILIATIONS &amp; KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS</p><p>Non-GAAP Measures</p><p>Basic Book Value per Share and Diluted Book Value per Share</p><p>In the third quarter of 2019, the Company changed the method used for calculating diluted book value per share (\"DBVPS\") to the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the Company computes the number of new shares that can potentially be created by unexercised in-the-money warrants and options. The Company then assumes that the proceeds received from the exercise of in-the-money warrant and/or options are used to repurchase outstanding common shares in the market. The number of additional shares that are added back to the basic book value per share denominator is equal to the difference between (i) the number of new shares potentially created by unexercised in-the-money warrants and options and (ii) the number of shares that could be repurchased in the market. The previous method used did not contemplate repurchasing shares in the market, which the Company believes overstated the impact of dilution. This change had no impact on basic book value per share. The following table shows the revised DBVPS compared to the DBVPS as previously presented:</p><p>Basic book value per share and diluted book value per share are non-GAAP financial measures and there are no comparable GAAP measures. Basic book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated by dividing shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders by the number of common shares outstanding, excluding the total number of unvested restricted shares, at period end. Diluted book value per share, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure and is calculated using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, we assume that proceeds received from in-the-money options and/or warrants exercised are used to repurchase common shares in the market. For unvested restricted shares with a performance condition, we include the unvested restricted shares for which we consider vesting to be probable. Change in basic book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in basic book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period book value per share. Change in diluted book value per share is calculated by taking the difference in diluted book value per share for the periods presented divided by the beginning of period diluted book value per share. We believe that long-term growth in diluted book value per share is the most important measure of our financial performance because it allows our management and investors to track over time the value created by the retention of earnings.\u00a0 In addition, we believe this metric is used by investors because it provides a basis for comparison with other companies in our industry that also report a similar measure.</p><p>Return on Beginning Shareholders' Equity Attributable to Third Point Re Common Shareholders</p><p>Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders, as presented, is a non-GAAP financial measure. Return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) available to Third Point Re common shareholders by the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders. We believe that return on beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders is an important measure because it assists our management and investors in evaluating the Company's profitability. When we repurchase our common shares, we also adjust the beginning shareholders' equity attributable to Third Point Re common shareholders for the impact of the shares repurchased on a weighted average basis. For a period where there was a loss, this adjustment decreased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity and for a period where there was a gain, this adjustment increased the stated returns on beginning shareholders' equity.</p><p>Key Performance Indicator</p><p>Net Investment Return on Investments Managed by Third Point LLC</p><p>Net investment return represents the return on our net investments managed by Third Point LLC, net of fees. The net investment return on net investments managed by Third Point LLC is the percentage change in value of a dollar invested over the reporting period on our net investment assets managed by Third Point LLC.\u00a0Effective August 31, 2018, we transitioned from our separately managed account structure to investing in TP Fund.\u00a0In addition, collateral assets and certain other investment assets, including fixed income securities, are managed by Third Point LLC. The net investment return reflects the combined results of investments managed on behalf of Third Point Re BDA and Third Point Re USA prior to the transition date of August 31, 2018 and the investments in TP Fund, collateral assets and certain other investment assets subsequent to the date of transition. Prior to the transition date of August 31, 2018, the stated return was net of noncontrolling interests and net of withholding taxes, which were presented as a component of income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income (loss). Net investment return is the key indicator by which we measure the performance of Third Point LLC, TP Fund's investment manager.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://c212.net/c/img/favicon.png?sn=NY32517&amp;sd=2020-02-27\"/> View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/third-point-re-announces-fourth-quarter-2019-earnings-results-301012960.html</p><p>SOURCE Third Point Reinsurance Ltd.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=NY32517&amp;Transmission_Id=202002271610PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY32517&amp;DateId=20200227\"/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRNEWS-NY3251720200227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRNEWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9M-6Y61-DXP3-R3F8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8054</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3374\"/><timeReceived>4:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 PR Newswire Association LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PR Newswire</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Tournament organizers have been advised that Saturday's public transport in match areas will be shut down and warned all fans to stay indoors on Saturday.</p><p>The Pool C game was due to be played outside of Tokyo at 4:15 p.m., local time Saturday, around when the storm is expected to make a direct landfall at strengths equivalent to a Category Two level storm. Toyota, around 225 kilometers (140 miles) west of Tokyo, is also expected to be highly impacted by the storm.</p><p>On Saturday, \"conditions in Japan will deteriorate through the day with the worst moving through central Japan late Saturday into Sunday local time,\" said CNN meteorologist Monica Garrett.</p><p>\"While making every possible effort to put in place a contingency plan that would enable all of Saturday's matches to be played, it would be grossly irresponsible to leave teams, fans, volunteers and other tournament personnel exposed during what is predicted to be a severe typhoon,\" Gilpin said.</p><p>\"We fully appreciate that England, France, New Zealand and Italy fans will be disappointed, but we trust they will appreciate that their safety must come first. They will be entitled to a full refund on their match tickets. Our message for all fans in Japan for Rugby World Cup is to heed all official advice, stay indoors throughout Saturday and do not attempt to travel on the day.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20191009rugby-world-cup-cancel-intl-hnk1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7J-4DV1-JBPX-X3HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"328\"/><timeReceived>11:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 9, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>rugby-world-cup-cancel-intl-hnk</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096SZ</classCode><className>PRESS CONFERENCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000CFE3</classCode><className>SPORTS FANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N515120CC</classCode><className>TELEVISION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N515210GM</classCode><className>CABLE TELEVISION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX170</classCode><className>TOKYO, JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Company's loss estimate is consistent with industry insured losses of approximately $11 billion and its expected market share of less than 1% for this catastrophe event.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Company's loss estimate is based on its ground-up assessment of losses from individual contracts and treaties exposed to the affected regions, including preliminary information from clients, brokers and loss adjusters. Industry insured loss estimates, market share analyses and catastrophe modeling analyses were also taken into account where appropriate. Due to the nature of this event, including the complexity of loss assessment and factors contributing to the losses, and the preliminary nature of the information available to prepare this estimate, the actual net ultimate loss for this event may differ materially from this current estimate. The additional complexity caused by the multiple catastrophic events that have occurred in Japan in recent months, together with the expectation of a relatively high proportion of flood related losses attributable to Typhoon Hagibis, are also likely to lead to increased uncertainty surrounding the estimated net ultimate loss for this event.</p><p>About AXIS Capital</p><p>AXIS Capital, through its operating subsidiaries, is a global provider of specialty lines insurance and treaty reinsurance with shareholders' equity at September 30, 2019 of $5.6 billion and locations in Bermuda, the United States, Europe, Singapore, Canada and the Middle East.

Japan and Scotland are due to meet in Yokohama on Sunday, though the game remains in doubt because of the devastating storm. </p><p>Typhoon Hagibis made landfall on Saturday night local time as hurricane-force winds battered infrastructure and killed two people. Tokyo and nearby Yokohama are at the center of the storm. </p><p>Weekend games between New Zealand and Italy as well as France and England had already been canceled Thursday, with Saturday's Formula One qualifying at the Japanese Grand Prix also canceled. </p><p>If Japan and Scotland are not able to play, the game will be declared a 0-0 draw with both teams receiving two points. Ireland would then play South Africa in the next round as group winners with Japan taking on New Zealand.</p><p>A resounding win</p><p>Not that Ireland were concerned with that for the 80 minutes against Samoa in Fukuoka, western Japan, some 1,100 kilometers away from Tokyo. Having already lost once in this tournament -- a 19-12 defeat to Japan that few saw coming -- coach Joe Schmidt's team would have been eager to lay down a marker ahead of the knockout phase. </p><p>The first score came after just three minutes when captain and hooker Rory Best finished from the back of a driving maul.</p><p>Winger Jacob Stockdale received the Samoan restart and charged up the field where he was clattered by Seilala Lam. The referee deemed the challenge illegal and replays justified the brandished yellow card for a high shoulder.</p><p>The Irish forwards enjoyed the man advantage and dictated the early exchanges. It was another front-rower who dotted down when Tadhg Furlong scored his second try of the competition on 10 minutes. The burly prop gave a show-and-go before finishing from eight meters out.</p><p>The game threatened to become a rout when Sexton -- who scored 18 points on the night -- was on the receiving end of a delightful inside ball from his fullback Jordan Larmour and had an easy run to the line. Sexton converted and the score read 21-0 after 21 minutes.</p><p>That trio of tries finally galvanized the Pacific Islanders who won a line out in Irish territory and worked through several phases. Captain Jack Lam burrowed and retrieved the ball two meters out and was too strong for his opposing No. 8 CJ Stander to score.</p><p>That proved to be a momentum shift and the pendulum swung even further towards the men in blue when Ireland's inside center Bundee Aki was shown a straight red for a dangerous tackle on fly-half Ulupano Seuteni. There appeared no malice in the act, but referees are under strict instruction to harshly punish errant shoulders that make contact with the head or face. </p><p>Ireland were forced to consolidate with a man down but grew back in the game as the halftime whistle approached. The bonus point for four tries scored was made safe just before the interval when Sexton had his second after a well worked move from a scrum. He missed the extra points from the conversion as he led his team into the break 26-5 ahead.</p><p>Sterner tests await</p><p>Though depleted in the backs, the Irish forwards continued to dominate and they folded the Samoan pack from a scrum on 48 minutes. The resulting penalty was quickly taken and neat interplay saw Larmour achieve a deserving five-pointer. Sexton slotted the extras in his last act of the match. </p><p>Two more Irish tries -- from Stander and replacement Andrew Conway -- meant the 2018 Six Nations champions registered their highest score in Japan.</p><p>Ireland will face tougher opposition in the next round as it seeks to reach the semifinals of a World Cup for the first time in its history. New Zealand's All Blacks or South Africa's Springboks await. Which one will be determined by the eventual outcome in Japan and Scotland. </p><p>TM &amp; \u00a9 2019 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

O'Donnell, President and Chief Executive Officer of RenaissanceRe, commented: \"We begin 2021 looking forward and fully focused on executing our strategy into an attractive reinsurance market. The book of business that we wrote at the January 1 renewal is larger and more efficient, with increased expected profitability, and we anticipate further opportunities to improve it over the course of the year. While 2020 brought many challenges, I am particularly proud of the accomplishments of our employees and the continuity of our culture during a difficult year marked by record-breaking weather events and the stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic.\"</p><p>Fourth Quarter of 2020 Summary</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Net negative impact on net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $166.1 million resulting from the Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses (as defined in the table below) and $172.7 million from losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Gross premiums written increased $30.0 million, or 3.3%, to $935.5 million, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by an increase of $63.3 million in the Property segment, partially offset by a decrease of $33.3 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Underwriting loss of $151.7 million and a combined ratio of 114.7% in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to an underwriting loss of $65.2 million and a combined ratio of 106.7% in the fourth quarter of 2019. The Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $130.0 million and had a combined ratio of 125.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Casualty and Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $21.4 million and had a combined ratio of 104.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020. The Company's underwriting result in the fourth quarter of 2020 was principally impacted by the Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses and the COVID-19 losses, both of which were primarily in the Property segment. The Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $239.8 million and added 23.4 percentage points to the combined ratio. The COVID-19 losses resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $237.2 million and added 23.2 percentage points to the combined ratio.<br/><br/>Partially offsetting the impact of the Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses and COVID-19 losses was favorable development on prior accident years of $128.4 million, primarily related to large loss events in 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as favorable movements in other assumed losses and ceded recoveries. The favorable development on prior accident years reduced the combined ratio by 12.5 percentage points and was principally in the Property segment.<br/><br/>In comparison, the Company's underwriting results in the fourth quarter of 2019 were principally impacted by Typhoon Hagibis and losses associated with aggregate loss contracts in 2019 (the \"2019 Aggregate Losses\"), which together had a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $237.0 million and added 25.0 percentage points to the combined ratio.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Total investment result was a gain of $340.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, generating an annualized total investment return of 6.6%, compared to $130.6 million and an annualized total investment return of 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>Net Negative Impact</p><p>Net negative impact includes the sum of estimates of net claims and claim expenses incurred, earned reinstatement premiums assumed and ceded, earned and lost profit commissions and redeemable noncontrolling interest. The Company's estimates of net negative impact are based on a review of its potential exposures, preliminary discussions with certain counterparties and actuarial modeling techniques. The Company's actual net negative impact, both individually and in the aggregate, may vary from these estimates, perhaps materially. Changes in these estimates will be recorded in the period in which they occur.</p><p>Meaningful uncertainty remains regarding the estimates and the nature and extent of the losses from catastrophe events, driven by the magnitude and recent nature of each event, the geographic areas impacted by the events, relatively limited claims data received to date, the contingent nature of business interruption and other exposures, potential uncertainties relating to reinsurance recoveries and other factors inherent in loss estimation, among other things.</p><p>The Company continues to evaluate industry trends and its own potential exposure associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and expects historically significant industry losses to emerge over time as the full impact of the pandemic and its effects on the global economy are realized. Among other things, the Company continues to actively monitor information received from or reported by clients, brokers, industry actuaries, regulators, courts, and others, and to assess that information in the context of its own portfolio. The Company's loss estimates represent its best estimate of incurred losses based on currently available information, and actual losses may vary materially from these estimates.</p><p>Weather-Related Large Loss Events</p><p>The financial data in the table below provides additional information detailing the net negative impact of the Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses on the Company's consolidated financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"26\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\"

The net negative impact on underwriting result had a 23.2 percentage point impact on the consolidated combined ratio, and is comprised of net claims and claims expenses incurred of $263.9 million, offset by net reinstatement premiums earned and earned profit commissions of $26.7 million. The net negative impact on underwriting result was $227.6 million in the Property Segment, principally representing the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported with respect to exposures such as business interruption coverage, and $9.6 million in the Casualty and Specialty segment.</p><p>Underwriting Results by Segment</p><p>Property Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written in the Property segment were $308.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $63.3 million, or 25.8%, compared to $245.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $59.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $14.3 million, or 31.9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.

The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships and new opportunities across a number of the Company's underwriting platforms.</p><p>Ceded premiums written in the Property segment were $28.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $26.5 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in ceded premiums written in the fourth quarter of 2020 primarily reflected business ceded to third-party investors in the Company's managed vehicles, principally RenaissanceRe Upsilon Fund Ltd.</p><p>The Property segment incurred an underwriting loss of $130.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to an underwriting loss of $87.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 105.7%, an underwriting expense ratio of 19.9% and a combined ratio of 125.6%, compared to 90.8%, 27.8% and 118.6%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>The Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 2020 were principally impacted by the Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on underwriting result of $232.7 million and added 46.7 percentage points to the combined ratio, and COVID-19 losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the underwriting result of $227.6 million and added 45.9 percentage points to the combined ratio. Partially offsetting the impact of the Q4 2020 Weather-Related Large Losses and COVID-19 losses was favorable development on prior accident years of $125.8 million, primarily related to large loss events in 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as favorable movements in other assumed losses and ceded recoveries. This favorable development reduced the Property segment combined ratio by 24.8 percentage points. In addition, the underwriting expense ratio in the fourth quarter of 2020 decreased 7.9 percentage points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a decrease in both the acquisition expense ratio and the operating expense ratio. The decrease in the acquisition expense ratio was primarily driven by changes in estimated commission expense, while the decrease in the operating expense ratio was primarily driven by reduced compensation expenses and an increase in management fees.</p><p>In comparison, the fourth quarter of 2019 was impacted by Typhoon Hagibis and the 2019 Aggregate Losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $235.5 million and added 52.5 percentage points to the Property segment combined ratio.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty Segment</p><p>Gross premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment were $627.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $33.3 million, or 5.0%, as compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. This decrease was primarily due to the non-renewal of certain business, including business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR, as well as changes in premium estimates.</p><p>The Casualty and Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $21.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to income of $20.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 70.0%, an underwriting expense ratio of 34.1% and a combined ratio of 104.1%, compared to 67.3%, 28.6% and 95.9%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>The increase in the net claims and claim expense ratio of 2.7 percentage points was principally the result of higher current accident year losses in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The net claims and claim expense ratio was impacted by net losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The underwriting expense ratio in the Casualty and Specialty segment increased 5.5 percentage points, to 34.1%, in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, driven by a higher acquisition ratio, partly offset by a lower operating expense ratio. The increase in the acquisition ratio was principally due to changes in estimated commission expense and the effects of purchase accounting amortization in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to the acquisition of TMR which decreased the acquisition ratio in the prior year period. The decrease in the operating expense ratio was primarily due to lower compensation expenses in the fourth quarter of 2020.</p><p>Other Items</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Company's total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains on investments, was a gain of $340.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a gain of $130.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, an increase of $209.9 million.

resulted in a net negative impact on net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders of $286.6 million, which reflects a net negative impact on underwriting result of $351.9 million, offset by redeemable noncontrolling interest of $65.4 million. The net negative impact on underwriting result had a 8.9 percentage point impact on the consolidated combined ratio, and is comprised of net claims and claims expenses incurred of $385.6 million, offset by net reinstatement premiums earned and earned profit commissions of $33.6 million. The net negative impact on underwriting result was $235.0 million in the Property segment, principally representing the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported with respect to exposures such as business interruption coverage, and $117.0 million for the Casualty and Specialty segment, primarily representing the cost of claims incurred but not yet reported with respect to exposures such as event contingency and event-based casualty covers.</p><p>Underwriting Results by Segment</p><p>Property Segment</p><p>In 2020, gross premiums written in the Property segment increased $568.2 million, or 23.4%, to $3.0 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in 2019.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business were $1.9 billion in 2020, an increase of $291.3 million, or 18.3%, compared to 2019. The increase in gross premiums written in the catastrophe class of business in 2020 was primarily driven by expanded participation on existing transactions, certain new transactions, rate improvements, and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Gross premiums written in the other property class of business were $1.1 billion in 2020, an increase of $276.8 million, or 33.1%, compared to 2019. The increase in gross premiums written in the other property class of business was primarily driven by growth from existing relationships, new opportunities across a number of the Company's underwriting platforms, and business acquired as a result of the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Ceded premiums written in the Property segment were $961.9 million in 2020, an increase of $185.2 million, or 23.8%, compared to 2019. The increase in ceded premiums written reflected business ceded to third-party investors in the Company's managed vehicles, primarily RenaissanceRe Upsilon Fund Ltd., as well as an overall increase in ceded purchases as part of the Company's gross-to-net strategy.</p><p>The Property segment generated underwriting income of $11.2 million in 2020, compared to underwriting income of $209.3 million in 2019. In 2020, the Property segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 74.2%, an underwriting expense ratio of 25.2% and a combined ratio of 99.4%, compared to 59.3%, 27.8% and 87.1%, respectively, in 2019.</p><p>The Property segment underwriting result and combined ratio in 2020 were principally impacted by the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on underwriting result of $651.9 million and added 35.0 percentage points to the combined ratio, and COVID-19 losses, which resulted in a net negative impact on underwriting result of $235.0 million and added 12.3 percentage points to the combined ratio. Partially offsetting the impact of the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and COVID-19 losses was favorable development on prior accident years of $157.3 million, primarily related to large loss events in 2019, 2018 and 2017, as well as favorable movements in other assumed losses and ceded recoveries. This favorable development reduced the Property segment combined ratio by 8.1 percentage points. In comparison, 2019 was principally impacted by the 2019 Large Loss Events, which resulted in a net negative impact on the Property segment underwriting result of $414.4 million and a corresponding increase in the Property segment combined ratio of 26.7 percentage points.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty Segment</p><p>In 2020, gross premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment increased $430.3 million, or 18.1%, to $2.8 billion, compared to $2.4 billion in 2019. The increase was principally due to growth from new and existing business opportunities written in the current and prior periods across various classes of business within the segment, and business acquired in connection with the acquisition of TMR.</p><p>Ceded premiums written in the Casualty and Specialty segment were $747.9 million in 2020, an increase of $98.4 million, or 15.1%, compared to 2019. The increase in ceded premiums written is primarily driven by an increase in gross premiums written subject to the Company's retrocessional quota share reinsurance programs.</p><p>The Company's Casualty and Specialty segment incurred an underwriting loss of $87.5 million in 2020, compared to underwriting income of $46.0 million in 2019. The underwriting loss in 2020 was primarily driven by COVID-19 losses. In 2020, the Casualty and Specialty segment generated a net claims and claim expense ratio of 73.8%, an underwriting expense ratio of 30.5% and a combined ratio of 104.3%, compared to 66.1%, 31.2% and 97.3%, respectively, in 2019.</p><p>The increase in the Company's Casualty and Specialty segment's combined ratio was driven by an increase in the net claims and claim expense ratio. The increase in the Casualty and Specialty segment net claims and claim expense ratio was principally due to the COVID-19 losses, which contributed 6.1 percentage points to the 7.7 percentage point increase in the net claims and claim expense ratio in 2020, compared to 2019. The underwriting expense ratio in the Casualty and Specialty segment decreased 0.7 percentage points, to 30.5%, in 2020, compared to 31.2% in 2019, due to a decrease in the operating expense ratio principally as a result of improved operating leverage.</p><p>Other Items</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests in 2020 was $230.7 million, compared to $201.5 million in 2019, an increase of $29.2 million, due to improved performance from Medici and Vermeer, partially offset by lower underlying performance in DaVinci which was negatively impacted by the 2020 Weather-Related Large Loss Events and the COVID-19 losses.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>In 2020, total fee income increased by $31.0 million, to $145.2 million, compared to $114.2 million in 2019, primarily driven by an increase in performance fee income due to favorable prior year reserve development which benefited certain of the Company's managed funds, and an increase in management fee income due to an increase in the dollar value of third-party capital managed by the Company.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>The Company's total investment result, which includes the sum of net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, was $1.2 billion in 2020, compared to $838.3 million in 2019, an increase of $336.4 million. The increase was primarily driven by net realized and unrealized gains on investments of $820.6 million in 2020, compared to $414.1 million in 2019. The net realized and unrealized gains on investments in 2020 were driven by net realized and unrealized gains on fixed maturity investments and equity investments trading, including gains from the strategic investment portfolio. Also driving the investment result for 2020 were higher average invested assets primarily resulting from capital raised during 2020 through the Company's common share offerings, described above, and through the Company's managed joint ventures and third-party capital vehicles, Upsilon RFO, Medici, Vermeer and DaVinciRe, and the subsequent investment of those funds as part of the Company's consolidated investment portfolio.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Net foreign exchange gains of $27.8 million in 2020 compared to net foreign exchange losses of $2.9 million in 2019.

The Company has provided these financial measures in previous investor communications and the Company's management believes that these measures are important to investors and other interested persons, and that investors and such other persons benefit from having a consistent basis for comparison between quarters and for comparison with other companies within the industry. These measures may not, however, be comparable to similarly titled measures used by companies outside of the insurance industry. Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these non-GAAP measures in assessing the Company's overall financial performance.</p><p>Operating (Loss) Income (Attributable) Available to RenaissanceRe Common Shareholders and Operating Return on Average Common Equity - Annualized</p><p>The Company uses \"operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders\" as a measure to evaluate the underlying fundamentals of its operations and believes it to be a useful measure of its corporate performance. \"Operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders\" as used herein differs from \"net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders,\" which the Company believes is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, by the exclusion of net realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments, excluding other investments - catastrophe bonds, net foreign exchange gains and losses, corporate expenses associated with the acquisition of TMR and the subsequent sale of RenaissanceRe (UK) Limited (\"RenaissanceRe UK\"), the income tax expense or benefit associated with these adjustments and the portion of these adjustments attributable to the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests.\" The Company's management believes that \"operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders\" is useful to investors because it more accurately measures and predicts the Company's results of operations by removing the variability arising from: fluctuations in the fair value of the Company's fixed maturity investment portfolio, equity investments trading, other investments (excluding catastrophe bonds) and investments-related derivatives; fluctuations in foreign exchange rates; corporate expenses associated with the acquisition of TMR and the subsequent sale of RenaissanceRe UK; the associated income tax expense or benefit of these adjustments; and the portion of these adjustments attributable to the Company's redeemable noncontrolling interests. The Company also uses \"operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders\" to calculate \"operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders per common share - diluted\" and \"operating return on average common equity - annualized.\" The following table is a reconciliation of: (1) net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders to \"operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders\"; (2) net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders per common share - diluted to \"operating (loss) income (attributable) available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders per common share - diluted\"; and (3) return on average common equity - annualized to \"operating return on average common equity - annualized.\" Comparative information for all prior periods has been updated to conform to the current methodology and presentation.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"16\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_15\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col8\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col9\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col10\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col11\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col12\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col13\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col14\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><colspec colname=\"col15\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col16\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col8\" namest=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\" nameend=\"col16\" namest=\"col10\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col8\" namest=\"col2\">Three months ended</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\" nameend=\"col16\" namest=\"col10\">Twelve months ended</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">(in thousands of United States Dollars, except per share amounts and percentages)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\" nameend=\"col4\" namest=\"col2\">December 31,   2020</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\" nameend=\"col8\" namest=\"col6\">December 31,   2019</entry><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\" nameend=\"col12\" namest=\"col10\">December 31,   2020</entry><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\" nameend=\"col16\" namest=\"col14\">December 31,   2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net income available to RenaissanceRe common shareholders</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">189,812</entry><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">33,773</entry><entry colname=\"col8\"/><entry colname=\"col9\"/><entry colname=\"col10\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col11\">731,482</entry><entry colname=\"col12\"/><entry colname=\"col13\"/><entry colname=\"col14\">$</entry><entry colname=\"col15\">712,042</entry><entry colname=\"col16\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjustment for net realized and unrealized gains on investments, excluding other investments -

The study analyzed 120 million forecasts from over 1,000 locations globally over a four-year period ending December 31, 2018, and AccuWeather was found to be the clear winner as the most public provider of forecasts in temperature, precipitation and wind speed forecast accuracy - a clean sweep of all categories -- for a 1-5 days-out forecast period.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/150460/accuweather_logo.jpg\"/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Read the full ForecastWatch four-year report here.</p><p>This comprehensive test analyzed data collected regarding weather forecasts in 1,108 locations around the world. For both 24-hour high- and low-temperature forecasts, AccuWeather was the most accurate provider with the lowest average of absolute error and the greater percentage of forecast accuracy within 3 degrees of actual temperature observations.</p><p>The study, which covered the period of January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018, also examined precipitation forecasts and AccuWeather's accuracy was found to be \"noticeably higher than the next four providers and significantly higher than Dark Sky,\" according to the report. \"AccuWeather stood out as the most accurate wind speed forecaster during the 48-month period of analysis\" with the lowest average absolute error, performing 28 percent better than the next closest provider. Other providers included in the report in addition to AccuWeather and Dark Sky were The Weather Channel, Weather Underground, both owned by IBM, Foreca and Intellicast.</p><p>\"We are proud to provide the most accurate and actionable forecasts availablefor our users and clients to help them make the best decisions, protect their families, reduce losses, and increase profitability, when weather is a factor,\" said Marshall Moss, AccuWeather Vice President of Forecasting and Graphics Operations. \"People as well as businesses and government agencies globally depend on AccuWeather forecasts, and this latest study from ForecastWatch proves their trust in the AccuWeather forecast is well-founded.\"</p><p>The independent analysis by ForecastWatch, the world's premier weather forecast monitoring and assessment service, provides additional clear, concrete evidence that AccuWeather's forecasts are superior to all other sources and, as a result, bring the most significant benefits to people and businesses.</p><p>\"The disruptive impact of weather on lives and businesses is significant,\" said Dr. Joel N. Myers, AccuWeather Founder and CEO. \"We are extremely proud of our track record of forecast accuracy, but the margin of exceptional value we provide goes well beyond what is demonstrated in this latest independent report. Our weather forecasts are more localized than other sources, more detailed, and extend further into the future.\"</p><p>\"The powerful combination of accuracy and detail, both in location and time, and AccuWeather's emphasis on how predicted weather conditions will impact its users and business clients, make AccuWeather's forecasts many times more valuable than our statistical advantages proven in this latest study,\" he continued.</p><p>As an example, Myers explained that while other sources may provide a weather forecast for New York City, AccuWeather forecasts are available for up to 279 different neighborhoods within New York City. \"The detail and hyper localization we offer means we deliver accuracy and value not even captured in this or any other statistical comparison,\" he said.</p><p>Notably, while AccuWeather, which makes its forecasts available free via its popular apps and accuweather.com, ranked first in temperature and precipitation forecast accuracy, Dark Sky, a weather app available at a cost to users, ranked last in both categories in this ForecastWatch study. Intellicast ranked last in wind speed forecast accuracy.</p><p>Myers added that in study after study, this latest report once again validates the important work of AccuWeather and demonstrates when users and customers choose AccuWeather, they are choosing the very best, most dependable source for the protection of life and property in the face of hazardous weather. Just prior to this ForecastWatch report, the industry tracker concluded in an18-month study ending in June 2019that AccuWeather had the most accurate weather forecasts in another victory of all categories tested - high- and low-temperature and wind speed forecast accuracy.</p><p>AccuWeather's leadership in forecast accuracy is the foundation on which all its innovative products and services are built. The patented AccuWeather MinuteCast\u00ae forecast, for example, gives users precipitation forecasts up to two hours ahead with precise start and stop times for every location. And in addition to hour-by-hour forecasts, AccuWeather offers forecasts that extend farther into the future than any other source, all the way up to 90-day forecasts that are highly popular with users who like to plan ahead.</p><p>These added benefits, explained Myers, coupled with AccuWeather's carefully crafted communication and emphasis on how forecasts impact peoples' lives and activities, make AccuWeather's forecasts uniquely valuable.</p><p>AccuWeather's proven Superior Accuracy is achieved by exclusive patented technology, the largest collection of global forecast models and data, leading-edge predictive AI and machine learning, and the best IP and procedures developed and refined over the company's 57-year history, combined with the most talented and experienced group of meteorological forecasters anywhere. AccuWeather employs more than 100 expert meteorologists who work as forecasters as well as throughout other parts of the company.</p><p>In addition to helping people remain safe and prepared, AccuWeather's weather forecasts and warnings also help thousands of businesses. AccuWeather works with more than half of the Fortune 500 companies and thousands of other businesses and government agencies globally to keep customers and employees safe, minimize losses and liability, save costs, improve efficiency and significantly outperform their competitors with uniquely valuable insights.</p><p>In business to help keep people safe, AccuWeather is dedicated to innovation and has developed many scientific breakthroughs and life-saving innovations, such as its exclusive AccuWeather RealImpact(TM) Scale for Hurricanes, a six-point scale, including a rating of less than one, to better communicate the impacts of hurricanes and tropical storms. Unlike the widely used Saffir-Simpson scale, which only uses wind speed, the RealImpact Scale incorporates a variety of factors to communicate the threat of a hurricane, such as flooding rain, storm surge and total damage and economic loss in addition to wind speed.</p><p>Some recent examples of AccuWeather's dedication to forecasting and communicating with Superior Accuracy include:</p><p>August/September 2019- Days in advance, AccuWeather correctly predicted Hurricane Dorian would be a 5 on the AccuWeather RealImpact Scale for Hurricanes when it devastated the northern Bahamas and a 2 across the southeastern United States. AccuWeather's forecasting accuracy led to a week's advance notice of the threat that wreaked havoc on the Bahamas, warning of flooding, coastal inundation, building, structural and tree damage. The company received many expressions of gratitude from emergency planners and the public for the early warnings.</p><p>October 2019- AccuWeather correctly predicted the landfall location of Super Typhoon Hagibis, which devastated the Kanto region of Japan, many days in advance, with a 6-day track error of 60 miles and a 4-day forecast that was nearly identical to the actual landfall location. Important impacts were communicated by AccuWeather including expected flash flooding, damaging winds, mudslides and travel disruptions. AccuWeather also cautioned about possible evacuations. In Tokyo, AccuWeather predicted wind gusts would be 80-100 mph and 6-12 inches of rain. Actual observations were 93 mph wind gusts and 9 inches of rain.</p><p>February 2019-Well in advance of a major snow and ice storm, AccuWeather's long-range forecasting and meteorology team warned of a northeast storm's impact as early as one week prior to the event. The company's impact-driven forecasts accurately conveyed the significant winter weather and its effect on people and businesses, including widespread power outages, slow and slippery travel conditions and a period of heavy snow and substantial buildup of ice. While there was major disruption to much of the northeast, AccuWeather accurately predicted there would be little impact in New York City, which ultimately only received 1.2 inches of snow. Other sources predicted up to 6 inches of snow.</p><p>Forbesmagazine dubbed ForecastWatch \"the JD Power of weather prediction\" and, according to Myers, these latest studies, in addition to numerous real-life examples of forecast accuracy, demonstrate once again why AccuWeather forecasts are the most trusted to provide actionable insights to help people and business better cope with the impact of weather.</p><p>About AccuWeather, Inc. and AccuWeather.com - AccuWeather, recognized and documented as the most accurate source of weather forecasts and warnings in the world, has saved tens of thousands of lives, prevented hundreds of thousands of injuries and tens of billions of dollars in property damage.

Around 140 people have been injured, and nine are missing, according to Japan's Fire Disaster and Management Agency.</p><p>The storm, which comes as the country hosts the Rugby World Cup, also meant that two matches -- England-France and New Zealand-Italy -- had to be preemptively canceled. Sunday's Pool B match between Namibia and Canada in Kamaishi was also canceled hours before it was due to take place.</p><p>A pivotal Pool A match between Japan and Scotland at 7:45 p.m. local time will go ahead, World Cup organizers said Sunday.</p><p>Evacuation advisories affect tens of millions</p><p>Evacuation advisories have been issued throughout much of the Tokyo region, affecting tens of millions of people. The Japanese capital is in lockdown, with usually busy streets abandoned amid torrential rain.</p><p>At least eight prefectures have ordered evacuations totaling 936,113 people, the FDMA said, and 292,770 households are without power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO) and Chub Electric Power Company.</p><p/><p>Meanwhile, the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport said it was considering discharging water from three dams due to heavy rain which could possible cause flooding downstream.</p><p>The storm had weakened as it approached Japan but still remained highly dangerous, with maximum winds of up to 195 kilometers per hour (122 mph) -- equivalent to a Category 3 Atlantic hurricane.</p><p>All flights to and from Tokyo and nearby airports have been canceled until at least Sunday morning. All bullet trains between Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka are also canceled, as are most non high-speed trains.</p><p>Local police said a 49-year-old man in Ichihara City, Chiba prefecture, was killed when a tornado flipped his car Saturday morning.</p><p>At least five other people, including three children, where injured as the tornado swept through the city, which lies around 30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of Tokyo, fire authorities said.</p><p/><p>Rugby chaos</p><p>While authorities made clear that the decision to cancel games was necessary to ensure the safety of players and fans, many were critical of the tournament's inability to reschedule games and apparent unpreparedness for the extreme weather -- despite the World Cup being held during typhoon season.</p><p>In canceled games, two points will be awarded to each team, in line with tournament rules. This could have an effect on who qualifies for the next round of the competition, particularly in Pool A, which includes hosts Japan.</p><p>A pivotal Pool A match between Japan and Scotland at 7:45 p.m. local time will go ahead, World Cup organizers said Sunday.</p><p>A win for Scotland would see it draw level on points with Japan, after which bonus points -- awarded for scoring four or more tries or losing within seven points -- would come into play to decide who reaches the quarterfinals.</p><p>A cancellation -- and a draw -- would see Japan qualify in second place and face New Zealand in the quarters. Ireland would top the group and face South Africa in the final eight if, as expected, it defeats Samoa. If the match goes ahead and Japan wins, it could take the theoretically easier game against the Springboks and leave Ireland to face the All Blacks.</p><p>Meanwhile, all activities scheduled for the Japanese Grand Prix were canceled Saturday, according to Formula One.

Compiled by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), parented by the\u00a0United Nations Economic and Social Council, the report documents impacts of weather and climate events on socio-economic development, human health, migration and displacement, food security and land and marine ecosystems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Described as the flagship UN study, theWMO Statement on the State of the Global Climate in 2019includes input from national meteorological and hydrological services, leading international experts, scientific institutions and United Nations agencies. It provides authoritative information for policy makers on the need for Climate Action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report confirms information in a provisional statement issued at the UN Climate Change Conference in December that 2019 was the second warmest year in the instrumental record. 2015-2019 are the five warmest years on record, and 2010-2019 the warmest decade on record. Since the 1980s, each successive decade has been warmer than any preceding decade since 1850.</p><p>The study alerts that 2019 ended with a global average temperature of 1.1\u00b0C above estimated pre-industrial levels, second only to the record set in 2016, when a very strong El Ni\u00f1o event contributed to an increased global mean temperature atop the overall warming trend.</p><p>\"We are currently way off track to meeting either the 1.5\u00b0C or 2\u00b0C targets that the Paris Agreement calls for,\" said UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres in a foreword to the report.</p><p>\"Given that greenhouse gas levels continue to increase, the warming will continue. A recent decadal forecast indicates that a new annual global temperature record is likely in the next five years. It is a matter of time,\" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas at a press conference on March 10 launching the report.</p><p>\"We just had the warmest January on record. Winter was unseasonable: mild in many parts of the northern hemisphere. Smoke and pollutants from damaging fires in Australia circumnavigated the globe, causing a spike in CO2 emissions. Reported record temperatures in Antarctica were accompanied by large-scale ice melt and the fracturing of a glacier which will have repercussions for sea level rise,\" said Mr Taalas.</p><p>\"Temperature is one indicator of ongoing climate change. Changes in the global distribution of rainfall have had a major impact on several countries. Sea levels are rising at an increasing pace, largely due to the thermal expansion of sea water as well as melting of the largest glaciers, like in Greenland and Antarctica. This is exposing coastal areas and islands to a greater risk of flooding and the submersion of low-lying areas,\" added Mr Taalas.</p><p>As the study points out, more than 90% of the excess energy accumulating in the climate system as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases goes into the ocean. In 2019, ocean heat content down to a depth of 2 kilometres exceeded the previous record highs set in 2018.</p><p>Ocean warmingtoo has widespread impacts on the climate system and contributes more than 30% of sea level rise through thermal expansion of sea water. It is altering ocean currents and indirectly altering storm tracks and melting floating ice shelves. Together with ocean acidification and deoxygenation, ocean warming can lead to dramatic changes in marine ecosystems.</p><p>In 2019, the ocean experienced on average nearly two months of unusually warm temperatures. At least 84% of the ocean experienced at least one marine heatwave.</p><p>Furthermore,in the decade 2009-2018, the ocean absorbed around 23% of annual CO2emissions, cushioning the impacts of climate change but increasing ocean acidity. The change of pH reduces the ability of marine organisms such as mussels, crustacean and corals to calcify, affecting marine life, growth and reproduction.</p><p>According to the report,deoxygenation alongside ocean warming and acidification is now seen as a major threat to ocean ecosystems and the wellbeing of people that depend on them. Coral reefs are projected to decline to 10%-30% of former cover at 1.5\u00b0C warming, and to less than 1% at 2\u00b0C warming.</p><p>The study highlights further:</p><p>Sea levelhas risen throughout the satellite altimetery record (since 1993), but the rate has increased over that time, mainly due to melting of ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica. In 2019, the global mean sea level reached its highest value on the record.</p><p>The continued long-term decline ofArctic sea icewas confirmed in 2019. The September monthly average extent (usually the lowest of the year) was the third lowest on record with the daily minimum extent tied for second lowest.</p><p>Until 2016,Antarctic sea iceextent had shown a small long-term increase. In late 2016 this was interrupted by a sudden drop in extent to extreme low values. Since then, Antarctic sea-ice extent has remained at relatively low levels.</p><p>Preliminary results from the World Glacier Monitoring Service indicate that 2018/19 was the 32nd consecutive year of negative mass balance for selected reference glaciers. Eight out of the ten most negative mass balance years were recorded since 2010.</p><p>Explaining climate-related impacts,the report devotes an extensive section to weather and climate impacts on human health, food security, migration, ecosystems and marine life. This is based on input from a wide variety of United Nations partners.</p><p>Extreme heat conditions are taking an increasing toll on human health and health systems.</p><p>In 2019, record-setting high temperatures from Australia, India, Japan, and Europe negatively affected health and well-being. In Japan, a major heat wave event resulted in over 100 deaths and an additional 18 000 hospitalizations. In France over 20 000 emergency room were recorded for heat-related illnesses between June and mid-September and during two major summer heatwaves, there were a total of 1462 excess deaths in the affected regions.</p><p>The report continued that changes in climatic conditions since 1950 are making it easier for the Aedes mosquito species to transmit dengue virus, increasing the risk of the occurrence of disease. In parallel, the global incidence of dengue has grown dramatically in recent decades, and about half of the world population is now at risk of infection. In 2019, the world experienced a large increase in dengue cases.</p><p>The other highlights of the report are:</p><p>Climate variability and extreme weather events are among the key drivers of the recent rise in global hunger and one of the leading causes of severe crises. After a decade of steady decline, hunger is on the rise again \u2013 over 820 million people suffered from hunger in 2018.</p><p>Among 33 countries affected by food crises in 2018, climate variability and weather extremes a compounding driver together with economic shocks and conflict in 26 countries and the leading driver in 12 of the 26. In light of this, the global community faces an enormous challenge to meet the Zero Hunger target of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>The food security situation deteriorated markedly in 2019 in some countries of the Greater Horn of Africa due to climate extremes, displacement, conflict and violence. By late 2019, about 22.2million people, (6.7million in Ethiopia, 3.1million in Kenya, 2.1million in Somalia, 4.5million in South Sudan, 5.8million in the Sudan) were estimated to be severely food insecure, only slightly lower than during the severe and prolonged drought in 2016-17.</p><p>There was exceptional dryness in March and much of April followed by unusually heavy rainfall and floods in October-December. The unusually heavy precipitation in late 2019 was also a factor in the severe desert locust outbreak in the Horn of Africa region - the worst in over 25 years, and the most serious in 70 years for Kenya. This is expected to spread further by June 2020 in a severe threat to food security.</p><p>More than 6.7 million new internal disaster displacements were recorded between January and June 2019, triggered by hydrometeorological events such as Cyclone Idai in Southeast Africa, Cyclone Fani in South Asia, Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean, and flooding in Iran, the Philippines and Ethiopia. This number was forecast to reach close to 22 million in 2019, up from 17.2 million in 2018. Of all natural hazards, floods and storms contributed most to displacement.</p><p>Also drought affected many parts of southeast Asia and Australia, which had its driest year on record, influenced by the strong positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole.</p><p>Southern Africa, Central America and parts of South America received abnormally low precipitation amounts.</p><p>Australia finished the year where it started: with extreme heat. The 2018-2019 summer was the hottest on record, as was December. Australia's hottest area-averaged day on record (41.9\u00b0C ) was on December 18. Australia's seven hottest days on record, and nine of the 10 hottest, occurred in 2019.</p><p>Two major heatwaves occurred in Europe in late June and late July. In France, a national record of 46.0\u00b0C (1.9\u00b0C above the previous record) was set on 28 June at V\u00e9rargues. National records were also set in Germany (42.6\u00b0C), the Netherlands (40.7\u00b0C), Belgium (41.8\u00b0C), Luxembourg (40.8\u00b0C) and the United Kingdom (38.7\u00b0C), with the heat also extending into the Nordic countries, where Helsinki had its highest temperature on record (33.2\u00b0C on 28 July).</p><p>It was also an above-average fire year in several high-latitude regions, including Siberia (Russian Federation) and Alaska (US), with fire activity occurring in some parts of the Arctic where it was previously extremely rare.</p><p>The severe drought in Indonesia and neighbouring countries led to the most significant fire season since 2015. The number of reported fires in Brazil's Amazonia region was only slightly above the 10-year average, but total fire activity in South America was the highest since 2010, with Bolivia and Venezuela among the countries with particularly active fire years.</p><p>Australia experienced an exceptionally prolonged and severe fire season in the later part of 2019 with repeated major outbreaks which continued into January 2020. As of early 2020, 33 deaths had been reported and over 2000 properties had been lost, while a total of about 7 million hectares had been burnt in New South Wales and Victoria.</p><p>Daily total wildfire CO2emissions generally followed the 2003-2018 average, according to the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service ECMWF Global Fire Assimilation System dataset. The largest increases above the 17-year mean in July, August, September and the end of December corresponding to the peak activity of wildfires in the Arctic/Siberia, Indonesia and Australia respectively.</p><p>Tropical cyclone activity globally in 2019 was above average. The Northern Hemisphere had 72 tropical cyclones. The 2018-19 Southern Hemisphere season was also above average, with 27 cyclones.</p><p>Tropical Cyclone Idai made landfall in Mozambique on 15 March as one of the strongest known on the east coast of Africa, resulting in many casualties and widespread devastation. Idai contributed to the complete destruction of close to 780000 ha of crops in Malawi, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe, further undermining a precarious food security situation in the region. The cyclone also resulted in at least 50905 displaced persons in Zimbabwe, 53237 in southern Malawi and 77019 in Mozambique.</p><p>One of the year's most intense tropical cyclones was Dorian, which made landfall with category 5 intensity in the Bahamas. The destruction was worsened as it was exceptionally slow-moving and remained near-stationary for about 24 hours.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis made landfall west of Tokyo on October 12, 2019, causing severe flooding.</p><p>The post New UN Report Warns Of Adverse Impacts Of Climate Change - Analysis appeared first on Eurasia Review.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-170897796</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YGY-M5R1-F11P-X3T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1969\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 24, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

I'd now like to turn the call over to Kevin. Kevin?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL, PRESIDENT, CEO &amp; DIRECTOR, RENAISSANCERE HOLDINGS LTD.: Thanks, Keith. Good morning, and thank you for joining today's call. We begin 2020 looking and feeling very different as a company from where we started 1 year ago. This journey charted a very intentional path designed to make RenRe not only more resilient, but also a broader, deeper and better partner to our customers.</p><p>It has been a long and deliberate track, one that is not yet complete, but successfully underway. It has taken us to where we now have a diversified book evenly divided between Property and Casualty and Specialty business. This change was at the behest of our customers who asked us to deepen and broaden our relationship with them, but also because we saw a path to greater efficiency. I am pleased with where we currently are and excited about our future course.</p><p>Last year, I started the call in January by asking 2 questions. 1 year on, I think we should ask ourselves the same 2 questions. The first is, how is our financial performance? And the second is, have we achieved the year's goals and effectively executed our strategy?</p><p>Starting with question 1, how is our financial performance? We grew book value per share by 15.7% and tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends by 17.9%. For the year, our return on equity was 14.1%, and our operating return on equity was 8%. In our Casualty segment, we generated a consistent diversifying underwriting profit. Bob will discuss our financial results in more detail later, but I believe we've performed well, especially against a difficult background.</p><p>In 2019, our industry experienced approximately $75 billion of insured catastrophe losses, including Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis in Japan, and Hurricane Dorian in the Caribbean. In addition, loss creep on prior year events continued to plague the industry.</p><p>In Casualty lines, the market is recognizing rate is required as losses are being impacted by social inflation from exponentially increasing jury verdicts and adverse development on recent prior accident years. For the industry, third-party capital was constrained in 2019 due to poor returns, mounting loss creep and concerns over climate change. Against this backdrop, we deployed more capital, both in respect to our own capital as well as the capital we manage on behalf of our partners.</p><p>Our partner capital increased by $1.3 billion in 2019, with an additional $525 million raised for the January 1, 2020, renewal. This highlights our ability to procure the most efficient capital for multiple sources and provides us considerable underwriting capital and financial flexibility heading into what we expect to be the best market opportunities we've seen in years. So in answer to the first question, I'm satisfied with our financial performance and the returns we have generated in 2019.</p><p>Moving on to question 2, how -- have we achieved the year's goals and effectively executed our strategy? We began the year with several goals. First was quickly and effectively integrating TMR's people, systems and risk into RenRe. Second was organically growing our business in a strengthening market, and third was increasing the operational efficiency of our organization by growing operating and corporate expenses slower than premiums.</p><p>I'm proud to report we outperformed on these goals. Bob will update you on the TMR integration, but it is essentially complete. An important element of the integration was to continue executing our strategy and organically growing the business. As the markets improved, we focused on expanding and deploying more capital. Finally, our operational and capital leverage continued to improve. And over the previous 3 years, we have more than doubled our gross premiums written while only growing shareholders' equity by 22% and increasing run rate expenses by only 13%.</p><p>Just as critical as accomplishing these goals effectively was doing so expediently. In 2019, we moved quickly and efficiently to position ourselves to execute into an improving market. Most of the heavy lifting is now behind us, and we have the increased scale, better tools, superior access to risk and financial resources necessary to outperform in 2020. So in conclusion, 2019 was an exceptional year when viewed against these strategic objectives.</p><p>I'll provide more details on the January 1 renewal and opportunities we are expecting in 2020 later in the call, but first, let me turn it over to Bob to talk about our financials. Bob?</p><p>ROBERT QUTUB, EXECUTIVE VP &amp; CFO, RENAISSANCERE HOLDINGS LTD.: Thanks, Kevin, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start off by saying we had a good year. We executed strongly, both financially and operationally during the quarter and the year. Today, I will divide my remarks between our fourth quarter and year-end 2019 results. I'll first discuss our consolidated financial performance before moving on to our segment results, investment portfolio returns, and finally, capital activities.</p><p>Starting with our consolidated results and beginning with the fourth quarter, where our annualized return on average common equity was 2.5%, and our annualized operating return on average common equity was 1.7%. Gross premiums written for the quarter were $905 million, up $358 million or 65% from the comparable quarter last year. About 2/3 of this was organic growth. We reported net income for the quarter of $34 million or $0.77 per diluted common share.</p><p>Our operating income was $23 million or $0.52 per diluted common share. Operating income excludes $18 million of net realized and unrealized gains on investments, and $5.7 million of transaction, integration and compensation expenses associated with the TMR integration. We had an underwriting loss for the quarter of $65 million and reported an overall combined ratio of 106.7%.</p><p>Now before moving on to our full year results, I'd like to provide more clarity on how the noncontrolling interest from our joint ventures impact our financial statements. Each quarter, we fully consolidate the results of DaVinci, Medici and Vermeer. And since we do not own 100% of these entities, we remove the portion of their returns that we do not own.</p><p>For example, 100% of DaVinci's results are included in our underwriting and investment income. However, because we only own 22% of DaVinci, we removed 78% of DaVinci's returns from our net income. This elimination is reflected in the income statement as the net loss or income attributable to noncontrolling interest. Therefore, when these ventures produce positive returns, the elimination of the income attributable to third-party investors is reflected as a reduction to our net income. Likewise, when these ventures have negative results, the elimination is reflected as an increase to our net income.</p><p>We have added a new page to the financial supplement that provides a breakdown of the components of the noncontrolling interest adjustment. This has always been reflected in our 10-K and 10-Q, but given the increasing significance, we thought it would be helpful if we included it in the financial supplement. As you will see in the new disclosure, for the quarter, we reflected a positive noncontrolling interest of $2.6 million. While both Vermeer and Medici produced positive returns for the quarter, these were more than offset by negative returns in DaVinci, resulting in a net overall loss for these vehicles, which is reflected as a positive noncontrolling interest adjustment.</p><p>Now moving on to the full year 2019, where we grew our book value per share by 15.7%, and tangible book value per share plus accumulated dividends by 17.9%. We realized a return on average common equity of 14.1%, and an operating return on average common equity of 8%. We reported net income of $712 million for the year, or $16.29 per diluted common share, and our operating income was $403 million or $9.13 per diluted common share. In 2019, our overall combined ratio was 92.3%. Net premiums earned for 2019 were $3.3 billion, up $1.4 billion or 69% year-over-year.</p><p>Now before moving to our segment results, I'd like to update you on our operational efficiency. Our direct expenses, which are the sum of our operational and corporate expenses, totaled $82 million for the quarter, which is an increase of $11 million from the fourth quarter of 2018. However, the ratio of direct expense to net premiums earned was 8.5%, a decrease of almost 4 percentage points for the same period last year. Likewise, for the year, direct expenses were up by $105 million to $317 million, while the ratio of direct expense to net premiums earned decreased by 1.2 percentage points in 2019 to 9.5%. Adjusting for the impact of $50 million in TMR integration costs incurred in 2019, direct expenses would have been $267 million for the year or 8% of net premiums earned.</p><p>Now moving on to our segments, and starting with our Property segment. Property gross premiums written grew by $45 million or 23% over the comparative quarter to $245 million. This growth was driven by an increase in other property of $109 million. The growth in other property was partially offset by a $64 million decline in property cat gross premiums written. We do not typically write much property cat in the fourth quarter outside of reinstatement premiums, which were down this year, reflective of loss activity and business mix. Other property is becoming a larger percentage of our overall property book, and for the year, it makes up 34% of property gross premiums written compared to 23% in 2018.</p><p>As a reminder, we access proportional business through our other property book, and due to the nature of this business, it carries a higher acquisition expense ratio. As this business becomes a greater part of the Property segment, acquisition expenses may increase. Our Property segment reported an underwriting loss of $87 million and a combined ratio of 118.6% in the fourth quarter, with property catastrophe reporting a 141% combined ratio and other property reporting an 88.6% combined ratio.</p><p>Current quarter losses in property cat were primarily driven by Typhoon Hagibis. On our last call, we announced an estimated net negative impact for the fourth quarter related to Typhoon Hagibis of approximately $175 million. We remain comfortable with this estimate. As you saw in our financials, we have allocated $128 million of net negative impact specifically to Hagibis, with the remainder being incurred under our aggregate covers. So to be clear, our estimate has not changed.</p><p>We have also reallocated $22 million in net negative impact from the third quarter events to 2019 aggregate losses. While this reallocation primarily relates to Typhoon Faxai, our estimates for both Faxai and Dorian remain the same at $103 million and $52 million, respectively.</p><p>For the year, gross premiums written in our Property segment grew by $670 million or 38%. This broke down to growth of $246 million or 18% in our property catastrophe class of business, and $424 million or 103% in our other property class of business. For the full year, our Property segment reported underwriting income of $209 million and a combined ratio of 87%.</p><p>Now moving on to the Casualty segment, where our gross premiums written were up $313 million or 90% in the fourth quarter of 2019 over the comparative quarter. Approximately 2/3 of this quarterly growth was organic. We reported underwriting income of $21 million and a combined ratio of 95.9% for the quarter. The current and accident year loss ratio for the Casualty segment was 68%. For the year, gross premiums written were up $827 million or 53%. About half of this growth was organic. The segment reported underwriting income of $46 million and a combined ratio of 97% for the year.</p><p>Now moving to fee income, where total fee income was $13 million for the quarter, with management fees contributing $24 million and performance fees being negative $11 million. The negative performance fees were driven by the cat activity in the quarter, primarily Hagibis, which triggered the reversal of previously accrued performance fees. Overall, our quarterly fee income was up by $5 million relative to the comparable quarter. For the year, total fee income was $114 million, up $24 million from 2018.</p><p>Now turning to investments. We posted total investment results of $131 million for the fourth quarter, which includes mark-to-market gains of $18 million. For the year, total investment results were $838 million, with $415 million in mark-to-market gains. Our fixed maturity and short-term investment return for the quarter was $97 million, and overall net investment income for the quarter was $113 million, almost flat compared to the third quarter. This quarter, we have enhanced our disclosures in the financial supplement to include retained total investment result. This delineates the net investment income and mark-to-market results that apply to our retained investment portfolio. In short, this is the quarterly investment return that contributes to our net income, and the remainder is what belongs to our partner capital.</p><p>Of the $113 million of the net investment income, we retained $91 million, a retention of about 80%, which is consistent with the full year 2019 and 2018. In the fourth quarter, our managed investment portfolio reported yield to maturity of 2.1% and duration of 2.9 years on assets of $15.7 billion, while our retained investment portfolio reported yield to maturity of 2.2% and duration of 3.6 years on assets of $11.2 billion.</p><p>Now moving on to capital management. The fourth quarter was once again active from a capital management perspective. As Kevin mentioned, we had a successful capital raise in preparation for 1/1 renewals, raising over $525 million in Upsilon and Medici, effective January 2020. This is in addition to the $1.3 billion in partner capital that we raised across our various joint ventures in 2019.</p><p>Looking forward to 2020. On March 15, the $250 million tranche of 5.75% senior notes will mature. As a reminder, last year, we issued $400 million of 3.6% senior notes due in 2029. Consequently, we remain in a strong capital and liquidity position going into 2020, and with an improving interest rate environment, anticipate additional opportunities to deploy capital into the business. As such, we did not repurchase any of our shares during the fourth quarter.</p><p>Before I turn it back over to Kevin, I want to update you on a change that we'll be making to our operating income calculation starting in the first quarter of 2020. As you know, operating income excludes net realized and unrealized gains on investments attributable to shareholders, transaction, integration and compensation expenses associated with the TMR acquisition, and income tax impact associated with these exclusions. With the addition of TMR and their nondollar balance sheet, we will be refining our methodology to also exclude foreign exchange gains and losses. While we hedge our economic FX exposure, we sometimes experience accounting-driven volatility that, over time, should be relatively neutral in terms of bottom line impact.</p><p>And finally, I'd like to update you on our TMR acquisition. With the 1/1 renewal behind us, we have re-underwritten effectively all of the TMR book, renewing the deals which met our strategic and financial thresholds. We exceeded the 2 primary metrics that we set out at the time of the acquisition as we retain greater than $700 million of TMR premium and will achieve an after-tax earnings run rate contribution greater than $100 million by the end of Q1 2020. When I think about the integration, it's the operational successes behind the financial ones that are even more important. We have a single view of risk. Our key systems are integrated. We have deepened our bench strength, and our people are working extremely well together. Going into 2020, we will benefit from the increased scale and operational efficiency that TMR has brought us. Because of the significant time and effort we spent on integration activities in 2019, we are free from distraction and well positioned to capture opportunities in this improving market.</p><p>And with that, I'll now turn it back over to Kevin for more details on our segments.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Thanks, Bob. I'll divide my comments between our Property segment and our Casualty and Specialty segment, starting with a discussion of 2019 results and then moving to the January 1 renewal and opportunities for 2020. After that, we'll take your questions.</p><p>For the full year in 2019, we grew gross written premiums in our Property segment by $670 million or 38% to $2.4 billion. A substantial portion was organic. Particularly, the 103% growth in other property reflects the opportunity that we've seen in E&amp;S property markets. We experienced a number of large natural catastrophes in the quarter. Last quarter, we preannounced and continue to hold $175 million net negative impact from Typhoon Hagibis, which was based on a $15 billion industry loss. We are monitoring the reports on Hagibis and expect to learn more as we approach the 4/1 renewal. And if the facts change, so will our estimate.</p><p>Last year, I discussed the impact of Hurricane Irma's loss creep, and noted it would be, by itself, one of the largest events in 2018. Fast forward 1 year, and we continue to experience billions of dollars of loss creep in Florida, and not only from Hurricane Irma, which made landfall 2.5 years ago, but now also from Hurricane Michael, which struck almost 1.5 years ago. Suffice it to say, we have not yet realized the benefits of last year's AOB reforms. This is deeply disappointing.</p><p>Several Florida domestics are now close to exhausting their 2017 private market reinsurance. This is yet another indicator of the deep structural problems afflicting Florida. In addition, as I discussed last quarter, Florida is increasingly exposed to the effects of climate change, such as rising sea levels, increased rainfall and flooding, and intensifying hurricanes. Although it is easy to talk about the June renewal, I can say that these 2 factors are materially impacting our view of Florida and will result in the need for substantial rate increases.</p><p>Florida has always been and will always be an important market for RenRe. We have been leaders in this business for decades. That said, we reduced our exposure to Florida domestic companies last year and are prepared to do so again if rate increases do not meet our return hurdles. At the same time, we are exploring additional means for accessing wind risk in this market.</p><p>2019 was an active year for Japan, with Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis causing widespread damage. Loss creep from Typhoon Jebi also continues to be an issue. Our team of scientists, meteorologists and engineers believe that climate change will further increase the natural catastrophe risk Japan faces. Sea level rise will intensify. Storm surge, rainfalls will increase and average typhoon intensity will be stronger, and there will be more typhoons of Category 4 intensity or greater. Typhoons Hagibis and Faxai are likely portents of the impact that climate change will have on Japan. We have underwritten the Japanese market for 25 years and greatly value the long-term relationships we have developed with our clients.</p><p>Taken as a whole, however, the unprecedented scale of storms in Japan over the last 2 years has caused us to increase our view of typhoon risk. Unfortunately, the price increases the Japanese market experienced last year have been more than offset by the post-renewal loss creep from Typhoon Jebi. Substantial rate increases are needed at 4/1 to accurately reflect Japan's elevated level of risk.</p><p>As I discussed on our Q3 conference call, the property market experienced a V-shaped renewal at January 1. Both primary insurance and retro rates were up materially, but reinsurance rates on loss-free business were only up slightly. Loss-affected business, such as treaties exposed to California wildfires, experienced material rate increases at renewal, and complex commercial risks were more stressed.</p><p>A key element of our strategy is to build options to access the full spectrum of risk, which allows us to adjust our portfolio mix between different classes of business, increasing on the best and decreasing on the worst. So while our top line premium increased marginally, the underlying business mix shifted materially to focus on the most profitable lines. We wrote less primary reinsurance risk. We sold more retro as its rates were more attractive, but it was most efficient against our partner capital and we will recognize this benefit through increased fees.</p><p>Finally, we grew our other property book materially as this is how we access primary property. As a reminder, we take cat risk in our other property portfolio, and in 2020, we have additional exposure to cat activity from this portfolio. The net impact, overall, of these changes is a more profitable property book that consumes less capital in the tail.</p><p>We continue to share risk through traditional retro and other structures. While retro has become more expensive relative to recent years, we've strategically focused our purchase to continue to support our clients, while maximizing the efficiency of our retained underwriting portfolio. Our latest Mona Lisa cat bond transaction was a key component of our gross to net strategy, providing $400 million of protection at relatively attractive pricing. The retro capacity we raised through Mona Lisa is very efficient capital, leaving us in a strong position heading into 2020.</p><p>It has been several years since we last accessed the cat bond market, and our ability to do so successfully is yet another indicator of our agility in sourcing the most efficient capital as market conditions change. Our partner capital business augmented our gross to net strategy at the January 1 renewal. DaVinci, Upsilon and Vermeer provided us with additional flexibility to match desirable risk with efficient capital at a time that retro markets have diminished capacity.</p><p>Looking forward, the pricing beat cannot continue indefinitely. In 2020, we anticipate property rates will continue to increase, especially in the U.S. and Japan. We also expect retro and E&amp;S to remain attractive. I'm optimistic about both the opportunities that will present themselves and our superior positioning to benefit from them.</p><p>For the year, we grew gross written premiums in our Casualty and Specialty segment by 53%. This is across all subclasses, reflecting a mix of organic growth as well as the impact of TMR, and resulting in a better balanced and more diverse portfolio. We construct our casualty portfolio to have an attractive return on risk and continue to achieve scale in this segment. As a result, we are generating a stable diversifying earnings stream, producing $46 million of net underwriting income and a combined ratio of 97 for the year.</p><p>Casualty and Specialty markets were broadly up at the January 1 renewal. Rate increases achieved by our customers have been above plan and expected to continue in 2020. We believe this rate change is greater than the increase in loss trends. We also saw significant improvements in terms and conditions, including broad-based reductions in ceding commissions that were also larger than anticipated. The improved trading conditions should be sustainable for the foreseeable future as insurance companies have recognized the need for rate and have been disciplined in decreasing supply to the market. As we move into 2020, these improved trading conditions should allow us to continue to profitably scale our casualty business, resulting in improved operational leverage and consistent underwriting profit.</p><p>Social inflation continues to impact the casualty industry. Our casualty underwriters have navigated effectively this market by being rigorous about selecting the best risks and overweighting our portfolio in the more attractive classes, while avoiding the most challenging. We benefit from close coordination between our underwriters, claims, reserving and pricing functions, and are aided by tools that allow us to quickly recognize loss trends. More importantly, we have a strong underwriting culture that focuses on the bottom line.</p><p>So the fourth quarter was a solid close to a strong year, which we rapidly and effectively integrated TMR, materially grew our top line while increasing our operational efficiency, all while delivering strong underwriting and investment results. As always, we remain resolutely focused on executing our strategy and maximizing shareholder value and are excited about the opportunities ahead of us in 2020 to deploy material capital at increasingly attractive returns.</p><p>Thank you. And with that, we'll turn it over to questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous.</p><p>RYAN JAMES TUNIS, PARTNER OF PROPERTY &amp; CASUALTY INSURANCE, AUTONOMOUS RESEARCH LLP: I had a couple. The first one is just thinking about, I guess, the cat loss activity in 2019. It seems like Ren's market share of that on a net basis was a little bit higher than it was in '17 and '18, if we think about maybe like a $60 billion industry cat year. I'm wondering, how much of that growth do you think was attributable to the actual growth in the size of your book or the nature or the type of loss events we experienced?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: So yes, I think that's a good question. And I think sometimes thinking about what's an average cat year from an industry perspective, it's difficult to relate it to what happens with the reinsurance portfolio. What happened last year is we had several large events. We had Hagibis, Faxai, Dorian, all of which as events become larger, there's going to be a disproportionate effect on reinsurance. I think the things affecting us on 2019 are: we had a different retro protections in 2019 than we had in 2018, and where the storms hit were places where we had a little bit less retro. So we have -- tend to protect the southeast wind pretty aggressively, and we had the losses in Japan, which is a little bit more of a net book.</p><p>The size of the book, which is the second part of your question, played a role. But that was not the biggest component of it. It was much more around the size of the retro we have protecting the portfolio.</p><p>RYAN JAMES TUNIS: Understood. And then on the Specialty Casualty side, I guess, obviously, you talked about how you're being vigilant about the tort trends and all that. I'm just curious, did -- has any of that had an impact on your loss picks here in 2019? Or is it one of those things where you're kind of monitoring it, and maybe not releasing reserves quite as fast? I'm just curious if the actual tort environment has put any upward pressure on your loss ratio in Casualty Specialty?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Let me start with pricing, and then I'll move to reserving. From a pricing perspective, what I mentioned is, I think the rate change that we're seeing is above the loss trend that we're observing. So our pricing curves, our pricing picks are actually dropping. We are not moving that to our reserving ratios, though. So our reserving ratios are consistent with what they've been historically, but where we are observing trend, we are making adjustments and pushing the ultimate expected up. So we are reflecting the change in trend in our legacy book, and we are not recognizing the improved pricing terms in the current renewals.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR, SENIOR ANALYST, JPMORGAN CHASE &amp; CO, RESEARCH DIVISION: I just had a question on the Casualty business. How have -- like as you reserve, are you -- have you been overly conservative in your reserves, given the social inflation issues that you've observed? Or are you basically assuming that the trends will be consistent with how they've been, but not get worse?</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Reserving is always an area of focus for any risk-taking company in this business, and it's something we put a lot of attention to. We believe that our picks are appropriate, and we take in all factors that we think will affect the ultimate dates. So we are looking at loss trend, we are looking at rate environments. We have historic rate monitoring tools. All of that is resonant within the picks that we have, but we feel like they are appropriate, and we stand by them as our best estimate.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Yes. I think the reason I was asking is, in response to the previous question, you sort of implied that you've been adjusting your pricing for it, but you're not building in an extra cushion in your reserves if trends continue to deteriorate.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Yes. So there's always -- looking at our book there, historically, is a difference between reserving -- and what reserving actuaries will reserve and what pricing actuaries will expect. We do -- as a general rule, we wait for development of about 30% of the curve before we take any measure that would be considered to be a positive trend in pricing. So even if our pricing actuaries are accurate in their assessment of today's risk, it will take a couple of years before that would be reflected by our actuaries. It's just the nature of the reserving process.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Okay. And then on your cat business, in terms of premium, fourth quarter is obviously not a good, big quarter. Your premiums were down, but it's usually not a big quarter anyway seasonally. What are you seeing in terms of primary company behavior in terms of purchase of cat insurance? Just -- are companies buying more or less given how much prices have gone up?</p><p>ROBERT QUTUB: It's -- if I have to put a blanket statement out, I would say the demand for reinsurance is relatively flat. There are some new purchases from some larger players that have come into the market. I think we have great relationships and great access, so we tend to have opportunities where there is even limited growth. But if you ask for a blanket statement, I would say relatively flat.</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Okay. And then just lastly, if I could ask one more. You seem fairly positive on pricing, and it seems like you're confident that 4/1 and midyear renewals, you'll continue to see upward moves in pricing. What gives you that comfort, given that some of the issues that have caused the soft pricing over the past few years, like excess capital in the industry, those are still out there? So just if you could share some insights on why you're optimistic about pricing.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Yes. The comments that you're referring to will have to do with the property cat renewals at 4/1 and...</p><p>JAMMINDER SINGH BHULLAR: Yes.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: So I'll comment on that. At 4/1, we have had ongoing discussions with our partners in Japan. They recognize that the change that was put through the market for Jebi was inadequate based on the development that we've seen since 4/1 on Jebi. In addition, the size of Hagibis and the size of Faxai, I think, will become more clear as we approach the 4/1 renewal. And historically, the Japanese market has responded as good partners. When there's losses to recognize, there is a need for additional rate.</p><p>Within Florida, I think there's a substantial structural issue in Florida. We've seen loss creep, we've seen ineffective legislation change with regard to AOB. And as we look at that market, our view is it goes up or we reduce. So I'm not going to forecast what the change will be, but I will say, unless we see changes that meet our return expectations, we will reduce in 2020, like we did in 2019.</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time.</p><p>KEVIN JOSEPH O'DONNELL: Well, we appreciate you joining today's call. Thank you for tuning in, and we look forward to speaking to you next quarter. Thank you.</p><p>OPERATOR: This concludes today's conference call.

AIR Worldwide is a Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) business.</p><p>According to AIR, Typhoon Hagibis made landfall with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of about 145 km/h (90 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane, on the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday, October 12, near Shizuoka on the Izu Peninsula. The storm delivered high winds and record-breaking precipitation to a large portion of Honshu from Mie Prefecture in the west to Iwate in the north. Storm surge raised sea levels by more than 1 meter above mean sea level along parts of the coast.  The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its Level 5, or highest level, special warning for heavy rain; unprecedented rainfall followed. A wide swath of Honshu just outside the Tokyo metro area received between 250 mm and 500+ mm (10 and 20+ inches) of rain; the resort town of Hakone, where 939.5 mm (37 inches) of precipitation was recorded, broke the calendar-day rainfall record for all of Japan. Hakone's rainfall represents the second-heaviest 24-hour rainfall ever recorded in Japan 25 inches (635 mm) of the 37 inches fell in just 12 hours. Many regions received between 30% and 40% of their yearly rainfall in just two days, with more than 100 stations breaking daily rainfall records at those locations. As a result of the large swath of unprecedented rainfall in Honshu, numerous rivers the Abukuma, Arakawa, Chikuma, Kuji, Naka, Shinano, Tone, and Watarase rivers among them experienced severe and devastating flooding.</p><p>According to AIR, of the ~540 river gauging stations on Honshu island, more than 85 exceeded their 100-year return period peak flows, with more than 100 exceeding their historical records. In addition, shortly before Hagibis made landfall, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the region parts of which were in the early stages of recovery from Typhoon Faxai, which struck just one month prior.   Much of central and eastern Japan experienced severe flooding and landslides; power outages and travel disruption were widespread.</p><p>Because of the intense rainfall within a short time period, much of the floodwater has a high mud content and includes a large amount of debris; this could potentially increase the costs of repair and cleanup and drive up business interruption losses especially for commercial and industrial properties. In addition, Hagibis impacted some of the same region damaged by Typhoon Faxai a few weeks earlier. Additional damage caused by Hagibis to properties that were damaged by Faxai but were not repaired would further complicate claims settlements.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates include:</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Insured damage to property (residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural/mutual), structures and their contents, as well as extra expenses and debris removal, and automobile from wind, storm surge, and inland flood.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates do not include:  </p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Landslide</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Losses from tornado or earthquake</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Losses to land</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Losses to infrastructure</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Losses to CAR/EAR, marine hull, or marine cargo lines of business</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Business interruption losses</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Loss adjustment expenses</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Demand surge the increase in costs of materials, services, and labor due to increased demand following a catastrophic event; demand surge can be applied by AIR software users who want to account for this variable</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>About AIR WorldwideAIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.

AIR Worldwide is a Verisk (Nasdaq:VRSK) business.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to AIR, Typhoon Hagibis made landfall with 1-minute sustained wind speeds of about 145 km/h (90 mph), the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane, on the main Japanese island of Honshu on Saturday, October 12, near Shizuoka on the Izu Peninsula. The storm delivered high winds and record-breaking precipitation to a large portion of Honshu from Mie Prefecture in the west to Iwate in the north. Storm surge raised sea levels by more than 1 meter above mean sea level along parts of the coast.</p><p>The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) issued its Level 5, or highest level, special warning for heavy rain; unprecedented rainfall followed. A wide swath of Honshu just outside the Tokyo metro area received between 250 mm and 500+ mm (10 and 20+ inches) of rain; the resort town of Hakone, where 939.5 mm (37 inches) of precipitation was recorded, broke the calendar-day rainfall record for all of Japan. Hakone's rainfall represents the second-heaviest 24-hour rainfall ever recorded in Japan--25 inches (635 mm) of the 37 inches fell in just 12 hours. Many regions received between 30% and 40% of their yearly rainfall in just two days, with more than 100 stations breaking daily rainfall records at those locations. As a result of the large swath of unprecedented rainfall in Honshu, numerous rivers--the Abukuma, Arakawa, Chikuma, Kuji, Naka, Shinano, Tone, and Watarase rivers among them--experienced severe and devastating flooding.</p><p>According to AIR, of the ~540 river gauging stations on Honshu island, more than 85 exceeded their 100-year return period peak flows, with more than 100 exceeding their historical records. In addition, shortly before Hagibis made landfall, a magnitude 5.7 earthquake struck the region--parts of which were in the early stages of recovery from Typhoon Faxai, which struck just one month prior.</p><p>Much of central and eastern Japan experienced severe flooding and landslides; power outages and travel disruption were widespread.</p><p>Because of the intense rainfall within a short time period, much of the floodwater has a high mud content and includes a large amount of debris; this could potentially increase the costs of repair and cleanup and drive up business interruption losses--especially for commercial and industrial properties. In addition, Hagibis impacted some of the same region damaged by Typhoon Faxai a few weeks earlier. Additional damage caused by Hagibis to properties that were damaged by Faxai but were not repaired would further complicate claims settlements.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates include:</p><p>- Insured damage to property (residential, commercial, industrial, and agricultural/mutual), structures and their contents, as well as extra expenses and debris removal, and automobile from wind, storm surge, and inland flood.</p><p>AIR's modeled insured loss estimates do not include:</p><p>- Landslide</p><p>- Losses from tornado or earthquake</p><p>- Losses to land</p><p>- Losses to infrastructure</p><p>- Losses to CAR/EAR, marine hull, or marine cargo lines of business</p><p>- Business interruption losses</p><p>- Loss adjustment expenses</p><p>- Demand surge--the increase in costs of materials, services, and labor due to increased demand following a catastrophic event; demand surge can be applied by AIR software users who want to account for this variable</p><p>About AIR Worldwide</p><p>AIR Worldwide (AIR) provides risk modeling solutions that make individuals, businesses, and society more resilient to extreme events.

(Operator Instructions) Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Your host for today's call is Prem Watsa, with opening remarks from Mr. Derek Bulas. Mr. Bulas, please begin.</p><p>DEREK BULAS, ASSOCIATE VP OF LEGAL, FAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED: Good morning, and welcome to our call to discuss Fairfax's 2019 year-end results. This call may include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ perhaps materially from those contained in such forward-looking statements as a result of a variety of uncertainties and risk factors, the most foreseeable of which are set out under Risk Factors in our Base Shelf Prospectus, which has been filed with Canadian securities regulators and is available on SEDAR.</p><p>I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Prem Watsa.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA, FOUNDER, CHAIRMAN &amp; CEO, FAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Derek. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Fairfax's 2019 year-end conference call. I plan to give you some of the highlights and then pass it on -- pass the call on to Jen Allen, our chief information -- Chief Financial Officer, for additional financial and accounting details. But to begin today's conference call, I'd like to comment on last night's press release announcing Paul Rivett's retirement. Paul told me recently that for family reasons, he wanted to retire as President of Fairfax, and it was with great sadness that I accepted his decision. For 17 years, Paul has given us all and has been instrumental in our success over that time. I've had the pleasure of working very closely with Paul all those years, and I will miss him greatly. He retires with our gratitude and with all our best wishes to him, his wife Janice and his children and his retirement. Paul will continue to work on projects for us and will remain the chairman of the boards of some of our noninsurance investments. So we thank you very much, Paul, and Paul is here with us. Paul?</p><p>PAUL RIVETT: Thank you, Prem. As -- Prem, as you said, I started at Fairfax in late 2003 and became the President 7 years ago and began doing these conference calls 2 years ago at the end of 2018 and working with you and the entire Fairfax family has been a joy and an honor and a privilege. There is no better place to work. It's always been fun at Fairfax, whether defending the organization or helping grow the company over the years, working with such talented people and assisting other businesses and individuals along the way. Over the last 2 decades with this fantastic team and atmosphere, I've given everything I had to help better this business, and it has been great fun. It is for personal reasons that I've decided to step back from working to spend more time with my family. And that said, as Prem mentioned, I will continue to sit on the Board of several Fairfax investee companies. To Prem, the entire Fairfax family and all our great shareholders, I'm so grateful for my time at Fairfax, and I look forward to watching the exciting future of the organization continue to unfold. Thank you, Prem, for everything.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Hey, thank you, Paul. And Paul, of course, will be at our AGM, and you'll have a chance to say hi to Paul.</p><p>So ladies and gentlemen, we'll just go right into fourth quarter call, year-end call. Fairfax's net earnings were $2 billion in 2019 versus $376 million in 2018, which equates to net earnings per share of approximately $70 per share versus $11.65 in 2018. Fairfax's book value per share in 2019 increased by 14.8%, adjusted for the $10 per share common dividend paid in the quarter of -- first quarter of 2019. The book value ends the year at $486 per share. We had record earnings, as I said, in 2019, at just over $2 billion, but became just shy of our 15% target for growth in book value. If not for some foreign exchange movements and pension expense that went through other comprehensive earnings, we'd have passed 15%.</p><p>Our companies continue to have good results with a strong combined ratio of 96.9% consolidated, strong reserves and producing an underwriting profit of $395 million for the year. All of our major insurance companies generated combined ratios of less than 100%, with Zenith leading the charge at 85.2%, Northbridge at 96.2%, Brit at 96.9%, Odyssey at 97.2%, Allied World at 97.5% and Crum &amp; Forster at 97.6%.</p><p>For the year, operating income was strong at $1.1 billion, and our net gains on investments for the year were $1.7 billion. This consisted of realized gains in our investment portfolios of $612 million that includes ICICI Lombard, BDT, Brookfield and Seaspan, and unrealized gains of $1.1 billion, principally Eurobank, CIB bank, BDT, Go Digit and Seaspan.</p><p>As we've mentioned at our annual meetings and in our annual reports and quarterly calls with IFRS accounting where stocks and bonds are recorded at market, and subject to mark-to-market gains or losses, quarterly and annual income will fluctuate, and investment results will only make sense over the long term. Of course, these results were after taking mark-to-market losses in BlackBerry, EXCO, Stelco and Fairfax Africa.</p><p>Underwriting income continued to increase with a lower consolidated combined ratio and strong organic growth continuing at our companies. Our insurance and reinsurance business net for written premium increased year-over-year by approximately 10%, in addition to an increase of 9% in 2018, primarily due to growth at Northbridge, Odyssey, Crum &amp; Forster and Allied World. Zenith is our only company not seeing premium increases as workers' compensation rates in the United States continue to decrease. At the subsidiary level, the change in net premiums written for the year and the fourth quarter were as follows: Odyssey Group for 2019 up 17%, and the fourth quarter up 25%; Crum &amp; Forster for the whole year 18%, for the fourth quarter 27%; Northbridge 15%, for the fourth quarter 20%; Zenith was down 9% for the year and minus -- and down 7% for the quarter; Brit was flat for the year as Lloyd's restructuring took place, and for the fourth quarter, they were down 7%; Allied World was up 6% for the year 2019, and 7% for the quarter. So you can see on a quarterly basis, our -- the premiums would have been increasing very significantly. If you look at on a quarterly basis and for the whole year 2019, first quarter was up 4%, this is the net written premium; second quarter, plus-6%; third quarter, plus-12% and fourth quarter plus-13%. And these are mainly because of rate increases. Rate increases have been accelerating during the year, and we expect this trend to continue in 2020. We continue to look to put more of our cash to work without reaching for yield or taking duration risk. Over the last 24 months, we have invested our cash and short-term U.S. treasuries and short-term investment grade bonds. We have also deployed some of our cash into real estate and mortgages. We now have an annual run rate of approximately $850 million in interest and dividend income and continue to focus on redeploying cash.</p><p>In December, as you saw in the press release, the company entered into an agreement to sell a 40% equity interest and its wholly owned European runoff group for cash of approximately $600 million to OMERS. Pursuant to the sale, OMERS and the company will jointly manage the European runoff after completion of the sale, which we expect to happen in the first quarter. With our partners, we hope to work together to help European runoff expand, given the many opportunities that they are seeing there in London, particularly. At the closing date, the company will deconsolidate European runoff from its runoff reporting segment and apply the equity method of accounting for its remaining equity interest. The transaction, of course, is subject to regulatory approval, and as I said, is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020. The assets and liabilities of European runoff are presented as held for sale in the company's consolidated balance sheet at year-end.</p><p>We remain conservatively positioned with common shareholders' equity of $13 billion at December 31, 2019, compared to $11.8 billion in the previous year, and holding company cash and marketable securities at $1.1 billion. Always looking to be soundly financed first, we have begun to repurchase our partners' interest in our insurance companies as well as repurchasing Fairfax shares. During 2019, we repurchased 479,000 shares and since the fourth quarter of 2017, approximately 2 years, we have purchased over 1.2 million Fairfax shares.</p><p>Fairfax India had an excellent year in 2019 as its book value per share increased by almost 22% to 16.89%, almost $17 a share. Bangalore International Airport had an increase in its valuation because of its second runway and second terminal and a validating investment by a third-party investor for 10% of our position. For more details, please refer to the Fairfax India press release.</p><p>Fairfax Africa had a difficult deal, mainly because of mark-to-market losses in Atlas Mara and CIG, so its net asset value dropped by 9%. We expect its net asset value to come back to $10 per share soon. For more details, again, please refer to the Fairfax Africa press release.</p><p>You'll remember, we continue to hold CPI-linked deflation flow of contracts with a notional amount of $100 billion and an average remaining term to maturity of 2.8 years. We carry these contracts at only $7 million, and they continue to provide us with downside protection in the event of a catastrophic turn of world events. As of December 2019, we have $10 billion in subsidiary cash and short-term investments in our portfolio, which is approximately 26% of our portfolio investments, to take advantage of opportunities that come our way. We have another $5.4 billion of approximately 1-year treasury bills, classified as bonds, and approximately $3.6 billion of high-quality corporate bonds with an average maturity of 1.5 years. In total, we have approximately $19 billion in cash and short-dated securities, which is almost 50% of our portfolio investments. Investment portfolios will be largely unimpacted by rising interest rates as we have not reached the yield. In fact, we will benefit from rising investment income with a run rate of approximately $17 billion in gross premium, a huge focus on underwriting discipline, a portfolio of approximately $38 billion, which does not include the RiverStone U.K. portfolio, which we will continue to manage, and HWIC, our investment subsidiary operating in a stock pickers market, all grounded in our fair and friendly culture built over 34 years. We expect to generate 15% return for our shareholders over time. We think the best is yet to come.</p><p>I will now pass the call over to Jen Allen, our Chief Financial Officer. Jen?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN, CFO, FAIRFAX FINANCIAL HOLDINGS LIMITED: Thank you, Prem. Before I discuss Fairfax's 2019 results. I would like to acknowledge Paul and thank him for his unparalleled support that he's provided to me and the finance team over the years. We wish Paul all the best in his future. We wanted to also provide the readers with -- sorry, we wanted to also let you know that in addition to the press release that was issued yesterday, that all of the details on our 2019 financial results will be made available in our annual report, which will be posted on the company's website on March 6, 2020.</p><p>Turning to Fairfax's consolidated results for the full year 2019. I will highlight the results of our operating companies and then finish with our consolidated financial position. For the full year 2019, Fairfax has reported net earnings of just over $2 billion or $69.79 per share on a fully diluted basis, which as Prem noted, was a record year for the company. That compared to net earnings of $376 million or $11.65 per share on a fully diluted basis in the full year of 2018. The full year 2019 net earnings primarily reflected strong net investment gains and higher interest dividend income and strong underwriting results at the operating companies. Underwriting profit at our insurance and reinsurance operations in 2019 increased to $395 million with a combined ratio of 96.9%, compared to an underwriting profit of $318 million and a combined ratio of 97.3% in 2018. The increase in underwriting profit of $76 million principally reflected a lower accident year loss ratio, partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Current period catastrophe losses in 2019 totaled $498 million, represented 4.0 combined ratio points, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $146 million or 1.2 combined ratio points; Typhoon Faxai at $76 million or 0.6 combined ratio points; and Hurricane Dorian, $66 million or 0.5 combined ratio points. That was lower than the current period catastrophe losses in 2018 of $752 million that represented 6.5 combined ratio points. In 2018, it principally related to the California wildfires, Hurricane Michael and Typhoon Jebi.</p><p>Our combined ratios benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development in 2019 of $480 million, representing 3.8 combined ratio points. That compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018 of $789 million, representing 6.8 combined ratio points. Net premiums written by our insurance and reinsurance operations increased by 10% in 2019, principally reflecting increases at Odyssey Group, Crum &amp; Forster and Northbridge.</p><p>Looking to our operating company results, starting with Northbridge. Northbridge's underwriting profit of $47 million and a combined ratio of 96.2% in 2019 was fairly consistent with its 2018 underwriting results. 2019 reflected lower non-catastrophe loss experience related to the current accident year, principally improvements in their transportation business. Partially offset by lower net favorable prior year reserve development. Northbridge's underwriting profit in 2019 included net favorable prior year reserve development of $67 million, representing 5.4 combined ratio points, reflecting better-than-expected loss emergence across all major lines of business. This compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $107 million, representing 9.5 combined ratio point in 2018, reflecting better-than-expected emergence on automobile and casualty lines of business. The underwriting results in 2019 included $12 million that represented 1 combined ratio point of current period catastrophe losses, that principally related to storms in Ontario and Qu\u00e9bec. That compared to current period catastrophe losses in 2018 of $19 million that represented 1.7 combined ratio points. In Canadian dollar terms, Northbridge's net premiums written increased by 18% in 2019, reflecting price increases across the group, strong retention of renewal business and growth in the new business.</p><p>Moving on to Odyssey Group, in 2019, Odyssey Group reported an underwriting profit of $90 million at a 97.2% combined ratio compared to an underwriting profit of $181 million at a 93.4% combined ratio in 2018. Lower underwriting profit in 2019 reflected lower net favorable prior year reserve development, and higher current period catastrophe losses. Odyssey Group's combined ratio in 2019 benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $230 million, which represents 7.2 combined ratio points, principally related to better-than-expected emergence on non-catastrophe losses of $148 million, primarily related to better-than-expected emergence from both non-catastrophe loss experience principally in the casualty, auto, marine and aviation lines and property catastrophe loss experience. That compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $346 million or 12.5 combined ratio points in 2018. Current period catastrophe losses of $280 million represented 8.8 combined ratio points in 2019, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $88 million or 2.8 combined ratio points; Typhoon Faxai at $42 million or 1.3 combined ratio points; and Hurricane Dorian at $25 million or 0.8 combined ratio points. And that compared to current period catastrophe losses of $252 million that represented 9.1 combined ratio points in 2018, that principally related to the 2018 California wildfires, Hurricane Michael and Typhoon Jebi. Odyssey Group wrote $3.4 billion of net premiums in 2019, which represented an increase of 17% from the prior year. This reflected growth in all divisions, with the majority of the increase related to U.S. insurance, with growth in the U.S. cross motor and financial product lines. The London market in new line -- Odyssey's new line business and its U.S. casualty reinsurance.</p><p>Moving on to Crum &amp; Forster. Crum &amp; Forster's underwriting profit in 2019 improved to $52 million with a combined ratio of 97.6% from an underwriting profit of $33 million and a combined ratio of 98.3% in 2018. The increase in underwriting profit was principally due to higher business volumes and profitable lines of business and lower current period catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased commissions as a result of growth and higher commission lines of business. Crum &amp; Forster's net premium written increased by 18% in 2019, primarily reflecting growth in accident and health, surety and programs, and surplus specialty lines of business.</p><p>Looking to Zenith. Zenith National reported underwriting profit in 2019 of $109 million with an 85.2% combined ratio compared to an underwriting profit of $140 million with an 82.6% combined ratio in 2018. The decrease in underwriting profit in 2019 principally reflected the impact of price decreases due to continued favorable loss trends. The underwriting profit in 2019 included $82 million or 11.2 combined ratio points of net favorable prior year reserve development which reflected net favorable loss development trends for accident years 2013 through 2018. Net premiums written by Zenith of $721 million in 2019, decreased by 9% from $789 million in 2018, with the decrease primarily reflecting price decreases due to continuing favorable loss trends.</p><p>Brit insurance in 2019 reported an underwriting profit of $51 million and a combined ratio of 96.9%, compared to an underwriting loss of $77 million and a combined ratio of 105.2%. The year-over-year improvement in Brit's underwriting results principally reflected a decrease in current period catastrophe losses and a decrease in the attritional loss ratio, partially offset by a decrease in net favorable prior year reserve development. Current period catastrophe losses of $70 million represented 4.3 combined ratio point in 2019, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $25 million or 1.5 combined ratio point; Typhoon Faxai, $12 million or 0.8 combined ratio point; and Hurricane Dorian, $24 million or 1.5 combined ratio points. That was significantly lower than current period catastrophe losses of $210 million that represented 12.7 combined ratio points in 2018 that related to the California wildfires, Typhoon Jebi, Hurricane Florence and Michael. Net favorable prior year reserve development was lower in 2019 at $47 million and represented 2.8 combined ratio points, reflecting better-than-expected claim experience across most lines of business, compared to $99 million that represented 6.0 combined ratio points in 2018. Brit's net premium written decreased by 1% in 2019 after excluding the onetime intercompany reinsurance transaction with runoff in 2018 that's eliminated on consolidation. The decrease reflected an increased use of proportional treaty reinsurance in the marine and property lines of business, partially offset by growth in premiums written, primarily growth in the reinsurance segment. That was partially offset by lower business volumes due to reductions in noncore lines of business.</p><p>Allied World reported an underwriting profit of $58 million and a combined ratio of 97.5% in 2019 compared to an underwriting profit of $43 million and a combined ratio of 98.1% in 2018. The improvement in underwriting profitability principally reflected lower current period catastrophe losses, partially offset by net adverse prior year reserve development in 2019, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development in 2018. Current period losses in 2019 were $85 million or 3.7 combined ratio points, principally related to Typhoon Hagibis at $31 million or 5.7 combined ratio point; Typhoon Faxai at $20 million, 0.8 combined ratio point; Hurricane Dorian, $14 million and 0.6 combined ratio points. That compared to current period catastrophe losses in 2018 of $223 million or 9.8 combined ratio point that principally related to the California wildfires, Typhoon Jebi, Hurricane Florence and Michael. Net adverse prior year reserve development of $32 million or 1.4 combined ratio points in 2019 reflect a deterioration in both the insurance segment and the reinsurance segment, compared to net favorable prior year reserve development of $97 million or 4.2 combined ratio points in 2018. Allied World's net premium written increased by 3%, reflecting growth in gross premiums written, partially offset by decreased premium retention, primarily driven by increased reinsurance purchase in their insurance segment.</p><p>Moving to Fairfax Asia. Fairfax Asia's underwriting profit increased to $6 million at a combined ratio of 97.0% in 2019 and that compared to an underwriting profit of $0.4 million at a combined ratio of 99.8% in 2018. With the increase in underwriting profit principally reflecting higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Our insurance and reinsurance other segment reported an underwriting loss of $18 million and a combined ratio of 101.7% in 2019 compared to an underwriting loss of $49 million and a combined ratio of 104.6% in 2018. The decrease in the underwriting loss in 2019 principally reflected higher net favorable prior year reserve development, primarily at Group Re, Fairfax Central and Eastern Europe and Brit Insurance. That was partially offset by a higher current period catastrophe losses, primarily related to the Chilean riots.</p><p>And finally, looking to run off. Excluding the first quarter of 2019 and the fourth quarter 2018 reinsurance transactions, runoff reported an operating loss of $219 million in 2019 compared to an underwriting loss of $288 million in 2018. The decrease in operating loss in 2019, principally reflected the runoff of Advent's unearned premiums and lower loss on claims, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Losses on claims in 2019 reflected net adverse development at U.S. runoff of $216 million, principally related to the strengthening of asbestos, pollution and other latent claim reserves. That was partially offset by European runoff net favorable reserve development of $66 million.</p><p>As Prem noted, on December 20, 2019, the company entered into an agreement to contribute its wholly owned European runoff group to a newly formed RiverStoneBarbados company that will be jointly managed with OMERS. Pursuant to the agreement, OMERS will subscribe for 40% equity interest in RiverStoneBarbados for cash consideration of approximately $600 million. At the closing date, the company will deconsolidate European runoff and remove runoff -- remove from the runoff reporting segment and commence the equity method of accounting to its joint venture interest in the RiverStoneBarbados entity. At December 31, 2019, on our consolidated balance sheet, the assets and liabilities of that European runoff operation were presented as held for sale in the company's balance sheet. And as Prem noted, the transaction is subject to regulatory approval with anticipated closing in the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>Looking to our consolidated results of Fairfax, our consolidated interest and dividend income increased year-over-year from $784 million in 2018 to $880 million in 2019, primarily reflecting higher interest income earned on increased holdings of high-quality U.S. corporate bonds, partially offset by lower interest income earned on decreased holding of our U.S. municipal bonds. Fairfax recorded a provision for income taxes of $262 million at an effective tax rate of 12% in 2019, with the lower effective tax rate in 2019, primarily due to income earned outside of Canada that's taxed at lower rates and the recognition of previously unrecorded U.S. foreign tax credits. Our total debt-to-total-cap ratio, excluding our non-insurance companies, decreased to 24.5% at December 31, 2019, from 25.0% at December 31, 2018, primarily as a result of the increase in total capital. We ended 2019 with an investment portfolio, which included the holding company cash and investments of $39 billion, slightly higher than $38.8 billion held at December 31, 2018. Book value per share at December 31, 2019, was $486.10 compared to $432.46 at December 31, 2018, an increase of 14.8% adjusted for that $10 dividend that the company paid in the first quarter of 2019.</p><p>And now I'll pass it back over to you, Prem.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Thank you very much, Jen. We look forward to answering your questions. Please give us your name, your company name and try to limit your questions to only one, so that it's fair to everyone on the call. Okay, Annie, we are ready for the questions.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>OPERATOR: (Operator Instructions) And our first question is from the line of Jaeme Gloyn from National Bank Financial.</p><p>JAEME GLOYN, ANALYST, NATIONAL BANK FINANCIAL, INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: Premium's growth, obviously, really solid. I was hoping you could break out what organic growth was in Q4?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So organic growth in Q4 was approximately 13% in terms of net written premium. So we're -- basically, Jaeme, we're seeing a rate increase -- accelerated rate increases through 2019. And we've been very careful, and as you know, not writing -- not increasing our premiums over the years in a soft market. In fact, decreasing it. And so now we're expanding. We grew in 2019 and -- on an accelerated basis quarter-by-quarter, that's why I showed it to you, and we think that trend continues in 2020.</p><p>JAEME GLOYN: Okay. And where do you think leverage can reach? And how quickly can Fairfax achieve those levels?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: You mean, in terms of premiums to equity and that type of leverage you're talking about? Yes, so in the past, we've gone to 1.5x net written premiums to shareholders' equity. But our companies, we are very decentralized. So each of our precedence, particularly the big ones, Odyssey, Allied World, Crum &amp; Forster, Brit, they're all ready to expand. They know what to do. It has -- it's not just the price increases, you have to get the right margins because there's also a potential risk with the insurance business, and we have the ability to expand as much as we like in the next few years. And in the past, 2001 -- now this is as a much bigger company today than we were in 2001, but in 2001 after September 11, 2002, '03, and '04, we more than doubled our premium and -- in those 3 years. Now -- right now, we have $17 billion in gross premium, approximately $13 billion in net written premium. But that's how you look at it in total, but what you should look at is each of the companies, $4 billion in Odyssey, approximately $4 billion in Allied and on and on and on. And all of those companies have the ability to expand if the pricing is appropriate. And at the moment, it seems like it's appropriate.</p><p>JAEME GLOYN: Okay, great. And just a follow-up. Can you balance that sort of commentary with shareholding repurchases, given the stock trend and the low book value, it would seem like a decent use of capital to repurchase shares as well. Can you balance those 2 competing uses of capitals?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. Of course, first is to help our companies grow because these opportunities don't last forever. And secondly is to buy back our stock, yes. But we have to do it in a financial way, we have to do it in a way that doesn't put us at risk. And so we -- that's the balance, Jaeme, that we are going through in terms of using on the excess funds that we think we won't need in terms of our expansion potential in the insurance business and buyback our stock. So we bought some and by the way, I've said publicly that we want to buy our shares, we don't want to issue shares, we don't want to expand, we've got a very diversified platform of the insurance, reinsurance business all over the world, but I said that over 10 years. So it's over time, not like every quarter. We'll buy it as and when we feel comfortable to take advantage of it. And -- but we're not going to do it at the expense of our financial position or at the expense of our insurance companies' ability to take advantage of good pricing.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE, DIRECTOR OF INSURANCE EQUITY RESEARCH, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS, RESEARCH DIVISION: A couple of questions. Can you help with -- the holding company cash was about $1.7 billion at the end of last quarter, and it's down to about $1 billion even or so at the end of this quarter. Can you help with just a couple of the major items that accounted for the move from $1.7 billion to about $1 billion?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. Jen?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: So -- right. Sure. So at the end of the last quarter, the $1.7 billion represented, we had $500 million drawn on our credit facility that's been fully repaid in the fourth quarter. There was also some residual capitalization put into our underlying insurance companies to help them with growth.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE: Okay. That's helpful on that. And then...</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: And Mark, as we've said, we get another $600 million in the first quarter as and when this RiverStone U.K. closes. And so we like to build our cash and marketable position to a higher level than $1.1 billion.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE: Okay. That's helpful. The second question, in the -- there was a sizable loss in the fourth quarter related to the profit share in associates and non-insurance entities. Could you talk a little bit about what was there? I'm sure it's probably some type of a mark-to-market, but just to help understand it.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes, for sure, Mark. Jen, would you answer that, please?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: Sure. So Mark, maybe just on that summarized income statement, there will be more details in our MD&amp;A when it comes out in the annual report, to give you more clarity. But high level, I think there's a couple of things to note in that non-insurance companies line. So in there, we have Thomas Cook that you recall is a consolidated investment, but it owns the underlying Quess shares that were demerged in the fourth quarter. Upon that demerger, there was $191 million, but that's an impairment on the Quess shares relating to the noncontrolling interest of Thomas Cook. That full $191 million is attributed to the noncontrolling interest line on the Fairfax net P&amp;L, so 0 impact to our book value per share. It's a growth presentation.</p><p>The other thing to note on that noninsurance operation line is also Fairfax India is presented in that line before we do our consolidation. As Prem noted, that they had an excellent quarter and an uptake, principally related to the Bangalore airport. As a result, they accrue for a performance fee of about $48 million. That's also in that line as an expense. But the way the consolidation works, we have the benefit coming through on the Fairfax line at $48 million. So it's the net benefit that you would actually see in our results of the 66% that we retain. So there is a little bit of noise on kind of a one-off transaction in those lines, just to clarify.</p><p>MARK ALAN DWELLE: No, that's helpful. And then just one last item, if I can. You mentioned within the runoff segment that there were asbestos charges, typically, that's all in the fourth quarter. Could you just quantify how much impact that had on the fourth quarter results?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: You said $216 million, right?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: $216 million.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: $216 million in gross in U.S. asbestos. We had some redundancies in the U.K. and the net impact was $150 million. And of course, Mark, we have interest and dividend income, and you have gains and losses on the stock side, take them all together and approximately, it's about a $50 million loss in our runoff company in -- at a U.S. runoff company, or the total runoff company is about $50 million loss. And so asbestos has been a problem for some time. And the plaintiff's lawyers, this is what they call social inflation, plaintiff's lawyers have been extending their reach into also some nooks and crannies to get anything that's got a little asbestos, as they come after the companies. And we think it might be somewhere here in the next few years might be peaking, but we happen to have the best team in RiverStone, very well versed team for asbestos in environmental settlements. We've made acquisitions on that front also. And so we think we know what we're doing. And we'll grind it to a halt as time goes by. But it is a industry-wide concern as the plaintiff's lawyers extend that reach. They've gone through -- they've been coming after the insurance companies and other companies for decades now. And somewhere here, we think it'll peak out, but it is still something that we watch very carefully and we look at it every year.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from the line of Tom MacKinnon from BMO Capital.</p><p>TOM MACKINNON, MD &amp; ANALYST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS EQUITY RESEARCH: A question with respect to your minority insurance partners. And they've helped you make acquisitions in the past. And I think the trend has been to sort of help -- to buy them out. But the RiverStone acquisition seems to go a little bit the other way, where you're actually selling some of the stuff back to them. So do you see -- envision an increasing role with these partners going forward? Or do you envision a role where you're going to be buying up your ownership from these partners going forward?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So our -- yes, there are 2 ways -- 2 sides, right, Tom. One is our insurance companies, and we've been buying back our partners' interest over time. So like that would be Brit and that would be Eurolife and that would be Allied. Allied comes this year. So yes, so we'd be looking to eventually own those companies 100%. They are insurance companies and over time, we'd be looking at only 100%. In terms of the RiverStone, we've taken that -- we've taken OMERS as a partner, and we think what we've done is that, as a partner, we've allowed -- that allows us to deconsolidate. And our U.K. company now, RiverStone, can -- there's a lot of Lloyd's companies, and there's a lot of runoffs in the U.K. So it helps us to finance that separately with our partner. And eventually, there's all sorts of possibilities, including taking it public at some point in time. So we're looking at Riverstone U.K. in a separate basis. But it's very much -- it's been a great performer, U.K., and we think the big advantage is it allows us to finance it separately from the Fairfax insurance companies.</p><p>TOM MACKINNON: And what would be the -- in order to take Eurolife and Britain and Allied up to 100% ownership, what's left for you? What kind of cost do you see of that over the next couple years?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So the year Eurolife we'll doing it sometime this year. That we'll probably do it, right, from the company itself. We've done very well in Eurolife. So that won't need much money. And for Brit, we need about 10%, we have to buy back and we're looking at buying back that as soon as we can. And then Allied is -- opens up in June, I think, somewhere June, July, and then we have the ability to do that. I think the -- for Allied, Peter, if I remember, it was something like $1.5 billion, something like that, that we need to buy at some point in time in the next 3, 4 years.</p><p>TOM MACKINNON: Okay. And what about -- and in the Brit, is that -- what's the dollar amount on that?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: The Brit, we don't have to, but it's approximately $100 million, plus/minus $100 million.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our next question is from the line of Christopher Gable, an individual investor.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GABLE: I'd like to follow-up a little bit on the rate of share repurchases, which personally had a higher expectation for the rate since I was up there on 10/17, there's about 4% has been purchased back and you mentioned that you're trying to try to reduce it over time from '20 to '23. And today is first time I heard that your time frame is 10 years, I thought it was shorter, but it...</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. We -- I quoted in our annual report, and I quoted and I talked about it in our AGM. The king of buybacks is a guy by the name of Henry Singleton.</p><p>CHRISTOPHER GABLE: Know the name.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes, you know the name. But something like 85% of the shares outstanding. But they bought it -- but he bought it over 10, 15 years. And I wanted to make sure that we've got a platform, Christopher, that -- of $17 billion worldwide insurance. And that doesn't include about $2 billion from Eurolife and from Gulf Insurance Co. and some from Digit in India. And so we've got a better part of $20 billion, we don't have to buy anything more. When we grow at 10%, we're growing at $1.7 billion, plus/minus another Brit is how we look at it, right? So we are going to have a tremendous ability going forward when we can balance, as we were saying, our financial position, ability to finance our insurance companies' growth and buyback stock. So over time, we'll be buying back a significant amount of our stock. But we don't want to do it at the expense of our financial position and we don't want to, as I said, do it at the expense of restricting the growth in our insurance companies.</p><p>OPERATOR: Our question is from Mikel Abasolo from Solo Capital Management.</p><p>MIKEL ABASOLO, FOUNDER, SOLO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT SL: I have 1 quick specific one and 1 more general, if I may. The specific one has to do with the unrealized gain on Go Digit. I'm surprised by that because in the annual report of 2018, I see that your 45% stake in that company amounts to a total of $3.4 million and the company lost money in the year 2018. So I was curious about that.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So that's a good question. And this is a company that's totally digitized, right? That's all-digital, growing like a weed. In 2 years, Kamesh Goyal, who's the founder of the company, has grown it to $300 million. And more recently, he's been able to raise -- we can only own, at the moment, 49%. He's been able to raise about 10%, a little more than 10%, and a valuation of $800 million plus. And so we might have put, I don't know, $140 million, something like that, $150 million. So that increase for our shares from $800 million plus to what we put is where that $350 million comes from. But Jen, you want to add to that?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: Sure. Maybe just to give you, Mikel, a little bit more color, there's 2 components to that investment that we hold in Digit. So the part that you're referring to is the common stock and a small portion of some pressures that we own. As Prem noted, we're limited to a 49% interest in India. Those shares are at a historic cost was about $16 million currently carried at nil because we do our equity pickup on that basis of the 49%. The large unrealized gain that you've noted of just over $350 million relates to the convertible press shares. So that's where we -- as Prem indicated, they had 3 private equity firms come in and value the company at over $850 million. Our share percentage of that on the convertible press that are a mark-to-market basis is what you're seeing come through on the unrealized gain. It's not the equity-accounted position.</p><p>MIKEL ABASOLO: Right. Excellent. And if I may, I have 1 more general, and I'm coming back with this year after year, almost year after year. And that is I guess that if there is a stockpicker's market, I'm pretty confident that Fairfax will do very well even if the discrepancy or the divergence between growth and value does not close soon enough, but I'm very worried that you confront a general call in the stock markets. You are as aware as I am that the Shiller P/E is at record levels, valuations, any way you look at them, they are extreme. And I mean, my worry is that if there is a general collapse or slow collapse in stock markets, I'm still very confident that Fairfax common stock would do much better than the indices, but I fear that you would be dragged down. And of course, you cannot spend relative dollars.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: No, that's right. And you never know in the stock market, 50% drop, 30% drop, which it could easily do, how we would do? But I do mention to you to look at our 2002, '03 and '04 annual report. In 1999 to 2002, the stock market dropped 50%. This is, of course, the .com bust, but the whole market dropped 50%, and our equity portfolios went up 100%. So there's -- value has been -- had a tough time for years and years and years, perhaps the whole decade. So if some of these high-flying stocks come down, you may not be surprised that the value stocks do well. If history is any guide, that's what's happened before.</p><p>MIKEL ABASOLO: Yes, I'm worried that this time it will be systemic, which it wasn't in 2001, '02, '03.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: And it might well be that. Might will be that. It might well be right on it.</p><p>OPERATOR: The next question is from the line of Jeff Fenwick from Cormark Securities.</p><p>JEFFREY MICHAEL FENWICK, MD &amp; HEAD OF INSTITUTIONAL EQUITY RESEARCH, CORMARK SECURITIES INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: So Prem, obviously, to begin, the headlines of late has been the spread of the coronavirus, and I've been getting some questions about that with respect to Fairfax. So can you just frame for us a little bit, maybe the extent of the risk exposure from Fairfax's perspective with respect to things like is this interruption insurance and that type of thing. Is there any sort of commentary you can offer up on that?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. So on the insurance side, Jeff, business interruption or anything else would be very minimal yet. Very minimal. We haven't seen any pickup in claims. And we're looking at size, for example, in the past. We don't expect that to be significant, but it could affect some of our investments, business travel might be slow and some other businesses, you hear them all making comments at the -- from the investment side, that might be slower. But from the insurance side, it's that's highly unlikely that will be affected by the coronavirus.</p><p>JEFFREY MICHAEL FENWICK: Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just turning to the investment gains. Specific to Q4, fairly sizable equity gain there. Was that the -- did you came with it loaded principally in the fourth quarter?</p><p>JENNIFER ALLEN: That's correct, yes. That was in the fourth quarter.</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Yes. Well, that -- yes. Yes. That was exactly right, Jeff.</p><p>JEFFREY MICHAEL FENWICK: Okay. And then maybe just one last one here. I know with the -- part of the market -- pardon me, needs to be associated with some capacity leaving the market, notably from Lloyd's. Do you think that's sustainable? Or as they sort of reorganize there and we see the rates improving, does that capacity start to come back into the market in fairly short order?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: Not in short order. It'll come back, but not in short order. And if history is any guide, again, if you see what happened in the past, you get a few years of significant price increases. You had some big companies, like Lloyd's is one, AIG has publicly said they are reducing their capacity significantly, that I think they've dropped it by 75% and a lot of the other large European companies have dropped. The social inflation, there's cat exposure, so these hurricanes that come into Florida, big losses, right, that has taken some time to hit and when it turns, price increases are taking place now. But as you said, Jeff, it'll turn, but you might have a good one for a few years. That's what's happened in the past.</p><p>OPERATOR: It's from [Sardeep Banerjee], a private investor.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Congrats on the great result on Fairfax India and Fairfax Financial. So I have a quick question on Bangalore Airport on Fairfax India side. So I don't know if you have already discussed this, but -- so encouraging infrastructure, who did Fairfax serve into? Is it to OMERS? Or did you guys release that information? Or who did...</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: We haven't released that yet. We will release it sometime, but we haven't released it yet. We just said that it was a third-party institutional investor who validated the investment.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Okay. But my question is that is the multiple that Fairfax India sold it to -- I mean, to third-party investors, is it a very -- is it a very high, like is it a reach valuation. So my question is coming from that. And can we assume that the future gain would be muted for the Bangalore Airport?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: No. I mean, you should look at it like this. The whole -- we happen to be fortunate about the airport at a valuation, 100%, now I'm talking, at about $1.4 billion. And so the valuation here was about $2.8 billion, less than $3 billion. That's $3 billion for Bangalore International Airport, which is going from 30 million passengers, second terminal, second runway to 45 million, 50 million, 60 million, 70 million and ultimately after 90 million passengers. If you look at Shanghai, it's trading in excess of USD 20 billion. So this is trading at $3 billion, and it's a long ways off from Shanghai, I understand that. But this is a private airport, it's really well run, and it's in the third-largest city in India, as you know, in Bangalore, and there's a ton of software engineers there, almost as many as in Silicon Valley.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED PARTICIPANT: Yes, thanks, Prem. And I can validate that, I've been to the airport and it's really phenomenal. I mean, it's probably the best airport I have been to, except Dubai. Another final question is that Fairfax India share repurchase, right? So if you look at 30th September, the normal course issuer bid cancellation, so as we all know, right, and you already mentioned that Fairfax India share value is undervalued, right? So why then out of $3.5 million that you guys could buy back, only you bought back $1.3 million. Is it an indication of management that is not that undervalued or any comment on that?</p><p>V. PREM WATSA: No, no. It's like anything else. We buy as much as we can. And I forget exactly how much we've bought. We've disclosed it, but with a net asset value of close to $17 and stock's trading at $12.5, I don't think you need a lot of work to be done to figure out that it's pretty undervalued.

More than 133,000 households were also without water, according to the Cabinet Office.</p><p>Fukushima Prefecture in the northeast of the country suffered the highest number of casualties, with at least 25 deaths, according to NHK.
