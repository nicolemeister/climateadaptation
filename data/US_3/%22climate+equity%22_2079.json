At least three of the eight organizations that were</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/04/04/biden-epa-billions-grants-green-groups-democrat-ties/\">selected as awardees are loaded with Democrat Party insiders.</url></p><p>'One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse,' Zeldin said in his Wednesday  <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/epaleezeldin/status/1889840040622321778\">statement posted to X. 'We will review every penny that has gone out the door. The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.'</url></p><p>Among the awardees  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/greenhouse-gas-reduction-fund/national-clean-investment-fund\">selected by the Biden EPA are Climate United, the Coalition for Green Capital and Power Forward Communities, three groups that are taking home almost $14 billion combined to establish financing operations for a wide variety of green technology and energy projects under the GGRF's National Clean Investment Fund. Each of these groups feature combinations of former Obama and Biden administration employees and officials from labor unions and left-wing environmental activist groups on their boards.</url></p><p>Project Veritas, a right-wing activist group, published secretly-recorded footage of a Biden EPA appointee discussing how the agency was 'tossing gold bars off the Titanic' in the final days of the Biden administration and before the Trump administration arrived to curb excessive federal spending. Zeldin referenced the footage in his statement announcing the agency's intent to recover the $20 billion.</p><p>However, the Biden EPA parked the $20 billion at Citibank before the Trump administration's arrival, ostensibly in an attempt to make it more difficult for incoming Trump EPA personnel to access the funds. Zeldin made clear in his remarks that Citibank is not suspected of any sort of wrongdoing with its involvement, but the Trump EPA wants to terminate the underlying agreement with the bank that the Biden EPA signed.</p><p>'Roughly twenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight,' Zeldin said in his statement.</p><p>Zeldin added that he will be referring the matter to the EPA Office of the Inspector General and that his agency will also work with the Department of Justice.</p><p>'Protect the Public's Trust, along with the Daily Caller News Foundation, has been among those sounding the alarm on this greendoggle for over two years now. Many of us recognized the issues and potential for abuse that were likely to manifest themselves due to the manner in which the Biden administration structured the program. Many of the recipient organizations were tied to the Biden administration and its political allies,' Michael Chamberlain, executive director of Protect the Public's Trust, a government watchdog group, told the DCNF. 'In fact, one of the recipients of billions from the GGRF had a board member who was likely involved in creating the program while serving in the Biden White House. What a surprise that EPA awarded funds to this group It appears as though our concerns with this program were more than justified.'</p><p>Content created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is availablewithout charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Dr. Goldman has deep expertise at the nexus of science and policy on topics including federal scientific integrity, climate science and emissions reductions, air pollution exposure and health effects, and environmental justice and science in federal decision making.</p><p>\"Dr. Goldman stood out amongst an extremely talented pool of candidates with her extraordinary vision, government and NGO policy experience, unparalleled science advocacy, and her deep commitment to environmental justice,\" said Dr. Anne Kapuscinski, chair of UCS's board of directors. \"She has wide-ranging expertise that will help UCS advance its mission of using rigorous science to build a healthy, safe and just future.\"</p><p>In recent years, Dr. Goldman served in the White House as the assistant director for environmental science, engineering, policy, and justice in the Climate and Environment division of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where she focused on climate equity, air quality, Indigenous Knowledge, environmental justice, and scientific integrity. She also served as the climate change research and technology director at the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she worked to decarbonize the transportation sector and build community resilience to climate change.</p><p>During the first Trump administration, Dr. Goldman was research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at UCS, where her team documented more than 200 attacks on science from the administration, and where she built a reputation as a thought leader on science and federal policymaking.</p><p>\"Every administration has politicized science in ways that hurt regular people, but my experience tells me this will be a whole new ball game,\" said Dr. Goldman. \"I'm energized for this fight. Together we must uphold the progress we've made to fight climate change and find opportunities at the state and regional level to continue the clean energy revolution that is underway.\"</p><p>A prolific writer, speaker and advocate, Dr. Goldman has testified before the U.S. Congress, served as an expert on the Public Health Rulemaking of the California Department of Conservation's Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), chaired the Air and Climate Public Advisory Committee for the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and served on the UNESCO/AAAS Consultation Group on the U.S. science ecosystem.</p><p>She holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in environmental engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.S. in atmospheric science from Cornell University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126922847</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DX4-GK33-S2VF-B0GJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 16, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Partnering with cash-strapped state agencies, the EPA bought kits that could measure lead levels in children with just a finger prick, gave out gift cards to incentivize testing, and offered testing opportunities in offices where families picked up benefits and received breastfeeding support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The program invested $150,000 in lead-testing kits for Harrison County, where Clarksburg is located, which raised testing rates in children from about 8% to 41%, says Camilla McMillen-Haught, director of Women, Infant, and Children (WIC) Nutrition in six West Virginia counties, including Harrison. Children with high levels of lead were then targeted for health interventions like dietary changes that would reduce their risk of long-term problems.</p><p>The future of the program is now uncertain because of the Trump Administration's focus on rooting out efforts to prioritize diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental-justice initiatives. A proposed expansion of the lead-testing program to states like Ohio is also threatened.</p><p>An EPA staffer connected to the initiative was put on administrative leave in early February as part of the Trump Administration's purge of federal-government workers. An additional 167 members of the EPA's Office of Environmental Justice and External Civil Rights were put on administrative leave, according to the agency, many after receiving emails that said they were identified as spending more than half their time on environmental-justice initiatives.</p><p>These moves were part of President Trump's Executive Order, titled \"Ending Radical and Waste Government DEI Programs and Preferencing,\" which he issued on his first day in office to target DEI and environmental-justice programs. (A Maryland judge on Feb. 21 largely blocked the Administration from carrying out much of the DEI Executive Order, though staff members and recipients of grants have not yet seen changes since then.) The Administration's goal, it said, was to slash spending and end initiatives that single out minorities for help.</p><p>In the directive, Trump criticized his predecessor's own Executive Order seeking to advance racial equity and support for underserved communities as \"illegal and immoral discrimination.\" New EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a video posted on X Feb. 12 that \"the days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\" He added, on Feb. 22, \"UPDATE: I just cancelled another 21 wasteful DEI and Environmental Justice grants, with the help of our amazing @DOGE team, racking up $67m more in savings!\"</p><p>But many of the environmental-justice programs targeted by the new Administration's staff cuts and funding freezes do not benefit minorities or left-leaning environmental groups, according to Adam Ortiz, who until January served as the EPA's Regional Administrator for Region 3, which includes Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. Often they help poor, white communities in conservative areas--places that overwhelmingly voted for Trump.</p><p>Clarksburg, a beneficiary of the West Virginia lead-testing program, is a former manufacturing hub that is 90% white and has a poverty rate of 23.2%, about double the national average. Harrison County, where it is located, voted for Trump by a margin of 40 percentage points in 2024.</p><p>\"These are communities that had the most hope in this Administration and are now feeling the most suffering,\" says Jacob Israel Hannah, the CEO of Coalfield Development Corporaton, a nonprofit that does workforce development in 21 counties in West Virginia. Coalfield had won nearly $700 million in federal funding for projects across the region. But nearly all that money was frozen by federal spending pauses targeting DEI, environmental justice, and clean-energy initiatives.</p><p>When asked about the idea that ending DEI and environmental-justice activities hurts communities that supported Trump, an EPA spokesperson said in a statement to TIME that it is \"working diligently\" to implement President Trump's Executive Orders. It placed the 168 Office of Environmental Justice employees on administrative leave after EPA career staffers determined that their functions \"did not relate to the agency's statutory duties,\" the statement said. The agency is \"in the process of evaluating new structure and organization to ensure we are meeting our mission of protecting human health and the environment for all Americans,\" according to the statement.</p><p>Harrison Fields, a White House spokesman, wrote in an email to TIME that \"protecting the civil rights and expanding opportunities for all Americans is a key priority of the Trump Administration, which is why he took decisive actions to terminate unlawful DEI preferences.\"</p><p>One of the grants Coalfield Development Corporation won--worth around $130 million--would have created 1,000 new jobs by training unemployed coal workers to become solar installers and then to install 250 megawatts of solar on closed coal mines, says Hannah. But now, he says, when Coalfield staffers log into funding portals for the Department of Energy, the EPA, and the Department of Labor, they receive a message that their grants are \"under review\" and that they are not able to access the money they were promised. The grant applications included the term environmental justice because they would have helped underserved communities access jobs and clean power, Hannah says. If the grant goes away, \"you will see the loss of what would have been over 1,000 new jobs in Appalachia,\" Hannah says.</p><p>While some of the beneficiaries of environmental-justice projects have been low-income communities of color in cities, others are struggling white communities in Appalachia. The Biden Administration mandated that 40% of many of its climate and clean energy funds flow to \"disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\"</p><p>\"The important thing to understand about all the grants at the EPA is that they prioritized reaching the communities most overburdened by pollution,\" says Zealan Hoover, who was until recently the Director of Implementation at the EPA, overseeing $100 billion in funding. \"In every state, there was a wide range of communities receiving funding.\" That includes rural communities in the Southeast and Gulf Coast, and places across the country that have disproportionately high energy costs, Hoover says.</p><p>Some of the programs whose funding was paused or whose federal staff were placed on administrative leave provided access to clean drinking water and functioning wastewater treatment plants, says Ortiz, the former EPA regional administrator. One project, spearheaded by a staffer now on administrative leave, sought to relocate a wastewater-treatment plant in Richwood, W.Va., that has been basically inoperable since a 2016 flood, he says.</p><p>\"Our environmental-justice work was really focused on places that historically didn't have the ability to match funds or pay loans back,\" Ortiz says. \"For the first time since the 1930s and 1940s, these communities were receiving serious investments to rebuild critical infrastructure.\"</p><p>In Pennington Gap, Va., which is located in a county where 86% of voters supported Trump in 2024, the future of a grant to demolish an asbestos-filled grocery store, issued through the EPA's Environmental Justice Collaborative Problem-Solving Cooperative Agreement Program, is now in question. The nonprofit environmental group Appalachian Voices, which received the grant, can't get in touch with its EPA program lead and can't send out any more information to community members without EPA approval, says Emma Kelly, new economy program coordinator for Appalachian Voices.</p><p>Many of the EPA environmental-justice staffers put on leave are eager to get back to work--even in an Administration hostile to the work that they do. \"No economy is going to be restored,\" says one staffer on administrative leave, who asked not to be named because they hope to be reinstated, \"if you don't have sanitation or clean drinking water.\"</p><p><br/>'These are communities that had the most hope in this Administration.'<br/>--JACOB ISRAEL HANNAH, CEO OF COALFIELD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO, Downtown Clarksburg, W.Va., in 2018, SPENCER PLATT--GETTY IMAGES</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO, Business owners after flooding in Pikeville, Ky., on Feb. 17, JON CHERRY--GETTY IMAGES</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TIMPRO-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TIMPRO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FB2-0X23-RV8N-S2M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">488081</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1453\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

The fight to squash the spending could expose the Trump administration to billions of dollars in damages if a court later finds its actions to be unlawful, an EPA lawyer warned as part of a series of Sunday night emails last month . In the same email chain, government lawyers acknowledged that they did not know whether criminal and civil investigations launched by the Trump administration would uncover evidence of the waste, fraud or conflicts of interest that Zeldin has publicly alleged . Their \"short-term objective\" was to block the money while those probes play out, a senior Justice Department attorney wrote in one email. The government's approach \"is believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities,\" veteran EPA attorney Jim Payne wrote to 14 career staff and political appointees at the environmental agency, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department late on the night of March 9. The emails, never before made public, offer a rare glimpse at the administration's internal qualms as EPA, DOJ and Treasury wage one of the most aggressive battles in President Donald Trump's campaign . The fight over the $20 billion stands out for one reason: The administration is seeking to pull back money that is already out the door - cash that President Joe Biden's agencies had awarded, and placed in accounts for the recipients at Citibank, before Trump took office. </p><p>EPA lawyers have asserted in court that they can terminate the grants without needing to offer any specific evidence of wrongdoing by the eight nonprofits. The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule as soon as this week on whether the Trump administration can continue freezing the money, which had been meant to pay for solar power, energy efficiency upgrades and other clean-energy projects in lower-income communities. Washington-based U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has chastised EPA's handling of the case, saying the agency \"never proffered ... adequate evidence\" to support its claims of wrongdoing. Even before then, the career EPA lawyer's email warning about \"significant\" risk already offered agency leaders a red flag about their strategy, according to one legal expert who reviewed the emails for POLITICO. \"To me, this is a signal that they think this is probably a loser,\" said Gary Jonesi, who retired in January after a 39-year career in enforcement at EPA under administrations of both parties. An EPA attorney would not use that adjective \"very lightly,\" said Avi Garbow, who served as the agency's general counsel in the Obama administration. \"It is not unusual at all that for policy directives ... there is some assessment by the Office of General Counsel that it presents some legal vulnerability,\" he said. \"It is less normal, I think, to phrase it as having 'significant' legal vulnerabilities.\" Other legal experts who reviewed the emails for POLITICO called it striking that they show the administration trying to block the money before finding certain evidence of wrongdoing to back it up. In one of the March 9 emails, Matthew Galeotti, a career official who at the time was serving in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, shared DOJ's analysis of the situation after interagency discussions throughout the day. \"The short-term objective is to prevent disbursement of the grant funds, so that ongoing criminal and civil investigations into the program can proceed without risk that the funds will permanently disappear,\" Galeotti wrote, outlining DOJ's position. That's an unusual approach, veteran EPA official Stan Meiburg told POLITICO. \"What I take from [DOJ's] line is, they're still trying to find ways to claw back the money, and they want to give themselves as much time as possible to do fishing expeditions to find any evidence in criminal or civil investigations that might give them a plausible reason for arguing that there was fraud going on, and therefore they should do this,\" said Meiburg, who retired after 37 years at EPA only to return a few months later as acting deputy EPA administrator in the Obama administration. \"And right now they haven't got one.\" In a statement Wednesday, EPA reiterated several allegations it has made publicly about the grants in recent months, including \"serious potential conflicts of interest,\" concerns about the ability of the grant recipients to handle the funds, statements by internal watchdogs of concern about oversight of the spending, and changes made by the Biden administration to the grant agreements that Zeldin says limited EPA's oversight, a claim with which the grant recipients disagree. \"It's telling that you cling to the narrative of 'no evidence' even as EPA has directly outlined evidence regarding serious concerns about self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified grantees, and reduced agency oversight tied to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,\" the agency said. \"These aren't vague suspicions - they're the foundation for ongoing DOJ and FBI and IG investigations, and the reason the fatally designed program was terminated.\" EPA added that the emails obtained by POLITICO show government attorneys seeking to stop the grant recipients from \"increasing their efforts to access and offload these tax dollars to third parties\" after the Trump administration increased its scrutiny of the program. Such withdrawals \"would be certain to cause irreparable harm to the U.S. taxpayer amounting into the billions of dollars,\" the agency added. Payne, who is serving as EPA's acting general counsel, also issued a statement characterizing the email exchange as a typical discussion. \"On their face, the alleged emails you reference appear to involve privileged discussions and ordinary deliberations among government attorneys,\" Payne said. \"Such an exchange of views is an important part of the government's work, and an unauthorized disclosure would be highly inappropriate and have potential legal consequences.\" The Justice Department declined to comment for this story, while the White House referred questions to EPA and DOJ. The FBI referred questions to DOJ. EPA's inspector general declined to comment on the existence or status of any ongoing investigations. 'Investigations may fill that out' The emails circulated weeks after Zeldin launched his first public attacks on the $20 billion grant program Feb. 12, contending that the Biden-era EPA had \"parked\" the money at Citibank as part of a \"scheme\" to evade federal oversight. \"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" Zeldin said, vowing to bring the money back under direct EPA control. EPA and Treasury soon pressed Citibank to freeze the grant money, while DOJ and the FBI pushed forward with a criminal probe that not enough evidence existed to justify opening a criminal investigation or freezing the Citibank accounts. Under the terms of the grants, EPA can terminate the awards under three circumstances: if a recipient isn't spending the money how it's supposed to; if it misleads EPA about its eligibility to receive the grant; or if EPA has \"credible evidence\" of criminal activity. One of the grant recipients, Climate United Fund, sued EPA over the freeze on March 8, and other spurned groups were drafting their own lawsuits. By the evening of March 9, DOJ's Galeotti warned that the clock was ticking: At midnight, less than four hours later, Citibank would have \"no basis\" to continue blocking the accounts under the Trump administration's previous requests. DOJ's recommendation was that both Treasury and EPA should each write to Citibank that evening to direct that the accounts remain frozen - a step that DOJ's analysis acknowledged could lead to more litigation. \"At some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period,\" Galeotti wrote. Participants in the email exchange included a mixture of career employees and political employees, with other staffers copied as recipients. One person who chimed in was Emil Bove, a former Trump defense attorney who is now the principal associate deputy attorney general, and who had pressed for a criminal investigation of the climate grants. Copied on the emails was Blanche, another Trump defense attorney who had been sworn in as deputy attorney general just days before. The emails show that the officials were concerned with stopping the climate grants, not with stopping any specific, evidence-based incidents of waste, fraud or abuse, government watchdog group executive Jillian Blanchard argued after reviewing the messages for POLITICO. \"It just seems to me that this is end-justifies-the-means logic, that there's no evidence that's being cited,\" said Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a group that has criticized the grant terminations. \"It's just, 'how do we protect ourselves in this moment, while we terminate grants without evidence?'\" Once the Trump administration officials decided on a specific course of action to order Citibank to keep the funds frozen, Payne - who has worked at EPA since 2016 and before that worked in environmental enforcement at DOJ - raised some concerns. He warned that the grant recipients could file for monetary damages in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a tribunal that has exclusive jurisdiction over monetary claims against the federal government. Payne asked DOJ to assess whether the government could prevail in that legal fight, \"to help ensure EPA senior leadership is well informed since there are potential multi-billion dollar damage claims.\" Yaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for civil matters, replied that DOJ couldn't make that assessment until it knew the outcome of the investigations. \"It depends on what the investigations uncover in terms of criminal conduct or other improprieties. It also depends on whether EPA ultimately terminates the grants,\" he wrote to Payne. \"All of that will bear on our defenses and rights.\" If the courts found that EPA's withholding of the funds was unlawful, the agency could be on the hook for that money, \"and perhaps interest or related relief,\" Roth added. In an interview, Blanchard said it was \"wild\" to see the Trump administration acknowledge - and apparently dismiss - the risk of being liable for damages when Zeldin routinely says he terminated the grants to protect taxpayer money. \"It isn't about the money,\" said Blanchard. \"They're doing it, I believe, to be able to say they stopped this program, they stopped what the Biden administration wanted to do. That's the main goal, to be able to say they stopped this.\" Garbow, the former EPA general counsel, said he would have been wary of such extreme risk. \"I cannot envision a scenario, had I been the general counsel, where my office had determined there were significant, multibillion-dollar damage claims, and I had not received substantial reassurance from the Justice Department about the merits of our potential defenses - that certainly, in my experience, would have warranted a conversation directly with the administrator to ensure that he or she was comfortable proceeding this way,\" Garbow said. It is unclear to what extent Zeldin was consulted on the matter on the evening the emails were sent. Just 44 minutes passed between Payne sharing the draft order to freeze the funds and Zeldin's chief of staff, Eric Amidon, sending it to Citibank. Waiting on the courts EPA's strategy to kill the climate grants has already fallen flat before one judge. Last week, Chutkan - a Barack Obama nominee who previously drew Trump's wrath while overseeing his now-dismissed election conspiracy criminal case - found that EPA's March 11 termination violated the law, the Constitution and the agency's own procedures. EPA's primary defense is that the grant terminations are effectively a breach of contract, which under the law would have to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, not in Chutkan's courtroom. It would likely take a year or more for the climate groups to push their case in that venue, and in the meantime they would go without any of that funding, said Blanchard. The recipients have already warned that without access to the money, some will soon face layoffs and others could shut down. Chutkan rejected EPA's interpretation of the law , writing that this is no simple contract dispute and \"the government is not just another contracting party.\" And on the merits, the Justice Department has conceded that the government did not cut off the grants because of any of the recipients' actions. \"EPA did not terminate for Plaintiffs' noncompliance,\" the agency wrote in a brief in late March . Chutkan's order to reopen the taps has been temporarily stayed while EPA appeals to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least $625 million in requests from the recipients is already pending, mostly earmarked to pay for clean energy projects, housing and community lending. Even if EPA prevails in moving the dispute to the Court of Federal Claims, it could still find itself potentially liable for paying the $20 billion, Payne wrote in one email on March 9. In the email, the EPA attorney shared a draft copy of a directive that Amidon would send directing Citibank to maintain the funding freeze. But that approach, Payne reiterated, \"is believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities including for potential future substantial monetary damage claims before the Court of Federal Claims.\" Adding the word \"significant\" is a subtle but clear message to other lawyers, Jonesi - the former EPA enforcement official - told POLITICO after reading the emails. \"When you've got Trump's criminal defense lawyers, now senior people at the Justice Department, on this email chain, you choose your words carefully, and you don't want to lose credibility by overstating the case,\" he said. Jonesi is now the executive director of CREEDemocracy, a group he founded this year to promote clean energy development and scrutinize Trump's policies. At 12:28 a.m. on Monday, March 10, Amidon sent the order to Citibank to continue freezing the funds, according to documents shared in court. He made only minor tweaks to Payne's draft language. Bove, the principal associate deputy attorney general, expressed happiness with the outcome. \"Grateful to all involved for the coordination on this,\" he wrote at 1:41 a.m. \"Thanks very much.\" The agency had contemplated going further by terminating the grants, not just freezing them, but that step \"is not being effectuated at this time,\" Roth wrote the night of March 9. Amidon's order to Citibank said the agency was waiting to alter the program until it received responses to oversight questions it had sent to the recipients, which were due March 28. Instead, EPA told Climate United and the other recipients on March 11 that Zeldin has terminated their grants. The email exchange does not reveal any reasons for the abrupt change of strategy. Myron Ebell, a longtime critic of climate spending and regulation who led Trump's 2017 EPA transition team, said he supports the administration being \"ambitious\" in canceling funding such as the $20 billion Biden program, and said he doesn't fear a court overturning the grant terminations. \"Then we'll be where we are now. I don't see that that's a loss,\" he said. \"We'll go back to the status quo, and if the administration wants to end these various green grant programs, they will have to go to Congress and say 'Well, we tried to do it.'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-0000019664f2d38dad9fe4f6949f0000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FW1-93T3-RTM2-X00H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Dr. Goldman has deep expertise at the nexus of science and policy on topics including federal scientific integrity, climate science and emissions reductions, air pollution exposure and health effects, and environmental justice and science in federal decision making.</p><p>\"Dr. Goldman stood out amongst an extremely talented pool of candidates with her extraordinary vision, government and NGO policy experience, unparalleled science advocacy, and her deep commitment to environmental justice,\" said Dr. Anne Kapuscinski, chair of UCS's board of directors. \"She has wide-ranging expertise that will help UCS advance its mission of using rigorous science to build a healthy, safe and just future.\"</p><p>In recent years, Dr. Goldman served in the White House as the assistant director for environmental science, engineering, policy, and justice in the Climate and Environment division of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where she focused on climate equity, air quality, Indigenous Knowledge, environmental justice, and scientific integrity. She also served as the climate change research and technology director at the U.S. Department of Transportation, where she worked to decarbonize the transportation sector and build community resilience to climate change.</p><p>During the first Trump administration, Dr. Goldman was research director for the Center for Science and Democracy at UCS, where her team documented more than 200 attacks on science from the administration, and where she built a reputation as a thought leader on science and federal policymaking.</p><p>\"Every administration has politicized science in ways that hurt regular people, but my experience tells me this will be a whole new ball game,\" said Dr. Goldman. \"I'm energized for this fight. Together we must uphold the progress we've made to fight climate change and find opportunities at the state and regional level to continue the clean energy revolution that is underway.\"</p><p>A prolific writer, speaker and advocate, Dr. Goldman has testified before the U.S. Congress, served as an expert on the Public Health Rulemaking of the California Department of Conservation's Geologic Energy Management Division (CalGEM), chaired the Air and Climate Public Advisory Committee for the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments and served on the UNESCO/AAAS Consultation Group on the U.S. science ecosystem.</p><p>She holds a Ph.D. and M.S. in environmental engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology, and a B.S. in atmospheric science from Cornell University.</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/noted-scientist-former-white-house-official-takes-helm-union-concerned-scientists\">https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/noted-scientist-former-white-house-official-takes-helm-union-concerned-scientists</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8998380 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8998380</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DX5-01B3-S1J7-P295-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"522\"/><timeReceived>4:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 16, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This grant is aimed at implementing urban forestry efforts focused on tree planting and maintenance, and community engagement.</url></p><p>This significant contribution will be used to support WHC's initiatives aimed at preserving and protecting wildlife habitats across Northwest Indiana. WHC's focus is geared towards improving local canopy networks to help mitigate urban heat island effect, prevent sediment runoff in local waterways (namely the Grand Calumet River), and increase biodiversity in urban communities.</p><p>Throughout the initiative, community members will benefit from horticultural and arboricultural education, increasing local expertise and providing sustainable opportunities. After completion, Northwest Indiana communities will benefit from increased public green spaces that may be utilized for recreational activities and public wellness.</p><p>'By nurturing local canopy networks and green spaces in urban areas, we are not only enhancing the environment but also creating a sense of pride and well-being among residents,' said Daniel Goldfarb, Director of Social Impact, WHC. 'Our commitment to the area, both with our work and our membership presence, empowers us to continue making a positive impact one tree at a time.'</p><p>Added Goldfarb, \"For our member companies located in the Great Lakes (and beyond), urban and community forestry is emerging as a key point of intersection between equity and justice efforts for communities, and climate adaptation actions contributing to corporate climate goals. It's another way to engage our corporate membership in the communities they work.'</p><p>The collaboration between WHC and GreenLatinos highlights a shared commitment to environmental equity and community engagement. Together, both organizations will work to enhance biodiversity, promote the importance of preserving wildlife habitats in urban and underserved communities, and develop pathways for nature-related jobs.</p><p>This initiative is funded by the USDA Forest Service in aims of promoting health and vitality in urban communities across the United States. The USDA Forest Service Urban and Community Forest Program plays a vital role in fostering resilient and thriving urban forests for the benefit of present and future generations, while promoting a sense of stewardship and connection to nature within urban communities and environments.</p><p>About WHC  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wildlifehc.org/introducing-tandem-global/\">(Soon to be Tandem Global)</url></p><p>WHC (Wildlife Habitat Council) has been working at the nexus of business and biodiversity for 35 years and is the only international NGO focused exclusively on enabling private sector action for nature. WHC builds strategies and frameworks for companies to integrate nature with climate, equity and engagement to support sustainable ecosystems and healthy communities. WHC's corporate members represent some of the leading national and multinational corporations. WHC-certified programs can be found in 19 countries and 48 U.S. states.

Hosted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and developed in cooperation with the Office of Information Technology Services, the webpage and Tree Tracker allow State agencies, organizations, private entities, and individuals to report the location and number of trees planted into the tracking tool, measuring progress in the statewide effort.</p><p>\"New York is taking decisive action to protect our environment and strengthen communities' ability to withstand severe weather,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Our progress toward the 25 Million Tree goal is a testament to the power of community-driven action, and the new Tree Tracker will make it easier for New Yorkers to track our progress, share updates and contribute to a healthier environment for the future.\"</p><p>Trees planted in 2024 and on count toward the statewide total. Every entry records the number and location of trees planted. Entries can also include additional information such as planting date(s), tree species, and tree size. The webpage displays an interactive map of planting projects across New York State, and tallies trees planted by region, county, and municipality for visitors to track planting across the state as the initiative progresses toward the 25 million tree goal.</p><p>In addition to linking to the Tree Tracker, the 25 Million Trees webpage provides information on how to plant trees, how to care for them to aid their survival, and where to go for more technical assistance.</p><p>Department of Environmental Conservation Interim Commissioner Sean Mahar said, \"Working with the New Yorkers we serve, the 25 Million Tree Goal is helping to address our sustained efforts to protect communities and natural resources across the state. Every tree planted is a step toward a healthier, greener New York. The Tree Tracker will empower New Yorkers to share their stories with us as our partners in this historic effort, which will have a lasting impact on the environment.\"</p><p>The Nature Conservancy's New York Executive Director Bill Ulfelder said, \"The Nature Conservancy is pleased to see New York State unveil new tools to document progress towards New York's goal to plant 25 million trees by 2033. Achieving this goal would help New York meet its carbon reduction goals while protecting clean drinking water, restoring wildlife habitat, and reducing the risks of extreme heatwaves, which can be fatal in neighborhoods without trees.\"</p><p>Governor Hochul launched the 25 Million Trees Initiative in her 2024 State of the State address, allocating $32 million in Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act Funds to modernize the State's tree nursery and harness technology to track forestation efforts in New York and $15 million in the Executive Budget to support resilient reforestation projects. The Initiative is invigorating statewide tree planting efforts, sending an unmistakable market signal to private nurseries, and growing the state's vital forest products industry. The Initiative advances the climate equity and reforestation goals outlined in New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and contributes to New York's broader efforts to reduce the pollution contributing to climate change.</p><p>The 25 Million Trees Initiative also highlights funding opportunities for afforestation and reforestation projects in New York State. Private landowners had access to $4.5 million for projects expanding and restoring forests through the Establishing Large Forests (ELF) Grant Program, and $15 million is currently available to municipalities, not-for-profits, and State agencies to create forested natural areas servicing urban communities through the Community Reforestation (CoRe) Grant Program until March, 12, 2025.</p><p>New York's 25 Million Trees Initiative also contributes in part to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers' call for planting 250 million trees around the Great Lakes region by 2033.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126957281</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F2K-W5N3-RRT3-R0G4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 5, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Andrew M. Cuomo issued the following release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the launch of a new webpage and interactive tracking tool to help document progress toward New York State's goal to plant 25 million trees by 2033. Hosted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and developed in cooperation with the Office of Information Technology Services, the webpage and Tree Tracker allow State agencies, organizations, private entities, and individuals to report the location and number of trees planted into the tracking tool, measuring progress in the statewide effort.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"New York is taking decisive action to protect our environment and strengthen communities' ability to withstand severe weather,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Our progress toward the 25 Million Tree goal is a testament to the power of community-driven action, and the new Tree Tracker will make it easier for New Yorkers to track our progress, share updates and contribute to a healthier environment for the future.\"</p><p>Trees planted in 2024 and on count toward the statewide total. Every entry records the number and location of trees planted. Entries can also include additional information such as planting date(s), tree species, and tree size. The webpage displays an interactive map of planting projects across New York State, and tallies trees planted by region, county, and municipality for visitors to track planting across the state as the initiative progresses toward the 25 million tree goal.</p><p>In addition to linking to the Tree Tracker, the 25 Million Trees webpage provides information on how to plant trees, how to care for them to aid their survival, and where to go for more technical assistance.</p><p>Department of Environmental Conservation Interim Commissioner Sean Mahar said, \"Working with the New Yorkers we serve, the 25 Million Tree Goal is helping to address our sustained efforts to protect communities and natural resources across the state. Every tree planted is a step toward a healthier, greener New York. The Tree Tracker will empower New Yorkers to share their stories with us as our partners in this historic effort, which will have a lasting impact on the environment.\"</p><p>The Nature Conservancy's New York Executive Director Bill Ulfelder said, \"The Nature Conservancy is pleased to see New York State unveil new tools to document progress towards New York's goal to plant 25 million trees by 2033. Achieving this goal would help New York meet its carbon reduction goals while protecting clean drinking water, restoring wildlife habitat, and reducing the risks of extreme heatwaves, which can be fatal in neighborhoods without trees.\"</p><p>Governor Hochul launched the 25 Million Trees Initiative in her 2024 State of the State address, allocating $32 million in Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act Funds to modernize the State's tree nursery and harness technology to track forestation efforts in New York and $15 million in the Executive Budget to support resilient reforestation projects. The Initiative is invigorating statewide tree planting efforts, sending an unmistakable market signal to private nurseries, and growing the state's vital forest products industry. The Initiative advances the climate equity and reforestation goals outlined in New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and contributes to New York's broader efforts to reduce the pollution contributing to climate change.</p><p>The 25 Million Trees Initiative also highlights funding opportunities for afforestation and reforestation projects in New York State. Private landowners had access to $4.5 million for projects expanding and restoring forests through the Establishing Large Forests (ELF) Grant Program, and $15 million is currently available to municipalities, not-for-profits, and State agencies to create forested natural areas servicing urban communities through the Community Reforestation (CoRe) Grant Program until March, 12, 2025.</p><p>New York's 25 Million Trees Initiative also contributes in part to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers' call for planting 250 million trees around the Great Lakes region by 2033.</p><p>Contact the Governor's Press Office</p><p>Contact us by phone:</p><p>Albany: (518) 474-8418</p><p>New York City: (212) 681-4640</p><p>Contact us by email:</p><p>[emailprotected] For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please contact Editor at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:contentservices@htdigital.in\">contentservices@htdigital.in</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">USSTNW-PR4960164</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">USSTNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F2H-Y9W3-SCMV-N0V8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">296938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"742\"/><timeReceived>12:32 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>US State News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 5, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

According to news originating from the University of Sussex by NewsRx correspondents, research stated, \"Over time, international environmental law has increasingly accommodated principles of equity and justice.\" </p><p><br/> Our news editors obtained a quote from the research from University of Sussex: \"Yet, climate equity remains a contentious, if not exclusionary, concept. This article applies new materialist theory and a posthuman perspective to climate equity. It explores the concept of climate (in)equity as enshrined in existing climate jurisprudence, and attempts to reimagine the concept in order to incorporate the subjectivity and interests of non-human matter into an otherwise enclosed and marketized climate-change legal discourse.\" <br/> According to the news editors, the research concluded: \"The analysis in this article finds that prejudicial approaches to climate equity that prioritize dominant human subjects produce unjust consequences for excluded, vulnerable human populations and for non-human subjects, with these unjust consequences shaping both policy and lived experience. The article suggests that adopting new materialist/posthuman ontological and epistemological pluralism will support the incorporation of human-non-human entanglements in climate equity, and that such a determination must extend to reforming the inequitable enclosures and exclusions driven by the climate equity assemblage.\" <br/> For more information on this research see: Reimagining climate equity to incorporate the non-human.

Appointed officials and bureaucrats across the federal government frantically spent money at a rate never before seen outside of pandemics and wars.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But there was no national emergency in these months. A very different motive drove their frantic spending. For the outgoing officials and the bureaucrats who supported them, it was their \u201cinsurance policy\u201d against losing power in Washington, D.C.</p><p>That claim was made by a member of the Biden-Harris administration who served as a special adviser to the Environmental Protection Agency. It was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.projectveritas.com/news/epa-advisor-admits-insurance-policy-against-trump-is-gold-bars-off-titanic\">captured</url> in a undercover investigation by Project Veritas and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2024/dec/5/donald-trump-proofing-biden-officials-strike-deals/\">reported</url> nearly a month after former Vice-President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election.</p><p>After the report, the Biden-Harris EPA spokesman <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/ProjectVeritas/videos/breaking-epa-responds-to-project-veritas-investigation-denies-wrongdoing-vows-to/1266381518028203/\">denied</url> any wrongdoing. In the weeks and months that followed, the allegation was not confirmed. It seemed the story was at a dead end.</p><p>Evidence Emerges of a Wild Spending Spree</p><p>That changed on February 12, 2024. The new EPA administrator, <url normalizedValue=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-zeldin-epa-climate-change-9f0def092a907deb5209c2b9ac14a81d\">Lee Zeldin</url>, confirmed in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://youtu.be/MxkzQn8S5p0\">video announcement</url> that the EPA rushed large amounts of cash out the door in the Biden-Harris administration's waning days.</p><p>Here's a transcript of the portion of the video directly addressing the allegation:</p><p>One of my very top priorities at EPA is to be an excellent steward of your hard-earned tax dollars. There will be zero tolerance of any waste and abuse.</p><p>An extremely disturbing video circulated two months ago featuring a Biden EPA political appointee talking about how they were \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d, rushing to get billions of your tax out the door before Inauguration Day. The \u201cgold bars\u201d were tax dollars and tossing them off the Titanic meant the Biden Administration knew they were wasting it.</p><p>Following this revelation, during my meetings with members of Congress, I made a very important commitment to them and to the American people, which I reiterated at my confirmation hearing that if confirmed, I would immediately get a full accounting.</p><p>Fortunately, my awesome team at EPA has found the gold bars. Shockingly, roughly 20 billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA.</p><p>This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight.</p><p>Even further, this pot of $20 billion was awarded to just eight entities that were then responsible for doling out your money to NGOs and others at their discretion with far less transparency. Just under $7 billion was sent to one entity called the Climate United Fund.</p><p>I'm sure you and I now have some of the same questions.</p><p>- How do these organizations decide how to allocate funding?<br/>- How much money have they given out so far and to whom?<br/>- Are there any former Biden EPA staff offers who are now working at these entities?</p><p>Let me make one thing abundantly clear. At this point there is zero reason to suspect any wrongdoing by the bank.</p><p>Here's my position as EPA administrator. The financial agent agreement with the bank needs to be instantly terminated and the bank must immediately return all of the gold bars that the Biden Administration tossed off the Titanic.</p><p>EPA needs to reassume responsibility for all of these funds. We will review every penny that has gone out the door. I will be referring this matter to the Inspector General's office and will work with the Justice Department as well.</p><p>The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.</p><p>The American public deserves a more transparent and accountable government than what transpired these past four years. We take our obligations under the law as seriously as it gets.</p><p>I've directed my team to find your gold bars and they found them. Now we will get them back inside of control of government as we pursue next steps.</p><p>To get so much money out the door so quickly, Biden-Harris EPA officials circumvented safeguards intended to prevent government officials from wasting taxpayer money. They were indeed\u201cthrowing gold bars\u201d off their \u201csinking Titanic.\u201d Their actions to short-cut these spending controls gave them away.</p><p>Potential Criminal Dimensions</p><p>In addition to circumventing the EPA's accounting controls, the officials and bureaucrats may alsohave tripped over other laws restricting government employees from exploiting their positions for personal gain.</p><p>For example, if any officials improperly moved taxpayer funds to groups where they later got jobs after leaving public service, that feather-nesting could represent a kind of embezzlement or racketeering. The Justice Department <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2025/02/14/epa-banking-on-a-fight-over-gold-bars-00204384\">will very likely investigate that potential</url>.</p><p>I suppose the most amazing part about the story is the original claim made by the Biden-Harris special adviser to the EPA. Their brazenness following their election loss suggests they didn't think they would ever face any consequences for their actions. It's a remarkable dimension in the annals of bureaucrats behaving badly.</p><p> - This article was <url normalizedValue=\"https://blog.independent.org/2025/02/20/bureaucrats-tossing-gold-bars-off-the-titanic/\">published at The Beacon</url><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EUSRVW-476520973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EUSRVW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5S-KS63-RSBF-C3WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">417294</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"867\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Buzz Future LLC Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"ro\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://syndigate.info\">(Syndigate.info)</url></emphasis></emphasis> All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Eurasia Review</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"35455\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 21, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"86\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N921100MM</classCode><className>US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000106</classCode><className>APPOINTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

The plan includes 17 goals and over 70 strategies the city wants to implement by 2030 to facilitate reaching the effort's end objective, such as promoting waste reduction and increasing electric vehicle use.</p><p>In a recent analysis, the city found only three goals were \"on track,\" such as waste reduction, electrifying vehicle miles and planting more trees. Despite progress, 11 out of the 17 goals are either in \"need of support\" or \"off track.\" Some of these include reducing emissions for buildings, protecting farmland and increasing public transit use. Current data on each goal's progress was not available in the report.</p><p>Braden Latham-Jones, the climate program manager for the city's Office of Sustainability, said the department struggled to make further progress because of a need for additional investment, staff and technology. According to the memo, Austin initially received $242 million in federal grants, but Latham-Jones said the city needs around $1 billion total to accomplish the plan's objectives.</p><p>\"Some of these goals are things the city can do just on its own and some things rely on people making different choices in their own life to get to the goals,\" Latham-Jones said. \"Some are going to be easier to accomplish with that additional investment and additional staff capacity.\"</p><p>Another barrier to meet the plan's goals is providing economic incentives to residents, said David Eaton, a natural resource policy studies professor. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, some incentives are low-interest loans and grants. When these benefits aren't available, the city relies on people to voluntarily contribute to the cause, which will take Austin more time to reach its sustainability goals, Eaton said.</p><p>\"People may understand that it's a good thing (to adopt sustainable practices) and they want to do that,\" Eaton said. \"Voluntary changes of behavior are very powerful.\"</p><p>Caroline Gamble, the internal relations director of the Campus Environmental Center, said a lack of education on sustainability is another reason why climate progress is delayed.</p><p>\"It's really important to implement the mindset of a circular economy within people,\" said Gamble, a sustainability studies and economics senior. \"The sustainability transition is ... getting behind the mindset of what sustainability really means.\"</p><p>The memo stated the city will launch a two-year climate implementation plan in March to get the goals back on track. As part of the initiative, the city will create teams that will analyze barriers to achieving climate goals, how to overcome them and produce reports on their findings.</p><p>\"There's a lot of focus on the need to really make a meaningful dent on our emissions, locally, nationally (and) globally to avert the worst case scenario with climate change,\" Latham-Jones said. \"We're seeing a lot of people come to terms with that and be ready to take action, and this is another great example of that.\"</p><p>Despite the city enacting initiatives to reach its sustainability goals, Latham-Jones said it's a collaborative effort to combat the climate crisis.</p><p>\"A lot can be done when we all focus on a goal together,\" Latham-Jones said. \"We've seen that happen with COVID ... and it was historic. We've done it recently and we could do it again.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">UWIRE-6062987</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">UWIRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F24-SJB3-RX06-T4K9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">172244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 UWIRE via U-Wire All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Texan: University of Texas - Austin</publicationName><aggregationName>University Wire</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 4, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.city\"><classificationItem><className>Austin</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>TX</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

Each of these groups feature combinations of former Obama and Biden administration employees and officials from labor unions and left-wing environmental activist groups on their boards.</p><p>Project Veritas, a right-wing activist group, published secretly-recorded footage of a Biden EPA appointee discussing how the agency was \u201ctossing gold bars off the Titanic\u201d in the final days of the Biden administration and before the Trump administration arrived to curb excessive federal spending. Zeldin referenced the footage in his statement announcing the agency's intent to recover the $20 billion.</p><p>However, the Biden EPA parked the $20 billion at Citibank before the Trump administration's arrival, ostensibly in an attempt to make it more difficult for incoming Trump EPA personnel to access the funds. Zeldin made clear in his remarks that Citibank is not suspected of any sort of wrongdoing with its involvement, but the Trump EPA wants to terminate the underlying agreement with the bank that the Biden EPA signed.</p><p>\u201cRoughly twenty billion of your tax dollars were parked at an outside financial institution by the Biden EPA. This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight,\u201d Zeldin said in his statement.</p><p>Zeldin added that he will be referring the matter to the EPA Office of the Inspector General and that his agency will also work with the Department of Justice.</p><p>\u201cProtect the Public's Trust, along with the Daily Caller News Foundation, has been among those sounding the alarm on this greendoggle for over two years now. Many of us recognized the issues and potential for abuse that were likely to manifest themselves due to the manner in which the Biden administration structured the program. Many of the recipient organizations were tied to the Biden administration and its political allies,\u201d Michael Chamberlain, executive director of Protect the Public's Trust, a government watchdog group, told the DCNF. \u201cIn fact, one of the recipients of billions from the GGRF had a board member who was likely involved in creating the program while serving in the Biden White House. What a surprise that EPA awarded funds to this group ... It appears as though our concerns with this program were more than justified.\u201d</p><p>All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Kathy Hochul, D-New York, issued the following news release on Feb. 5, 2025:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">New Yorkers Encouraged to Record Tree Plantings to Contribute to Statewide Sustainability and Reforestation Goals</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every Tree Planted Contributes to State Goal of 25 Million Trees by 2033</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* * *</p><p>Governor Kathy Hochul today announced the launch of a new webpage and interactive tracking tool to help document progress toward New York State's goal to plant 25 million trees by 2033. Hosted by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and developed in cooperation with the Office of Information Technology Services, the webpage and Tree Tracker allow State agencies, organizations, private entities, and individuals to report the location and number of trees planted into the tracking tool, measuring progress in the statewide effort.</p><p>\"New York is taking decisive action to protect our environment and strengthen communities' ability to withstand severe weather,\" Governor Hochul said. \"Our progress toward the 25 Million Tree goal is a testament to the power of community-driven action, and the new Tree Tracker will make it easier for New Yorkers to track our progress, share updates and contribute to a healthier environment for the future.\"</p><p>Trees planted in 2024 and on count toward the statewide total. Every entry records the number and location of trees planted. Entries can also include additional information such as planting date(s), tree species, and tree size. The webpage displays an interactive map of planting projects across New York State, and tallies trees planted by region, county, and municipality for visitors to track planting across the state as the initiative progresses toward the 25 million tree goal.</p><p>In addition to linking to the Tree Tracker, the 25 Million Trees webpage provides information on how to plant trees, how to care for them to aid their survival, and where to go for more technical assistance.</p><p>Department of Environmental Conservation Interim Commissioner Sean Mahar said, \"Working with the New Yorkers we serve, the 25 Million Tree Goal is helping to address our sustained efforts to protect communities and natural resources across the state. Every tree planted is a step toward a healthier, greener New York. The Tree Tracker will empower New Yorkers to share their stories with us as our partners in this historic effort, which will have a lasting impact on the environment.\"</p><p>The Nature Conservancy's New York Executive Director Bill Ulfelder said, \"The Nature Conservancy is pleased to see New York State unveil new tools to document progress towards New York's goal to plant 25 million trees by 2033. Achieving this goal would help New York meet its carbon reduction goals while protecting clean drinking water, restoring wildlife habitat, and reducing the risks of extreme heatwaves, which can be fatal in neighborhoods without trees.\"</p><p>Governor Hochul launched the 25 Million Trees Initiative in her 2024 State of the State address, allocating $32 million in Clean Water, Clean Air and Green Jobs Environmental Bond Act Funds to modernize the State's tree nursery and harness technology to track forestation efforts in New York and $15 million in the Executive Budget to support resilient reforestation projects. The Initiative is invigorating statewide tree planting efforts, sending an unmistakable market signal to private nurseries, and growing the state's vital forest products industry. The Initiative advances the climate equity and reforestation goals outlined in New York's Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act and contributes to New York's broader efforts to reduce the pollution contributing to climate change.</p><p>The 25 Million Trees Initiative also highlights funding opportunities for afforestation and reforestation projects in New York State. Private landowners had access to $4.5 million for projects expanding and restoring forests through the Establishing Large Forests (ELF) Grant Program, and $15 million is currently available to municipalities, not-for-profits, and State agencies to create forested natural areas servicing urban communities through the Community Reforestation (CoRe) Grant Program until March, 12, 2025.</p><p>New York's 25 Million Trees Initiative also contributes in part to the Great Lakes St. Lawrence Governors and Premiers' call for planting 250 million trees around the Great Lakes region by 2033.</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-launch-new-25-million-trees-initiative-tree-tracker\">https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-announces-launch-new-25-million-trees-initiative-tree-tracker</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9037465 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9037465</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F2K-24M3-S041-425B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"762\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 6, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

It also covered enhanced teen programming.</p><p>The Skyline Hills Recreation Center saw a funding surge from $6,440 to $84,000 that was spent partly on a young engineers program and a cheer and dance team.</p><p>While the program has made a difference, it has also suffered some growing pains.</p><p>City officials provided funding to only six neighborhoods the first year, with the goal of getting each of them to the minimum funding goal for city rec centers of just over $80,000.</p><p>But in year two, the goal was changed to $50,000 in 10 neighborhoods so that the Opportunity Fund could help more areas.</p><p>The annual funding estimate of $1 million was also revised downward in the face of backlash from groups that pay the Opportunity Fund fee.</p><p>The $1 million was based on the fee being applied to all permitted events, facility use by sports leagues, room and pool rentals and other operations in city parks.</p><p>But city officials say they got complaints from youth sports leagues and nonprofits that the Opportunity Fund fee was substantially increasing permit costs and jeopardizing their ability to keep operating at city facilities.</p><p>Consequently, city officials agreed that youth sports leagues would only be charged the Opportunity Fund fee for game-day rental hours and not for practice hours. And nonprofits were given lower fees and only charged during event hours.</p><p>The Opportunity Fund fee is an additional surcharge beyond ordinary permit and facility use fees.</p><p>For outdoor events with fewer than 50 people, the fee is $1 an hour for nonprofits and $5 for commercial enterprises. With more people, the cost is $10 an hour for nonprofits and $20 an hour for commercial use.</p><p>Room rentals are $1 an hour for nonprofits and $10 an hour for commercial.</p><p>Youth Sports Leagues pay $1 per hour for use of courts and fields. Adult leagues pay $2 an hour.</p><p>Just over two-thirds of Opportunity Fund revenue comes from outdoor events, with another 26% from sports leagues and 7% from room rentals.</p><p>All of these fees are slated to rise by 19.5% this spring. San Diego is sharply increasing fees to help close a projected $258 million budget deficit.</p><p>The city uses a complex formula to decide which neighborhoods get Opportunity Fund money. It includes income data from the U.S. Census, the city\u2019s climate equity index and the Parks and Recreation Department\u2019s tactical equity plan.</p><p>Those criteria combine to help officials evaluate a neighborhood\u2019s income level, resources and vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>Marcella Bothwell, chair of the city\u2019s Parks and Recreation Board, said Wednesday that the Opportunity Fund could really make a difference to long-neglected city neighborhoods.</p><p>\u201cThere\u2019s a long, long history of the recreation centers south of Interstate 8 not having the same level of programming as the recreation centers north of the 8,\u201d Bothwell said. \u201cThis is a chance to take a tiny bit of revenue and use it to make things more equitable.\u201d</p><p>When the fund was established, Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera said it had the potential to be \u201ctransformational\u201d for many city neighborhoods that have had relatively scant resources.</p><p>\u201cThis is a really, really good step to equitably redistribute from communities that are literally overflowing with resources to communities with limited access to opportunity,\u201d Elo-Rivera said.</p><p>The other neighborhoods that have gotten Opportunity Fund money so far are Mountain View, Stockton, Bay Terraces, Southcrest and City Heights.</p><p>Funding has also gone to the Willie Henderson Sports Complex, Park de la Cruz Recreation Center and the Cesar Solis Skate Park in Ocean View Hills.</p><p>\u00a92025 The San Diego Union-Tribune.

On August 15, Mayor Jacob Frey gave the 2024 budget address, which included a first-time Climate Legacy Initiative. While the budget details are not yet available, the coalition -- made up of local labor, immigrant rights, climate, and environmental justice organizations -- is cautiously optimistic that new staff and programs to promote racial equity in the transition to clean energy will get funding next year.</p><p>\"Seeing the City listen to constituents and invest fully in the first year of a decade of transition is huge,\" said Ulla Nilsen, MN350 Senior Organizer on the MN350 Green New Deal Team. \"We look forward as a coalition to reviewing the budget details, and to continue to partner on ramping up the funding necessary to implement the new Climate Equity Plan. In the meantime, we celebrate the fact that the Mayor and City Council heard the community and announced a budget to support this historic step forward for climate and equity.\"</p><p>In mid-July, after receiving more than 800 public comments on the draft plan, the Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously to pass a strong 10-year Climate Equity Plan that centers dignified, good-paying jobs, green workforce development in communities of color, support for universal weatherization and electrification upgrades, infrastructure improvements, future solution planning, and the staffing needed to oversee, direct, implement, and conduct community engagement for these programs.</p><p>Residents from all thirteen wards in the city, supported by the coalition, have been gathering since 2021 to strategize around raising the funds necessary to not only build out climate solutions but ensure that the benefits of the clean energy transition are available to every Minneapolis resident -- no exceptions. Dubbed the People's Climate &amp; Equity campaign, coalition members and residents have come together to work with city council members and the mayor on a climate plan grounded in an equitable transition to a clean energy economy. Today, the coalition celebrates the city's commitment of funding this transition.</p><p>Visit MN350's website for more information about the grassroots People's Climate &amp; Equity Plan.</p><p>###</p><p>ABOUT</p><p>Known as the Just Transition Fund, a multigenerational, multiracial coalition of local labor, immigrant rights, and environmental justice organizations have come together to work with city council members and the mayor on a climate plan grounded in an equitable transition to a clean energy economy.</p><p>Coalition members include:</p><p>Awood Center</p><p>Black Visions</p><p>Community Power</p><p>Cooperative Energy Futures</p><p>Environmental Justice Advocates of MN</p><p>Health Professionals for a Healthy Climate</p><p>ISAIAH</p><p>Minneapolis Federation of Teachers</p><p>MN350</p><p>MN Interfaith Power and Light</p><p>MN Renewable Now</p><p>Minnesota Environmental Justice Table</p><p>SEIU Local 26</p><p>Sierra Club North Star Chapter</p><p>Take Action MN</p><p>Unidos MN</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://mn350.org/news/coalition-of-labor-immigrant-rights-climate-justice-and-faith-organizations-laud-minneapolis-financial-commitment-to-climate-equity/\">https://mn350.org/news/coalition-of-labor-immigrant-rights-climate-justice-and-faith-organizations-laud-minneapolis-financial-commitment-to-climate-equity/</url></p><p>[Category: Energy]</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-8245780 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR8245780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6908-NSC1-DYG2-R3TJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"567\"/><timeReceived>9:31 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 18, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This legislation shapes the U.S. food system and covers everything from nutrition to conservation and crop insurance. The last food and farm bill expired in September 2023, and Congress passed a one-year extension shortly after to keep agricultural programs running until a new bill is signed into law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act, proposed but not yet introduced in full by Stabenow, critically protects climate-friendly guardrails around billions of dollars in investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that are intended to support farmers in being part of the climate solution. Thompson's proposal suggests removing those guardrails to allow funding to be used for practices with no demonstrated climate benefits.</p><p>A truly sustainable agricultural system must include sustainable working conditions. A review of Stabenow's proposal indicates that her bill would improve coordination across the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for food and farmworkers by reauthorizing and expanding the Farmworker Coordinator position and providing workers with support to withstand disruptions to the food and farm economy, whether from extreme weather or global pandemics.</p><p>The proposal also includes provisions to create a more just and equitable food and farm system by increasing support for farmers who have been historically underserved or excluded from USDA support and services namely Black farmers and ranchers, Indigenous producers and other farmers of color and ensuring that all farmers, no matter their background, can compete and succeed. Thompson's House proposal does not appear to contain any provisions to address the needs of workers or historically underserved farmers.</p><p>Finally, the Senate proposal would protect modernization of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to ensure that food assistance reflects the true cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific and dietary guidelines.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists:</p><p>\"Farmers are increasingly impacted by extreme weather driven by climate change, and any final food and farm bill must help farmers become more resilient to climate impacts like increasingly severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding while also reducing agricultural emissions that are contributing to the climate crisis. Protecting and preserving Inflation Reduction Act conservation funding for climate-smart farming practices is critical and should not be up for discussion or negotiation. This isn't a fringe issue polls show that the public strongly supports programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>\"The public also supports protecting the workers who keep our country fed and helping people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. Senator Stabenow's proposal takes important steps to rectify a history of exclusion and discrimination by addressing the unique barriers faced by historically underserved farmers and ranchers and finally recognizing food and farmworkers as a critical part of our agriculture and food system. Workers have been clear that they deserve a voice in the food and farm bill and in USDA policies that affect their workplaces and their lives.</p><p>\"A new food and farm bill provides an opportunity to create a food system that is more resilient in the face of extreme weather and climate change, is more sustainable for future generations, is more just and equitable for farmers and workers, and keeps people from going hungry. The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act appears to demonstrate a serious understanding and reckoning with the challenges facing our food and farm system, and the changes necessary to build a more sustainable, resilient and equitable food system that works for everyone. This proposal should be the starting point for all future conversations about the food and farm bill.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126525333</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BXW-W7G1-DYTH-G4Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"730\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 1, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Asked for comment on the status of the fund, EPA referred POLITICO to a videotaped statement Feb. </p><p>12 in which Administrator Lee Zeldin demanded that a total of $20 billion in Biden-era green grants be returned - vowing, \"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over.\" Power Forward, one of eight recipients across two grant programs totaling $20 billion, has found itself swept up in the growing political storm surrounding Zeldin's attempts to revoke the awards - part of the Trump administration's wider effort to expand its constitutional powers by throttling already-enacted spending it disagrees with. Congress approved the $20 billion as part of a Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund created by former President Joe Biden's 2022 climate law, and Biden's EPA contractually obligated the money before last October, as the statute required. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund also includes another $7 billion for solar grants. The Trump administration's efforts to revoke the climate cash have kicked off a spiraling mess that shows no signs of ending. A senior federal prosecutor resigned last week after saying Justice Department officials had pressured her to launch a criminal investigation into the green grant program despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing. Meanwhile, Zeldin has taken the unorthodox step of trying to get Citibank, where Biden's administration had deposited $20 billion of the funds, to send it back. Zeldin has condemned the grants as an example of \"waste and abuse,\" though without specifying what aspects of the spending he considers wasteful or abusive. \"I'm a little perplexed that this is at all controversial,\" Mayopoulos - a former CEO of Fannie Mae - told POLITICO. \"We are in violent agreement with the president that the cost of housing and the cost of energy is too high for many Americans, and we are looking to address that issue.\" Zeldin has also attempted to lay the dispute at the feet of former Democratic Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams - even referring to Mayopoulos' group as \"Stacey Abram's Power Forward Communities\" in an EPA press release last week \" of Biden. But Mayopoulos said Abrams, a former paid adviser to one of Power Forward's member groups, is no longer involved with his organization. \"Stacey Abrams has not received a penny of this EPA grant. It was never the plan for her to receive any money from this grant,\" Mayopoulos said in the interview. \"Power Forward Communities has no relationship with Ms. Abrams, other than the fact that she's one of the people who have advised one of our coalition members in the past.\" That coalition member, Rewiring America, confirmed to POLITICO that Abrams' contract with the group expired at the end of 2024. Abrams never received any payments from or held a position with Power Forward Communities, nor did she get any money from the EPA grant, Abrams spokesperson Joshua Karp said. In her advisory role with Rewiring America, Abrams did work to identify potential partners for the coalition now working on the grant, Karp said. Abrams alluded to that role in a post on X in October 2023 , writing: \"Thrilled to be part of @rewiringamerica and the Power Forward Communities coalition. This is how we expand access to clean energy - by prioritizing housing, equity and resilience.\" In his attacks on the grant, Zeldin has repeatedly pointed to an undercover video recording that Power Forward and seven other recipients would get the money for projects designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Mayopoulos said the money that Power Forward is spending would support energy efficiency upgrades, build homes and boost lending capital for rural, affordable and multifamily housing. Zeldin has expressed doubts about Power Forward's selection to oversee the $2 billion grant, noting that the organization had formed only in 2023 and had revenues of just $100, according to federal tax filings. The EPA chief told Fox News on Sunday that the Justice Department \"has been asking a lot of questions of us\" and that Citibank is cooperating with the department. Though he has not cited any evidence of illegal behavior, he said that \"the entire scheme, in my opinion, is criminal.\" Citibank declined to comment. Mayopoulos said those accusations misrepresent his organization, which intends to improve or build 11,000 multifamily and 61,000 single-family homes, spur 64,000 jobs and curb energy bills $1.26 billion over the seven-year grant period. The coalition's member groups have long histories of rolling out major spending projects, Mayopoulos added. Together they have combined for $100 billion in projects across 1.4 million affordable homes, Power Forward Communities said. \"Power Forward Communities was created to serve as the coalition entity for these five respected nonprofits,\" Mayopoulos said. \"They clearly have the experience and capabilities and proven track record over two-and-a-half centuries of collective work to do this and to fulfill this grant.\" Besides United Way and Habitat for Humanity, Power Forward's members include the affordable housing group Enterprise Community Partners. The other partners are the Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which specializes in financing projects in areas that struggle to attract private-sector investment, and Rewiring America, which aims to electrify homes and curb fossil fuel use. Program supporters have worried the Trump administration's threats to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund could create a chilling effect on spending the money . But Mayopoulos said he is \"confident\" that Citibank will honor the agreements it has with the Treasury Department and the EPA, calling it a \"large and highly respected financial institution.\" Mayopoulos argued that the money will help achieve Trump's goals of reducing energy costs. The awards that Power Forward announced Monday include $115 million for rural Americans - who largely backed Trump - in states such as West Virginia and Alabama, with much of that used to finance new multifamily housing. Two other awards would boost multifamily lending by $424 million across 20 states, including Georgia, Louisiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Texas and Florida.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-000001953a90d057af9ffb9254a20000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FDN-0CX3-S5VX-X0C6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1189\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 25, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Administration to unfreeze this funding, access has not been restored, leaving my Administration with no choice but to pursue legal action to protect the interests of the Commonwealth and its

reclamation efforts to repair damaged coal mine lands and cap old gas wells that had been abandoned over the years.</p><p>A regional think tank, the Ohio River Valley Institute, said its economic

All eyes are on what House Republicans will end up cutting from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) to try and extend the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA), portions of which are due to expire at the end of this year. Possibly with an even greater impact, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced its intention to revisit the Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, the statutory foundation for its authority to regulate carbon emissions from power plants, stationary sources, and vehicles. Finally, the White House followed through on promises to boost domestic mining and the production of critical minerals, leveraging a number of executive tools.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Status Update on Reconciliation and the Inflation Reduction Act Tax Credits</p><p>The House and Senate adopted separate budget resolutions with reconciliation instructions. While the Senate originally wanted to pursue a two-bill approach with energy, border security, and defense preceding tax, they have switched to the House's one 'beautiful' comprehensive reconciliation bill, likely due to the fact that the House can only afford to lose three of its own members if it wants to pass a bill. Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-SD) has ambitiously indicated that he wants to advance a new budget resolution that lets the Senate and House set their own spending cut minimums before Congress leaves for Easter recess. This strategy would push off fights to resolve major sticking points until the end of the month. Added to the House's task, the White House recently inserted a requirement for the House bill to extend the debt ceiling. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) has said he wants to get a reconciliation bill to Trump's desk by Memorial Day.</p><p>The House resolution that passed on February 25 calls on the House Energy and Commerce Committee to reduce the federal deficit by at least $880 billion over ten years in order to support extending the TCJA rates. One analysis indicates hitting this number will require at least $700 billion in cuts to Medicaid funding, potentially a very problematic step for Republicans. Several offsets are also expected from the rescission of IRA tax credits, including the Advanced Manufacturing Tax Credit (45-X), the Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit (45-V), and the consumer electric vehicle tax credit (30-D). Various estimates have reported that repealing 45-X would contribute $120 - 250 billion to that $880 billion goal and repealing 45-V would contribute $13 - 120 billion. However, given that these credits serve projects disproportionately in Republican states, it may prove difficult for the Republicans to maintain solidarity down this path with only a 3-seat House majority. Even elimination of 30-D tax credits, which could end up saving $192 billion, may be questionable because it would negatively impact US electric vehicle manufacturers, including Tesla, and would be detrimental to the administration's efforts to support the US critical minerals and vehicle manufacturing industries. This would be on top of the effect of tariffs announced by the administration impacting the auto industry.</p><p>Also at play are tax credits for industries that Republicans may look more favorably on, such as the 45-Q carbon capture credit and the technology-neutral investment and production tax credits. In line with this, a March 9 letter from 21 House Republicans to House Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith (R-MO) opposed cuts or what House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington has been calling a 'thoughtful' phase out of the IRA. Adding to IRA support, the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), representing US investor-owned electric companies, came out strongly in support of maintaining the technology neutral ITC and PTC, claiming that they will save US consumers approximately $45 billion between 2025 and 2032.</p><p>Meanwhile, the Senate may betaking a more modest approach, with Chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Mike Lee (R-UT), reportedly targeting a range of $5 - 10 billion in energy-related cuts. If the House were able to pass its single reconciliation bill, this indicates that it is far from certain it would make it through the Senate.</p><p>With the outcome far from certain, ML Strategies will continue actively tracking IRA tax credit developments, providing updates to clients directly.</p><p>Trump's Critical Minerals Executive Order</p><p>On March 20, President Trump signed an Executive Order ( <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production/\">EO) on 'Immediate Measures to Increase American Mineral Production.' The EO asserts that reliance on foreign mineral production, particularly from hostile nations, threatens national and economic security. In response, the President directs a series of immediate measures across various federal departments and agencies to expedite permitting, prioritize mineral projects on federal lands, clarify regulations, and stimulate public and private capital investment in the domestic mineral sector.</url></p><p>Some highlights of the EO include the following:</p><p>All Agencies involved in the permitting of mineral production are to provide to the Chair of the NEDC a list of all mineral production projects for which a plan of operations, a permit application, or other application for approval has been submitted. The NEDC will identify projects for prioritized approval and expedited permitting.</p><p>The NEDC is directed toissue a request for information to solicit industry feedback on regulatory bottlenecks and other recommended strategies for expediting domestic mineral production. The Chair of the NEDC and the Director of the Office of Legislative Affairs are also directed to jointly prepare and submit recommendations to the President for Congress to clarify the treatment of waste rock, tailings, and mine waste disposal under the Mining Act of 1872.</p><p>The Secretary of Defense:</p><p>Is delegated Presidential Authority under Section 303 of the Defense Production Act (DPA), in consultation with other agency heads, for domestic production and facilitation of strategic resources the Secretary of Defense deems necessary to advance mineral production in the United States.</p><p>Is directed to add mineral production as a priority industrial capability development areafor the Industrial Base Analysis and Sustainment Program.</p><p>Is directed to utilize the National Security Capital Forum to facilitate the introduction of entities to private capital.</p><p>Significant DPA authorities are delegated to the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) for domestic mineral production, with loan authority limited to projects that create, maintain, protect, expand, or restore domestic production. The DFC and the Secretary of Defense are instructed to develop a plan to establish a dedicated mineral production fund for domestic investments, potentially utilizing DoD investment authorities from the DPA and the Office of Strategic Capital.</p><p>The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Industrial Base Policy is directed to convene and announce requests for bids for buyers of minerals.</p><p>The Secretary of the Interior is directed to provide a list of all federal lands known to hold mineral deposits and reserves, while declaring mineral production and mining-related purposes as the priority land use in these areas, allowing amendments to land use plans as needed.</p><p>The Secretaries of Interior, Defense, Agriculture, and Energy are directed to identify federal land sites suitable for commercial mineral production enterprises.</p><p>The Secretaries of Defense and Energy are directed to enter into extended use leases with private entities to facilitate the establishment of commercial mineral production.</p><p>The Export-Import Bank is directed to release recommended program guidance for the use of mineral production financing tools authorized under the Supply Chain Resiliency Initiative to secure US offtake of global raw mineral feedstock for domestic minerals processing.</p><p>The Small Business Administration is directed to prepare and submit through the Assistant to the President for Economic Policy recommendations for legislation to enhance private-public capital activities to support financing to domestic small businesses engaged in mineral production.</p><p>The actions taken through the EO are positive overall and continue an environment of support for critical minerals that started in the first Trump administration and ran through the Biden administration. Taken in total, they are a very positive sign of where a second Trump administration may go to support critical minerals. More will need to be done, however, to address fundamental permitting, financing, and creation of demand signals for critical minerals projects to advance quickly. The DPA program, for example, was underfunded and understaffed to process the substantial number of applications they received for critical minerals as well as other defense critical materials. Projects applying to DFC for loans, under DPA or OSC authority, will likely need to show clear and substantial off-take and/or balance sheet strength to make it through successful underwriting. Permitting timelines will also continue to be an issue. It is likely that additional Congressional action, including permitting reform and appropriations, will be needed to accelerate US mining and processing of critical minerals.</p><p>Furthermore, curiously missing from the EO was any mention of supporting critical minerals development in allied countries. The DPA authorities referenced can be made available to Canada and Australia both of which have much more favorable permitting regimes for mining projects. The DoD previously  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3777044/department-of-defense-awards-147-million-to-enhance-north-american-cobalt-and-g/\">announced support of two Canadian projects under the DPA, with joint funding by the Canadian government. The latest EO would seem to discourage, if not eliminate, that avenue- meaning that US dependency on China will continue. In our view, this is where the EO falls short in addressing Chinese dependency.</url></p><p>You can read our more in-depth analysis of the EO  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mlstrategies.com/insights-center/viewpoints/2025-03-31-good-first-step-review-trump-administrations-critical\">here.</url></p><p>Agency Rollback of Clean Energy and Climate Projects</p><p>The administration continues to look at existing IRA programs, beyond tax incentives, to both help close their budget gap for the TCJA as well as align departments more closely to their policy positions.</p><p>Department of Energy (DOE)</p><p>On March 21, the DOE submitted to the Trump administration a list of clean energy projects to review for elimination. Any program or project that has spent less than 45 percent of its appropriated or awarded funding is required to be reviewed. Other projects on the list include $8 billion for hydrogen hubs, $7 billion for carbon capture hubs, $6.3 billion for industrial demonstrations, $50 million for distributed energy programs, $500 million for long-duration energy storage, and $133 million for the Liftoff program aimed at accelerating new technology development. It is still unclear exactly how the administration plans to enact rollbacks on the spending. While program agreements allow for DOE to exercise some level of management oversight, cancelling a project that is executing its plan would receive significant opposition and potential legal action, especially for those in Republican districts. Reports are circulating that the administration was considering eliminating only projects in Democratic districts, but that may be equally problematic. It remains to be seen if this extraordinary step is taken.</p><p>However, the administration's approach to some forms of clean technology seems to be clear, with Secretary Chris Wright stating at CERAWeek that he 'doesn't believe the scale-up of wind and solar are justified' and that 'there is simply no physical way that wind, solar and batteries could replace the myriad uses of natural gas.' However, he did defend DOE's national laboratories and called them 'underappreciated gems in our country.'He also committed to following through on loans made through the Loan Programs Office (LPO) at the end of the Biden administration, which implies loans reaching closing may be secure while others still waiting for conditional commitment are likely at risk without further clarification.</p><p>Department of Transportation (DOT)</p><p>On March 12, the DOT announced it was moving to freeze all unobligated and partially obligated discretionary grants or cooperative agreements that involve bicycles, climate, equity, or electric vehicles and their charging infrastructure. Funds will remain frozen until DOT reviews each project and decides whether to let it proceed, cancel, or revise it. In the case of revisions, teams are instructed to remove the 'offending parts and replace them with components that are aligned with the administration's policy.'</p><p>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</p><p>This past month, the EPA announced its intent to terminate $20 billion in climate grants from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF), having submitted the GGRF program to the Office of Inspector General, Department of Justice, and Federal Bureau of Investigation for review. EPA has the authority to cancel the contracts under specific and legally defined examples of waste, fraud and abuse. However, the fund awardees, Power Forward Communities, Climate United, and Coalition for Green Capital, claim this is not the case. These awardees sued Citibank, the steward of the money, who <url normalizedValue=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/03/climate-group-sues-epa-and-citibank-over-funding-freeze-00219920\">then sued EPA.

The lawsuit also accused Citibank of 'improperly complying with the government's campaign of intimidation and freezing funds that it is by law required to release.'</p><p>House Energy and Commerce Democrats have launched an  <url normalizedValue=\"https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/03/house-democrats-probe-epa-over-stalled-20b-climate-fund-00224835\">investigation into the EPA demanding the provision of its communications with the Treasury Department, Justice Department and Citibank in explanation of why funds are frozen. However, since Democrats are the minority, the EPA is not required to formally respond.</url></p><p>EPA's Flurry of Deregulation</p><p>EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/epa-launches-biggest-deregulatory-action-us-history\">announced the undertaking of 31 actions to deregulate Biden and Obama-era regulations, as directed by President Trump's earlier energy-related executive orders. The full list of actions can be viewed in the table below.</url></p><p>Most notably, however, the EPA announced it will be reconsidering the  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-08/documents/endangermentfinding_legalbasis.pdf\">2009 Greenhouse Gas Endangerment Finding, consistent with the '</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/\">Unleashing American Energy' EO released in January. The Endangerment Finding is the basis for regulating greenhouse gases (GHGs) under the Clean Air Act (</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-air-act\">CAA), allowing the EPA to set emission standards for power plants, vehicles, aircraft, and other sources that could impact health and welfare.

Trump appointees at the Justice Department announced they would restructure the Department of Justice's Environment and Natural Resources Division. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/10/30/opinion-five-things-know-john-podesta-tyler-oneil/\">(RELATED: TYLER O'NEIL: Five Things To Know About John Podesta)</url></emphasis></p><p>Shortly after her confirmation, Attorney General\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.justice.gov/ag/media/1388551/dl?inline\">Pam Bondi rescinded</url>\u00a0any \u201cmemoranda, guidance, or similar directive that implement the prior administration's 'environmental justice' agenda.\u201d</p><p>\u201cGoing forward, the Department will evenhandedly enforce all federal civil and criminal laws, including environmental laws,\u201d Bondi noted.</p><p>Why does this matter?</p><p>\u201cEnvironmental justice\u201d refers to the toxic brew of critical race theory and climate alarmism. According to critical race theory, America is institutionally racist against black people and other minorities and in favor of white people. According to climate alarmism, the burning of fossil fuels will bring about Armageddon.</p><p>The EPA defines \u201c<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice\">environmental justice</url>\u201d as ensuring that Americans \u201care fully protected from disproportionate and adverse human health and environmental effects (including risks) and hazards, including those related to climate change, the cumulative impacts of environmental and other burdens, and the legacy of racism or other structural or systemic barriers\u201d (emphasis added).</p><p>Trump entered office promising to unleash American energy and reverse the Biden administration's promotion of critical race theory and its application in the \u201cdiversity, equity, and inclusion\u201d movement. This diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) movement aims to promote some racial minorities, rejecting the colorblind approach of focusing on merit or competence.</p><p>While President George H.W. Bush established the EPA's Office of Environmental Equity - the office that President Bill Clinton would later rename the Office of Environmental Justice - President Joe Biden hypercharged its mission, directing all-of-government efforts on DEI, restrictions on fossil fuels, and a promotion of less reliable forms of energy, like wind and solar.</p><p>In doing so, Biden followed the demands of activist groups, many of which staffed and advised his administration.</p><p>As I note in my book, \u201cThe Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,\u201d Biden tapped climate alarmists for key leadership positions.</p><p>Biden picked Michael Regan, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, to head up the EPA. He selected Laura Daniel-Davis, a vice president at the National Wildlife Federation (NWF), to serve at the Department of the Interior. He nominated <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2021/06/24/tracy-stone-manning-bureau-of-land-management-joe-biden/\">Tracey Stone-Manning</url>, another NWF staffer who confessed to typing out a letter on behalf of tree-spiking eco-terrorists, to head the Bureau of Land Management.</p><p>Gina McCarthy, who headed EPA under President Barack Obama, became president of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://dailycaller.com/2024/07/17/major-enviro-groups-foreign-oil-offshore-wind/\">Natural Resources Defense Council</url> (NRDC) until Biden appointed her national climate adviser.</p><p>When Trump moved against the EPA's environmental justice office, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrdc.org/press-releases/epa-shutter-environmental-justice-office-disgrace\">NRDC released a statement</url> condemning the move as a \u201cdisgrace.\u201d Who did NRDC enlist to make the statement? None other than Matthew Tejada, who directed the Office of Environmental Justice from 2013 to 2022.</p><p>\u201cThe Trump EPA is abandoning the communities across our nation that need help the most,\u201d Tejada said. \u201cShuttering the environmental justice office will mean more toxic contaminants, dangerous air, and unsafe water in communities across the nation that have been most harmed by pollution in the past.\u201d</p><p>That conclusion, of course, relies on the assumptions of critical race theory and climate alarmism, however. If America is not institutionally racist but rather a country with civil rights laws that protect citizens of all races from discrimination, the EPA does not need an \u201cenvironmental justice\u201d office to combat pollution for Americans of specific skin colors.</p><p>If the <url normalizedValue=\"https://pjmedia.com/tyler-o-neil/2020/12/28/egg-on-their-faces-10-climate-alarmist-predictions-for-2020-that-went-horribly-wrong-n1289371\">predictions of climate disaster</url> are overblown and based on false assumptions that exaggerate the risks when actual deaths from climate disaster have <url normalizedValue=\"https://nypost.com/2022/04/30/deaths-in-climate-disasters-declined-99-from-a-century-ago/\">declined by 99% over the past century</url>, then perhaps the EPA need not invest extra funds in an office of environmental justice. If fossil fuels have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/transportation-air-pollution-and-climate-change/accomplishments-and-successes-reducing-air#:~:text=Historic%20Success%20of%20the%20Clean%20Air%20Act,lower%20than%20they%20were%20prior%20to%20regulation.\">gotten substantially cleaner</url>, perhaps the EPA should focus on specific air quality issues, rather than premonitions of global climate doom.</p><p>This seems to be at least part of the reasoning behind EPA's restructure.</p><p>\u201cUnder President Trump, the EPA will be focused on our core mission to protect human health and the environment, while Powering the Great American Comeback,\u201d EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThe previous Administration used DEI and Environmental Justice to advance ideological priorities, distributing billions of dollars to organizations in the name of climate equity. This ends now.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe will be good stewards of tax dollars and do everything in our power to deliver clean air, land, and water to every American, regardless of race, religion, background, and creed,\u201d he added.</p><p>While pollution affects Americans in different ways, the EPA need not indulge in critical race theory and climate alarmism to effectively combat the real threats Americans face. Rather than addressing supposed institutional racism and fossil fuel-induced disaster, the EPA should focus on its actual mission: protecting Americans from concrete instances of pollution and environmental harms.</p><p>Of course, those humdrum concerns don't require as much federal funding and staff - and that might explain the real reason behind the Left's freakout over Trump's move.</p><p>Tyler O'Neil is managing editor of The Daily Signal and the author of two books: \u201cMaking Hate Pay: The Corruption of the Southern Poverty Law Center,\u201d and \u201cThe Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government.\u201d</p><p>The views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.</p><p>All content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bill proposing to enshrine state emission reduction goals into law eked through its first committee on a 5-4 vote.</p><p>Senate President Pro Tempore Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) is the sponsor for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nmlegis.gov/Sessions/25%20Regular/bills/senate/SB0004.pdf\">Senate Bill 4, also called the Clear Horizons Act.</url></p><p>New Mexico is facing compounding climate disasters and an increased burden to address them, she said, and said the state needs to address the planet-warming emissions.</p><p>'I want to be part of the process that tries to eliminate the greenhouse gases,' said Stewart in closing comments. 'That's what's heating up the planet, there's just no question about it anymore.'</p><p>What's in the bill?</p><p>The bill, if adopted, sets goals to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels by 45% in 2030, 75% in 2040 and 100% in 2050 of the emission levels in 2005, spelling out in law an executive order Gov. Michelle Lujan issued in 2019.</p><p>The exact process would be determined through a rule-making process by the Environmental Improvement Board. In addition, the bill would establish yearly reports on New Mexico's emissions; require the state to prioritize reduction in 'overburdened communities;' and to consult with tribal governments.</p><p>It requests $3 million for the New Mexico Environment department to hire additional staff and run the emissions reduction program.</p><p>Stewart was joined by Gabe Pacyniak, an environmental law professor from the University of New Mexico law school to field questions from the committee.</p><p>Republican lawmakers asked questions centering on the economy, which veered off-topic at times during the two-hour hearing.</p><p>In one exchange with Sen. Larry Scott (R-Hobbs) asked if Stewart could explain gross domestic product to the committee, she responded 'all I want to talk to you about is billions of dollars that it's costing right now for the fires that we've had in New Mexico, fires they had in California - that affects our GDP.'</p><p>Republican senators asked multiple times how the bills would impact the price of utilities, food and gasoline prices.</p><p>While Democratic senators expressed their support, Sen. Joe Cervantes (D-Las Cruces) joined with Republicans on the committee in the vote against the bill.</p><p>In comments before the vote, Cervantes said he supported efforts to mitigate climate change, and called many of the goals in the bill 'laudable,' but said he was concerned the language of the bill is too vague and a target for lawsuits by industry, agriculture and business opponents.</p><p>'This is a field day for lawyers, this bill, and I don't think that's good, there's time wasted and opportunity wasted,' Cervantes said.</p><p>In public comment, lobbyists for oil and gas organizations and agriculture comprised most of the opposition, saying that the bill was too 'aggressive,' and saying the industries such as oil and gas and agriculture would be negatively impacted.</p><p>'We are very concerned about the unintended consequences to our job space and overall economy with such an aggressive mandate, ' said Terri Cole, the CEO for the Greater Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce. 'In particular, we believe the oil and gas industry will be negatively affected.'</p><p>Supporters of the bill included a coalition of two dozen climate, equity and community nonprofit groups who have endorsed the bill, several youths, the governor's climate advisor Travis Kellerman and New Mexico Environment Department Secretary James Kenney.</p><p>Ariella Proak De Varna and Adriana Martinez, eighth graders from Santa Fe Girls' School, read speeches developed as a class to share their support for the bill.</p><p>'We are counting on you to fulfill your responsibilities to the people of New Mexico,' Martinez said. 'So we urge you to choose legislation that will protect the future of our beloved state and the people who call it home.'</p><p>The students choose which bill they support, said Darya Glass, the co-director of the school and teaches civics and government.</p><p>In the hallways of the Roundhouse, one of their classmates, Paloma Rodriguez (Lipan Apache), said she enjoyed seeing the democratic process up close on an issue she's passionate about.</p><p>'I don't, of course, understand a lot about everything they're asking about, it's very clear that some of them were off topic and I don't think that really helps the bill at all,' Rodriguez said.</p><p>The bill is assigned to appear before the Senate Finance Committee next, which it would need to pass before heading to a floor vote.</p><p>GET THE MORNING HEADLINES.</p><p> SUBSCRIBE </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-STNW1000995253897315517725210100197</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">Newstex Blogs</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F0T-N5S3-RTV7-5042-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">567836</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"785\"/><timeReceived>10:48 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Here we show how GHG emissions from consumption and investments attributable to the wealthiest population groups have disproportionately influenced present-day climate change. We link emissions inequality over the period 1990\u20132020 to regional climate extremes using an emulator-based framework. We find that two-thirds (one-fifth) of warming is attributable to the wealthiest 10% (1%), meaning that individual contributions are 6.5 (20) times the average per capita contribution. For extreme events, the top 10% (1%) contributed 7 (26) times the average to increases in monthly 1-in-100-year heat extremes globally and 6 (17) times more to Amazon droughts. Emissions from the wealthiest 10% in the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions. Quantifying the link between wealth disparities and climate impacts can assist in the discourse on climate equity and justice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While climate injustice is widely recognized, a quantification of how emissions inequality translates into unequal accountability is still lacking. Here researchers examine how affluent groups disproportionately contribute to the increase in mean temperature and the frequency of extreme events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Main</emphasis>Over the past two decades, extreme events attributable to climate change resulted in an annual average of US$143 billion in damages1. How these costs could and should be covered\u2014both between and within countries\u2014is a matter of debate2. Central to this debate is the stark disparity between those responsible for emissions and those affected by their impacts. The wealthiest 10% of the global population accounted for nearly half of global emissions in 2019 through private consumption and investments, whereas the poorest 50% accounted for only one-tenth of global emissions3. At the same time, regions with low historic emissions and income levels are typically more frequently and severely exposed to climate impacts4,5 and have limited resources for adaptation6. This cause-and-effect injustice is widely acknowledged7, yet a quantification of how emissions inequality translates into unequal accountability for the resulting global temperature levels and extreme climate events is missing. This translation should account for the individual warming contributions of emissions of non-CO2 GHGs, such as methane (CH4), given their major role in recent warming8.</p><p>In this study we combine wealth-based carbon inequality assessments3 with an emulator-based climate modelling framework9 to systematically attribute changes in global mean temperature (GMT) levels and grid-cell-level climate extremes to emissions from different wealth groups. We use the Model for the Assessment of the Greenhouse Gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC)10, a simple climate model, in conjunction with the Modular Earth System Model Emulator for Monthly Temperature and Precipitation (MESMER-M-TP)11, a model that is able to generate large ensembles of spatially explicit monthly temperature and precipitation data that closely resemble those of complex Earth system models at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>We use attribution science frameworks to link human-induced GHG emissions to changes in the modelled frequency and intensity of extremes12. These frameworks were originally developed to attribute changes in total human emissions13,14. Today, they are increasingly applied for source attribution; that is, to quantify the relative contributions of individual emitter groups, such as companies or countries15,16. When attributing impacts among multiple emitters, various approaches exist and serve distinct purposes17,18. Here we assess the changes in the characteristics of monthly extremes but for the emissions attributable to a specific emitter group15,18.</p><p>We generate counterfactual emission pathways by subtracting the 1990\u20132019 emissions of specific emitter groups, namely the wealthiest 10%, 1% and 0.1% globally, as well as in the United States, EU27, India and China (Fig. 1b). Emissions data are drawn from ref. 3 and include emissions from domestic consumption, public and private investments and trade. These emissions are attributed primarily to consumers, except emissions from capital formation in production sectors, which are attributed to firm owners3. Emissions are reported as a basket of GHGs with warming expressed in CO2 equivalents. We convert these counterfactual pathways into GMT levels and gridded climatic variables (Fig. 1a), allowing us to compare the 2020 climate against the hypothetical 2020 climate state that we would observe if these groups had not emitted. Specifically, we attribute GMT levels and changes in the probability and intensity of extremely hot and dry months (Fig. 1c). Prolonged heat poses a significant burden on human health19 and sustained precipitation deficits impair crop yields and threaten water resources20, meaning that both climate extremes are highly relevant in driving climate impacts. We measure meteorological droughts with the standardized precipitation index computed over 3-month periods (SPI-3)20.Fig. 1</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Overview of the modelling framework using a schematic example.</emphasis></p><p>Counterfactual emissions were converted into GMT using the simple climate model MAGICC and subsequently translated into grid-cell-level realizations of climatic variables using MESMER-M-TP. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Counterfactual CO2 emissions pathways.

For illustration, we also provide counterfactual warming outcomes based on rescaling global emissions according to the per capita profile of individual income percentiles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Inequality in attributed global warming contributions</emphasis></p><p>Our modelling framework depicts natural variability and uncertainty in the global response to emission changes (Methods). Unless mentioned otherwise, we provide median results with the 5th\u201395th confidence intervals in parentheses. All results are statistically significant (established via a one-sample <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>-tests, Methods) unless explicitly marked otherwise. As our database provides only basket emissions, we derived the main results by assuming that emissions for each GHG scale proportionally with the globally aggregated emissions (Methods). We explore the sensitivity to this assumption in Supplementary Section 2.</p><p>GMT in 2020 is 0.61 \u00b0C (0.45\u20130.83 \u00b0C) higher than in 1990. We found that about 65% (0.40 \u00b0C (0.27\u20130.56 \u00b0C)) of this increase is attributable to the global top 10%, 20% (0.12 \u00b0C (0.09\u20130.17 \u00b0C)) to the top 1% and 8% (0.05 \u00b0C (0.03\u20130.07 \u00b0C)) to the top 0.1% (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table 3). These warming contributions are higher (by about one-fifth) than the respective group\u2019s contributions to aggregated GHG basket emissions (Supplementary Table 2), underscoring the importance of non-CO2 GHGs21 (see also Supplementary Section 2).Fig. 2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attributed 1990\u20132020 GMT increases by emitter group.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>, Median GMT increase over 1990\u20132020 and the shares attributed to global top 10%, 1% and 0.1%.

Vertical lines represent the 5th\u201395th confidence intervals from natural variability and uncertainty in the global temperature response. Circles highlight median values from the sensitivity analysis. Estimates are based on 600 ensemble members each.</p><p>To put these numbers into perspective, we defined a group\u2019s equal share as the contribution to warming they would have if their per capita impact matched the global average. Therefore, we scaled the total GMT increase according to the group\u2019s share of the global population (for example, the equal share of the global top 10% would be 10% of the full 0.61 \u00b0C increase). We then derived climate inequality factors (CIFs) as the group\u2019s actual contribution to global warming relative to their equal share. CIFs increase from 6.5 for the top 10% to 20 (77) for the top 1% (0.1%), indicating an amplification of climate inequality with increasing wealth.</p><p>The full depth of the disproportion in contributions to GMT level becomes tangible when global emissions are rescaled according to the per capita profile of global income groups (Fig. 2b). If the entire world population had emitted like the bottom 50%, there would have been minimal additional warming since 1990. However, if the entire world population had emitted like the top 10%, 1% or 0.1%, the GMT increase since 1990 would have been 2.9 \u00b0C, 6.7 \u00b0C or 12.2 \u00b0C.</p><p>Between 1990 and 2020, emissions from the global top 10% arose primarily in the world\u2019s highest emitting countries: the United States, the EU27, China and India (Fig. 2c). Note that the composition of the global top 10% shifts over time (Supplementary Fig. 1), and while our focus is on wealthy individuals from the world\u2019s largest economies, those from smaller (wealthier, as well as less wealthy) countries also contribute disproportionately3. Income levels from regional top emitters deviate from their global counterparts: the top 10% and 1% in the United States and the EU27 (India and China) are wealthier (poorer) than the globally wealthiest 10% and 1% (Fig. 2d).</p><p>Attributed GMT shares by regional emitter groups combine within- and between-region inequality. In the United States (EU27), the top 10% contribute 3.1 (2.8) times more to global warming than the average citizen, but 17 (8) times more than the global average. For the United States, the contribution of the top 10% alone exceedes the entire country\u2019s equal share. This relative inequality increases with increasing wealth: the top 1% in the United States (EU27) contribute 53 (21) times their equal shares, and the top 0.1% contribute 190 (64) times their equal shares. In China, where the overall CIF is near 1, the top 10%, 1% and 0.1% emit 4, 13 and 50 times their equal shares, showing even greater regional influence from societal elites. Similarly, in India, where the national CIF is 0.3 (implying that the countries per capita average emissions are below the global average), the top 10%, 1% and 0.1% emit 1.2, 4 and 10 times the global average.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Major disparities in attributable extremes worldwide</emphasis></p><p>We attribute regional increases in the frequency of extremely hot (dry) months, here defined as 1-in-100-year events in a pre-industrial climate, to the emissions of the global top 10% (Fig. 3a), so throughout this Article extremes or extreme events refer to a month being at least as hot (dry) as the hottest (driest) 1% of months in a pre-industrial climate. We state attribution results as additional event counts over a modelled 100-year period of current climate conditions compared with those in 1990 (Methods). For example, 10 additional attributable events indicate that a pre-industrial 1-in-100-year event happens an additional 10 times within 100 years, meaning that its probability has increased tenfold.Fig. 3</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Frequency change of 1-in-100-year monthly heat and meteorological drought events attributable to global top emitters.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>,<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>, Monthly distributions of heat extremes (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">a</emphasis>) and drought extremes in the Amazon (<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">b</emphasis>) across grid cells attributable to the global top 10%.

We omit showing global drought estimates because of insufficient agreement among grid-cells. Distributions were derived by first computing median attribution results at each grid cell (estimated from 15,000 ensemble members each) and then computing statistics across all grid cells within each region.</p><p>For heat extremes, changes are most (least) pronounced in August (February), where 11.5 [8.5\u201315.4] (3.5 [2.4\u20134.3]) additional events are attributable to the global top 10%. These changes refer to the global median over land that is predominantly located on the Northern Hemisphere. Areas in strongly affected regions, such as the Amazon region, Southeast Asia or central Africa, face months with up to 30-fold increases in probability (see also Supplementary Figs. 5\u20138).</p><p>To account for differences in seasonality between the Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere, we assessed heat extremes during the month with peak temperatures (Supplementary Fig. 4). Emissions from 1990\u20132020 led to a 12.3-fold (9.7\u201317.9) increase in the probability of heat extremes in the peak temperature month. The top 10% (1%) contribute 7.3 (25.7) times the global average to this (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201313e). In addition, the intensities of these extremes increased by 0.83 \u00b0C (0.75\u20130.97 \u00b0C) since 1990. Of this increase, 0.55 \u00b0C (0.50\u20130.67 \u00b0C) (0.17 \u00b0C (0.16\u20130.21 \u00b0C)) is attributable to the top 10% (1%), suggesting that their contribution is 6.7 (21.1) times higher than the global average (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201313).</p><p>Attribution results for meteorological drought extremes strongly depend on region and month, with robust drying found mainly in Central America, the Amazon, the Mediterranean, southern Africa and northern Australia (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figs. 5\u20138). This is expected, given the considerable intermodel disagreement and large uncertainties in regional precipitation projections22, 23\u201324. We found the strongest attributable drying trend in the Amazon region in October. Overall, the region faces a threefold increase (1.7\u20134.2) in extreme probability compared with 1990 (Fig. 3b). The top 10% (1%) contribute 6.1 (16.7) times the global average to this increase. The Amazon region is of global importance, given its uniquely biodiverse system and its major role in the global carbon cycle. Drought events over the past century have already negatively impacted carbon storage in Amazonian rainforests25.</p><p>Overall, the spatial disparity in attributable changes at the grid-cell-level (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. 5\u201313) implies that the regions that disproportionately contribute to the emissions of the top 10% (for example, the EU27 and the United States; Fig. 2) face smaller increases than regions that have contributed very little (for example, western North America and west and central Europe compared with the Amazon region and west southern Africa in Fig. 3c,d).</p><p>The relatively small (attributable) changes over India and parts of China and the simultaneously high intermodel disagreement are worth noting, given that they are inconsistent with the increasing number of climate-related disasters India is already facing26. We assume that this is related to the climate effects of air pollution, which we discuss in greater detail in Supplementary Section 3.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attributing transboundary impacts of regional emissions</emphasis></p><p>The inequality in warming contributions from affluent groups in high-emitting regions exceeds the inequality in their global counterparts (Fig. 2). This disparity also appears at the grid-cell-level: in the global median, emissions from the top 10% (1%) in the United States are associated with 1.3 (1.0\u20131.8) (0.3 (0.3\u20130.5)) additional 1-in-100-year heat events during peak temperature months. This impact represents 23 (60) times the global average contribution and about 3 (2) times the relative contribution of the global top 10% (1%) (Fig. 3). The increase in extreme heat is unevenly distributed across regions. For example, in heat-affected areas such as the Amazon and southeast Africa, emissions from the top 10% in China (the United States) are linked to 2.7 (1.9\u20133.2) (2.5 (1.7\u20132.8)) and 2.7 (1.1\u20133.4) (2.5 (1.0\u20133.2)) additional occurrences of extreme heat during months with peak temperatures (Fig. 4). In these areas, we can also robustly attribute heat extremes to the regional top 1%. In the Amazon, 0.8 (0.7\u20131.0) additional heat extremes are attributable to the top 1% in China. This corresponds to an increase in occurrence frequency of 80%.Fig. 4</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Increase in the frequency of 1-in-100-year peak summer heat extremes in selected regions attributable to the top 10% and 1% of emitters.</emphasis></p><p>Left: median number of additional heat extremes in selected regions that are attributable to the top 10% of emitters in China, the United States, the EU27 and India. Right: same as on the left but for the top 1% of emitters. Wider bars indicate that more events are attributable to a given emitter group. The values in the bars indicate the additional numbers of events over the course of 100 years. Median estimates were derived by first computing median attribution results at each grid cell (estimated from 15,000 ensemble members for each) and then computing statistics across grid cells within each region.</p><p>Attributing changes in extreme events to country-specific wealthy emitter groups becomes increasingly challenging as emitter groups decrease in per capita size, meaning that their cumulative emissions decrease even if their relative emissions contributions increase. Projected temperature distributions are characterized by strong changes in the trend and by consistency across models, allowing robust attribution results even for seemingly small emission amounts, particularly in highly affected regions. The magnitude depends on the definition of extremes, with tail risks seeing the strongest increase (Supplementary Figs. 18\u201321). For droughts, the situation is more complex. The SPI-3 signal is dominated by variability and considerable intermodel disagreement, which prevented us from deriving robust attribution results when emissions are small.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Discussion</emphasis></p><p>This study introduces a framework to link wealth-based emissions to shifts in GMT and to changes in regional monthly heat and meteorological drought extremes. We found that the wealthiest 10% contributed 6.5 times more to global warming than the average, with the top 1% and 0.1% contributing 20 and 76 times more, respectively. For heat, this imbalance is more pronounced at the grid-cell-level: the wealthiest 10% and 1% contributed over 7 and 25 times more than the global average to the increase in frequency of pre-industrial 1-in-100-year heat extremes during months with peak summer temperatures. The warming contributions of the wealthy are associated with considerable transboundary effects\u2014for example, the contributions of the wealthiest 10% within the United States and China led to a two- to threefold increase in heat extremes across vulnerable regions such as the Amazon, Southeast Asia and southeast Africa. The robust attribution of drought signals is more complex. We found the strongest signals in the Amazon region in October, where the emissions of the global top 10% (1%) led to a 2.3-fold (0.8-fold) increase in the frequency of extreme droughts.</p><p>Our analysis also underscores the critical role of CH4 emissions in near-term warming (Supplementary Fig. 2) and calls for new research to disentangle income-based emissions at the level of individual gases. Reducing CH4 emissions in line with Paris Agreement-compatible pathways could yield immediate reductions in global temperatures and climate extremes27.</p><p>We note that our study focuses on monthly extreme heat (that is, extremely hot months), meaning that heatwaves\u2014defined as prolonged periods of abnormally high temperatures lasting from two days to months28\u2014do not directly relate to our metric. However, the probability of extreme daily temperatures is amplified during extremely hot months29, implying that attributable results for short-duration heatwaves might be even more pronounced. Further research is needed to explicitly explore this relationship.</p><p>Wealth-based emissions comprise private consumption and investment in capital formation across production sectors that supply goods and services consumed by society. Recognizing the associated unequal warming contributions can inform policy interventions. For example, deliberation over a coordinated global wealth tax can draw on this work, illustrating the climate co-benefits of attenuating stark wealth-based disparities in climate impact responsibilities30,31. The transboundary impacts we identify highlight how high-emitting individuals contribute to intensified extremes, even in distant regions. Similarly, the warming attributable to the investments of the wealthy underscores the need to realign financial flows to meet global climate goals32. This is particularly relevant for the wealthiest 1% and 0.1%, whose transboundary contributions to worsening local extremes arise primarily through investments, rather than consumption. Efforts to redirect these financial flows should also consider the shared responsibilities of governments to expedite systemic changes in financial and regulatory structures33.</p><p>Our granular impact analysis shows that low-income regions incur the brunt of the harm caused by emissions concentrated among wealthier populations worldwide. From an adaptation and loss-and-damage perspective, this provides a basis for policy discussions around contributions to compensatory and preventative measures. The amounts of adaptation and loss-and-damage finance provided currently are minuscule compared with the assessed needs34. Our work motivates innovative policy instruments targeted at wealthy individuals to bridge these glaring finance gaps35. Such policies can also improve perceptions of climate justice, a vital factor in fostering social acceptance of climate action36,37. Moving towards evidence-based and targeted policies that reflect polluter-pays principles, including on the domestic level in terms of individual contributions, may therefore be an important cornerstone to enhance policy support for climate action in general.</p><p>Considerations of our results in policy debates must, however, recognize the conceptual challenges and value judgements in our approach and implementation. First, our attribution relies on consumption-based emissions accounting, allocating emissions between consumers and shareholders through shared ownership (see ref. 3). Our approach contrasts with production-based approaches used to quantify the responsibilities of producers15. Exploring diverse accounting frameworks is key to developing policy mechanisms that address multiple dimensions, but requires care in determining responsibility. Second, we employ the \u2018but for\u2019 attribution method. This approach directly links emissions to observed climate change while accounting for the timing of emissions and impacts. However, it is sensitive to the sequence of emissions removal and the design of the counterfactual scenarios18. Third, our approach is limited to changes in climate hazards only, and does not account for on-the-ground vulnerabilities and exposure, which are often key to driving the eventual impact of extreme climate events38. Integrating other causal drivers into extreme event attribution analysis increasingly allows us to address those limitations38,39 in a step towards using extreme event attribution to inform the discourse on loss and damage40,41. At the same time, wealth levels are a key determinant for adaptive capacity and vulnerability in the face of climate change, particularly at the levels of households and individuals42,43. We would therefore expect wealth-related drivers of vulnerability and exposure to further exacerbate the inequalities in responsibilities and experience of the impacts of the climate hazards we studied here.</p><p>All quantitative estimates are tied to these three assumptions, and we must recognize the choices and value judgements involved in the analysis when evaluating the ethical and legal implications of our findings.</p><p>Our analysis is further limited by the lack of data on how GHG emission compositions vary with income and wealth. This limits the accuracy of our results, given the role of non-CO2 GHGs in recent warming. In addition, our drought indicator only considers precipitation, which may lead to underestimations in drought risks24. Finally, our analysis is based on modelled data, which may deviate from observations44,45.</p><p>Accordingly, our analysis does not explicitly assign full responsibility for resulting climate impacts, nor does it determine fair emission levels for any income group. Such determinations require an integrated view of fairness, justice and socio-economic factors46,47, with different reference points for societies at varying levels of development.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate how individual emitter groups have contributed to increases in regional extremes globally. In times of growing economic and climate inequalities, advancing frameworks for attributing emissions to individual emitters can inform global climate action and enhance climate justice.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Methods</emphasis></p><p>We quantified intensity and frequency changes in extremely hot (dry) months attributable to specific emitter groups. The methodological framework relies on three steps (Fig. 1): first, we constructed counterfactual emissions pathways (that is, emissions pathways with and without the emissions of selected population groups); second, we translated emissions into gridded temperature, precipitation and potential drought data via a chain of computationally efficient emulators; and third, we built on the framework of extreme event attribution to quantify changes in the grid-cell-level distributions of the climatic variables.</p><p>We relied on the SPI-3 to identify meteorological droughts20. The SPI-3 is computed from precipitation data only, meaning that it does not account for changes in soil- and plant-based water demands. As climate-driven precipitation signals are dominated by natural variability and intermodel disagreement24, climate change-induced trends in our drought indicator are probably a conservative estimate of actual changes20. Therefore, we also computed the SPEI-348. The SPEI-3 takes changes in water demands via potential evapotranspiration (PET) into account. Ideally, PET is estimated from temperatures, radiation, wind speed and humidity via the Penman\u2013Monteith equation20,49. Given that our emulation framework only depicts temperature and precipitation, we relied on the Thornthwaite method to compute PET from temperature data only50. However, PET estimates via the Thornthwaite method are prone to overestimations in terms of magnitude and temporal trends51. This left us with an indicator for meteorological droughts (SPI-3) that probably underestimates drought risks and an additional indicator for potential droughts (SPEI-3 via the Thornthwaite method) that probably provides an overestimation. We used the conservative estimates in the main part of our analysis and show potential drought risks in Supplementary Section 5.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Counterfactual emissions pathways</emphasis></p><p>We assessed what our climate today would look like if the wealthiest 10%, 1% and 0.1% globally, as well as in the United States, EU27, India and China, had not contributed to global emissions between 1990 and 2019. We followed ref. 52 to construct a time series of historic baseline emissions from 1850\u20132019 resolved by gas. Next, we removed emitter-specific contributions from these baseline emissions (Fig. 1). To do so, we relied on a dataset of consumption-based CO2e emissions categorized by country and income decile between 1990 and 20193. The estimates relate to all emissions except those from agriculture, forestry and other land use. Our analysis required us to make assumptions about how to disaggregate the reported basket emissions into individual gases. We focused on decomposing emissions into CO2, nitrogen oxide (N2O) and CH4. These three gases make up 98.7% of the total global GHG emissions (excluding agriculture, forestry and other land use)53. The composition of production-side GHG emissions varies strongly by country, ranging from primarily CO2-based emissions (for example, Singapore) to almost equal shares of CO2 and CH4/N2O (for example, Qatar) and, in low-income countries in particular, primarily CH4/N2O (for example, Chad)54. The carbon inequality dataset from ref. 3 employs input\u2013output tables that redistribute production-side emissions to consumers across countries. About one-half of global CH4 emissions are embodied in global trade, with household consumption dominating the final demand category55. Given these considerations, and a lack of alternative data, we chose to apply the same decomposition assumptions across countries and emitter groups. For our central estimate, we assumed that emissions for each GHG scale proportionally with the globally aggregated emissions. We tested the sensitivity to this assumption by providing two extreme cases in which the wealthy emitters (1) solely emit carbon (CO2case) or (2) solely emit CH4 and N2O (non-CO2case). Note that in the non-CO2 case, the emissions associated with the global top 10% are larger than the total global CH4 and N2O emissions combined, and we removed the excessive emissions from the CO2 time series. We converted between individual GHGs and CO2e using the Global Warming Potential 100.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Emulator-based modelling approach</emphasis></p><p>We transformed counterfactual emissions into grid-cell-level distributions of temperature and precipitation using emulators and subsequently computed drought measures from the emulated data. The emulation consisted of two steps: first, converting emissions into GMT; and second, translating GMT into grid-cell-level monthly mean temperature and precipitation distributions (Fig. 1). The first translation step was carried out with MAGICC10,56. MAGICC is a simple, computationally efficient climate model for global climate indicators. Our temperature outcomes were calculated with MAGICC v7.5 in a probabilistic setting that reflects the assessed uncertainty ranges from the IPCC\u2019s Sixth Assessment Report24. We generated 600 GMT trajectories for each scenario. The second translation step was carried out using MESMER-M-TP11. MESMER-M-TP combines parametric approaches and stochastic sampling to approximate the behaviour of individual climate models. For any climate model, the emulator can be calibrated with a small set of actual climate model data and then used to generate gridded temperature and precipitation data that statistically resemble the climate model data. Here we calibrated MESMER-M-TP with 24 different models from the Phase Six of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (Supplementary Table 4). Subsequently, we converted each GMT trajectory into a single gridded time series of temperature and precipitation. We computed the SPI-3/SPEI-3 indicator following ref. 48 and used the gamma distribution for normalization. This provided us with a dataset containing 4 variables \u00d7 600 realizations \u00d7 2,652 grid points \u00d7 170 years \u00d7 12 months for each scenario.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Attribution framework</emphasis></p><p>Traditional attribution studies typically aim to understand how climate change altered the statistics of a specified observed extreme. Our study deviates from this approach. We were interested in understanding the extent to which changes in a broad class of historic extremes can be related to emissions from specific emitter groups. We therefore used the framework for event attribution as a guideline14 but modified it according to our research questions. Most importantly, our analysis fully relied on modelled data, meaning that we were not taking observational data into account. Hence, the event attribution framework was reduced to three essential steps: first, we defined extreme events; second, we performed an analysis using emulated (climate model) data; and third, we synthesized the hazards into an attribution statement.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Extreme event definition</emphasis></p><p>We defined extreme events relative to the reference period 1850\u20131900 and focused on 1-in-100-year (main text) and 1-in-50/1-in-10,000-year (Supplementary Information) events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate model analysis and hazard synthesis</emphasis></p><p>In a first step, we tested whether changes in the grid-cell-level distribution of a climatic variable under a given counterfactual scenario were significantly different from its present-day distribution. To this end, we computed the differences between the present-day and counterfactual present-day distributions and employed a Student\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">t</emphasis>-test57 to verify that the distribution was significantly different from zero. If this was the case, we proceeded with the actual attribution. We used the modelled distribution of climatic variables over the reference period to derive grid-cell-specific intensity thresholds for our defined events. To assess frequency changes, we counted how many times the reference intensity threshold was exceeded in a present-day (2020) climate and in a counterfactual 2020 climate, and attributed the difference to a specific emitter group. Similarly, we quantify intensity changes by assessing how hot (dry) a specific extreme would be in a present-day climate as compared to a counterfactual climate, and attribute the difference in values.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Reporting summary</emphasis></p><p>Further information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Online content</emphasis></p><p>Any methods, additional references, Nature Portfolio reporting summaries, source data, extended data, supplementary information, acknowledgements, peer review information; details of author contributions and competing interests; and statements of data and code availability are available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02325-x\">https://doi.org/10.1038/s41558-025-02325-x</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Acknowledgements</emphasis></p><p>S.S. acknowledges support from the German Federal Environmental Foundation (DBU).

The EPA has requested that a bank freeze accounts holding GGRF money and, according to sources who spoke to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisal, the agency has triggered an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/fbi?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">FBI</url> investigation of the GGRF.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A group of Democratic lawmakers accused the EPA of making \"inaccurate and misleading claims,\" and one legal scholar called the EPA's freeze on GGRF funds \"strikingly illegal.\" The agency's request for an order to freeze bank accounts even precipitated the resignation of a senior prosecutor at the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/department-justice?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Department of Justice</url> who said there was not sufficient evidence to support the EPA's action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As of Thursday, bank accounts for the recipient groups remained frozen with no explanation from the bank or EPA, representatives of the groups said, and the EPA had produced no evidence of any wrongdoing by the organizations.

A former EPA adviser said disadvantaged communities already suffering high energy bills and heavy pollution burdens stand to lose the most.</p><p>\"These are programs designed to help low-income households lower their energy costs and reduce their exposure to pollution,\" former EPA adviser Zealan Hoover told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis>. \"It would just be a huge, missed opportunity to pull back now.\"</p><h>'Inaccurate and Misleading' Claims</h><p>Congress approved $27 billion for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, the largest part of the 2022 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/inflation-reduction-act-2-most-important-law-most-havent-heard-1939531?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Inflation Reduction Act</url>, President <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/joe-biden?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Joe Biden</url>'s main initiative on climate change.

He accused the previous administration of \"rushing to get billions of your tax dollars out the door before Inauguration Day.\"</p><p>Several members of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/congress?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Congress</url> and people who were involved with the funding process said Zeldin has offered no evidence of any wrongdoing and that he is mischaracterizing the nature and timeline of the program's application and vetting process.</p><p>In a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=51219611-4681-4DE8-AFAC-C5C6CEBADA22\">letter sent to the EPA Monday</url>, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/democrats?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Democrats</url> on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newsweek.com/topic/senate?utm_source=Synacor&amp;utm_medium=Attnet&amp;utm_campaign=Partnerships\">Senate</url>Committee on Environment and Public Works said Zeldin's \"inaccurate and misleading\" claims were a pretext to do away with a program Congress had already authorized and funded.</p><p>\"You and your team discovered nothing\u2014and certainly not taxpayer money being wasted,\" the senators wrote.</p><p>The lawmakers said the decision to have Citi manage GGRF grants was made by April 2024, \"seven months before the 2024 election and more than nine months before Inauguration Day.\"</p><p>Former EPA adviser Hoover said the eight recipient groups, which include nonprofit coalitions and community development financial institutions, underwent a thorough vetting and application process in the grant competition.</p><p>\"We really thoughtfully worked through all of the different considerations and controls for the program to make it as robust and effective as possible,\" he told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis>.</p><p>Hoover also countered Zeldin's characterization of the use of a bank as a financial agent. In his video, Zeldin said money was \"parked\" at an outside financial institution.</p><p>\"This scheme was the first of its kind in EPA history, and it was purposefully designed to obligate all of the money in a rush job with reduced oversight,\" Zeldin said.</p><p>Hoover said the Treasury Department frequently uses financial agent agreements. In a 2017 report, the Government Accountability Office said the Treasury has \"a long history of using financial agents to support its core functions\" and recommended ways to strengthen the accounting programs the department uses.</p><p>\"This is a very well-established program and has been commonly used under administrations from both parties, including the first Trump administration,\" Hoover said.</p><p>The EPA did not respond to a request for comment for this story.</p><h>'Strikingly Illegal' Move by the EPA</h><p>David Super is a professor at Georgetown Law, where his research focuses on administrative law, constitutional law and legislation. Super told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> that the EPA's attempt to claw back the GGRF money is \"strikingly illegal.\"</p><p>Super said that freezing the accounts put the federal government in breach of contract. If there was evidence of misconduct by the recipient groups, he said, the EPA should have given the grantees notice and an opportunity to respond before terminating the contract.</p><p>\"They're simply using the word 'fraud' as a political epithet but have no evidence of any wrongdoing,\" Super said. \"There's a danger that prosecutors will be pressured into putting together false investigations and false charges to back up the politics.\"</p><p>On February 18, a veteran prosecutor at the Department of Justice abruptly resigned after a dispute over whether there was sufficient evidence to order the freeze on GGRF accounts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Washington Post</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/18/read-resignation-letter-denise-cheung/\">published the resignation letter</url> from Denise Cheung, who had been head of the criminal division. In the letter, Cheung described her \"concern about the current lack of evidence of any apparent crime\" after receiving a request from the EPA to send a letter to the bank.</p><p>\"I still do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to issue the letter you described,\" Cheung wrote, \"including sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize the particular accounts identified.\"</p><p>A source familiar with the situation told <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Newsweek</emphasis> on condition of anonymity that FBI agents were at EPA offices within the past week conducting interviews and collecting material related to the GGRF. A spokesperson for the Department of Justice declined to comment for this story.</p><p>Super predicted that if the GGRF accounts remain frozen, the grantees will likely sue the federal government, \"and they'll win.\" He said he was struck by the irony that the EPA's purported motivation for cutting the funding is to limit waste, fraud and abuse.</p><p>\"But the charges of fraud without any evidence are highly abusive,\" Super said. \"Withholding money that will eventually have to be paid after expensive litigation is wasteful, and the assertion that they have the power to do this is a fraud.\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2596851/clean-energy-funds-frozen.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Clean Energy Funds Frozen</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo-illustration by Newsweek/Getty</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>Clean Energy Funds Frozen</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWKCOM-2037522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWKCOM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F79-KS33-RXGC-621F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472435</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1289\"/><timeReceived>3:32 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright \u00a9 2025 Newsweek Inc.

The fee hikes, which average 20 percent, would generate about $25 million a year.</p><p>Those follow the council's approval on Jan. 27 of doubling parking meter fees across the city from $1.25 an hour to $2.50 an hour, which is projected to generate $10 million in additional annual revenue.</p><p>The flurry of action was prompted by voters narrowly rejecting Measure E, a proposed one-cent sales tax hike that would have increased city revenue by about $400 million a year and was billed as a solution to the city's budget problems.</p><p>Shortly after the defeat of Measure E became official in early December, Gloria announced a hiring freeze and his intention to quickly propose revenue initiatives and emergency spending cuts.</p><p>Council members have embraced the revenue initiatives but complained this week that the spending cut proposals have not come quickly enough.</p><p>\"The longer we wait to take action, the worse the situation is going to be,\" said Councilmember Sean Elo-Rivera, who criticized the mayor for doing essentially nothing on cuts since his early December news conference.</p><p>Councilmember Henry Foster expressed similar sentiments.</p><p>\"We don't see the sense of urgency,\" Foster said of the mayor. \"I hope the administration sees that there is a need for change.\"</p><p>The mayor has focused on revenue initiatives before proposing cuts partly because that was the explicit direction he received from council members, said Matt Yagyagan, Gloria's policy director.</p><p>A comprehensive list of proposed cuts will be presented to the council by the end of February, Yagyagan told council members Wednesday during a meeting of the council's budget committee.</p><p>The reductions are likely to focus on reduced overtime, eliminating outside contracts and finding ways to save on existing programs, he said.</p><p>Cuts that would require layoffs and meeting with labor unions will be avoided because the need to conduct those meetings would delay the impact of such cuts, Yagyagan said.</p><p>But cuts of that nature are expected to be proposed on April 15 when the mayor announces his plan to balance the budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.</p><p>Councilmember Kent Lee said he was frustrated that the council's focus on new revenue over cuts this winter apparently persuaded the mayor's staff to delay proposing cuts.</p><p>\"It never meant we shouldn't be exploring both at the same time,\" Lee said. \"We all know that revenue alone is not going to solve our crisis at the moment.\"</p><p>City labor leader Michael Zucchet also criticized the mayor for not fully following through on a hiring freeze he announced in early December.</p><p>Zucchet said the city has continued to hire since then at essentially the normal pace.</p><p>\"It's been business as usual for the last two-and-a-half months,\" said Zucchet, expressing frustration that continued hiring could mean more job losses in the new budget. \"There's no right-sizing going on.\"</p><p>City finance officials said there have been some strategic hires since the freeze was announced, including parking enforcement officers who generate revenue and workers to help the city transition to charging single-family homes for trash pickup.</p><p>Council members have stressed they don't want what they call \"across the board\" cuts because some neighborhoods can withstand reduced hours at libraries and recreation centers easier than others because they rely on those amenities less.</p><p>The city's independent budget analyst, in a summary of new budget priority memos submitted by council members last month, said \"a majority of memos expressed concerns about 'across-the-board' service reductions, which could disproportionately impact vulnerable and underserved communities.\"</p><p>Elo-Rivera was more aggressive in his memo.</p><p>\"Across the board cuts are inequitable and are not representative of who is willing to invest in the city,\" said Elo-Rivera, referring to Measure E getting stronger support in most low-income neighborhoods than most wealthy neighborhoods. \"These cuts are particularly devastating in the Parks and Recreation and Library Departments. Closed libraries and a lack of services can impact opportunity and life outcomes for generations.\"</p><p>Yagyagan said the mayor's staff agrees.</p><p>He said they are focused on what he called surgical cuts, \"with a specific lens that keeps services in communities that need them.\"</p><p>\u00a92025 The San Diego Union-Tribune.

We already have milestones in place that have us transitioning to 100% clean energy by 2035, and EcoFleet ATL will not only bring us closer to our climate goals but also support expanding EV capabilities-especially in our EV fleet,\" said Mayor Andre Dickens. \"EcoFleet ATL will also advance equity and environmental justice in disadvantaged communities by prioritizing the installation of EV chargers in historically underserved areas, promoting unique economic and climate equity opportunities while also creating a city built for the future.\"</p><p>The City of Atlanta's EcoFleet ATL program will replace 11 total vehicles with electric alternatives. The City will replace one Class 7 diesel street sweeper with a Class 7 electric sweeper, three Class 6 diesel utility trucks with Class 7 electric alternatives, two Class 7 diesel utility trucks with Class 7 electric alternatives, one Class 6 diesel refuse hauler truck with a Class 7 electric alternative, and four Class 6 diesel shuttle/transit buses with Class 7 electric alternatives.</p><p>EcoFleet ATL will also install 11 150kW DC fast Level 3 chargers at four different City-owned sites: three at Atlanta Fleet Service Headquarters, one at the Department of Watershed Management Hemphill Water Treatment lot, two at DWM's Bureau of Drinking Water Building, and five at the Department of Aviation.</p><p>In addition to adding replacement EVs and installing the City's first DCFC systems, EcoFleet ATL will support transformative training programs for City fleet mechanics and operators. These funds will support training for staff to maintain, service and operate both the EVs and the associated EV supply equipment (EVSE) to maximize longevity of the EcoFleet ATL assets.</p><p>You can find a video on the City's EcoFleet program at this link.</p><p>###</p><p>For more information about the City of Atlanta, please visit<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.atlantaga.govor\">www.atlantaga.govor</url> watch City Channel 26.

Invited by the President of the Oxford Union, Israr Kakar, Minister Iqbal passionately articulated how liberal democracy has failed the developing world, exposing the double standards and systemic oppression that continue to hinder economic justice, political sovereignty, and climate equity for nations of the Global South. At the heart of Minister Iqbal's argument was the assertion that liberal democracy, though championed as the ultimate model of governance, has in reality deepened inequality, fostered political instability, and reinforced economic subjugation rather than delivering on its promises of justice, prosperity, and equality. </p><p>He challenged the hypocrisy of Western democracies that preach democratic values while enabling authoritarian regimes, political suppression, and economic exploitation in the developing world. Minister Iqbal underscored the plight of occupied Kashmir and Palestine, calling for the world to recognize their inalienable right to freedom and self-determination. He criticized how liberal democracy is selectively applied, where human rights violations and war crimes in Palestine, Kashmir, and Gaza are met with silence from the very nations that claim to be champions of democracy and human rights. He questioned how powerful nations defend their allies' oppression while condemning resistance from the oppresseda contradiction that exposes the inherent bias within the system. He further argued that post-World War II global institutions were never designed to empower the Global South but rather to control it through economic dependency and geopolitical manipulation. Citing the collapse of the USSR as an event that was wrongly celebrated as a victory for liberal democracy, he pointed out that three decades later, the Global South remains entrapped in poverty, political suppression, and economic servitudea direct result of rigged financial structures, trade barriers, and debt traps imposed by the Global North. Citing Jason Heichel's book The Divide, Minister Iqbal revealed a stark reality: for every $1 in aid received by the Global South, it loses $14 through exploitative financial mechanisms such as debt repayment and profit repatriation. He called out the injustice of intellectual property laws, which enabled the West to monopolize COVID-19 vaccines, leading to 1.3 million preventable deaths in the Global South, as critical medical patents were blocked in the name of corporate profits. Highlighting the climate injustice perpetuated by liberal democracies, Minister Iqbal reminded the audience that while the Global North contributes over 80% of historical carbon emissions, it is the Global South that pays the highest price. He pointed to Pakistan's 2022 climate catastrophe, where devastating floods caused $30 billion in damages, yet the so-called champions of democracy offered loans instead of grants, effectively forcing Pakistan to finance its own destruction. He expressed dismay at the harsh reality where the promises of sustainable development have led to floods, droughts, and broken commitments, leaving developing nations to struggle while powerful states continue their exploitation unchecked. Minister Iqbal's compelling arguments resonated deeply within the intellectually rigorous environment of Oxford Union, where global leaders, scholars, and students have long engaged in some of the world's most significant debates. Despite the historically challenging nature of Oxford's debating forums, where even seasoned political figures struggle to gain consensus, Prof. Ahsan Iqbal convincingly dismantled the illusions of liberal democracy and won the debate on intellectual merit and evidence-based argumentation. The debate concluded with Prof. Iqbal's stance gaining 180 votes in favor, while the opposition secured 145 votes, marking a remarkable victory for Pakistan and the Global South on an international platform. Prof. Ahsan Iqbal's success at Oxford Union has reinforced his global reputation as a champion of underdeveloped nations, advocating for an equitable world order where the sovereignty, dignity, and development of the Global South are prioritized. His impassioned call for reform, justice, and self-reliance has resonated beyond this debate, sparking conversations in policy circles, universities, and international forums about the urgent need to redesign global governance structures for a more just, inclusive, and balanced world. As a statesman who has consistently defended democracy, justice, and equality for Pakistan and the Global South, Minister Ahsan Iqbal has once again proved that his voice is one of the few that can challenge global injustices at the highest intellectual and diplomatic levels. His triumph at Oxford Union is not just a win in a debateit is a victory for the Global South and all those striving for a fairer world. *****</p><p>PREVIOUS NEXT</p><p>ABOUT US</p><p>Press Information Department is the principal department of Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, headed by Principal Information officer (PIO).

Their \"short-term objective\" was to block the money while those probes play out, a senior Justice Department attorney wrote in one email.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The government's approach \"is believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities,\" veteran EPA career attorney Jim Payne wrote to 14 career staff and political appointees at the environmental agency, the Treasury Department and the Justice Department late on the night of March 9.</p><p>The emails, never before made public, offer a rare glimpse at the administration's internal qualms as EPA, DOJ and Treasury wage one of the most aggressive battles in President Donald Trump's campaign to throttle his predecessor's clean energy and climate agenda.</p><p>The fight over the $20 billion stands out for one reason: The administration is seeking to pull back money that is already out the door - cash that President Joe Biden's agencies had awarded, and placed in accounts for the recipients at Citibank, before Trump took office. EPA lawyers have asserted in court that they can terminate the grants without needing to offer any specific evidence of wrongdoing by the eight nonprofits.</p><p>The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals is expected to rule as soon as this week on whether the Trump administration can continue freezing the money, which had been meant to pay for solar power, energy efficiency upgrades and other clean-energy projects in lower-income communities. Washington-based U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan has chastised EPA's handling of the case, saying the agency \"never proffered ... adequate evidence\" to support its claims of wrongdoing.</p><p>Even before then, the career EPA lawyer's email warning about \"significant\" risk already offered agency leaders a red flag about their strategy, according to one legal expert who reviewed the emails for POLITICO.</p><p>\"To me, this is a signal that they think this is probably a loser,\" said Gary Jonesi, who retired in January after a 39-year career in enforcement at EPA under administrations of both parties.</p><p>An EPA attorney would not use that adjective \"very lightly,\" said Avi Garbow, who served as the agency's general counsel in the Obama administration.</p><p>\"It is not unusual at all that for policy directives ... there is some assessment by the Office of General Counsel that it presents some legal vulnerability,\" he said. \"It is less normal, I think, to phrase it as having 'significant' legal vulnerabilities.\"</p><p>Other legal experts who reviewed the emails for POLITICO called it striking that they show the administration trying to block the money before finding certain evidence of wrongdoing to back it up. In one of the March 9 emails, Matthew Galeotti, a career official who at the time was serving in the office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, shared DOJ's analysis of the situation after interagency discussions throughout the day.</p><p>\"The short-term objective is to prevent disbursement of the grant funds, so that ongoing criminal and civil investigations into the program can proceed without risk that the funds will permanently disappear,\" Galeotti wrote, outlining DOJ's position.</p><p>That's an unusual approach, veteran EPA official Stan Meiburg told POLITICO.</p><p>\"What I take from [DOJ's] line is, they're still trying to find ways to claw back the money, and they want to give themselves as much time as possible to do fishing expeditions to find any evidence in criminal or civil investigations that might give them a plausible reason for arguing that there was fraud going on, and therefore they should do this,\" said Meiburg, who retired after 37 years at EPA only to return a few months later as acting deputy EPA administrator in the Obama administration. \"And right now they haven't got one.\"</p><p>In a statement Wednesday, EPA reiterated several allegations it has made publicly about the grants in recent months, including \"serious potential conflicts of interest,\" concerns about the ability of the grant recipients to handle the funds, statements by internal watchdogs of concern about oversight of the spending, and changes made by the Biden administration to the grant agreements that Zeldin says limited EPA's oversight, a claim with which the grant recipients disagree.</p><p>\"It's telling that you cling to the narrative of 'no evidence' even as EPA has directly outlined evidence regarding serious concerns about self-dealing and conflicts of interest, unqualified grantees, and reduced agency oversight tied to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund,\" the agency said. \"These aren't vague suspicions - they're the foundation for ongoing DOJ and FBI and IG investigations, and the reason the fatally designed program was terminated.\"</p><p>EPA added that the emails obtained by POLITICO show government attorneys seeking to stop the grant recipients from \"increasing their efforts to access and offload these tax dollars to third parties\" after the Trump administration increased its scrutiny of the program. Such withdrawals \"would be certain to cause irreparable harm to the U.S. taxpayer amounting into the billions of dollars,\" the agency added.</p><p>Payne, who is serving as EPA's acting general counsel, also issued a statement characterizing the email exchange as a typical discussion.</p><p>\"On their face, the alleged emails you reference appear to involve privileged discussions and ordinary deliberations among government attorneys,\" Payne said. \"Such an exchange of views is an important part of the government's work, and an unauthorized disclosure would be highly inappropriate and have potential legal consequences.\"</p><p>The Justice Department declined to comment for this story, while the White House referred questions to EPA and DOJ. The FBI referred questions to DOJ. EPA's inspector general declined to comment on the existence or status of any ongoing investigations.</p><p>The emails circulated weeks after Zeldin launched his first public attacks on the $20 billion grant program Feb. 12, contending that the Biden-era EPA had \"parked\" the money at Citibank as part of a \"scheme\" to evade federal oversight. \"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boatloads of cash to far-left activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" Zeldin said, vowing to bring the money back under direct EPA control.</p><p>EPA and Treasury soon pressed Citibank to freeze the grant money, while DOJ and the FBI pushed forward with a criminal probe and EPA's inspector general launched a review of the program at the request of agency leadership. The road to get there was choppy, however: In February, a top federal career prosecutor in Washington resigned after arguing that not enough evidence existed to justify opening a criminal investigation or freezing the Citibank accounts.</p><p>Under the terms of the grants, EPA can terminate the awards under three circumstances: if a recipient isn't spending the money how it's supposed to; if it misleads EPA about its eligibility to receive the grant; or if EPA has \"credible evidence\" of criminal activity.</p><p>One of the grant recipients, Climate United Fund, sued EPA over the freeze on March 8, and other spurned groups were drafting their own lawsuits. By the evening of March 9, DOJ's Galeotti warned that the clock was ticking: At midnight, less than four hours later, Citibank would have \"no basis\" to continue blocking the accounts under the Trump administration's previous requests.</p><p>DOJ's recommendation was that both Treasury and EPA should each write to Citibank that evening to direct that the accounts remain frozen - a step that DOJ's analysis acknowledged could lead to more litigation.</p><p>\"At some point, we will need to raise defenses, but the criminal and civil investigations may fill that out over the intervening period,\" Galeotti wrote.</p><p>Participants in the email exchange included a mixture of career employees and political employees, with other staffers copied as recipients. One person who chimed in was Emil Bove, a former Trump defense attorney who is now the principal associate deputy attorney general, and who had pressed for a criminal investigation of the climate grants. Copied on the emails was Blanche, another Trump defense attorney who had been sworn in as deputy attorney general just days before.</p><p>The emails show that the officials were concerned with stopping the climate grants, not with stopping any specific, evidence-based incidents of waste, fraud or abuse, government watchdog group executive Jillian Blanchard argued after reviewing the messages for POLITICO.</p><p>\"It just seems to me that this is end-justifies-the-means logic, that there's no evidence that's being cited,\" said Blanchard, vice president of climate change and environmental justice at Lawyers for Good Government, a group that has criticized the grant terminations. \"It's just, 'how do we protect ourselves in this moment, while we terminate grants without evidence?'\"</p><p>Once the Trump administration officials decided on a specific course of action to order Citibank to keep the funds frozen, Payne - who has worked at EPA since 2016 and before that worked in environmental enforcement at DOJ - raised some concerns.</p><p>He warned that the grant recipients could file for monetary damages in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, a tribunal that has exclusive jurisdiction over monetary claims against the federal government. Payne asked DOJ to assess whether the government could prevail in that legal fight, \"to help ensure EPA senior leadership is well informed since there are potential multi-billion dollar damage claims.\"</p><p>Yaakov Roth, the acting assistant attorney general for civil matters, replied that DOJ couldn't make that assessment until it knew the outcome of the investigations.</p><p>\"It depends on what the investigations uncover in terms of criminal conduct or other improprieties. It also depends on whether EPA ultimately terminates the grants,\" he wrote to Payne. \"All of that will bear on our defenses and rights.\"</p><p>If the courts found that EPA's withholding of the funds was unlawful, the agency could be on the hook for that money, \"and perhaps interest or related relief,\" Roth added.</p><p>In an interview, Blanchard said it was \"wild\" to see the Trump administration acknowledge - and apparently dismiss - the risk of being liable for damages when Zeldin routinely says he terminated the grants to protect taxpayer money.</p><p>\"It isn't about the money,\" said Blanchard. \"They're doing it, I believe, to be able to say they stopped this program, they stopped what the Biden administration wanted to do. That's the main goal, to be able to say they stopped this.\"</p><p>Garbow, the former EPA general counsel, said he would have been wary of such extreme risk.</p><p>\"I cannot envision a scenario, had I been the general counsel, where my office had determined there were significant, multibillion-dollar damage claims, and I had not received substantial reassurance from the Justice Department about the merits of our potential defenses - that certainly, in my experience, would have warranted a conversation directly with the administrator to ensure that he or she was comfortable proceeding this way,\" Garbow said.</p><p>It is unclear to what extent Zeldin was consulted on the matter on the evening the emails were sent. Just 44 minutes passed between Payne sharing the draft order to freeze the funds and Zeldin's chief of staff, Eric Amidon, sending it to Citibank.</p><p>EPA's strategy to kill the climate grants has already fallen flat before one judge.</p><p>Last week, Chutkan - a Barack Obama nominee who previously drew Trump's wrath while overseeing his now-dismissed election conspiracy criminal case - found that EPA's March 11 termination violated the law, the Constitution and the agency's own procedures.</p><p>EPA's primary defense is that the grant terminations are effectively a breach of contract, which under the law would have to be heard in the Court of Federal Claims, not in Chutkan's courtroom. It would likely take a year or more for the climate groups to push their case in that venue, and in the meantime they would go without any of that funding, said Blanchard. The recipients have already warned that without access to the money, some will soon face layoffs and others could shut down.</p><p>Chutkan rejected EPA's interpretation of the law, writing that this is no simple contract dispute and \"the government is not just another contracting party.\"</p><p>And on the merits, the Justice Department has conceded that the government did not cut off the grants because any of the recipients' actions. \"EPA did not terminate for Plaintiffs' noncompliance,\" the agency wrote in a brief in late March.</p><p>Chutkan's order to reopen the taps has been temporarily stayed while EPA appeals to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. At least $625 million in requests from the recipients is already pending, mostly earmarked to pay for clean energy projects, housing and community lending.</p><p>Even if EPA prevails in moving the dispute to the Court of Federal Claims, it could still find itself potentially liable for paying the $20 billion, Payne wrote in one email on March 9.</p><p>In the email, the EPA attorney shared a draft copy of a directive that Amidon would send directing Citibank to maintain the funding freeze. But that approach, Payne reiterated, \"is believed to have significant legal vulnerabilities including for potential future substantial monetary damage claims before the Court of Federal Claims.\"</p><p>Adding the word \"significant\" is a subtle but clear message to other lawyers, Jonesi - the former EPA enforcement official - told POLITICO after reading the emails.</p><p>\"When you've got Trump's criminal defense lawyers, now senior people at the Justice Department, on this email chain, you choose your words carefully, and you don't want to lose credibility by overstating the case,\" he said. Jonesi is now the executive director of CREEDemocracy, a group he founded this year to promote clean energy development and scrutinize Trump's policies.</p><p>At 12:28 a.m. on Monday, March 10, Amidon sent the order to Citibank to continue freezing the funds, according to documents shared in court. He made only minor tweaks to Payne's draft language.</p><p>Bove, the principal associate deputy attorney general, expressed happiness with the outcome.</p><p>\"Grateful to all involved for the coordination on this,\" he wrote at 1:41 a.m. \"Thanks very much.\"</p><p>The agency had contemplated going further by terminating the grants, not just freezing them, but that step \"is not being effectuated at this time,\" Roth wrote the night of March 9. Amidon's order to Citibank said the agency was waiting to alter the program until it received responses to oversight questions it had sent to the recipients, which were due March 28.</p><p>Instead, EPA told Climate United and the other recipients on March 11 that Zeldin has terminated their grants. The email exchange does not reveal any reasons for the abrupt change of strategy.</p><p>Myron Ebell, a longtime critic of climate spending and regulation who led Trump's 2017 EPA transition team, said he supports the administration being \"ambitious\" in canceling funding such as the $20 billion Biden program, and said he doesn't fear a court overturning the grant terminations.</p><p>\"Then we'll be where we are now. I don't see that that's a loss,\" he said. \"We'll go back to the status quo, and if the administration wants to end these various green grant programs, they will have to go to Congress and say 'Well, we tried to do it.'\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">POLTCO-00265680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">POLTCO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGF-XS93-RYXK-41ST-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">334576</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2705\"/><timeReceived>8:40 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Politico.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 2, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Courts of Claims</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjUxRDdCQUI0MENENDUxMEIyRkFEQTBCNTg2MEJERjI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NURENzJGNTEyQzM0NEREQUI2RkVCRTM4RTc1RTZBREU</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

LOUIS PARK, Minn., May 22 -- The city of St. Louis Park issued the following news release:</p><p>The City of St. Louis Park sustainability division has launched a new tool where residents can explore demographic, climate and energy data within the city.</p><p>The goal of the climate equity map is to help City of St. Louis Park staff consider the impacts of environmental justice in their work. Staff will use the map to customize city programs to benefit those particularly vulnerable to climate change and to identify areas where climate-related emergencies may have a more severe impact.</p><p>Climate change affects some in the community more than others, especially young children, seniors and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) residents, as well as people living in homes that lack efficient heating or cooling, to name a few factors.</p><p>Because of historic and systemic racism, including redlining, BIPOC community members are more likely to live in areas that are more susceptible to the impacts of climate change. Historically redlined areas are on average 5 degrees Fahrenheit warmer. Homes in these areas also are usually older and less energy efficient. The median energy burden, or the percent of income spent on energy bills, of Black households is much higher nationally than white households.</p><p>The city's Climate Action Plan, a guide to achieving carbon neutrality in the city by 2040, intersects with many environmental justice topics and aims to reduce these inequalities to create a more sustainable, resilient and just community for all.

Speaking at a panel titled \"The New Economic Revolution: An African Perspective\" on February 11, 2025, he cited striking data that turns conventional wisdom on its head.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We actually asked Moody's Analytics to look at the risk profile of Africa, of investments and infrastructure over the last 14 years. Guess what they found? The rate of loss in Africa is 1.7%. That in Latin America was about 13%. The one in Eastern Europe was more about 10%.\"</p><p>These statistics paint a picture starkly different from the risk premiums typically demanded for African investments. The continent's actual performance suggests it might be one of the world's safest investment destinations--a reality masked by persistent negative stereotypes.</p><p>Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation and chairman of multiple African businesses, spoke from direct experience: \"There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa.\" Elumelu, whose portfolio spans power, oil and gas, financial services, and healthcare across four continents, including investments in the Gulf states.</p><p>He emphasized that success lies in seeing opportunity where others see risk.</p><p>\"There's nowhere else we get the kind of returns on investments as what we make in Africa,\" said Tony Elumelu, founder of the Tony Elumelu Foundation.</p><p>\"You may decide to see risks or challenges, or you may see opportunities,\" Elumelu explained. \"But ability to identify opportunities and structure your approach in a way that addresses and mitigates those risks confers extra competitive advantage on you and your business.\"</p><p>To bridge this perception gap, the African Development Bank Group announced plans to establish a new Africa Investment Guarantee Agency. The institution will offer comprehensive coverage against climate, equity, political, and currency risks--addressing key concerns that have historically deterred international investors.</p><p>The timing could not be more critical. Africa stands at the nexus of several global transitions: demographic, energy, and agricultural. With 75% of its population under 35 years old, including 600 million people between ages 15 and 35, the continent is positioned to become the world's workforce. Its vast mineral resources--including critical materials for electric vehicles and renewable energy--make it indispensable to the global energy transition.</p><p>\"Whether it is lithium-ion batteries, whether it is electric vehicles, whether it's platinum, whether it's copper, whether it's graphite, whether it's any of this lithium-ion, all is in Africa,\" Adesina noted. \"So what Africa actually does with its resources will shape the future of the world.\"</p><p>The narrative of a \"resource curse\" that has long haunted Africa's development story also came under scrutiny at the summit. Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh rejected this framing entirely, introducing instead the concept of \"conscientious concessions\".</p><p>These, he explained, are deals that benefit investors, governments, and local communities alike.</p><p>\"It's so easy to speak about concessions from any one of these countries or from private sector that is 100 years, lots of waivers, employees coming from abroad, everything gets shipped out. That's not consensual. You're talking about bad deals, by the way, which turned things into a curse, and I think that's what people talk about,\" Sengeh explained. He pointed to recent developments in Sierra Leone's rutile mining sector, where domestic ownership is changing the dynamics of resource management.</p><p>The narrative of a \"resource curse\" that has long haunted Africa's development is wrong, said Sierra Leone's Chief Minister David Moinina Sengeh.</p><p>\"If we think about not just pennies, but the people and the planet, then the deals and the agreements we sign, with our conscience, will work for the people, will bring economic value for everyone, for the investor, for the government, and the people who are there,\" Sengeh added.</p><p>The African Development Bank Group is actively working to facilitate such balanced agreements. \"We have the African Legal Support Facility at the African Development Bank to help Sierra Leone and DRC, several other countries, to be able to structure deals that are in their own interest,\" Adesina explained.</p><p>The Africa Investment Forum Market Days held in Morocco in December 2024 demonstrated strong investor appetite when barriers are removed, securing $29.4 billion in investment interest within just 72 hours! This contributed to over $225 billion in investment interests mobilized since the Africa Investment Forum's inception in 2018. This success is part of a broader push to industrialize the continent and move beyond raw commodity exports.</p><p>\"The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,\" Adesina emphasized. \"But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.\"</p><p>Major initiatives are already underway to build this infrastructure. The African Development Bank Group is investing $3 billion in special agro-industrial processing zones, while \"Mission 300,\" a partnership with the World Bank, aims to provide electricity access to 300 million Africans. These projects represent significant opportunities for private investment in power generation, transmission, and distribution.</p><p>\"The export of raw commodities of any kind is a door to poverty,\" said Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, President and Chair of the Boards, African Development Bank Group. \"But the export of industrial value-added manufacturing to allow Africa's share of global manufacturing to rise and to move up in global value chains, that is the highway to prosperity.\"</p><p>The African Continental Free Trade Area, with its $3.4 trillion market potential and population of nearly 1.5 billion people, adds another layer of opportunity. \"Africa is not going to beg its way into development,\" Adesina insisted. \"Africa is going to trade and invest its way into development.\"</p><p>Looking ahead, African leaders are clear about who will drive this transformation. As Sierra Leone's Chief Minister Sengeh put it: \"Who's going to dominate in Africa? Africans are going to dominate in Africa.\" He called for \"progressive, social, democratic radicalism\" to ensure development benefits all Africans.</p><p>For global investors, the message from Dubai was clear: the risk is not in investing in Africa, but in missing out on its opportunities. As Elumelu concluded: \"The time is now.\"</p><p>* Watch the panel discussion (link is external)</p><p>***</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/press-releases/africas-risk-premium-costly-myth-holding-back-continent-80966\">https://www.afdb.org/en/news-and-events/press-releases/africas-risk-premium-costly-myth-holding-back-continent-80966</url></p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-9056912 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR9056912</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F4M-FSN3-RS5Y-H3CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><timeReceived>6:47 PM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 14, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Eligible applicants can receive up to 85% of the incremental cost of purchasing qualified electric school buses. The program provides up to $1.5 million per grantee, with an increased cap of $2 million for income-qualified applicants or large school districts.</p><p>Priority will be given to projects benefitingTitle I Schoolsand underserved communities.</p><p>Funding is distributed as cost reimbursement, with partial awards available to maximize program impact.Local school districts are eligible to submit applications to purchase school buses. Applications must be submitted by the district to support their fleet or fund efforts by their private vendors or contractors.</p><p>Any publicly funded school bus procured by an eligible entity for the routine transportation of students for school or school-related programming or activities is also eligible for consideration. Vehicles must be purchased newretrofits or repowered vehicles are not eligible. A vehicle that has been funded in whole or in part by another Maryland state agency grant may also not be funded through this program.</p><p>\"The Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program represents a convergence of the state's climate, equity and economic goals. The program enables Maryland communities to overcome the initial costs associated with the shift to cleaner vehicles so that they can receive the long-term savings that come with reduced fuel and maintenance costs,\" said Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul G. Pinsky .\"Because of this program, our kids will breathe cleaner air and our return on the investment of public funds will expand. That's a clear win-win for Maryland.\"</p><p>The window for applications for the Fiscal Year 2025 Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program will close on February 14, 2025 at 3 p.m. EST. Full details on eligibility, program guidelines and the application process are available on theprogram webpage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1126873470</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMN-H5B1-JCBF-S2FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 11, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Democrats play hardball</emphasis></p><p>Senate Democrats are digging in for a fight on a House-passed stopgap funding measure that is needed by Friday night to avoid a partial government shutdown.</p><p>After a closed-door caucus lunch, Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., announced that Democrats would fight for a one-month continuing resolution that would allow time for Congress to finish full-year appropriations bills.</p><p>The House GOP's continuing resolution (HR 1968), which passed on a mostly party-line vote Tuesday, would extend current funding through the end of this fiscal year, which is Sept. 30. Schumer suggested his caucus won't provide the votes to get to the needed 60 to allow the measure to come to a final vote, raising the odds of a shutdown when current stopgap funding (PL 118-158) runs out Friday at midnight.</p><p>\"Our caucus is unified on a clean, April 11 CR that will keep the government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan legislation that can pass,\" Schumer said on the Senate floor. \"We should vote on that.\"</p><p>That demand erects a roadblock to swift Senate passage of the House bill. But it doesn't necessarily mean the House bill is dead.</p><p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., took the initial step needed to get onto the stopgap measure Wednesday night, filing cloture on the motion to proceed to the House-passed bill. But how quickly the bill gets to the president's desk -- if at all -- was in Democrats' hands. </p><p>Democrats have been torn over whether to vote for a House bill they dislike or trigger the shutdown, which some dislike even more. If Senate GOP leaders grant Democrats a vote on a one-month CR, which likely would fall short, some Democrats may then be willing to join Republicans in advancing the House bill. Thune said he was open to that idea, though Democrats hadn't approached him yet with an offer. Your Budget Tracker has the full story here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">2. Greater defense boost eyed</emphasis></p><p>As the Pentagon faces down the possibility of its first-ever yearlong stopgap funding bill, Senate GOP defense hawks are pushing to further boost military spending through a different avenue: the forthcoming reconciliation plan. </p><p>Rather than sticking to the $150 billion figure for defense spending offered in the Senate's budget resolution (S Con Res 7), lawmakers on Wednesday began publicly advocating for an extra $25 billion increase for the department through the legislation. </p><p>Armed Services Chairman Roger Wicker, R-Miss., said in a brief interview Wednesday that he now wants to see \"at least $175 billion\" for the Defense Department included in the legislation. \"I could justify every penny of it,\" he added. </p><p>The comments came a day after the House narrowly passed a stopgap spending measure for the remainder of the fiscal year (HR 1968) and promptly adjourned ahead of a Friday night funding deadline. National security-minded lawmakers have chafed against the continuing resolution, which represents an effective cut to fiscal 2025 Defense funding after inflation, despite the inclusion of money transfer authorities, the ability to begin new programs and other flexibilities that are typically excluded from short-term spending plans. </p><p>The reconciliation package, as well as future fiscal 2026 defense funding legislation, is seen as a way to make up for that military spending reduction. John M. Donnelly has more details here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Related:</emphasis> Pentagon leaders plan to roll out their recommended cuts to military spending alongside their budget request for fiscal 2026, the Defense Department indicated in a newly released letter to Congress. The letter, addressed to House Armed Services Chair Mike D. Rogers, R-Ala., and dated March 5, states that Congress will be informed of the results of the so-called budget relook -- which called for an internal realignment of 8 percent of the Defense Department's budget -- as the president's spending request is made public in the coming weeks. Briana Reilly has more here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">3. DOGE data access probe blocked</emphasis></p><p>House Ways and Means Republicans effectively blocked further consideration of a pair of resolutions that would require the Trump administration to share information about the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency's access to Treasury Department and Social Security Administration data.</p><p>In a rowdy committee markup Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans traded barbs about DOGE's mission and access to sensitive information at both agencies.</p><p>Democrats introduced the pair of resolutions of inquiry, which are privileged under House rules and must be considered in committee. The party-line votes to report the two resolutions of inquiry unfavorably to the House effectively block Democrats from forcing a floor vote on the measures in the future. </p><p>\"What we have seen over the last seven weeks is unacceptable,\" said Ways and Means ranking Democrat Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts. \"Unaccountable and unelected people with no experience in the systems of our government have been rifling through the people's data,\" </p><p>Ways and Means Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo., countered that Democrats oppose cutting \"government fat.\" DOGE's access to Treasury and SSA data is above board, Smith added, citing Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent's authorization. Caitlin Reilly has the story.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">4. EPA grants terminated</emphasis></p><p>In a late-night decision Tuesday, EPA Adminstrator Lee Zeldin terminated $20 billion in climate-change grants issued by the previous administration through the Democrats' 2022 climate reconciliation law (PL 117-169).</p><p>The grants were issued through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is intended to help finance projects across the country that would reduce emissions.</p><p>\"I have taken action to terminate these grants riddled with self-dealing and wasteful spending,\" Zeldin said in a statement. \"EPA will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars dedicated to our core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of 'climate equity.'\" He said the contracts were terminated due to \"incidents of misconduct, conflicts of interest, and potential fraud.\"</p><p>Zeldin has said he's referred the matter to the EPA's inspector general and that there is a parallel investigation at the Justice Department. The funds, which were placed in a Citibank account by the Biden administration, were frozen in February.</p><p>One of the recipients, Climate United, sued the EPA on March 8 over this move, arguing the agency had not adequately demonstrated that there was waste or fraud that warranted terminating the contract. A hearing on that case is scheduled for Wednesday afternoon in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. David Jordan has more on the grants here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">5. Plan to dump federal office buildings contested</emphasis></p><p>A Trump administration plan to sell off \"non-core\" federal buildings could save hundreds of millions in annual operating costs, according to a General Services Administration estimate. But it could also displace dozens of congressional offices around the country, cost taxpayers additional money and disrupt constituent services, say critics on Capitol Hill.</p><p>As many as 43 Senate state offices and 14 House district offices are housed in buildings deemed \"non-core\" in a list that GSA published online last week and then deleted, per a count by Democratic lawmakers. And more could be at risk as part of a push to terminate federal leases to cut spending, led by billionaire Elon Musk and the so-called Department of Government Efficiency.</p><p>\"Picking major pieces of real estate to sell without any deeper analysis of market conditions, other office space and the long-term development plans in the region is just plain dumb,\" said Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. \"That's what makes this feel like it's a whole lot more about politics than it is about government efficiency.\"</p><p>Warren has an office in the John F. Kennedy Federal Building in Boston, which appeared on the list of more than 440 properties posted last Tuesday. A day later, that original list had disappeared, though an updated roster of disposable federal buildings is \"coming soon,\" according to GSA's website. </p><p>Many federal buildings have become \"functionally obsolete and unsuitable for use,\" according to the GSA, which touted $430 million in potential yearly savings via divestiture. A spokesperson said GSA had \"received an overwhelming amount of interest\" in the effort since last week. Justin Papp has more details.</p><h>BUDGET BRIEFS</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Frozen transportation funds probed:</emphasis> Senate and House Transportation-HUD Appropriations ranking members Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. and James E. Clyburn, D-S.C., sent a letter to Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy asking him to explain recent funding, policy and staffing changes at the department. Gillibrand and Clyburn wrote that $60 billion in competitive grants that were awarded but not obligated have been frozen and that hundreds of probationary Transportation Department employees have been fired. -- <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aidan Quigley</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Senate GOP tax writers head to White House:</emphasis> Senate Finance Republicans head to the White House Thursday as the GOP tries to sort out its plans for a budget reconciliation bill they need to bypass a filibuster and enact much of Trump's agenda. Senate Republicans have said the $4.5 trillion cap the House budget resolution (H Con Res 14) would place on the cost of the tax portion of the bill falls short of the space they need to make the 2017 tax cuts (PL 115-97) permanent, an aim they share with the White House. House Republicans have warned major changes to their resolution would imperil the measure when it returns to their chamber.  --<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Caitlin Reilly</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Senate GOP tax cut wish list:</emphasis> Ahead of the White House meeting, Senate Finance Chairman Michael D. Crapo, R-Idaho, ticked off a list of possible tax items that could push the price tag well north of $5 trillion, significantly more than the House budget allows for. He said at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce tax summit Wednesday that senators had submitted more than 200 requests to him beyond the typical suite of 2017 tax cut extensions, relief from the state and local tax deduction cap and Trump's proposals to exempt tips and overtime pay from the income tax. Ideas range from expanded low-income housing credits to a larger estate tax exemption, Crapo said. \"The list goes on and on,\" he said, according to The Wall Street Journal.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bishop nomination advanced:</emphasis> The Senate Budget Committee approved the nomination of former Rep. Dan Bishop as deputy director of the White House budget office Wednesday, setting it up for a confirmation vote on the Senate floor. The panel recommended the Bishop nomination on an 11-10 party-line vote. The vote follows action by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which approved's Bishop nomination last month, as Paul M. Krawzak reports here.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Medicare, Medicaid payment models scrapped:</emphasis> The Trump administration announced Wednesday it will end several payment models that were intended to save money in Medicare and Medicaid.The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced that after a review of ongoing models, some will conclude early on Dec. 31 while others will end as scheduled. Participants -- typically health care providers -- will have through the end of the year to transition to other models \"to minimize disruption to their operations,\" CMS said in a statement. The CMS said canceling the models will save $750 million, as Jessie Hellmann reports here.</p><h>PODCAST PLUG</h><p>Our latest CQ Budget podcast, available here, assesses the prospects for passage this week of a continuing resolution to head off a partial government shutdown and the political challenge it poses to both parties.

The storms left more than 250 people dead and laid bare the need to improve the modeling of these events from a number of perspectives including engineering, infrastructure, supply chains, and social support networks.</p><p>\"Better modeling means better preparedness. The rapid intensification of both storms is a worrisome signal, one of the many signals calling attention to this problem,\" said Dr. Paolo Bocchini, PhD., Director of the Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience. \"We need to unite the next generation of researchers in engineering, natural hazard science, climate science, and the social science of disasters to understand today better so we can prepare for tomorrow.\"</p><p>According to a release, the consequences of other catastrophic phenomena - such as wildfires, pandemics, floods, and earthquakes - are also being addressed by the work of the Center.</p><p>Bocchini says Lehigh University's Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience is a unique research forum using advanced technology and analytics, including Artificial Intelligence, to modernize the science and accuracy of catastrophe modeling. Bocchini and his interdisciplinary team of seven other core faculty are building a collaborative ecosystem of academia, industry, and government agencies to better enable communities to understand and withstand disaster.</p><p>The Center, he says, is home to the country's only graduate-level degree program training the next generation of people to develop and use catastrophe models. Researchers from academia and the private and public sectors come together to combine historical data with the most advanced multi-scale, multi-hazard, and multi-physics models to improve how our communities prepare for climatological and biological disasters.</p><p>They've been flooded with calls and questions over the last several weeks. These questions are born out of fear and concern. But they can be cause for a cure. That cure, Bocchini says, comes by connecting the evolutions of engineering, climatology, earth sciences, and sociology to better understand the whys and results of tomorrow's catastrophes.</p><p>Decades of research in natural hazards and seven years of specific focus on catastrophe modeling culminated in the 2024 establishment of Lehigh University's Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience. The Center provides an interdisciplinary home for the scientific and educational activities of researchers, students, and scholars working on natural disasters and health-related threats. Lehigh identified catastrophe modeling and resilience research as one of its strategic areas of growth and has invested in the development and advancement of the Center's work.</p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WNCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WNCLPM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DMK-6CD1-JCRR-00Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Close-Up Media, Inc.

Trucks would rumble by, carting away contaminated soil as part of a shipyard cleanup effort that has spanned\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.envirostor.dtsc.ca.gov/public/profile_report?global_id=38440004\">39 years</url>. Harrison says the trucks were often uncovered, and she recalls seeing dirt blow over the street in clouds that looked like smoke.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You'd think it was a fire from blocks away,\" said Harrison, 58.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That dust - which she couldn't avoid inhaling -\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/science/article/Toxic-soil-went-from-SF-s-Hunters-Point-to-12854269.php\">might</url>\u00a0have been contaminated with more than\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://cumulis.epa.gov/supercpad/SiteProfiles/index.cfm?fuseaction=second.contams&amp;id=0902722\">a hundred</url>\u00a0pollutants, some radioactive. Four generations of Harrisons, including Arieann's grandchildren, have lived in the neighborhood as the cleanup drags on. Marie Harrison, a prominent local environmental justice advocate and Arieann's mother, died of a chronic lung disease that her doctors suspected was precipitated by toxins. Arieann's father, who died in 2014, had cancer and her sister has cancer. Multiple tests of Arieann's blood and urine have detected radioactive compounds including plutonium and toxins like lead and arsenic, which also have been found at the shipyard. Arieann continues her mother's work advocating for a complete shipyard cleanup through the Marie Harrison Community Foundation.\u00a0</p><p>The shipyard, a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/exposed/\">notoriously toxic site</url>, is just one of thousands of contaminated parcels around the Bay Area undergoing remediation. These cleanups take longer in marginalized communities, according to a new San Francisco Public Press analysis of more than 20,000 sites of varying size across the nine-county Bay Area. In areas that scored high on a national index of socioeconomic vulnerability, the median cleanup took more than 450 days longer than in the least vulnerable areas. Many factors, including the type of toxin, the nature of the site and the complexity of the cleanup, could affect how long a remediation takes and explain some of the differences. But in a subset of more than 12,000 cleanups of comparable complexity, the disparities were even more pronounced.</p><p>Scientists and community organizers accuse regulators of prioritizing cleanups in wealthier, whiter areas. Regulators acknowledge that work can lag in marginalized communities but say they are hamstrung by insufficient money and staffing. For people living near toxic sites, slow or stalled cleanups mean longer exposure to harmful substances,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4038095/\">increasing the risk of sickness</url>.\u00a0</p><p>While the locations and history of toxic cleanups are well-documented, no public catalog of cleanup durations existed. To create one, the Public Press mapped three agencies' databases of thousands of cleanups and calculated their durations using start and end dates. As a measure of marginalization, the analysis used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Social Vulnerability Index, which combines demographic data with poverty rates, access to transportation and other socioeconomic factors to score census tracts.\u00a0</p><p>Community advocates and researchers have long believed that regulators prioritize cleanups in areas where residents have the means to prompt action and protest delays.\u00a0</p><p>\"Cleanup standards for communities of color and low-income communities continue to lag behind those of other communities,\" said Bradley Angel, executive director of the watchdog group Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice. \"It's not that cleanups don't exist in other communities, but the problem is magnified here.\"\u00a0</p><p>Lindsey Dillon, an associate professor of sociology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the impact of toxic sites on surrounding communities, said the Public Press' findings are consistent with academic literature on environmental justice.</p><p>\"Marginalized groups get fewer resources,\" Dillon said.</p><p>Racial disparities are stark, the data shows. The median cleanup in areas with a very high proportion of residents who are Black, Indigenous or other people of color took nearly a year longer than the median cleanup in mostly white areas. In the subset of similar sites, the difference was more than two and a half years or 47%.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're seeing the results of racism,\" said Shirletha Holmes-Boxx, a Greenaction community organizer and policy advocate.\u00a0</p><p>When a cleanup drags on, the exposure period for nearby residents can too, which experts say increases the risk of getting sick.\u00a0</p><p>Dr. Ahimsa Porter Sumchai, who runs the Hunters Point Community Biomonitoring Program, has tested the blood and urine of people living near the shipyard, including Arieann Harrison, for contaminants. Harrison's doctors say the toxins found in her body have contributed to a host of symptoms, ranging from dizziness and nausea to a mysterious metallic taste in her mouth.\u00a0</p><p>In a different family Sumchai tested, every member had the same contaminants in their blood and urine. The older the family members were, the higher their pollutant concentrations.\u00a0</p><p>\"There's no question that the duration of exposure matters,\" Sumchai said.\u00a0</p><p>In an emailed statement, Environmental Protection Agency spokesperson Joshua Alexander attributed the cleanup's long duration to its complexity and acknowledged that\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/exposed-part-6-shuttered-radiation-lab-poses-ongoing-health-risks-for-growing-neighborhood/\">past fraud</url>\u00a0by the cleanup contractor Tetra Tech EC extended the timeline. He said the cleanup is moving as fast as it can, responsibly.</p><p>\"We work with the Navy to prioritize according to the worst risks first,\" Alexander said.\u00a0</p><p>Most contaminated sites are not nearly as toxic as the shipyard. But even relatively minor sites can generate low levels of chronic exposure, said Ian Wren, lead scientist at the watchdog organization San Francisco Baykeeper. Petroleum from leaking underground storage tanks at former gas stations, for instance, can cause short-term effects like nausea and dizziness. In the long term, they can cause liver and kidney damage, and increase cancer risk,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/indoor-air-quality-iaq/volatile-organic-compounds-impact-indoor-air-quality\">according to the EPA</url>.</p><p>\"It's that chronic exposure that poses the greatest risk to communities,\" Wren said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Residents in socially vulnerable communities are often already managing health conditions that can be exacerbated by toxic exposure, said Dillon, the UC Santa Cruz professor.\u00a0</p><p>\"All of those socioeconomic factors and health conditions make people even more vulnerable to the health risks of contamination,\" Dillon said. \"Socially vulnerable neighborhoods should be at the top of the list in terms of cleanup priority.\"\u00a0</p><p>Several regulators acknowledged that work has been slower in marginalized communities, though officials gave differing characterizations of the disparities. Cheryl Prowell has worked more than 17 years at regulatory agencies overseeing cleanups in California. Prowell is assistant deputy director of site mitigation and restoration at the California Department of Toxic Substances Control and formerly a supervising engineer at the State Water Resources Control Board, two of the agencies responsible for the cleanup sites the Public Press analyzed. She has seen slower action on cleanups in marginalized communities.\u00a0</p><p>\"I could see the difference. Understanding why that was true, I don't know, but both agencies are working to try to change that,\" Prowell said.\u00a0</p><p>Though she saw the inequity, Prowell said, officials had not been applying an environmental justice lens to the data until now.</p><p>\"I hope you will start to see these numbers change. There is so much to do,\" she said.</p><p>Working-class communities can face hurdles to protesting slow cleanups, said Julio Garcia, executive director of the South San Francisco environmental justice organization Rise South City. People in these communities working one or more jobs often don't have the luxury or ability to take unpaid time off to attend public meetings where they might exert pressure on regulators. It also takes time to learn about the risks of pollution and toxic exposure, Garcia said.</p><p>Socially vulnerable neighborhoods also tend to be on or near current and former industrial sites. Many are close to the former military installations that pepper Bay Area coastlines. These areas bear the brunt of the region's worst pollution, which may take more time to remediate.</p><p>\"As a rule, the most polluting activity is put where people least can resist it,\" said\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/bay-area-group-new-tool-reveals-worst-toxic-sites-refocusing-environmental-activism/\">Cade Cannedy</url>, program director at Climate Resilient Communities in East Palo Alto. \"The most polluted sites will be in communities of color. Smaller sites will also take longer to clean up in those communities, often because they have less power to resist it.\"</p><p>Conversely, more powerful communities can usher cleanups along, said Wren, the Baykeeper scientist.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Affluent communities can exert pressure on regulators to act, Wren said, adding that officials have told him resource-strapped agencies will not manage a site proactively unless a community forces them to do so.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's really a case of, the squeaky wheel gets the cleanup,\" he said.</p><p>Cleanups also happen faster when property owners can pay - and that's often the case for sites of planned redevelopment, said Prowell, of the Department of Toxic Substances Control. Developers have the money for cleanups and can pressure regulators to speed up the process, she said.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>\"The consultants and attorneys that work on the redevelopment projects are very persistent, so there is that element of 'squeaking' on redevelopment projects,\" she said, responding to Wren's \"squeaky wheel\" analogy.</p><p>Others contend that money doesn't buy influence in the cleanup process, at least not from the government side.</p><p>\"That's not my reality,\" said Marikka Hughes, branch chief at the Department of Toxic Substances Control, adding that the agency works to complete cleanups fairly.\u00a0</p><p>But cleanups that don't have sufficient funding or persistent attorneys can fall through the cracks. The process regularly stretches on for decades; dozens in the Bay Area have dragged on for more than half a century. More than a thousand have lasted longer than three decades.\u00a0</p><p>\"The idea that communities are waiting that long is heartbreaking,\" said Phoenix Armenta,\u00a0manager for climate equity and community engagement for the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.</p><p>The correlation between social vulnerability and cleanup duration is not perfect. Census tracts with a \"moderate\" social vulnerability index had some of the longest cleanups, in some cases longer than sites in \"high\" social vulnerability areas. However, some of those \"moderate\" tracts are in communities like Bayview-Hunters Point, South San Francisco, East Oakland and East Palo Alto, widely considered marginalized relative to their immediate surroundings.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfpublicpress.org/brightline-defense-takes-on-san-franciscos-air-pollution-and-environmental-justice-concerns-qa-with-executive-director-eddie-ahn/\">Eddie Ahn</url>, the executive director of Brightline Defense, an environmental justice advocacy organization, has assessed the accuracy of a state screening tool similar to the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index called CalEnviroScreen. Ahn noted that tools calibrated to a statewide or national scale often don't take into account the high cost of living in the Bay Area. That can lead to an underestimation of economic pain in the region. Moreover, neighborhoods like San Francisco's Mission District comprise luxury homes side by side with affordable housing, a complicated profile that is difficult to represent in an aggregate score like those produced by the CDC's index.\u00a0</p><p>That issue likely led a census tract in Hunters Point next to the shipyard to score \"moderate\" in social vulnerability. The tract contains new luxury homes whose residents are wealthier than those in the surrounding working-class neighborhood. That inflates the tract's median household income to $142,321, which is comparable to citywide levels, according to\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US06075980600-census-tract-9806-san-francisco-ca/\">U.S. Census data</url>. The pocket of well-off residents misleads screening tools, resulting in a vulnerability score for the tract that is out of sync with the rest of the community, said Dillon, the UC Santa Cruz professor, who has assessed several such tools.</p><p>Since the overall dataset includes a range of cleanup types, including exceptionally complex and hazardous sites, the Public Press also analyzed a subset of sites with similar characteristics. That analysis showed even more pronounced disparities.\u00a0</p><p>Old underground storage tanks are scattered across communities of all levels of vulnerability. Often relics of old gas stations, they frequently leak gasoline into the surrounding soil and groundwater. As cleanups go, they are relatively simple, and the cleanup protocol is consistent across sites.\u00a0</p><p>The median duration of leaking underground storage tank cleanups in high vulnerability areas was more than two years longer than comparable cleanups in the lowest vulnerability areas. The median cleanup took even longer in moderate social vulnerability areas, where scores may be affected by pockets of gentrification.</p><p>\"It's another example of our communities being left behind, forgotten about and disenfranchised,\" said Adele Watts, the interim Northern California co-director for the environmental justice advocacy group Communities for a Better Environment.</p><p>The state Water Resources Control Board, which oversees the cleanups of underground storage tanks, is aware that cleanups take longer in more vulnerable communities. Annalisa Kihara, the agency's assistant deputy director in the Division of Water Quality, said the agency is revising its process to prioritize communities that are most burdened with pollution, and that it has an initiative for expediting stalled cases.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're holding a mirror up to ourselves,\" Kihara said.\u00a0</p><p>Underground storage tank cleanups in marginalized neighborhoods may take longer because those neighborhoods are more burdened with various kinds of pollution, and there's a greater likelihood that contamination from a given underground storage tank is interacting with other toxic substances.\u00a0</p><p>\"We're often finding a soup of contaminants,\" Kihara said.\u00a0</p><p>If multiple parties are responsible for the pollution, that will slow the cleanup too, she said.\u00a0</p><p>Regulators at the Department of Toxic Substances Control said they aspire to prioritize projects based on risk to human health and whether the site is going to have housing, but that insufficient funding can limit their ability to do so.\u00a0</p><p>Site remediation in California operates under a \"polluter pays\" model, where the property owner is responsible for covering costs for testing and treatment as well as agency staff time. When the property owner doesn't have sufficient money, regulators dip into limited - and\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://bes.dtsc.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/42/2024/01/01162024-Item-6-Complete-DTSC-Budget-Update-January-2024-ADA.pdf\">dwindling</url>\u00a0- pools of funding. But there isn't enough of it, said the department's Hughes. Other officials agreed more funding is needed to advance cleanups.</p><p>The agency representatives described underground storage tanks as a success story. After Congress created a\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/ust/leaking-underground-storage-tank-trust-fund\">dedicated fund</url>\u00a0financed by a gas tax to pay up to $1 million per site to clean up underground tanks, regulators\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/site_cleanup_program/docs/CleanupPrograms_FactSheet.pdf\">closed 95% of them</url>\u00a0in three decades. The water board says it wants to reproduce that success with other, more complex cleanups.\u00a0</p><p>As the Trump Administration\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/11/climate/epa-closure-environmental-justice-offices.html\">cuts</url>\u00a0federal environmental programs, researchers and advocates say the region's most polluted communities need state and municipal agencies to step up.\u00a0</p><p>Arieann Harrison, the Hunters Point environmental justice activist, is still pushing for a full cleanup of the shipyard - work she hopes will protect future generations.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's too late for me, the toxins are already in my bones. I just want to see a better outcome for our kids,\" Harrison said. \"All these protective agencies, they haven't protected us at all. But they're doing better now. They are at the table.\"\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>At the Marie Harrison Community Foundation office, stickers and T-shirts carry the slogan \"can we live.\"\u00a0</p><p>\"I came up with the rallying cry 'can we live' because I felt like we were begging for our lives,\" Harrison said. \"Can we live?

The storms left more than 250 people dead and laid bare the need to improve the modeling of these events from a number of perspectives including engineering, infrastructure, supply chains, and social support networks.</p><p>\"Better modeling means better preparedness. The rapid intensification of both storms is a worrisome signal, one of the many signals calling attention to this problem,\" said Dr. Paolo Bocchini, PhD., Director of the Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience. \"We need to unite the next generation of researchers in engineering, natural hazard science, climate science, and the social science of disasters to understand today better so we can prepare for tomorrow.\"</p><p>According to a release, the consequences of other catastrophic phenomena - such as wildfires, pandemics, floods, and earthquakes - are also being addressed by the work of the Center.</p><p>Bocchini says Lehigh University's Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience is a unique research forum using advanced technology and analytics, including Artificial Intelligence, to modernize the science and accuracy of catastrophe modeling. Bocchini and his interdisciplinary team of seven other core faculty are building a collaborative ecosystem of academia, industry, and government agencies to better enable communities to understand and withstand disaster.</p><p>The Center, he says, is home to the country's only graduate-level degree program training the next generation of people to develop and use catastrophe models. Researchers from academia and the private and public sectors come together to combine historical data with the most advanced multi-scale, multi-hazard, and multi-physics models to improve how our communities prepare for climatological and biological disasters.</p><p>They've been flooded with calls and questions over the last several weeks. These questions are born out of fear and concern. But they can be cause for a cure. That cure, Bocchini says, comes by connecting the evolutions of engineering, climatology, earth sciences, and sociology to better understand the whys and results of tomorrow's catastrophes.</p><p>Decades of research in natural hazards and seven years of specific focus on catastrophe modeling culminated in the 2024 establishment of Lehigh University's Center for Catastrophe Modeling and Resilience. The Center provides an interdisciplinary home for the scientific and educational activities of researchers, students, and scholars working on natural disasters and health-related threats. Lehigh identified catastrophe modeling and resilience research as one of its strategic areas of growth and has invested in the development and advancement of the Center's work.</p><p>((Comments on this story may be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newsdesk@closeupmedia.com\">newsdesk@closeupmedia.com</email>))</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WNCLPM-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WNCLPM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DM4-KSW1-F06S-P48B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">345215</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Close-Up Media, Inc.

This legislation shapes the U.S. food system and covers everything from nutrition to conservation and crop insurance. The last food and farm bill expired in September 2023, and Congress passed a one-year extension shortly after to keep agricultural programs running until a new bill is signed into law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act, proposed but not yet introduced in full by Stabenow, critically protects climate-friendly guardrails around billions of dollars in investments from the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) that are intended to support farmers in being part of the climate solution. Thompson's proposal suggests removing those guardrails to allow funding to be used for practices with no demonstrated climate benefits.</p><p>A truly sustainable agricultural system must include sustainable working conditions. A review of Stabenow's proposal indicates that her bill would improve coordination across the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for food and farmworkers by reauthorizing and expanding the Farmworker Coordinator position and providing workers with support to withstand disruptions to the food and farm economy, whether from extreme weather or global pandemics.</p><p>The proposal also includes provisions to create a more just and equitable food and farm system by increasing support for farmers who have been historically underserved or excluded from USDA support and services - namely Black farmers and ranchers, Indigenous producers and other farmers of color - and ensuring that all farmers, no matter their background, can compete and succeed. Thompson's House proposal does not appear to contain any provisions to address the needs of workers or historically underserved farmers.</p><p>Finally, the Senate proposal would protect modernization of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to ensure that food assistance reflects the true cost of a nutritious diet based on the latest scientific and dietary guidelines.</p><p>Below is a statement by Melissa Kaplan, senior manager of government affairs in the Food and Environment Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists:</p><p>\"Farmers are increasingly impacted by extreme weather driven by climate change, and any final food and farm bill must help farmers become more resilient to climate impacts like increasingly severe droughts, extreme heat and flooding while also reducing agricultural emissions that are contributing to the climate crisis. Protecting and preserving Inflation Reduction Act conservation funding for climate-smart farming practices is critical and should not be up for discussion or negotiation. This isn't a fringe issue - polls show that the public strongly supports programs that help farmers protect their farms from extreme weather, like those funded by the Inflation Reduction Act.</p><p>\"The public also supports protecting the workers who keep our country fed and helping people of color and young people succeed in agriculture. Senator Stabenow's proposal takes important steps to rectify a history of exclusion and discrimination by addressing the unique barriers faced by historically underserved farmers and ranchers and finally recognizing food and farmworkers as a critical part of our agriculture and food system. Workers have been clear that they deserve a voice in the food and farm bill and in USDA policies that affect their workplaces and their lives.</p><p>\"A new food and farm bill provides an opportunity to create a food system that is more resilient in the face of extreme weather and climate change, is more sustainable for future generations, is more just and equitable for farmers and workers, and keeps people from going hungry. The Rural Prosperity and Food Security Act appears to demonstrate a serious understanding and reckoning with the challenges facing our food and farm system, and the changes necessary to build a more sustainable, resilient and equitable food system that works for everyone. This proposal should be the starting point for all future conversations about the food and farm bill.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>Original text here: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/farm-bill-must-prioritize-sustainable-food-system\">https://www.ucsusa.org/about/news/farm-bill-must-prioritize-sustainable-food-system</url></p><p>[Category: Environment]</p><p>Contact: Kyle Ann Sebastian, Communications Officer, Food &amp;

Wes Moore, D-Maryland, issued the following news release on Dec. 11, 2024:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Governor Wes Moore today announced the launch of the Maryland Energy Administration's new program to expand the number of electric school buses in use across the state. As a key pillar of the governor's $90 million climate pledge, the program will help cut emissions that drive climate change and improve the health of Maryland's schoolkids.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Many communities are already seeing the consequences of climate change in their own backyards. Now, we need to ensure more Marylanders can see themselves in the progress of climate action,\" said Gov. Moore. \"Electrifying our school bus fleet isn't just the responsible choice for our environment -- it's also the smart thing for our state's economic competitiveness and our children's health.\"</p><p>The Maryland Energy Administration will offer up to $17 million through the Fiscal Year 2025 Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program for electric school buses, charging infrastructure and associated costs. Eligible applicants can receive up to 85% of the incremental cost of purchasing qualified electric school buses. The program provides up to $1.5 million per grantee, with an increased cap of $2 million for income-qualified applicants or large school districts.</p><p>Priority will be given to projects benefiting Title I Schools and underserved communities.</p><p>Funding is distributed as cost reimbursement, with partial awards available to maximize program impact. Local school districts are eligible to submit applications to purchase school buses. Applications must be submitted by the district to support their fleet or fund efforts by their private vendors or contractors.</p><p>Any publicly funded school bus procured by an eligible entity for the routine transportation of students for school or school-related programming or activities is also eligible for consideration. Vehicles must be purchased new--retrofits or repowered vehicles are not eligible. A vehicle that has been funded in whole or in part by another Maryland state agency grant may also not be funded through this program.</p><p>\"The Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program represents a convergence of the state's climate, equity and economic goals. The program enables Maryland communities to overcome the initial costs associated with the shift to cleaner vehicles so that they can receive the long-term savings that come with reduced fuel and maintenance costs,\" said Maryland Energy Administration Director Paul G. Pinsky. \"Because of this program, our kids will breathe cleaner air and our return on the investment of public funds will expand. That's a clear win-win for Maryland.\"</p><p>The window for applications for the Fiscal Year 2025 Maryland Electric School Bus Grant Program will close on February 14, 2025 at 3 p.m. EST.

Trump's Environmental Protection Agency in mid-February placed an extraordinary freeze on one of the largest climate programs in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. A federal court is now weighing whether that action defied EPA's contractual obligations, several laws and the grantees' Constitutional rights to due process of law, with the next hearing in the case set for Wednesday.</p><p>The fight in Washington threatens to slow Bridge of Grace's plans to expand its work buying and rehabilitating dilapidated houses in Fort Wayne. The group aims to reduce blight, provide much-needed housing for low-income families and cut energy consumption and costs with efficiency and appliance upgrades. And yet, de Leon remains optimistic that some good can still come of this.</p><p>\"I put everything in God's hands,\" he said. \"If it doesn't happen, you know, something else, bigger and better, will come out.\"</p><p>But the wait for a program like this one already had been long.</p><p>Climate activists had advocated for nearly two decades for a \"green bank\" that would use federal money to spur private investment in the clean energy transition. Low-interest loans could spur homes and businesses to adopt renewable energy and efficiency upgrades, especially in disadvantaged areas. This idea became law in 2022, but it has now run into the buzzsaw of Trump administration budget cuts and attempts to do away with Biden-era climate programs, sending shockwaves across the country to local governments, lenders, developers, small businesses and others that were counting on having access to these loans.</p><p>Participants saw in the program an opportunity for the government to boost local economies while improving the environment and saving money. The Trump administration characterized it as a giveaway-potentially, a criminal one-that was part of a harmful green agenda. Trump's team also is using the fight over the climate fund to assert an expansive view of executive power-arguing that any federal contracts can be brushed aside based on a change in policy priorities by a new administration.\u00a0</p><p>\"The days of irresponsibly shoveling boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity are over,\" said Lee Zeldin, administrator of the EPA under Trump.</p><p>An EPA spokesperson declined to comment, saying the matter is in litigation and the agency has laid out its case in court filings.</p><p>The Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was unlike any other of the thousands of environmental grants that the Biden administration awarded under the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. It was not meant to be a government handout, but rather seed money to get private lenders to finance the clean energy transition at the ground level.</p><p>Climate policy thinkers began talking about the concept nearly 20 years ago. Government couldn't fund a clean energy transition all on its own, they reasoned. Instead, government could assume some of the risk and provide guidance that would spur private lenders to begin making the kind of loans they weren't making-for energy-efficiency and renewable energy projects for homes and small businesses, especially in low-income communities that needed the most help.</p><p>\"It was designed to address sort of market failures in certain areas, especially low-income neighborhoods where generating a transition to clean energy and energy efficiency can both reduce bills and address the climate crisis by reducing emissions,\" said U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) in a recent interview. He introduced <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/1698?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22climate+bank%22%7D&amp;s=5&amp;r=1\">one of the first green bank proposals</url> in Congress in 2009, when he was still a member of the House.</p><p>It was one of the only ideas to garner bipartisan support in a committee vote that year as Congress debated President Barack Obama's ill-fated climate legislation, co-sponsored by current Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), then a representative. The big bill, which would have capped U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and employed a market-based trading system to drive investment, died in the Senate.</p><p>In 2011, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) picked up the <url normalizedValue=\"https://insideclimatenews.org/news/11052011/bingaman-murkowski-senate-clean-energy-ceda/\">green bank</url> idea, working on a bill with former Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), then chair of the Senate Energy Committee, who saw it as one of the only climate solutions that could get GOP support. Said Murkowski, \"It's a smarter, more efficient way for the federal government to promote clean energy technologies.\"</p><p>As it turned out, Congress would not take up climate legislation again for more than a decade. But in the meantime, the green bank idea took off in states and around the world. Connecticut's state legislature paved the way for the nation's first green bank by bipartisan vote in 2011, and since then <url normalizedValue=\"https://coalitionforgreencapital.com/american-green-bank-consortium/\">20 more public and quasi-public</url> green banks have been established from Hawaii to Rhode Island, including in red states like Texas, Missouri and South Carolina.\u00a0</p><p>Green banks have been established in the United Kingdom, Japan, Australia and other countries. The Natural Resources Defense Council calculates that such banks have funded <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nrdc.org/greenbanknetwork\">$143 billion</url> in clean energy projects that have cut climate-damaging emissions equivalent to taking 25 million gasoline cars off the road.</p><p>A key feature of green banks is their multiplier effect. Public money is meant to act as a backstop that gives private lenders, mostly credit unions and small community banks, the confidence to lend larger sums to get climate-friendly projects done. Such lenders are accustomed to financing home mortgages and auto loans, not clean energy.</p><p>\"Financing in clean energy, energy efficiency, solar and so forth is a very specialized market,\" said Bert Hunter, executive vice president and chief investment officer of the Connecticut Green Bank, who sees its job as providing \"a pathway for local lenders to get acquainted with this market.\"</p><p>Since its inception 13 years ago, private lenders have put $7 into clean energy projects for every $1 loaned by the Connecticut Green Bank-for a total of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ctgreenbank.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/FY12-FY24-Connecticut-Green-Bank-Impact-Report-8-30-2024.pdf\">$2.9 billion</url>. The money has financed energy upgrades for more than 63,000 Connecticut families and 8,000 businesses. Delinquency rates have been low or on par with national averages for mortgage and auto loans, even though 32 percent of the lending has been in low-income and disadvantaged communities, which have fewer resources.\u00a0</p><p>Van Hollen says the combined economic and environmental benefits, plus reduced reliance on foreign oil, make green banks a \"win-win-win\" public policy. \"This is a case where it needed some government incentive to make these necessary changes and to move in the direction of more clean energy, more energy efficiency,\" he said. When the opportunity finally came in 2022 to advance climate legislation in Congress, Van Hollen and Markey worked with the Biden administration to make sure that the Inflation Reduction Act included a provision for a green bank, now called the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.</p><p>Because the IRA was a budget reconciliation bill-a special type of legislation that requires only a simple majority for Senate passage-it had to be designed as a grant program. But the $27 billion wouldn't be spent and gone as with the other grants. The recipients would work in partnership with private lenders to generate loans to be paid back with interest, with the proceeds reinvested in more clean energy projects over time.</p><p>Supporters of the fund point to evidence that it was working, even in its earliest stages. One of the main recipients, the Coalition for Green Capital, had already closed six clean energy projects totaling $33.7 million by the end of 2024, according to <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874838-33-28\">court testimony</url>. Those deals attracted $192 million in private investment; every $1 of federal money was mobilizing $6 of private capital. The coalition told the court it received many more proposals and was considering funding 24 that would have deployed a combined $16 in private financing for every $1 of financing by the federal government.\u00a0</p><p>But this work, an estimated $85 billion in clean energy projects, is now on hold, blocked by the Trump administration's attempt to radically reconfigure the congressionally approved fund.</p><p>The Trump administration has sought to slash government spending across the board, but its attack on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund has been on a different level.</p><p>Trump and his team didn't just seek to claw back $20 billion of the awarded money; they launched a criminal investigation into the program. They notified grantees that their contracts were terminated \"based on substantial concerns regarding program integrity, the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the Agency's priorities, which collectively undermine the fundamental goals and statutory objectives of the award.\"\u00a0</p><p>Zeldin targeted three-quarters of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, including the entirety of two programs, the National Clean Investment Fund, designed to help finance low- and zero-emissions energy projects, more than half of them in low-income and disadvantaged communities, and the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator, which works with community-based lenders to finance such projects for individuals and small businesses, all of them in disadvantaged areas.\u00a0</p><p>\"I will not rest until these hard-earned taxpayer dollars are returned to the U.S. Treasury,\" Zeldin said in a press statement.</p><p>In EPA's <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874697-49\">latest court briefs</url>, however, the agency spends less time on allegations of wrongdoing, although it does say the criminal investigation is ongoing. The agency spends more time on its authority under law, claiming that it has the right to break contracts if its priorities change.\u00a0</p><p>The Trump administration argues that grant recipients may be able to pursue a claim in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (where the only relief would be monetary), but it can not be forced \"to proceed with billions of dollars in grants that it has decided no longer advance the interests of the United States.\"</p><p>The shift in the arguments comes after the grantees challenged many of the Trump EPA's arguments:</p><p>U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan concluded that so far the Trump administration has \"proffered no evidence to support their basis for the sudden terminations\" of the contracts. On March 18, she blocked the EPA from taking back the money, but did not free it up for the grantees. It is now sitting in the accounts at Citibank while the litigation proceeds.</p><p>This program represents the first time EPA, which had never before administered such a large grant initiative, has used an outside financial agent like Citibank. But such agreements have been used often by the federal government to handle large transactions, including to transmit assistance to businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0</p><p>The arrangement \"increased transactional visibility\" for EPA and was designed specifically to give the agency a security interest in the money-a legal right to the funds if the grant recipient had not performed its contractual duties, an official of the Coalition for Green Capital <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874897-33-27\">told the court</url>. Such an arrangement was not possible through the government's in-house government grant distribution system.</p><p>Indeed, one portion of the fund-the $7 billion Solar for All program-is not being held up but is being administered to 60 grantees nationwide through the government's grant distribution system. The Trump administration froze this money for a time, but released it amid continuing court battles over its latitude to block congressionally approved grant programs.</p><p>In Van Hollen's view, the use of Citibank as an outside financial agent got under the skin of Trump administration officials in their effort to assert control at all levels of government.</p><p>\"I believe they're frustrated because the Biden administration was able to place these funds beyond their clawback reach,\" Van Hollen said. \"So they're just manufacturing claims, and that manufacturing of claims is itself a fraud. It's a fraud on the public.\"</p><p>The Trump administration's attacks on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program are an extension of a fight that right-wing foes have been waging against the program since its inception. When winners of the fund's grants were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-20-billion-grants-mobilize-private-capital-and\">first announced</url> on April 4, 2024, by Vice President Kamala Harris in a visit to North Carolina, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro, whose YouTube channel has more than 7 million subscribers, posted a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7XIjWVQibw\">segment</url> mocking Harris' speaking mannerisms and ridiculing the planned central role of community banks (\"so wildly profitable compared to the big banks,\" he said, sardonically).</p><p>The day before the November election, House Republicans posted a report decrying the Biden-Harris administration's environmental justice grants as a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://energycommerce.house.gov/posts/e-and-c-republican-staff-report-details-cronyism-within-biden-harris-epa-s-multibillion-dollar-environmental-justice-grant-programs-1\">green group giveaway</url>.\" They singled out Power Forward Communities, a new coalition that had been awarded $2 billion from the federal fund for financing home energy efficiency upgrades at scale. The report said the administration \"financially rewarded another organization espousing its same policy views.\"</p><p>On Dec. 3, the right-wing group Project Veritas, which specializes in hidden camera recordings to attack political opponents, posted a video of a young EPA staffer, Brent Efron, apparently captured in a social setting, describing colorfully how the Biden administration was getting grant money out the door before Trump's inauguration. \"It truly feels like we're on the Titanic ... throwing gold bars off the edge,\" he said in the video.</p><p>But Efron's lawyer, Mark Zaid, has said his client was not referring to the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Efron only joined the EPA last July, according to his LinkedIn profile, and was still in graduate school when the grant awards were announced last April.</p><p>Nevertheless, Zeldin has adopted \"gold bars\" as his mantra in a drive to seize the money. He cited the Project Veritas video on Feb. 12 when he first announced he was referring the matter to U.S. Department of Justice investigators. His office again cited the video in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2025-03/epaigrequest030225.pdf\">a March 2 letter</url> to the EPA's Office of Inspector General, the first detailed public accounting of the Trump administration's case against the program.</p><p>It has been a stunning reversal of fortune and elevation in status for Project Veritas, which over the years has gotten a portion of its <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874829-fossil-fuel-industry-and-allies-funding-of-project-veritas#document/p1/a2630004\">funding from fossil fuel industry allies</url>. Project Veritas had been under criminal investigation for paying $40,000 to two Florida residents who had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2024/04/09/aimee-harris-biden-daughter-diary-00151311\">pleaded guilty</url> to stealing the diary of Biden's daughter in an effort to embarrass him.</p><p>Within two weeks of Trump's inauguration, though, the Justice Department announced it would <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/politics/justice-dept-project-veritas-ashley-biden.html\">not bring charges</url> against Project Veritas. And the next week, Zeldin cited the group's covert recording as the basis for the Trump administration's own criminal investigation.</p><p>That probe got off to a rocky start. Denise Cheung, the head of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington, D.C., a 24-year veteran of the department, handed in her resignation after she was ordered to freeze the Citibank accounts and issue subpoenas.\u00a0</p><p>According to her resignation letter, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2025/02/18/read-resignation-letter-denise-cheung/\">made public</url> by The Washington Post, she told Trump administration officials she had no legal authority to order such a freeze and her team concluded the evidence, including the Project Veritas video, did not meet the threshold for opening a grand jury investigation.</p><p>The case was then taken up personally by the Trump-appointed interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, Ed Martin, a longtime conservative activist who called the federal program \"insanity\" and \"total graft\" in <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1849039688251691015\">a post on X</url> in October.</p><p>But a U.S. magistrate judge in D.C. rejected Martin's application for a seizure warrant, and the Justice Department transferred the probe to Florida. \"This chain of events provides abundant reason to believe that the Trump administration is purposefully misusing the tools of law enforcement, and pursuing false allegations of criminal conduct,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-11-Letter-to-DOJ-and-FBI-re-Greenhouse-Gas-Reduction-Fund.pdf\">wrote</url> Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) in one of several queries Democratic senators have<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases-democratic?ID=51219611-4681-4DE8-AFAC-C5C6CEBADA22\"> sent</url> to administration officials.</p><p>A hearing in the lawsuit brought by grantees was originally scheduled for March 11, but the Trump administration asked for a 24-hour delay, which it used to send termination notices to all the grant recipients. The following day, it asked the court to dismiss the case because, among other things, the grants had been terminated and the case was moot.\u00a0</p><p>But the judge did not buy it, saying EPA's unilateral cancellation of the grants meant the grantees were even more within their rights to sue. Even if EPA has valid concerns, Chutkan said it had failed to follow the procedures required by law, including providing recipients with an opportunity to object and challenge a termination.</p><p>But the Trump EPA, in briefs filed last week in anticipation of Wednesday's hearing, made clear its view that the grant recipients have no legal rights to the money. \"Nothing in the Constitution or any statute compels EPA to make these grants to these Plaintiffs,\" the administration's brief said. \"At most, those authorities direct EPA to re-obligate the funds for specified purposes, which EPA has stated it will do.\"</p><p>Lawyers for grant recipient Climate United said the Trump administration's latest filings display \"a remarkable view of Executive power.\" EPA, they said, is arguing that it has \"an unfettered and unreviewable right to cancel grants and claw back funds that were already distributed to recipients,\" not because of any failure or wrongdoing, but due to a change in policy.\u00a0</p><p>Among the people frustrated by the funding cutoff is David Shadburne, CEO of MidWest America Federal Credit Union in Fort Wayne. The credit union, founded in 1936 and with 15 branches in northeast Indiana, had qualified for an $11 million grant under the federal fund. The institution had been working with local charities, contractors and others to publicize the loans and prepare to make the most of this opportunity. One of those charities was Bridge of Grace Compassionate Ministries.</p><p>\"There's a lot of misinformation about how money is just kind of falling from heaven, and there's no rules, controls, constraints, and it's going to organizations that may not even know what they're doing,\" Shadburne said. \"We're not some fly-by-night organization.\"</p><p>MidWest America had gone through an extensive review process with Inclusiv, a New York-based charitable lender founded in 1974 that was set to get $1.87 billion to work with local credit unions to provide loans under the federal program.\u00a0</p><p>Shadburne noted that participants such as his credit union needed to put up double the amount of federal money they were to receive, so in his case this means the $11 million from the government is being blended with $22 million from his credit union to start a revolving loan fund.</p><p>He participated in months of virtual training through the University of New Hampshire and must provide detailed reports on how the money is spent.</p><p>\"This was not done willy-nilly,\" he said.</p><p>The availability of federal money allows the credit union to charge a lower-than-market interest rate for loans under the program. For example, a local resident or business could get a loan to improve insulation and replace windows on a property at an interest rate of about 7 percent as opposed to a typical rate that would be more than 10 percent.</p><p>The borrower saves up to thousands of dollars in interest, and the credit union can give loans to people with lower incomes and lower credit scores than would ordinarily qualify.</p><p>\"In the long term, we believe it's also going to be an economic driver,\" Shadburne said. \"People are going to have to go and buy energy efficient appliances. They're going to buy new windows, doors, insulation. They're going to buy the heat pumps and other things.\"</p><p>And that will be a boost for manufacturers, retailers, contractors, and will save on energy costs for consumers, he said.</p><p>As people pay their loans back, the federal portion goes back into the loan fund to be used again to help others, which is the essence of a revolving loan.</p><p>Some of this kind of work was being done already in Fort Wayne, but the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund was going to allow it to be conducted on a larger scale that would serve many more people and businesses.</p><p>How does Shadburne feel to see these efforts stymied under misleading pretenses?</p><p>\"It's infuriating,\" he said.</p><p>Across the country, charitable organizations and businesses are now in the awkward position of having little or no money to run programs that they had been publicizing.</p><p>\"It's extremely frustrating,\" said Andreas Karelas, executive director of RE-volv in San Francisco, a nonprofit that helps churches, charities, tribal governments and others develop solar power.</p><p>\"The risk is that you're going to scare off potential collaborators that are going to say, 'Wait a minute. Are we ever going to get this?'\" he said. \"You're going to be damaging the reputation of groups like RE-volv and others that are in the space that are unable to deliver on their promises because of this type of malarkey that EPA is causing.\"</p><p>His nonprofit has been in discussions with local groups in 25 states that were taking steps to launch projects using the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. Those groups are now waiting for resolution.</p><p>Grantees have told the judge that they have not been able to make payroll or pay contractors. The Coalition for Green Capital said some participants in its loan program have delayed deploying any of the funds because of uncertainty; one Midwestern financial institution told the group its board had voted not to accept money from the coalition after hearing Zeldin's remarks on the program.</p><p>The Coalition for Green Capital \"will never know how many opportunities it lost as a result of potential partners' concerns that ... funding will be delayed for months or years of litigation,\" said the group's CEO, Richard Kauffman, in <url normalizedValue=\"https://legacy.www.documentcloud.org/documents/25874838-33-28\">a court filing.</url></p><p>In Minnesota, John Vaughn is helping several local and tribal governments as they try to get loans through the federal fund. He is managing director of community development and finance for Fresh Energy, a clean energy advocacy organization based in St. Paul.</p><p>\"There's a lot of people pulling their hair out,\" he said.</p><p>While this is a partisan issue in Washington, with a Republican president seeking to undo a program signed into law by a Democratic president, Vaughn sees no partisanship in the way local leaders discuss the opportunities they could have with the federal money.</p><p>Washington \"almost seems like it's a different world that's disconnected from what I personally experience working in communities,\" he said.</p><p>There are similar sentiments in Appalachia, according to Dana Kuhnline, senior program director for ReImagine Appalachia, a Pennsylvania-based nonprofit that helps local governments and labor organizations with climate-friendly development.</p><p>\"It's really heartbreaking,\" she said of the effects of the funding delays. \"Communities were ready to hit the ground at a sprint.\"</p><p>Efficiency Maine, a nonprofit that makes loans to help people switch to cleaner and cheaper heating systems, has said it will run out of money in one of its loan programs within 12 months unless the federal government releases its funding.</p><p>Homeowners in Maine are more dependent on oil heating than residents in any other state, saddling them with high fuel and maintenance costs as well as pollution. Efficiency Maine had planned to finance 1,243 home conversions from oil to electric heat pumps per year with the federal funds. Such a switch could save the average Maine household $704 per year in heating costs, a 23 percent reduction, while its carbon pollution would fall 67 percent.\u00a0</p><p>This loss of funding will \"disproportionately impact creditworthy small businesses and low- and moderate-income households who face steeper barriers to financing such projects than other customer classes,\" said Michael Stoddard, executive director at Efficiency Maine, in an email.</p><p>The people who agreed to speak about their experiences are the exception. Inside Climate News reached out to dozens of organizations that are part of the program. Amid lawsuits, a criminal probe and vitriol on the program coming from the president himself, most of them declined to comment or did not respond to messages.</p><p>Connecticut Green Bank, the nation's first green lender, said it was hoping to expand its offerings with the infusion of money it was getting from the federal fund as a subcontractor of the Coalition for Green Capital. Connecticut Green Bank officials were working on a plan so tenants, as well as homeowners, could benefit from on-site solar installations. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/extreme-rainfall-brings-catastrophic-flooding-northeast-august-2024\">Catastrophic flooding </url>across Connecticut in August 2024 also has bank officials thinking about how the climate change now evident is also increasing the need for investment.</p><p>\"We have to enable more investment for us to be able to not only decarbonize our energy system ... but also on the other end, in community projects, to increase our resilience,\" said Bryan Garcia, CEO of the Connecticut Green Bank. But the controversy over the federal program \"distracts from the proven results that we've been seeing with the model.</p><p>\"Green banks aren't ideological,\" he added. \"They're very pragmatic tools that are supported by Republicans and Democrats. And our success in Connecticut shows that it's about smart finance and not politics.

This week, he shined a light on $2 billion of the&amp;#8239;$20 billion&amp;#8239;gold bars parked by the Biden-Harris administration at an outside organization to reduce oversight set to be distributed to Stacey Abram's Power Forward Communities. It was also revealed that major beneficiaries of the Democrats' Green New Deal include former employers and major donors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Administrator Zeldin told the Free Beacon:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I made a commitment to members of Congress and to the American people to be a good steward of tax dollars and I've wasted no time in keeping my word. When we learned about the Biden Administration's scheme to quickly park $20 billion outside the agency, we suspected that some organizations were created out of thin air just to take advantage of this.</p><p>\"As we continue to learn more about where some of this money went, it is even more apparent how far-reaching and widely accepted this waste and abuse has been. It's extremely concerning that an organization that reported just $100 in revenue in 2023, was chosen to receive $2 billion. That's 20 million times the organization's reported revenue.</p><p>\"President Trump was elected with a mandate from the American people to stop the fraud and abuse by leaders who irresponsibly shoveled boat loads of cash to far-left, activist groups in the name of environmental justice and climate equity, instead of serving the American people. Those days are over.\"</p><p>Here's a breakdown of the coverage:</p><p>Free Beacon Breaking Report: DOGE Finds $2 Billion in Taxpayer Funds Earmarked for Stacey Abrams-Linked Group</p><p>\"Power Forward Communities' grant was one of just eight Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants that the EPA doled out in April 2024 and that, altogether, totaled $20 billion. EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced on Feb. 13 that his staff and Department of Government Efficiency officials discovered that the Biden administration parked that same $20 billion at an outside financial institution before leaving office, limiting the federal government's oversight of the program.</p><p>\"The revelation that Power Forward Communities is among the beneficiaries of the funds Zeldin's team located raises ethics questions about how the Biden administration selected recipients of such massive grants and whether it played favorites when doling those grants out. Abrams was a vocal proponent of the Biden administration's green energy agenda and campaigned for former vice president Kamala Harris.</p><p>\"It also appears to validate concerns expressed for years by Republicans that Biden administration allies would prop up organizations that were specifically designed to receive federal funding under programs like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created to operate as a 'green bank' by Democrats' behemoth Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\"</p><p>Free Beacon Breaking Follow-up: 'Serious Conflicts of Interest': Biden EPA Official Oversaw $5B Grant to His Former Employer</p><p>\"The senior Biden administration official tasked with directing former President Joe Biden's $27 billion climate grant program oversaw a $5 billion grant from the program to his former employer, the Washington Free Beacon has learned.</p><p>\"Jahi Wise joined the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2022 as the founding director of the newly created Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, or GGRF, according to his LinkedIn profile. In April 2024, while Wise served in that role, the EPA announced that it would award GGRF grants totaling $20 billion to just eight nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, a Washington, D.C.-based group that received $5 billion as part of the announcement and where Wise previously worked as the director of policy. There is no indication that Wise recused himself from that process.</p><p>.</p><p>\"'The story of the Biden EPA's gold bars never stops,' EPA administrator Lee Zeldin told the Free Beacon. 'The waste and abuse was so deeply interwoven in the last administration that not only did the leaders who oversaw this not bat an eye at billions of your taxpayer dollars going towards partisan pet projects, but serious conflicts of interest were ignored. That should have raised red flags.'\"</p><p>Blaze Media: Biden admin gave $2 billion to Stacey Abrams-linked climate outfit as part of 'gold bar' scheme: Zeldin</p><p>\"Zeldin has raised questions about one of the intended recipients of the funds - a new nonprofit linked to a staunch ally of the former president and vice president, failed gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams.</p><p>\"The Abrams-linked nonprofit, Power Forward Communities, was founded in 2023 by several groups, including Rewiring America, a climate alarmist outfit focused on electrifying American homes and businesses. Abrams serves as senior counsel at Rewiring America, and she made clear online in October 2023 that she was an engaged player in Rewiring America and the PFC 'coalition.'</p><p>\"The Beacon indicated that PFC also counts among its partners at least two leftist nonprofits founded by Abrams, the Tides Center-sponsored Southern Advancement Project and Fair Count.\"</p><p>Breitbart: 'Extremely Concerning': EPA Uncovers $2 Billion Set Aside for Climate Group Linked to Stacey Abrams</p><p>\"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has uncovered $2 billion set aside for a climate group linked to Democrat Stacey Abrams -Power Forward Communities - despite the fact the organization reported just $100 in total revenue, raising eyebrows.</p><p>\"'As we continue to learn more about where some of this money went, it is even more apparent how far-reaching and widely accepted this waste and abuse has been,' Zeldin said, emphasizing how 'extremely concerning' it is that 'an organization that reported just $100 in revenue in 2023 was chosen to receive $2 billion. That's 20 million times the organization's reported revenue.'</p><p>\"The news comes on the heels of Zeldin announcing that they discovered the 'gold bars off the Titanic' that the Biden administration tried to waste before President Donald Trump assumed office. On February 12, he announced the EPA found the 'gold bars.'\"</p><p>Newsmax: Zeldin: EPA Paid Over $2B to NGOs Before Inauguration</p><p>\"EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin on Wednesday said he's discovered that the agency made over $2 billion in payments that went to non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the weeks leading up to President Donald Trump's inauguration last month.</p><p>\"'I haven't had a chance to talk about this one publicly because I just read this about an hour ago,' Zeldin said in an interview with Andrew Wilkow. 'I was reading through one of the grant agreements. On page one, it was telling this entity that they have 21 days to distribute $2.29 billion. But that's not the worst part. On page six, it gives the recipient 90 days to complete their 'How To Develop a Budget' training.'\"</p><p>.</p><p>\"'This is something that by design took great measure to reduce significantly oversight and accountability. Many of those sub-grantees are also pass-throughs,' said Zeldin. 'They were amending the account control agreements right up to the inauguration. I reviewed three amended account control agreements [dated] Jan. 13.'\"</p><p>New York Post: Zeldin EPA discovers $2 billion Biden admin stashed away for Stacey Abrams-linked climate group&amp;#8239;</p><p>\"'It's extremely concerning that an organization that reported just $100 in revenue in 2023 was chosen to receive $2 billion,' EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin told the outlet, referring to Power Forward Communities' latest tax filings.

This week, he shined a light on $2 billion of the $20 billion gold bars parked by the Biden-Harris administration at an outside organization to reduce oversight set to be distributed to Stacey Abram's Power Forward Communities. It was also revealed that major beneficiaries of the Democrats' Green New Deal include former employers and major donors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Administrator Zeldin told the Free Beacon:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I made a commitment to members of Congress and to the American people to be a good steward of tax dollars and I've wasted no time in keeping my word.

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin announced on Feb. 13 that his staff and Department of Government Efficiency officials discovered that the Biden administration parked that same $20 billion at an outside financial institution before leaving office, limiting the federal government's oversight of the program.</p><p>\"The revelation that Power Forward Communities is among the beneficiaries of the funds Zeldin's team located raises ethics questions about how the Biden administration selected recipients of such massive grants and whether it played favorites when doling those grants out. Abrams was a vocal proponent of the Biden administration's green energy agenda and campaigned for former vice president Kamala Harris.</p><p>\"It also appears to validate concerns expressed for years by Republicans that Biden administration allies would prop up organizations that were specifically designed to receive federal funding under programs like the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which was created to operate as a 'green bank' by Democrats' behemoth Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.\"</p><p>Free Beacon Breaking Follow-up: 'Serious Conflicts of Interest': Biden EPA Official Oversaw $5B Grant to His Former Employer</p><p>\"The senior Biden administration official tasked with directing former President Joe Biden's $27 billion climate grant program oversaw a $5 billion grant from the program to his former employer, the Washington Free Beacon has learned.</p><p>\"Jahi Wise joined the Environmental Protection Agency in December 2022 as the founding director of the newly created Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, or GGRF, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Harris campaigns on permitting reform.</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By Adam Aton Vice President Kamala Harris is embracing a surprising election strategy: elevating the technocratic subject of permitting reform into a pillar of her presidential campaign. The Harris campaign last Thursday released an economic policy blueprint that calls for a double-barreled approach to hastening the renewable energy transition: more federal subsidies, combined with easier permitting rules. That follows a major speech Harris gave Wednesday spotlighting the role federal permitting plays in areas such as housing supply and manufacturing investment. It's there she promised to \"cut red tape and get things moving faster.\" </p><p>\"The simple truth is, in America, it takes too long and it costs too much to build,\" Harris said at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh. \"Whether it's a new housing development, a new factory, or a new bridge, projects take too long to go from concept to reality. It happens in blue states, it happens in red states, and it's a national problem.\" The vice president said she would work with business executives and community leaders to shorten the permitting process. That marks another turn toward the center for Harris. She already has disavowed her 2019 call for a fracking ban and in general has distanced herself from the other climate policies of her previous presidential campaign, such as banning offshore drilling and single-use plastics. Permitting reform has historically alarmed environmentalists, including environmental justice advocates who see the permitting process - and the litigation it can spawn - as one of their best defenses against heaping more burdens onto communities that already experience high cumulative impacts of pollution and climate change. Harris' turn on the issue illustrates how much the political and economic landscape has changed since her last campaign, when the then-senator from California instead sought to add new layers to federal permitting. In 2020, after circulating draft text for about a year, Harris and New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York sponsored the \"Climate Equity Act .\" Aimed at elevating frontline communities in the permitting process, the bill would have required federal regulations and investments to undergo additional climate and environmental justice analyses, including expanded opportunities for public comment and judicial review. Harris cast the \"Climate Equity Act\" as a step toward bringing \"a Green New Deal closer to reality.\" \"It is not enough to simply cut emissions and end our reliance on fossil fuels,\" Harris said at the time . \"We must ensure that communities already contending with unsafe drinking water, toxic air, and lack of economic opportunity are not left behind.\" On Wednesday, Harris instead framed federal permitting as holding back the U.S. economy. \"China is not moving slowly. They're not. And we can't afford to, either,\" the vice president said. \"The Empire State Building, you know how long it took to build that? One year. The Pentagon, you know how long that took? 16 months.\" \"No one can tell me we can't build quickly in our country. I've got empirical evidence,\" she said. The Harris campaign did not respond to questions about whether the vice president still supports the \"Climate Equity Act,\" which did not advance and has not been reintroduced during the last two Congresses. Her new policy blueprint, though, notes that the Biden administration's Inflation Reduction Act included a funding boost to speed up the permitting process. It also says Harris \"helped finalize\" a rule aimed at streamlining federal permits , and that she \"pushed to increase the number of projects that qualify for the simplest form of environmental review so that agencies can expedite projects that will lower costs without harming the environment.\" Harris' turnabout on permitting echoes some other greens who are softening their positions now that the Inflation Reduction Act has spurred a rush of clean energy investment. With federal tax credits flowing to solar and wind projects, the permitting process has emerged as a bottleneck to the energy transition. Lena Moffitt, executive director of the climate policy and advocacy group Evergreen Action, hailed Harris' economic plan as a boon for clean energy deployment, especially in the manufacturing sector. \"Her commonsense efforts to cut red tape across multiple sectors are vital to accelerating the expansion of clean, affordable energy and lower household energy costs while creating millions of good-paying union jobs,\" Moffitt said in a statement. Permitting reform remains fraught for climate hawks. Two recent efforts to relax permitting rules - a bipartisan Senate bill spearheaded in part by West Virginia independent Sen. Joe Manchin, and a recently passed bill to exempt some semiconductor plants from environmental reviews - have split Democrats as well as their allies. But when it comes to Harris' permitting reforms, even the most progressive groups have given her cover. One reason is her plan doesn't spell out exactly what permitting changes she would seek. The other is that they think those fights can wait until after the election. \"It's really hard to figure out exactly how to dramatically expand renewable energy,\" said Saul Levin, campaigns and political director for the Green New Deal Network. But, he added, there's no comparison between Harris' proposals and those of former President Donald Trump. \"Are we going to allow Project 2025 to move forward, leading to the deaths and suffering of millions of people?\" he asked, referring to the conservative blueprint for a second Trump administration. \"Our plan is to win, and then have a really robust discussion and push her as much as possible.\" That view was echoed by the Sunrise Movement, which praised Harris' economic proposals as a \"big step towards lowering prices, expanding green energy production, and creating green, union jobs. \"It importantly recognizes that good climate policy must be woven into every policy, from housing to education to energy,\" said Stevie O'Hanlon, the group's communications director. \"Let's be clear: This plan isn't as bold as science demands,\" O'Hanlon said. \"We have just six years to act to ensure a livable planet for our generation. We need more. On Nov. 6, we'll be there demanding that. But, in the meantime, we will focus on defeating Donald Trump.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CLIWRE-00000192303dd614a3ba397dd7a40001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CLIWRE2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D93-9591-F0YC-P359-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388351</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1063\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Politico LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ClimateWire</publicationName><volume>Vol. 10</volume><issueNumber>No. 9</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 30, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
