In the final quarter of 2019, GDP plunged at an annualised rate of 6.3 per cent. Now, many economists are predicting a full-blown recession as coronavirus racks the country.</p><p>Policy makers are nervously awaiting a glut of economic data due out tomorrow, including retail sales and industrial production figures, which will give a clearer indication of where the world's third-biggest economy is headed.</p><p>So what went wrong in the final three months of 2019? The consensus explanation is that an increase in sales tax from eight per cent to 10 per cent badly knocked the economy.</p><p>Ministers also blamed the destructive typhoon Hagibis, which hit in October and which insurers have estimated cost Japan's economy more than $10bn (\u00a37.7bn) of damage.</p><p>The official figures showed that consumption slumped at an annualised rate of 11 per cent in the final quarter. On top of this, business investment tumbled 14 per cent.</p><p>Japane Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has since faced difficult questions, having vowed to avoid a big economic hit by increasing public spending.</p><p>Indeed, the entire \"Abenomics\" project of the last seven years - loose monetary policy, flexible fiscal policy, and reforms aimed at driving up investment - has looked increasingly fruitless to many.</p><p>Neil McKinnon, global macro strategist at Russian bank VTB, said Japan has failed utterly to boost growth.</p><p>\"The Bank of Japan's quantitative easing [bondbuying] programme has been three times the size of the US Federal Reserve's programmes, but Japanese real GDP growth has never been able to sustain two per cent,\" he said.</p><p>Whereas once the US saw the country as an economic rival by the US, nations now fear so-called Japanification: Ultra-low interest rates, low growth and low inflation.</p><p>Analysts at Japanese bank Nomura said that things are set to stay bad for Japan's economy, as a coronavirus-induced lockdown in China and other countries dents tourism and disrupts global supply chains.</p><p>And now senior members of the International Olympic Committee have given the country until May to make a call on whether this year's Olympic Games can go ahead in Tokyo, posing a further threat to Japan's economic wellbeing.</p><p>Nomura's base case is that Japan's real GDP will fall 0.5 per cent in 2020. Should coronavirus worsen, it could fall as much as 1.1 per cent.</p><p>Japan announced further economic stimulus at the end of last year, but Freya Beamish, chief Asia economist at consultancy Pantheon Macroeconomics, said this \"won't really kick in until the second quarter\". \"We continue to expect a contraction in the first quarter,\" she said, \"albeit less severe than we thought, before the extent of the fourth-quarter plunge was revealed, posing a more favourable base.\" Two quarters of falling output would put the economy in technical recession.</p><p>The consensus estimates for tomorrow's data is that retail sales fell 2.4 per cent month on month in January while industrial production rose just 0.2 per cent.</p><p>Depending on the direction coronavirus takes, the data could be the start of a long year for the Japanese economy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Shinzo Abe faces a hard sell as the economy worsens</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-157835360</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y96-F1W1-JCBW-N271-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"517\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

Domestic consumption should recover as the impact of the higher consumption tax abates,\" he said.</p><p>\"In addition, with the Tokyo Olympics just a few months away, we will undoubtedly see a significant positive economic impact of the Games for the Japanese economy.\"</p><p>Japan's government is to allocate JPY15.3 billion to fight the economic impact of the virus, including measures to enhance airport inspections and testing capacity.</p><p>By Miwa SUZUKI</p><p>source: AFP</p><p>Copyright 2020 Alliance News Limited.

Unless it is quickly decided to put the game back several months, we could be in for a long wait.</p><p>                     What are the options?                   </p><p>There are no remaining available dates inside current international windows this year. That means any rearranged game will have to be played either on a weekend where players' clubs are also in action or during scheduled rest periods. Playing a Test outside the international window usually requires the cooperation of affected clubs, although Ireland and Italy have control over most of their players' provincial teams. The next rest weekend, meanwhile, is not until June 27/28, a week before both countries play the first match of their summer tours.</p><p>One possibility could be the weekend of the Champions Cup semi-finals, on May 2 and 3, if Leinster lose to Saracens and do not qualify, as both Irish and Italian players would be free to play. </p><p>                     Are tickets for the postponed fixture still valid?                   </p><p>Yes. And anyone unable to make the rearranged game is expected to be able to claim a full refund. Although people who have booked plane or rail tickets and hotel rooms are unlikely to be so fortunate.</p><p>                     What's the latest on Italy v England?                   </p><p>The Government plans to discuss whether to recommend postponing the game. No decision by either the UK or Italian authorities is expected until next week at the earliest but Italy were yesterday planning to prepare for the game as normal, with their rugby federation hopeful it would go ahead.</p><p>                     And if it doesn't?                   </p><p>More chaos. Playing one Italy game in during a rest weekend would be difficult enough. Two would be a major test and raise serious questions about player welfare. England do have an Autumn Test scheduled for November 21/22 for which they currently have no opponent but that is at Twickenham and playing Italy in Rome instead would cost the Rugby Football Union millions. Premiership clubs last night appeared willing to release England players to play the fixture earlier than that if necessary.</p><p>                     Would cancelled matches definitely need to be played?                   </p><p>If France beat Scotland and Ireland in their remaining two games, they will win the Grand Slam and render any outstanding fixtures much less relevant. Three World Cup group games were never played last year due to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/customer/subscribe/sport/?icid=premium-sport_editorial_inarticlelink_inarticle_newspaper-of-the-year\">Super Typhoon Hagibis</url>, with draws awarded instead. But there are potentially-vital ranking points on the line ahead of November's 2023 World Cup draw, while England and Ireland would still be battling for second or third place - and the resulting prize money - even if France do complete a clean sweep.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-60617384</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y98-Y041-JCJY-G54Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>8:23 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 26, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But that's just been my focus. I'm not thinking about anything else other than going over to France and playing rugby.</p><p>\"I'm not worried about it not going ahead. If you do that, then you won't prepare properly.</p><p>\"I would be pretty upset if we don't play. I want to play for my country, so I'd be pretty devastated on a personal level.</p><p>\"But again, if it's not safe to play, it's not safe, and if I have to go back to Gloucester and I'm not allowed to come back up if the game's the following week, that's out of my hands.</p><p>\"We've just got to crack on and focus on the week, not let that be a distraction.\"</p><p>There is a similar vibe to the week before Scotland's final game of the last World Cup against Japan. Then, Typhoon Hagibis was blowing through Tokyo and the crucial contest in</p><p>Yokohama was in doubt right up until the morning of the game.</p><p>\"Yeah, I suppose it was the same when we played Japan,\" recalled Harris. \"I was still preparing and focusing on my role in that game then as well. That was bizarre because it was really torrential the day before the game. Then, on the day of the game, the sun was shining.\"</p><p>In Paris Scotland are attempting to knock off the third of their long disappointments on away trips in successive games.</p><p>Wales fell at Llanelli for the first time since 2002, England were beaten at Twickenham for the first time since 1983, and now there's Paris, where the Scots last won in 1999.</p><p>\"It's the confidence and belief you take from those results,\" said Harris \"You think to yourself: 'We can do this.'</p><p>\"We all still believe we can win the Championship.</p><p>\"We're obviously not focusing too far ahead.</p><p>\"But if we can beat France, we've then got two home games to come. So it's a good opportunity for us.\"</p><p>France will be without 11 players due to Covid-19 on Sunday if it goes ahead. Key men like Antoine Dupont and captain Charles Ollivon will be missed, but those coming in are not unknown to the Scots, says Harris.</p><p>\"France have a defensive system, an attacking structure and a style of play,\" he pointed out.</p><p>\"So we just look at that and how we deal with their threats and the opportunities that are there for us.</p><p>\"They're not going to be unknown players - this is international rugby. And we're not going to overdo it by looking too much at individuals.</p><p>\"But we know their style of play and that's what we're going to focus on.\"</p><p>There were no further positive tests among the French camp yesterday, leaving them with 11 players and four members of the coaching staff affected by outbreak.</p><p>None of the players who tested positive will be available on Sunday if the game is played, even if some will have completed the isolation period.</p><p>Nonetheless France's training schedule has been badly disrupted. The Six Nations' testing oversight group is to meet on Wednesday night to decide if Sunday's match should be postponed.</p><p>Their statement that the match should be rescheduled as soon as possible - probably next week - brought a strident response from Scottish Rugby.</p><p>The Scots stand to lose as many as 11 English-based players as next week falls outwith international player release protocols.</p><p>In the meantime Scottish Rugby confirmed the two remaining home games in the championship against Ireland (March 14) and Italy (March 20) will be played behind closed doors.</p><p>This follows the announcement from the Scottish Government of a return to the tier system against Covid-19 in April.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CONFIDENT: Chris Harris says the only thing on his mind is going to France to play rugby.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">COURIE-167270741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:622V-55J1-DYTY-C2XS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473433</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 DC Thomson Co Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11981\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 24, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>Business &amp;

Cirium pointed out that ANA ranked second despite contending with disruption caused by Typhoon Hagibis in the autumn.</p><p>Though no UK airline made it into the ranking, a number of European operators did, with Alitalia, the Italian flag carrier, highest in sixth.</p><p>Bowen said: \"Achieving world-class customer satisfaction and industry-leading product differentiation is about more than just competitively priced tickets and flight availability. When choosing who to fly with, savvy travellers also now consider airline punctuality and operational reliability.\" </p><p>                     Who is the best at time-keeping in Europe?                   </p><p>None of UK's major airlines - British Airways or easyJet, for example - made it into the regional ranking.</p><p>Aeroflot took the crown once again, while S7 Airlines, another Russian carrier, came second, with Iberia, the Spanish airline, in third.</p><p>                     How do UK airlines rank?                   </p><p>Cirium included an additional ranking for the UK, given none of the carriers made the cut for the main report. </p><p>Virgin Atlantic rose to the top, registering a score of 78.2 per cent. The score would have placed it 10th in the European ranking, but the airline does not meet the criteria to be included in the category. </p><p>British Airways, however, would fall short, with a score of 77 per cent. Ryanair, meanwhile, placed third in the UK, with 76.8 per cent of its flights on time. </p><p>                     Which are the world's most punctual airports?                   </p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, given the success of the Russian airlines, Moscow's Sheremetyevo International was ranked as the airport with the best punctuality in the world; 95 per cent of its flights departed on time. The only other European airport to make the top 20 was Oslo Airport Gardermoen, where 83.6 per cent of its 2019 flights departed on time. </p><p>In second place was Guangzhou Baiyun International, a place ahead of Shanghai Pudong International.</p><p>                     Don't airlines exaggerate flight time to improve their on-time performance?                   </p><p>\"Schedule padding\" is one of the worst-kept secrets in air travel. Airlines are under increasing pressure to improve their OTP so give themselves plenty of wiggle room when allotting flight times. That's why, despite advances in technology, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/Are-airlines-exaggerating-flight-times-so-theyre-never-late/\">it takes longer to fly from A to B than it once did</url>. </p><p>Take, for example, the short hop from London Heathrow to Edinburgh. Twenty years ago, according to previous research by OAG, every flight heading north was allotted a flight time of 75 minutes or less. These days a flight time of 90, or even 100 minutes, isn't uncommon.</p><p>For the short hop from Madrid to Barcelona, most airlines quoted a flight time of one hour back in 2000. Now 75 minutes is the norm.</p><p>                     Inspiration for your inbox                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/Are-airlines-exaggerating-flight-times-so-theyre-never-late/\">Sign up to Telegraph Travel's new weekly newsletter</url> for the latest features, advice, competitions, exclusive deals and comment. </p><p>You can also follow us on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/Are-airlines-exaggerating-flight-times-so-theyre-never-late/\">Twitter</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/Are-airlines-exaggerating-flight-times-so-theyre-never-late/\">Facebook</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travel-truths/Are-airlines-exaggerating-flight-times-so-theyre-never-late/\">Instagram</url>. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-59094015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWJ-1R11-JCJY-G1NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"607\"/><timeReceived>4:40 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 2, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

There are also escalating doubts over England's trip to Italy amid concerns the tournament may not be completed for the first time in almost 50 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Rugby Football Union is in talks with the government over England's match in Rome on 14 March - as well as the Six Nations organisers and the authorities in Italy, where the death toll from the coronavirus has reached double figures. With five Serie A football matches taking place behind closed doors this weekend there remains the possibility England's match in Rome will be played in an empty stadium.</p><p>The Italian federation has said its government will decide whether the England match on the final weekend of the tournament goes ahead. The Six Nations organisers said on Wednesday that all matches other than Ireland v Italy are scheduled to go ahead but will continue to monitor the situation \"very closely\".</p><p>The health secretary, Matt Hancock, told the House of Commons he would be discussing the problem with the department for digital, culture, media and sport. Around 20,000 England supporters are expected to attend the match in Rome.</p><p>England's women's and under-20s teams are also due to play Italy on the same weekend in the northern part of the country where 11 towns have been placed in lockdown.</p><p>On Wednesday the Irish Rugby Football Union chief executive, Philip Browne, confirmed Ireland's match against Italy on 7 March in Dublin had been postponed after an emergency meeting with Ireland's minister for health, Simon Harris.</p><p>The IRFU is in discussions with the Six Nations organisers over rescheduling the game, as well as the women's and under-20s fixtures on the same weekend, but doubts have been raised over whether it will take place at all.</p><p>\"We will immediately begin to work with our Six Nations partners to look at the possibility of rescheduling those matches,\" Browne said. \"I would hope to have an update in the coming days.\" Asked if they would be rescheduled rather than cancelled, he said: \"That's the aim if we can do it.\"</p><p>The IRFU has said it will provide ticket holders with new tickets for the rescheduled matches or with a refund if they are not able to attend. Rescheduling the men's fixture is likely to prove difficult because there appears to be no room in the rugby calendar this season and no sign of the coronavirus relenting any time soon. In 2001 the outbreak of foot and mouth disease caused similar chaos with one match postponed until September and two taking place in October. The last time the tournament was not completed was 1972 because of the Troubles in Ireland.</p><p>If England's match against Italy is called off and rescheduled outside an international Test window it is understood there is a provision within the Professional Game Agreement between the RFU and Premiership Rugby that ensures Eddie Jones has access to players. No such agreement exists with Italy.</p><p>All countries will be keen to have their games played with world ranking points all the more important this year because the 2023 World Cup draw takes place after the November internationals.</p><p>When three games were cancelled during the World Cup last year because of Typhoon Hagibis, World Rugby awarded a 0-0 draw. Should that be the case for Ireland v Italy, Ireland would lose a full ranking point.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-60617560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y98-Y051-JCJY-G02Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"572\"/><timeReceived>8:39 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

After the coronavirus outbreak caused their final game against Italy in Rome next week to be postponed, they will wind things up with Wales' visit to Twickenham. Off-field events will undoubtedly have proved unsettling, but England have previous experience of dealing with such unexpected situations following Typhoon Hagibis forcing their World Cup pool game against France last October to be scrapped. England went on to reach the final and this weekend will again be about staying concentrated on the job.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">England fired up after Cardiff defeat</p><p>England head coach Eddie Jones feels that his players ``owe them one'' following a painful Six Nations loss in Wales just over 12 months ago. England, chasing a third successive win in the tournament, led 10-3 at half-time as Tom Curry scored a try that reflected their dominance. But Wales were a different animal after the break as they shunted England on to the back foot for long periods before lock Cory Hill's touchdown and a late Josh Adams score confirmed an outstanding 21-13 victory. Wales went on to win the Grand Slam, while England could only lick their wounds. The pain has not gone away.</p><p>The odds are stacked against Wales</p><p>Wales head to English rugby headquarters striving to avoid a third successive defeat in one Six Nations campaign for the first time since 2007. Losses to Ireland and France derailed hopes of a successful title defence following last season's Grand Slam, and life is not about to get any easier. Wales' Six Nations record against England in Cardiff reads won five, lost five but at Twickenham, they have suffered eight defeats from 10 visits. Wales' last success in the tournament there came eight years ago, and most bookmakers rate them a distant 9/2 shot for victory this weekend.</p><p>England farewell for Steve Borthwick</p><p>After England's Italian job was put on hold it unexpectedly brought forward Borthwick's departure from the Red Rose set-up. The 40-year-old former England captain will be Leicester Tigers' head coach from this summer, ending his association with the national team. He won 57 caps as a player and has been part of Jones' coaching staff since the Australian was appointed more than four years ago, working as forwards specialist and then skills coach for over 50 Tests. Saturday's game will be the last for Borthwick in an England tracksuit at Twickenham, while England lock George Kruis is also set to bow out as he ponders a prospective new playing career in Japan.</p><p>Are Wales asking a lot of Liam Williams and Josh Navidi?</p><p>Yes, is the simple answer. Their quality and experience is unquestioned, with Williams one of world rugby's most exciting backs and number eight Navidi a breakdown specialist whose physical presence is always felt by opponents. Williams, though, has not played since Wales' World Cup quarter-final victory over France on October 20, suffering an ankle injury during training just a few days later, while Navidi's last competitive outing came eight weeks ago before a hamstring problem laid him low. Wales head coach Wayne Pivac feels that both players have enough training volume in them, declaring they are ``ready to go.'' Welsh fans will hope he is right. end</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PANSN-HSA9490</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PANSN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-3GK1-JCBD-Y01W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">326104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"585\"/><timeReceived>11:41 AM BST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Press Association Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PA Newswire: Sport News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48480\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

All this before we mention the names of Israel Folau and Rob Howley or the words \"Championship cuts\".</p><p>It goes without saying, at remarkable times like these, rugby and sport are trifling matters. This will not be the last sport affected by the coronavirus \u00adoutbreak. Public health comes first.</p><p>If there are any surprises, it is that there are still only two games called off and that we have had to wait as long as today for the expected announcement that England's game in Italy, the worst affected country in Europe, is off.</p><p>From the moment when the Irish \u00adgovernment said last week that their game against Italy in Dublin this \u00adSaturday should not go ahead, the \u00adwriting has seemed on the wall. How could Italians not be allowed to watch a game in Ireland, then English people pile into Rome and the close confines of Stadio Olimpico?</p><p>After meeting in Paris on Monday, rugby authorities have been simply waiting for someone more senior - a government, basically - to tell them to call games off. That arrived yesterday when the Italian government ordered that all sports events in the country would have to take place behind closed doors until April 3.</p><p>That left the tournament organisers with one simple decision: accept going behind closed doors, or postpone.</p><p>The Six Nations could surely not be played behind closed doors. It is a fan's event, about atmosphere, colour and rather more than rugby.</p><p>But more pressing, naturally, for the authorities are commercial imperatives: Italy need the gate receipts. An England visit is a biennial boon for any union, with thousands of fans pouring into the city, most of them with considerable appetite for the local delicacies.</p><p>In many ways, now the challenge really begins. Rugby is being sucked so dry by the greed of its administrators that rescheduling these games, which are important to fans, appears a \u00addesperately difficult task even without factoring in the fact that coronavirus may wreak havoc for months yet.</p><p>It could be that we have to wait as long as we did in 2001, when three games took place in the autumn due to foot-and-mouth disease, with England \u00adfailing to pull off a Grand Slam after the delay. One senses organisers would rather like France to get their two games done this month and pull off their first Grand Slam for a decade, so at least the important bits are decided.</p><p>Even if we accept it is necessary to postpone these games right now, it is unsatisfactory to have to play games in October. Even by then, teams will have changed due to form and fitness, while coaching staffs will be different, too. For instance, Steve Borthwick will be \u00adrunning Leicester, rather than involved with England's forwards.</p><p>Spare a thought most, for the Italian titan Sergio Parisse. His 143rd and final Test was due to be last October in Japan, only for Italy's game against New \u00adZealand to be cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. So Italy decided he could be involved against England, for a swansong at home.</p><p>Surely they cannot now take the third time lucky approach? For years, Parisse seemed the unluckiest player in the Championship, a lone brilliant player in a poor team. Even his retirement is proving unfortunate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ESTONL-60846941</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ESTONL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBY-HM31-JCJY-G4WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411938</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"587\"/><timeReceived>12:43 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Evening Standard Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>standard.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"27119\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

But on Sunday France and England face each other at the Stade de France on the opening weekend of a Six Nations that promises fresh faces and change - for no one more than Les Bleus.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former assistant Fabien Galthie has been promoted to head coach, replacing Jacques Brunel, and has made his mark by naming 19 uncapped players in the 42-man squad that assembled in Paris last weekend.</p><p>Among the 50-year-old's radical overhaul are seven players with fewer than five caps and seven of the Junior World Cup-winning side, with the emphasis firmly on youth.</p><p>France are widely fancied to challenge for a first Six Nations title in a decade, but Galthie's selection suggests he is looking beyond the next two months and has an eye on the 2023 World Cup, which they will host.</p><p>There is previous in France for this kind of upheaval. Former head coach Marc Lievremont capped a record 13 new players at the 2008 Six Nations. They would finish third twice before winning the Grand Slam in 2010.</p><p>The next year they reached the World Cup final, losing 8-7 to hosts New Zealand, but could and should have won. That tournament is also remembered for players revolting against Lievremont, but the idea of overhauling the squad with an eye for the future is one that Galthie appears to have adopted.</p><p>However, the French rugby fraternity is not renowned for patience and, in fairness, it is impossible not to be excited by the talent coming through across the Channel. It is symptomatic of French rugby's change in approach as Top14 sides increasingly recognise the importance of producing and nurturing talent rather than throwing money at global stars.</p><p>NEW ERA This season they have three sides in the quarter-finals of both the Champions Cup and Challenge Cup. And there were promising signs in Japan as Les Bleus came within touching distance of the semi-finals, only for a Sebastien Vahaamahina red card to sabotage their efforts against Wales.</p><p>At half-back, the flourishing partnership between Antoine Dupont, 23, and Romain Ntamack, 21, is so exciting that Galthie has left out Maxime Machenaud and Camille Lopez. They also have excellent runners outside of them in Virimi Vakatawa and Teddy Thomas, who have produced outstanding rugby for Racing 92 in Europe this term, as well as the versatile Damian Penaud, 23, who was one of France's stand-out backs last year.</p><p>Up front they are also well stocked and flankers Charles Ollivon, 26, and Gregory Alldritt, 22, will be a great match for England's Sam Underhill and Tom Curry. However, France will sorely miss Camille Chat, 24, who is perhaps the pick of their pack. He was set to replace Guilhem Guirado in the No2 jersey but has been ruled out by injury. It means more responsibility will fall on the shoulders of 19-stone prop Jefferson Poirot, who at 27 is one of the senior squad members.</p><p>Then there are the backroom changes, with former Wales coach Shaun Edwards and ex-France captain Rafa Ibanez coming in to support Galthie. Edwards in particular will give England reason for concern, with the 53-year-old looking to impart the knowledge that yielded Wales so much success over the last 12 years. His first outing with Wales in 2008 was a 26-19 win at Twickenham. His no-nonsense approach may be just what the mercurial French need as they embark on a new era.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CITYAM-157043243</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CITYAM2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3N-68X1-DYTY-C2Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">372494</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 City A.M.

Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said yesterday he would be discussing with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport whether the game should go ahead and that the UK would \"join up with the [Irish] Republic\" when making a decision on whether future Six Nations games should be played.</p><p>\"Our goal is to minimise social disruption, of which this is an important part for any rugby fan, subject to keeping the public safe,\" said Hancock.</p><p>Public Health England is advising those returning from northern Italy to self-isolate if they have symptoms of the virus. If it determines that England's game should not go ahead, the RFU would be duty-bound to agree.</p><p>Rome is not affected by the outbreak and the Six Nations issued a statement saying that \"all other matches are currently scheduled to go ahead as normal\".</p><p>However, it added that it would continue to monitor the situation \"very closely with all unions and the respective government authorities and health organisations\". The uncertainty has left the 20,000 England supporters who are expected to travel to Rome in limbo, with questions rising about travel insurance claims and tickets.</p><p>A spokesman for the Italian Rugby Federation, however, said it planned to prepare for the game as normal and, at this stage, expected it to go ahead.</p><p>The majority of the Italian squad play for Treviso and Zebre, both based in northern Italy, but it is understood that none have entered the locked-down area.</p><p>\"From March 2, everything should be completely back to normality,\" the spokesman added. The Six Nations board is to meet on Monday to discuss options for rescheduling Ireland's match against Italy. Given the season has already been squeezed by the World Cup, completing the championship will be difficult.</p><p>One possibility could be the weekend of the Champions Cup semi-finals, on May 2-3, if Leinster do not qualify as Irish and Italian players would be free to play.</p><p>The IRFU said it would be providing ticket holders with tickets for the rescheduled games or a refund.</p><p>If England's match is also postponed, the Premiership clubs have indicated they would make their players available if the game was called off for a reason outside of the RFU's control.</p><p>Jamie George, the England hooker, said that the experience of dealing with Typhoon Hagibis during the World Cup in Japan would enable the team to cope with what-ever disruption coronavirus might cause to the championship.</p><p>England's final pool game against France was one of four to be cancelled at short notice as the supertyphoon closed in on Honshu, but Eddie Jones, the England head coach, made light of the upheaval by relocating his squad to Miyazaki to prepare for their quarter-final against Australia, which they won.</p><p>As a 25-man squad gathered in Oxford for a three-day training camp, George insisted that their focus had not been affected by the events surrounding the coronavirus. \"I've learnt in sport that you can't listen to rumours about anything,\" said George. \"There is a serious issue going on, but we don't know what is going to happen so all we can do is make sure that we prepare as well as we can do.</p><p>\"We can take a huge amount of confidence from the way we dealt with Typhoon Hagibis. Within an hour or two, we were on a plane to Miyazaki and had a brilliant training camp down there that set us up nicely for a quarter-final and semifinal. It's a tough situation, but one that is out of our control.\"</p><p>Bath back-three player Anthony Watson and Sale back-row forward Mark Wilson have been added to the squad. Exeter Chiefs' hooker, Luke Cowan-Dickie, has been given time at home for family reasons. Saracens back-row forward Ben Earl, who won his first caps against Scotland and Ireland, has not been included, while Exeter prop Harry Williams has been preferred to Bath's Will Stuart.</p><p>Six Nations table PW D L F A BPTS France 33 008662 113 England 32 015442 1 9 Ireland 32 015550 1 9 Wales 31 027951 26 Scotland 31 023532 26 Italy 30 032294 0 0 March 7 Ireland v Italy (postponed), England v Wales 4.45pm. March 8 Scotland v France 3pm.</p><p>March 14 Wales v Scotland 2.15pm, Italy v England 4.45pm, France v Ireland 8pm.</p><p>Q&amp;A What we know about the disruptions by Ben Rumsby Q Why was the decision made to postpone the Ireland-Italy game? A It was taken on the grounds of protecting public health due to the spread of the coronavirus in Italy, from where around 2,500 fans were expected to travel to Dublin.</p><p>Q How soon before we know a new date? A The Irish Rugby Football Union said yesterday it would \"immediately\" look into it but agreeing a date in the coming weeks would appear fanciful given the speed at which the virus has spread.</p><p>Q What are the options? A There are no available dates inside current international windows this year. Any rearranged game would have to be played either on a weekend where clubs were also in action or during scheduled rest periods. Playing a Test outside the window usually requires the cooperation of affected clubs, although Ireland and Italy have control over most of their players' provincial teams. The next rest weekend is not until June 27-28.</p><p>Q What's the latest on Italy v England? ANO decision is expected until next week at the earliest but Italy yesterday were confident it would go ahead.</p><p>Q And if it does not? More chaos.</p><p>APlaying one Italy game during a rest weekend would be difficult enough. Two would be a major test and raise serious questions about player welfare. England do have an autumn Test scheduled for Nov 21-22 for which they currently have no opponent but that is at Twickenham and playing Italy in Rome instead would cost the Rugby Football Union millions. Premiership clubs last night appeared willing to release England players to play the fixture earlier than that if necessary.</p><p>Q Would cancelled matches definitely need to be played? A Even if France had sealed the grand slam, there would be place prize money at stake, as well as potentially crucial ranking points ahead of November's 2023 World Cup draw.</p><p>The foot-and-mouth epidemic of 2001 devastated agriculture in Britain and Ireland, with 2,000 cases reported, over six million cows and sheep culled and a huge disinfection drive launched (left) to halt its spread. It also caused major disruption to the Six Nations.</p><p>England were making serene progress towards clinching the grand slam, having won their opening four matches in the tournament. They began with a 44-15 romp against Wales in Cardiff, smashed Italy 80-23, humbled Scotland 43-3 and France 48-19 at Twickenham.</p><p>All that remained was an encounter with Ireland, who had already had to postpone games in Scotland and Wales as the disease spread rapidly The matches were put back until the autumn - with the Irish beating the Scots and the Welsh to set up a grandslam showdown in Dublin which they won 20-14 (above).</p><p>However, England still finished on top of the pile, thanks to their superior scoring during the competition as a whole.</p><p>We've been here before How a public health crisis caused havoc at the 2001 Six Nations</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-157866527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9D-DKC1-DYTY-C2CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1326\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>Business &amp;

What's interesting is we've never done something like this. Miles has always been a mate, going back a long time.</p><p>MH: We don't discuss it much these days but we're very similar ages - 56 and 57! We both joined the BBC at similar times and were brought up in that school all those years ago. It was a great place to learn our trade. We're still mates with everyone from that era.</p><p>NM: There was a whole bunch of us who came through when Radio 5 Live was first starting - Simon Brotherton, Jon Champion, Peter Drury, Mark Pougatch.</p><p>AB: It's like a who's who of commentary!</p><p>NM: I wouldn't have called myself Miles' boss but to start with I was a producer. My main job was making sure Ian Robertson got on air. Robbo needed more help plugging things in than Miles!</p><p>MH: We're from the same broadcast family so we've naturally built a very strong bond. Whenever we see people from that era, we just pick up the conversation as if it never stopped all those years ago.</p><p>AB: Do you compare commentary notes now?</p><p>NM: Miles was the first one to do something different beyond Bill McLaren. Bill is someone we both have deep in our hearts as someone who inspired us. Miles moved to Sky and was part of what they did in the early to mid-1990's. They absolutely redefined the way rugby was done on the telly. We loved Bill but what Miles and Sky were at the forefront of was making it a thoroughly modern and professional sport in terms of the way it was broadcast. It was the level we've now all come to expect. I always felt like I was looking up to Miles because he was doing stuff no-one else had ever done with Stuart Barnes. I've never felt a rivalry.</p><p>MH: Very kind of you to say that! Rivalry? No. We have a genuine friendship. You can listen to another commentator and take little bits from them but at no point should you move away from being yourself. You have to commit to your own authenticity as a commentator. It was great to be involved with Sky but when their coverage of the Premiership came to an end, I knew BT was in very safe hands and they'd do it their way.</p><p>NM: My job as a commentator and broadcaster on the day of the Premiership final is lots of things. But essentially, it's to be good company. If you're not, you're not a good commentator. When I listen to Miles, his commentary feels very natural, very warm and welcoming. He's the kind of bloke you'd be happy to sit next to in the stands. Think about his commentary of Brian O'Driscoll's try for the Lions against Australia in 2001. As a commentator you're meant to be impartial, but a Lions tour is slightly different. When Brian does what he does and Miles shouts \"You beauty\" it's just a magical moment. I think I was in The Alma in Wandsworth with pints of beer going over my head! I'm sure Brian loves that commentary. To hit the right note, with the right words and to sum up the moment perfectly is the skill of the broadcaster and Miles' commentary on O'Driscoll's try was a great example.</p><p>AB: Rugby is a complex game. What makes a great rugby commentary?</p><p>MH: That is such a difficult question to answer. There is a lot to marry up. Nick is right. A sense of companionship is so important but you also have to know when to concentrate on other aspects. Your words have to appeal to everyone. If you spend too long explaining something, you're missing what's going on. You have to be accurate and explanatory.</p><p>NM: I'm going to jump in here. There has been a trend, in cricket in particular, for the trained broadcaster and journalist to be removed.</p><p>MH: Commentary is instant journalism. For me there is no better challenge in broadcasting. If you've never played the game to any decent level but have always wanted to, it's the closest you're ever going to get to that feeling.</p><p>AB: We're all in that boat!</p><p>MH: Absolutely. To know when to take the temperature of the match is absolutely key. You do that not only with your words, but also your tone and style of delivery. There are so many things whizzing through your head.</p><p>NM: When I'm doing the final on Saturday, I'll remember what Bill always taught me which was never talk about something the viewer can't see at home. When 80,000 people are doing their nut at Twickenham, it's the most glorious sound. I don't care how good your analysis is because at that point, it can wait. Miles and I had the same boss at the BBC - Bob Shennan - and his advice was unless what you're saying is better than the sound of a full stadium, shut up! As a commentator you're the guardian of the noise. Don't be dribbling over it.</p><p>MH: I love co-commentators who understand that and are able to let the moment breathe. It comes after a try obviously, but another key moment is when the teams walk out. I love to be quiet then.</p><p>AB: 'Instant journalism' is a fascinating phrase Miles. How do you go about delivering that?</p><p>MH: It can be daunting but what comes out is natural. You do have to hold yourself back from saying the sorts of things you might do watching the match on your TV at home. Professional commentary is not shouting at the TV with a beer in hand. There is a distinct difference. You can't be shouting or swearing.</p><p>NM: I've often thought that would make an interesting channel though - an X rated commentary!</p><p>MH: I would absolutely love that but I'm not sure how many would view it!</p><p>AB: Why has rugby always seemed to have legendary commentators?</p><p>MH: Nobody has been better than Bill. It's as simple as that. Nick has already said how much we admire him. There has been no rugby commentator who has had a better voice. Commentary evolves and moves with the times. Bill was very aware of that. I still treasure a personal handwritten note he gave me at the start of my career. People will have their favourites in terms of the modern commentators and that's fine. It is a matter of taste. Sometimes it's you and sometimes it's not. Bill was untouchable.</p><p>NM: What I would say about the nature of rugby is that there is a degree of friendship and respect between the players, coaches and the media that doesn't exist quite as much in football. I know Bill felt that responsibility to look after the game. Bill loved rugby and the people. They trusted him to portray what they were about.</p><p>MH: To the general audience, Bill's legacy is his commentary, his warmth, and his companionship. In particular it's his velvety voice - just unbelievable. But his legacy in the game was way beyond that. It was the way people thought about him and the handshakes he had with players and coaches. It was his ability to be part of what were closed captain's runs sessions because he was trusted to keep certain information to himself. Bill was amazing at setting the highest standards.</p><p>NM: I remember when things changed for Bill. He'd always been allowed into closed training sessions. One day Bill asked to go and watch the Wallabies train and they said no. I suspect there were periods towards the end of Bill's career where he thought 'This is not the sport I first got involved in.' It does change and it changes season on season. There is that element of secrecy now. The most important thing Bill did was establish trust between the audience and the commentator. If you're not trusted as a broadcaster, you're wasting your time. The level of preparation Bill did - in terms of research and pronunciation - has seeped through to us.</p><p>MH: I remember working with him in 1993, very early on in my career. If it was a deliberate move by the bosses to put us together then it was sheer genius. Those days have lived with me forever. When you're talking about commentary skills, I think accuracy has to be at the top of the list because that leads to trust and respect. I don't want to say 'It was better back in the day' because you have to move with the times. But one thing in modern-day sports broadcasting which gets to me a little bit is that sometimes a mistake is celebrated as if it's OK or a bit of fun. If you make one you've got to admit it and react accordingly, but don't think it's a joke. We all make mistakes and I love a bit of fun in the commentary box. But if you make an error, respect the audience who don't like that.</p><p>AB: Do you two feel a responsibility as the voices of English rugby today?</p><p>NM: If that means we're doing a good job and protecting the legacy of people like Bill, then great. If I feel a sense of achievement in anything it's that his work with us wasn't wasted.</p><p>MH: You hear players talk about their desire to leave their shirt in a better place. It sounds a bit of a clich\u00e9 but I love the phrase. It applies to us as broadcasters too. You've said a wonderful thing to us there Alex but we don't have time to stop and think about where we are in our careers. If we did, we wouldn't be thinking about our next broadcast. That might be the one that trips you up and means you'll be remembered for all the wrong reasons. Fear factor is something that motivates a lot of players and it also drives a lot of broadcasters.</p><p>NM: You don't get much time to look back because the game moves on so quickly. The toughest thing is to stay relevant in a game that's becoming quicker and quicker with more and more detail. It's all on another scale to the past. Not only that, what the audience want from television now is also completely different. It's like another universe now with the levels of analysis and statistics.</p><p>AB: How do you see future of rugby broadcasting with the likes of Netflix and Amazon around?</p><p>NM: Who knows what it will look like in 100 years but I'd be amazed if it wasn't produced by the individual clubs. Football is leading the way on this. If you're a Bristol fan, you want to watch their games through Bristol eyes and listen to commentary with Bristol ears. I think that's happening to broadcasting, journalism, and the way we consume sport. We were always brought up to be impartial. Increasingly, broadcasting is becoming more partial and I fear that's what the audience wants. I feel uncomfortable with that.</p><p>MH: Nick's right. You can see it emerging. But I think there is still a strong place for fans to see coverage from all angles. One of the joys of doing the Lions is it's the one time you can let your impartiality halo slip a little bit.</p><p>NM: But you can't be 'We' and 'Us' because the moment you are, you stop being impartial.</p><p>MH: If you do that, you can never go back. It's a small step from passion to one-eyed. If that happens in my broadcasting career I'm gone overnight. You can't be like that.</p><p>AB: It's been a dreadful season for English rugby off the field. As broadcasters, how do you think the sport can sell itself better as a product?</p><p>NM: There has been a shadow over this season ever since Worcester and Wasps went out of business. I've not enjoyed this season that much. I can't beat around the bush on that. I'll be glad when it's over. As much as we try to sell the product, two clubs have already gone out of business and it could soon be three. The sport needs to learn some pretty major lessons from this. I don't want to go through another season where we finish with fewer teams than we started with.</p><p>MH: I echo that. I've found it very difficult this season with Worcester and Wasps. It's upsetting with the people you know at both clubs and the scramble they've had for jobs. It's happening to a lot of people in life at the moment so rugby is not necessarily a special case. This year's final to my mind should almost be a dedication to those two clubs. I know I'm biased but I do think rugby still has an awful lot going for it. There are clear issues in the sport which need to be addressed and I'm not trying to belittle that. It's clearly a key moment for the game and the decisions which will be made in the immediate future will absolutely shape the sport for a lifetime. I hope within that framework we can continue to tell the positive sides of the sport.</p><p>NM: I hope there are Worcester and Wasps fans who can feel involved in rugby this weekend. The sport hasn't forgotten them.</p><p>                     Three quickfire questions...                   </p><p> Best match you've commentated on?</p><p>MH: South Africa against the Lions 2009, second Test. It was the best match I've seen. It simply had absolutely everything.</p><p>NM: World Cup 2019 - Japan against Scotland. The game went ahead in Yokohama after Typhoon Hagibis. The stadium was surrounded by water and thousands of lives in the area had been decimated. When Japan won, there were grown men in tears and the Japanese don't show emotion. For the country's rugby team to bring a nation back together like that was just amazing.</p><p>Best player you've commentated on?</p><p>NM: I'll give two - a forward and a back. Martin Johnson and Brian O'Driscoll.</p><p>MH: There are loads flashing into my head. Richie McCaw. Am I allowed a back as well? For absolute talent, I'd go Jason Robinson. His ability literally raised me out of my seat and turned me into Murray Walker! How have I not said Christian Cullen! It's too difficult!</p><p>Who do you think will win this year's World Cup?</p><p>NM: I'd love it to be Ireland but if not them, France.</p><p>MH: I think you'd get good odds on New Zealand now but in terms of who I think will win it, when it's that close being at home can swing it. France.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-93666620</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:689J-KMD1-JBNF-W0B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2385\"/><timeReceived>6:59 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

He has no criminal record and promised this court that he would not do it again.\"</p><p>McIntyre, 45, was initially held at a police station in Tokyo before being transferred to the city's main <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-mcintyre\">detention centre</url> in Kosuge, which last year was home to the former Nissan boss and international fugitive Carlos Ghosn.</p><p>McIntyre said he had shared a tiny cell, which was lit day and night, with a convicted murderer who was appealing against his sentence. Conditions there had almost driven him \"insane\", he told the Guardian during an interview at the detention centre earlier this month.</p><p>McIntyre, who was led into his court hearing last week in handcuffs and with a rope tied around his waist, apologised for his actions, claiming he had only wanted to ensure that his son and daughter, aged eight and 11, were safe after large parts of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-mcintyre\">Japan</url> were pummelled by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-mcintyre\">Typhoon Hagibis</url> in mid-October last year.</p><p>His parents, who flew to Japan from their home near Sydney to attend their son's trial, said they were relieved that he had finally been freed.</p><p>\"We're glad that it's over,\" McIntyre's mother, Lynne, said. \"But we don't have our missing grandchildren back, and now we may never get them back.\"</p><p>McIntyre claimed in court that his wife - with whom he has started divorce proceedings - had abducted their children in May last year and severed all contact with him. The Guardian has contacted McIntyre's wife for comment.</p><p>\"I have made repeated attempts [to find them] through the family court and the police but I have had no success,\" he said at his hearing. \"I have no idea where my children are. I have no idea if they are alive or dead. As a parent this causes me unbelievable grief.\"</p><p>McIntyre is one of a number of foreign parents who say they have been denied access to their children after separating from or divorcing their Japanese spouses.</p><p>The Hague convention on international child abductions, which Japan ratified in 2013 after years of pressure, requires parents accused of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-mcintyre\">abducting their children</url> to return them to their country of habitual residence.</p><p>But the treaty does not apply to cases involving couples living in Japan, even if one of the parents is a foreign national, and Japanese courts almost always award custody to the mother.</p><p>\"All I and other parents want is for Japan to join the civilised world and institute a system of joint custody,\" McIntyre said outside the court after the ruling. \"I am here on behalf of all those abducted children who don't have a voice. This is not a way for a modern society to operate. Children deserve two parents.\"</p><p>McIntyre made headlines in his native Australia in 2015 after SBS <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/scott-mcintyre\">sacked</url> him for posting controversial Anzac Day tweets critical of what he called the \"cultification [sic] of an imperialist invasion\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GUARDN-59417614</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GUARDN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y08-MH31-F021-63C7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">138620</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><timeReceived>10:12 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Guardian, a division of Transcontinental Media Group Inc.

You speak about family all the time and there are things that happen in your life all the time.''</p><p>Ford says coronavirus has caused minimal disruption to England's preparations for Wales' visit to south west London.</p><p>``It's been a completely normal week. We went out for food together on Wednesday night,'' the Leicester fly-half said.</p><p>``In terms of hygiene, not much has changed because we want to be pretty red hot on that anyway. It's just reminders more than anything to keep good habits around camp.</p><p>``It's hard to believe, but we're genuinely just concentrating on the game on Saturday first and foremost. It will be a tough enough challenge as it is.''</p><p>Eddie Jones echoes Ford's view by claiming England's only aim is to topple their old rivals while tuning out the turmoil that has engulfed the Six Nations and other sports amid mounting concerns over public health.</p><p>``The only thing I'm focused on is Wales. There's going to be 82,000 people yelling and screaming, knowing we're going to play a really tough, positive game of rugby,'' Jones said.</p><p>``We've probably had our best training run of the Six Nations. We're not far underneath where we were at the World Cup now in terms of physical condition and the intensity we can potentially play with.''</p><p>Jones has targeted Saturday's showdown for England to peak in the 2020 Six Nations and the Australian has a score to settle.</p><p>A year ago England were powering towards the Grand Slam as they followed up emphatic victories over Ireland and France by building a 10-3 half-time lead in Cardiff that eventually spiralled into a 21-13 defeat.</p><p>Wales went on to be crowned champions and the setback at the Principality Stadium still rankles ahead of Wayne Pivac's first visit to Twickenham since replacing Warren Gatland in November.</p><p>``You never like to lose to Wales - and we lost last year. We were in the position we were in at half-time and we've learned from that,'' said Jones, who steered England into the Yokohama final where they lost 32-12 to South Africa.</p><p>``That was one of the key games that got us in our best condition for the World Cup. It's still a game that I'm sure irks every player who played in it. It certainly irks me.</p><p>``You've got to remember they beat us last year, so we owe them one. England-Wales games are a little bit different. They go down to the wire.''</p><p>The postponement of the Italy game means England could be saying goodbye to two stalwarts on Saturday - George Kruis, who is weighing up an option from Japanese club rugby, and Leicester-bound assistant coach Steve Borthwick.</p><p>``George is fantastic. Great team man, great work rate. Couldn't ask for a bloke who plays tougher for the team,'' Jones said.</p><p>``Steve's been an unbelievable servant for English rugby. He's done a great job for the team for the last five years. He's going to turn out to be an outstanding coach.'' end</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PANSN-HSA9122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PANSN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC4-67D1-DYTG-N2BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">326104</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"646\"/><timeReceived>6:15 AM BST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Press Association Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>PA Newswire: Sport News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"48480\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 6, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>RUGBYU England</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX002145</classCode><className>VIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOTY</classCode><className>CORONAVIRUSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000466</classCode><className>DELAYS &amp; POSTPONEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX351</classCode><className>CARDIFF, WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX106</classCode><className>LONDON, ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC690</classCode><className>WALES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was one of many \"light bulb\" moments that pushed the England scrum-half to embark on her own mission: to live a more sustainable and eco-friendly lifestyle.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To hold herself accountable, MacDonald started a blog - \"Let's Talk 1%\" - where she documented one small change she was determined to make each month for the greater good of the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">From switching to shampoo and hair-conditioning soap bars as a way of cutting down on single-use plastics, to ordering locally-produced vegetables and using bamboo toothbrushes, MacDonald has now conquered most sustainable swaps. There is one, however, that continues to evade her.</p><p>\"No, I haven't used reusable loo roll yet,\" laughs MacDonald when asked, \"but that's not to say I won't. I do use recyclable toilet paper.\"</p><p>Granted, washing reusable toilet wipes seems a pretty onerous responsibility for an international athlete given their nomadic lifestyle. But judging by MacDonald's competitive drive - she picked up a rugby ball aged 19 at university and just three years later was on England's books - it is surely only a matter of time before she ticks off that next goal.</p><p>The only downside to her career - if there is one - is trying to reconcile her eco-enthusiasm with the demands of life as a professional rugby player. \"When I'm at home, I have more control over what I'm buying and eating,\" she says. \"With a meal, I wouldn't start with a chicken and build around that - I'd much prefer a veggie lasagne or veggie sausages, because I actually prefer the taste of them.\"</p><p>When she is away with England, that routine is not so straightforward. Overnight stays in hotels, where catering is provided, limits what MacDonald can put on her plate, although she has counterbalanced that frustration by projecting her passion for sustainability on to her rugby peers.</p><p>\"In England camp, we might have bottles of water provided - but we'll request jugs of tap water to replace them,\" she says. \"We share cars as much as we can. I also try to buy as few boots as possible. I have one pair of boots and I wear them until they split and my feet are soaking wet when I stand on the pitch.</p><p>\"It's difficult - and it's certainly not perfect by any means - but sport can still play a role while all the technologies around it continue to develop to allow us to be more sustainable and environmentally friendly in the future.\"</p><p>MacDonald's sport is one of many that has already felt the disruptive force of climate change, when matches at the 2019 World Cup in Japan - including England's meeting with France - were cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. More recently, the marathon at this year's Tokyo Olympics was moved because of concerns for athletes' welfare at the hottest Games on record.</p><p>Scientists predict sport will face more disruption of this kind in the future and latest estimates show that by 2050, one in four English football league grounds can expect flooding every year.</p><p>It is little wonder, then, that last week Fifa, along with several other signatories, agreed to become net zero by 2040 - a move which is at odds with recent proposals put forward by football's world governing body to host a World Cup every two years.</p><p>For MacDonald, there is also the small matter of the delayed women's World Cup next year in New Zealand. Should she make the squad, she would have no option but to board a longhaul flight - and it is partly why she admits to not fitting the definition of a true eco-warrior.</p><p>\"International sport by its very nature requires you to travel, which is probably the highest contributor to CO2 emissions to what a team produces,\" says MacDonald, who will look to make an impact from the bench in England's second autumn meeting against the Black Ferns today. \"The less travel we can do, the better. Unfortunately, we can't dictate what green technologies are available to fly to New Zealand, but we can still become more sustainable as a team.\"</p><p>And yet, due to its growing profile, women's rugby is inadvertently proving more sustainable than other, more lucrative sports. At her club, Wasps, MacDonald plays in the same set of kit for the entire season - and points to Harlequins' kit from last season, which was made from recycled plastic.</p><p>\"For internationals, you get a new shirt for each game,\" MacDonald says. \"Quite often we sign those shirts and give them to charities to raffle off as prizes, so they end up having a secondary life.

You speak about family all the time and there are things that happen in your life all the time.''</p><p>Ford says coronavirus has caused minimal disruption to England's preparations for Wales' visit to south west London.</p><p>``It's been a completely normal week. We went out for food together on Wednesday night,'' the Leicester fly-half said.</p><p>``In terms of hygiene, not much has changed because we want to be pretty red hot on that anyway. It's just reminders more than anything to keep good habits around camp.</p><p>``It's hard to believe, but we're genuinely just concentrating on the game on Saturday first and foremost. It will be a tough enough challenge as it is.''</p><p>Eddie Jones echoes Ford's view by claiming England's only aim is to topple their old rivals while tuning out the turmoil that has engulfed the Six Nations and other sports amid mounting concerns over public health.</p><p>``The only thing I'm focused on is Wales. There's going to be 82,000 people yelling and screaming, knowing we're going to play a really tough, positive game of rugby,'' Jones said.</p><p>``We've probably had our best training run of the Six Nations. We're not far underneath where we were at the World Cup now in terms of physical condition and the intensity we can potentially play with.''</p><p>Jones has targeted Saturday's showdown for England to peak in the 2020 Six Nations and the Australian has a score to settle.</p><p>A year ago England were powering towards the Grand Slam as they followed up emphatic victories over Ireland and France by building a 10-3 half-time lead in Cardiff that eventually spiralled into a 21-13 defeat.</p><p>Wales went on to be crowned champions and the setback at the Principality Stadium still rankles ahead of Wayne Pivac's first visit to Twickenham since replacing Warren Gatland in November.</p><p>``You never like to lose to Wales - and we lost last year. We were in the position we were in at half-time and we've learned from that,'' said Jones, who steered England into the Yokohama final where they lost 32-12 to South Africa.</p><p>``That was one of the key games that got us in our best condition for the World Cup. It's still a game that I'm sure irks every player who played in it. It certainly irks me.</p><p>``You've got to remember they beat us last year, so we owe them one. England-Wales games are a little bit different. They go down to the wire.''</p><p>The postponement of Italy means England could be saying goodbye to two stalwarts on Saturday - George Kruis, who is weighing up an option from Japanese club rugby, and Leicester-bound assistant coach Steve Borthwick.</p><p>``George is fantastic.

But this is Scotland, remember.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last time Italy did win a match in the championship was, inevitably, at BT Murrayfield as the Scots plummeted to a whitewash in Vern Cotter's first Six Nations.</p><p>The Azzurri await in Rome a week on Saturday as Gregor Townsend's side look to get a first win on the board in this championship but know that a potentially emotion-fuelled cauldron lies in store at the Stadio Olimpico.</p><p>Italy entered the expanded Six Nations 20 years ago and got off to a flier as stand-off Diego Dominguez orchestrated a humbling of reigning Five Nations champions Scotland at the old Stadio Flaminio. Since then it has been tough for Italy, although seven wins over the Scots is by far their most successful head-to-head record and they do boast one of the finest players to grace  the tournament.</p><p>Back row colossus Sergio Parisse was denied his fairytale send-off against the All Blacks at the World Cup as Typhoon Hagibis struck in Japan last year and the final pool match was cancelled but the Toulon forward is primed to return for a curtain call against the Scots.</p><p>In sport all losing streaks come to an end at some point. One of the most fabled is tennis player Vitas Gerulaitis who, after finally beating fellow American Jimmy Connors following 16 straight defeats to the Brash Basher of Belleville, strode into the press conference at the 1980 Masters event in New York with champagne bottle in hand and pronounced: \"Let that be a lesson to you all, nobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row.\"</p><p>Who is to say it won't be a Prosecco-wielding Parisse who does something similar in 12 days' time.</p><p>\"We know they'll come with a lot of passion, especially at home,\" said Scotland flanker Jamie Ritchie, pictured. \"It's potentially Sergio Parisse's swansong, and they're always a passionate group.</p><p>\"For whatever reason, they always seem to target our game. We know what's coming, it's on their home patch and we need to perform away from home.\"</p><p>The 23-year-old Edinburgh player is relishing the prospect of facing one of the game's legends, who would win an extraordinary 143rd Test cap if he does turn out against Scotland.</p><p>\"Italy probably pose us a challenge where we're going in as favourites which we probably haven't had the last two weeks. If that is pressure, we need to take it on the chin and perform,\" added Ritchie, who was at blindside in the 13-6 loss to England at storm-ravaged BT Murrayfield on his 15th international appearance.</p><p>\"We prepare just as well for any game. We back ourselves against any opposition. You saw in the last two weeks that if we'd got a few more things right, we'd have won those games.</p><p>\"We'll be going in with the same mindset and looking to put those wrongs right.\"</p><p>Scotland take lessons from the loss of the Calcutta Cup but it will be a much different game in Rome.</p><p>\"Because it was so wet on Saturday, the game was so slow. It needs to be tight, the opposition are expecting you to do one-pass plays and they are the easiest to defend,\" said Ritchie.</p><p>\"It was one of those games. It kind of came down to who made the fewest mistakes and there was a lot of close-quarters contact. There was a bit of a back row battle, just trying to get the ball back.\"</p><p>Ritchie remains confident that Scotland can finish the Six Nations on a high with a win in Italy propelling them to three in a row.</p><p>\"We're here to win as many games as we can, and looking at the last two weeks, we had opportunities to win both those games. We were very much in them. For us, it's about finishing those opportunities.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-9B626C792B134DDF839F35BFC1BB4945ELM84078964STTS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y60-NVK1-JDPH-B224-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Primary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>scotland rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>six nations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

After the coronavirus outbreak caused their final game against Italy in Rome next week to be postponed, they will wind things up with Wales' visit to Twickenham. Off-field events will undoubtedly have proved unsettling, but England have previous experience of dealing with such unexpected situations following Typhoon Hagibis forcing their World Cup pool game against France last October to be scrapped. England went on to reach the final and this weekend will again be about staying concentrated on the job.</p><p>                     England fired up after Cardiff defeat                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/article39021114.ece\">5 key talking points as England take on Wales in the Six Nations Code 2</url></p><p>England head coach Eddie Jones feels that his players \"owe them one\" following a painful Six Nations loss in Wales just over 12 months ago. England, chasing a third successive win in the tournament, led 10-3 at half-time as Tom Curry scored a try that reflected their dominance. But Wales were a different animal after the break as they shunted England on to the back foot for long periods before lock Cory Hill's touchdown and a late Josh Adams score confirmed an outstanding 21-13 victory. Wales went on to win the Grand Slam, while England could only lick their wounds. The pain has not gone away.</p><p>                     The odds are stacked against Wales                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/article39021114.ece\">5 key talking points as England take on Wales in the Six Nations Code 3</url></p><p>Wales head to English rugby headquarters striving to avoid a third successive defeat in one Six Nations campaign for the first time since 2007. Losses to Ireland and France derailed hopes of a successful title defence following last season's Grand Slam, and life is not about to get any easier. Wales' Six Nations record against England in Cardiff reads won five, lost five but at Twickenham, they have suffered eight defeats from 10 visits. Wales' last success in the tournament there came eight years ago, and most bookmakers rate them a distant 9/2 shot for victory this weekend.</p><p>                     England farewell for Steve Borthwick                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/article39021114.ece\">5 key talking points as England take on Wales in the Six Nations Code 4</url></p><p>After England's Italian job was put on hold it unexpectedly brought forward Borthwick's departure from the Red Rose set-up. The 40-year-old former England captain will be Leicester Tigers' head coach from this summer, ending his association with the national team. He won 57 caps as a player and has been part of Jones' coaching staff since the Australian was appointed more than four years ago, working as forwards specialist and then skills coach for over 50 Tests. Saturday's game will be the last for Borthwick in an England tracksuit at Twickenham, while England lock George Kruis is also set to bow out as he ponders a prospective new playing career in Japan.</p><p>                     Are Wales asking a lot of Liam Williams and Josh Navidi?                   </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/rugby/article39021114.ece\">5 key talking points as England take on Wales in the Six Nations twitter 5</url></p><p>Yes, is the simple answer. Their quality and experience is unquestioned, with Williams one of world rugby's most exciting backs and number eight Navidi a breakdown specialist whose physical presence is always felt by opponents. Williams, though, has not played since Wales' World Cup quarter-final victory over France on October 20, suffering an ankle injury during training just a few days later, while Navidi's last competitive outing came eight weeks ago before a hamstring problem laid him low. Wales head coach Wayne Pivac feels that both players have enough training volume in them, declaring they are \"ready to go.\" Welsh fans will hope he is right.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELWEB-60879142</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELWEB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YC5-9WT1-JCJY-G0R5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400553</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"677\"/><timeReceived>11:41 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent News &amp;

We now understand the plan is for the 36-year-old maestro - who has played eight times for his club Toulon this season and is not in the Italy squad - to play some minutes in Italy's last match against England, with a video review of his wondrous career played beforehand on the Stadio Olimpico big screens. It should be an emotionally charged extension to the great man's 69 appearances in the tournament.</p><p>2 Form guide from the World Cup The global tournament gave us a skimpy form guide in Six Nations terms. The cancellation of the France v England match due to Typhoon Hagibis left Ireland's clear-cut win over Scotland as the only \"Six Nations\" fixture played during the pool stage. Then France lost to Wales in a quarter-final skewed by Sebastien Vahaamahina's red card for elbowing Aaron Wainwright (below) in the head. England reaching the final against South Africa was impressive, as they had big wins over Argentina, Australia and New Zealand along the way - but would they have got past Six Nations opposition so easily?</p><p>3Breakdown battle and clever kicks England fly-half George Ford (below) had no hesitation highlighting the most important battleground. \"With England, the breakdown is huge for us,\" said Ford. \"We do it every day in training, so we will get the speed of ball we want and then it's 'right, we're off'.\" Keep your eyes peeled, too, for half-backs varying their kicking to create pressure or catch the opposition out - in this high-speed test of vision and skill, gaps must be exploited in the back field, on the edge of the defensive lines or straight down the middle. And the kick-pass is in vogue again, to outflank rush defences.</p><p>4 Wales to break the back-to-back Grand Slam barrier? No team has done the Grand Slam two years in a row in the Six Nations era - the last team to do it was France in the Five Nations in 1997 and 1998. Before that, it was achieved only by England in 1991 and 1992, 1923 and 1924, and 1913 and 1914, Wales in 1908 and 1909. History does, though, point to someone doing the Slam this year, as it has been achieved after each of the last four World Cups - by France in 2004, Wales in 2008 and 2012, and England in 2016. Note that none of those teams had reached the final of the World Cup in question...</p><p>5 Hit or miss? Every goal kick predicted The march of data analysis in rugby continues, and Amazon Web Services are giving TV viewers five new real-time statistics. Tackle count and metres made are old hat - now we will see dominant tackles measured and mapped on the field, while a \"power game\" of metres made, together with line breaks, is assessed for its direct impact. There will be a heat map for the locations of rucks and turnovers, and visits to the 22 will come with greater detail. Maybe the best fun will be the \"kick predictor\" - rating a goal-kicker's chances based on the position of the kick, the state of the match, and his historical strike rate.</p><p>6 Feelings run high over high tackles The Rugby Football Union postponed the publication of its annual injury audit last week, but when it emerges there is bound to be attention paid to concussion, and whether referees in English club rugby are applying the hightackle framework stringently enough. Consistency is far from simple, as the controversial tackle by Australia's Reece Hodge against Fiji in the World Cup showed, but the top referees consult regularly in a bid to smooth out discrepancies. Eleven of the 12 World Cup referees will be on duty - J\u00e9r\u00f4me Garc\u00e8s has retired from internationals, while Andrew Brace of Ireland makes his debut and England's Matthew Carley returns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IINDUK-INMLMMGLSTRY000033328028-ARTICLE-TEXT-1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IINDUK2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y3M-YMX1-F072-422V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">379735</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"639\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

All this before we mention the names of Israel Folau and Rob Howley or the words \"Championship cuts\".</p><p>It goes without saying, at remarkable times like these, rugby and sport are trifling matters. This will not be the last sport affected by the coronavirus outbreak. Public health comes first.</p><p>If there are any surprises, it is that there are still only two games called off and that we have had to wait as long as today for the expected announcement that England's game in Italy, the worst affected country in Europe, is off.</p><p>From the moment when the Irish government said last week that their game against Italy in Dublin this Saturday should not go ahead, the writing has seemed on the wall. How could Italians not be allowed to watch a game in Ireland, then English people pile into Rome and the close confines of Stadio Olimpico? After meeting in Paris on Monday, rugby authorities have been simply waiting for someone more senior - a government, basically - to tell them to call games off. That arrived yesterday when the Italian government ordered that all sports events in the country would have to take place behind closed doors until April 3. That left the tournament organisers with one simple decision: accept going behind closed doors, or postpone.</p><p>The Six Nations could surely not be played behind closed doors. It is a fan's event, about atmosphere, colour and rather more than rugby.</p><p>But more pressing, naturally, for the authorities are commercial imperatives: Italy need the gate receipts. An England visit is a biennial boon for any union, with thousands of fans pouring into the city, most of them with considerable appetite for the local delicacies.</p><p>In many ways, now the challenge really begins. Rugby is being sucked so dry by the greed of its administrators that rescheduling these games, which are important to fans, appears a desperately difficult task even without factoring in the fact that coronavirus may wreak havoc for months yet.</p><p>It could be that we have to wait as long as we did in 2001, when three games took place in the autumn due to footand-mouth disease, with England failing to pull off a Grand Slam after the delay. One senses organisers would rather like France to get their two games done this month and pull off their first Grand Slam for a decade, so at least the important bits are decided.</p><p>Even if we accept it is necessary to postpone these games right now, it is unsatisfactory to have to play games in October. Even by then, teams will have changed due to form and fitness, while coaching staffs will be different, too. For instance, Steve Borthwick will be running Leicester, rather than involved with England's forwards.</p><p>Spare a thought most, for the Italian titan Sergio Parisse. His 143rd and final Test was due to be last October in Japan, only for Italy's game against New Zealand to be cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis. So Italy decided he could be involved against England, for a swansong at home.</p><p>Surely they cannot now take the third time lucky approach? For years, Parisse seemed the unluckiest player in the Championship, a lone brilliant player in a poor team. Even his retirement is proving unfortunate.</p><p>?

Last year I remember strong winds but when we actually got there it was windy outside but, on the field, it wasn't too bad. </p><p>\"It'll be whether the rain comes down, too. I've been looking at the weather forecast every day and it has started to close in, it's now looking like it'll be wet and windy around kick-off time.\"</p><p>Scotland may have held the famous old trophy for two years now but, as ever, England start as heavy odds-on favourites. The conditions may be a levelling factor but Townsend is a coach, as he was a player, who would prefer a dry ball and track.</p><p>Asked if he would like to see a roof at Murrayfield, he smiled and replied: \"That would be a great idea. But I don't think it's happening anytime soon.\"</p><p>Townsend has made only one change to the starting XV that impressed at times, battled well but ultimately fell short 19-12 through a combination of poor discipline, misfortune and an inability to finish despite spending a full six minutes in the Irish 22.</p><p>Magnus Bradbury missed Dublin due to a minor thigh strain but returns to the No 8 jersey he filled so magnificently in last year's epic 38-38 meeting between the sides at Twickenham, his storming try proving critical in the  fightback surge.</p><p>\"I thought his performance at Twickenham last year as a No 8, it was the first time he'd played there for us, was outstanding,\" said Townsend. \"He had two really great carries off the base of the scrum, he had carries from restarts, under pressure, being the first man and gave us go-forward. </p><p>\"And a great run-in for a try, too. He was maybe 50-50 at the weekend and we knew it would have been a risky one if we played him. It enabled Nick [Haining] to show what he could do at international level. Magnus is fit this week and has trained fully.\"</p><p>Haining may have been an unknown quantity to many viewers last week but he was one of Scotland's standouts on the day.</p><p>Asked if it was a difficult  decision to drop him to the bench, Townsend said: \"Yes and no. It was a good debut from Nick but Magnus has played very well for us in the World Cup and at No 8 against England at Twickenham. He's worked more with the two back-row colleagues in Jamie [Ritchie] and Hamish [Watson]. We trained with Magnus at No 8 for about four or five days leading up to the Ireland game.\"</p><p>With the hype and mindgames flying around, it is important on these occasions to ensure the passion doesn't take away from the precision, something the coach accepts may have happened in that chastening first half at Twickenham last year.</p><p>Reflecting on how he dealt with that balance during his Calcutta Cup career, Townsend smiled and said: \"I don't think I did it very well because I lost nine times out of ten against England. </p><p>\"I used to get too pumped up... It's important our players are ready for the physical battle but are in control. In control of their discipline first of all but if they have that fire inside of them.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-AE5FD2CD53D14E138F263199053943DBELM83986510STTS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y54-T2T1-JDPH-B1HR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Primary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>england rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>scotland rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>six nations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N511000CC</classCode><className>PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But that\u2019s just been my focus. I\u2019m not thinking about anything else other than going over to France and playing rugby.</p><p>\u201cI\u2019m not worried about it not going ahead. If you do that, then you won\u2019t prepare properly.</p><p>\u201cI would be pretty upset if we don\u2019t play. I want to play for my country, so I\u2019d be pretty devastated on a personal level.</p><p>\u201cBut again, if it\u2019s not safe to play, it\u2019s not safe, and if I have to go back to Gloucester and I\u2019m not allowed to come back up if the game\u2019s the following week, that\u2019s out of my hands.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to crack on and focus on the week, not let that be a distraction.\u201d</p><h>A similar vibe to Japan</h><p>There is a similar vibe to the week before Scotland\u2019s final game of the last World Cup against Japan. Then, Typhoon Hagibis was blowing through Tokyo and the crucial contest in Yokohama was in doubt right up until the morning of the game.</p><p>\u201cYeah, I suppose it was the same when we played Japan,\u201d recalled Harris. \u201cI was still preparing and focusing on my role in that game then as well.</p><p>\u201cThat was bizarre because it was really torrential the day before the game. Then, on the day of the game, the sun was shining.\u201d</p><h>A third record of disappointment erased?</h><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.thecourier.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/02/shutterstock_editorial_11758449at-846x564.jpg\">Harris reflects after the loss to Wales last week.</url></p><p/><p/><p/><p>In Paris Scotland are attempting to knock off the third of their long disappointments on away trips in successive games. Wales fell at Llanelli for the first time since 2002, England were beaten at Twickenham for the first time since 1983, and now there\u2019s Paris, where the Scots last won in 1999.</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s the confidence and belief you take from those results,\u201d said Harris \u201cYou think to yourself: \u201cwe can do this\u201d.</p><p>\u2018I\u2019ve never actually played in Paris, so I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like. But we\u2019re playing in empty stadiums at the moment, it\u2019s probably going to be similar to playing at all the rest.</p><p>\u201cWe are full of confidence, and we all still believe that we can win the Championship. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously not focusing too far ahead.</p><p>\u201cBut if we can beat France, we\u2019ve then got two home games to come. So it\u2019s a good opportunity for us.\u201d</p><h>No unknowns in the French squad</h><p>France will be without 11 players due to Covid-19 on Sunday if it goes ahead. Key men like Antoine Dupont and captain Charles Ollivon will be missed, but those coming in are not unknown to the Scots, says Harris.</p><p>\u201cFrance have a defensive system, an attacking structure and a style of play,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cSo we just look at that and how we deal with their threats and the opportunities that are there for us.</p><p>\u201cThey\u2019re not going to be unknown players \u2013 this is international rugby. And we\u2019re not going to overdo it by looking too much at individuals.</p><p>\u201cBut we know their style of play and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.\u201d</p><h>No new positive tests in French camp</h><p>There were no further positive tests among the French camp on Tuesday, leaving them with 11 players and four members of the coaching staff affected by outbreak.</p><p>None of the players who tested positive will be available on Sunday if the game is played, even if some will have completed the isolation period.</p><p>Nonetheless France\u2019s training schedule has been badly disrupted. The Six Nations\u2019 Testing Oversight Group is to meet on Wednesday night to decide if Sunday\u2019s match should be postponed.</p><p>Their statement that the match should be rescheduled as soon as possible \u2013 probably next week \u2013 brought a strident response from Scottish Rugby.</p><p>The Scots stand to lose as many as 11 English-based players as next week falls outwith international player release protocols.</p><h>No fans at Murrayfield this Six Nations season</h><p>In the meantime Scottish Rugby confirmed the two remaining home games in the championship against Ireland (March 14) and Italy (March 20) will be played behind closed doors.</p><p>This follows the announcement from the Scottish Government of a return to the tier system against Covid-19 in April. The governing body held off for some weeks before making what seemed an inevitable decision, but have now conceded that fans will not be allowed into Murrayfield for this season.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/thecourier/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2021/02/shutterstock_editorial_10577146bb-833x564.jpg\">Chris Harris (r, with Adam Hastings) is looking to celebrate with The Auld Alliance trophy again.

But this is Scotland, remember.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The last time Italy did win a match in the championship was, inevitably, at BT Murrayfield as the Scots plummeted to a whitewash in Vern Cotter's first Six Nations.</p><p>The Azzurri await in Rome a week on Saturday as Gregor Townsend's side look to get a first win on the board in this championship but know that a potentially emotion-fuelled cauldron lies in store at the Stadio Olimpico.</p><p>Italy entered the expanded Six Nations 20 years ago and got off to a flier as stand-off Diego Dominguez orchestrated a humbling of reigning Five Nations champions Scotland at the old Stadio Flaminio. Since then it has been tough for Italy, although seven wins over the Scots is by far their most successful head-to-head record and they do boast one of the finest players to grace  the tournament.</p><p>Back row colossus Sergio Parisse was denied his fairytale send-off against the All Blacks at the World Cup as Typhoon Hagibis struck in Japan last year and the final pool match was cancelled but the Toulon forward is primed to return for a curtain call against the Scots.</p><p>In sport all losing streaks come to an end at some point. One of the most fabled is tennis player Vitas Gerulaitis who, after finally beating fellow American Jimmy Connors following 16 straight defeats to the Brash Basher of Belleville, strode into the press conference at the 1980 Masters event in New York with champagne bottle in hand and pronounced: \"Let that be a lesson to you all, nobody beats Vitas Gerulaitis 17 times in a row.\"</p><p>Who is to say it won't be a Prosecco-wielding Parisse who does something similar in 12 days' time.</p><p>\"We know they'll come with a lot of passion, especially at home,\" said Scotland flanker Jamie Ritchie, pictured. \"It's potentially Sergio Parisse's swansong, and they're always a passionate group.</p><p>\"For whatever reason, they always seem to target our game. We know what's coming, it's on their home patch and we need to perform away from home.\"</p><p>The 23-year-old Edinburgh player is relishing the prospect of facing one of the game's legends, who would win an extraordinary 143rd Test cap if he does turn out against Scotland.</p><p>\"Italy probably pose us a challenge where we're going in as favourites which we probably haven't had the last two weeks. If that is pressure, we need to take it on the chin and perform,\" added Ritchie, who was at blindside in the 13-6 loss to England at storm-ravaged BT Murrayfield on his 15th international appearance.</p><p>\"We prepare just as well for any game. We back ourselves against any opposition. You saw in the last two weeks that if we'd got a few more things right, we'd have won those games.</p><p>\"We'll be going in with the same mindset and looking to put those wrongs right.\"</p><p>Scotland take lessons from the loss of the Calcutta Cup but it will be a much different game in Rome.</p><p>\"Because it was so wet on Saturday, the game was so slow. It needs to be tight, the opposition are expecting you to do one-pass plays and they are the easiest to defend,\" said Ritchie.</p><p>\"It was one of those games. It kind of came down to who made the fewest mistakes and there was a lot of close-quarters contact. There was a bit of a back row battle, just trying to get the ball back.\"</p><p>Ritchie remains confident that Scotland can finish the Six Nations on a high with a win in Italy propelling them to three in a row.</p><p>\"We're here to win as many games as we can, and looking at the last two weeks, we had opportunities to win both those games. We were very much in them. For us, it's about finishing those opportunities.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-9B626C792B134DDF839F35BFC1BB4945ELM84078964SWTS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y60-NVK1-JDPH-B22C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 10, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Primary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>scotland rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>six nations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

Of that total, private sector and government-sponsored insurance programs covered USD71 billion of the total - six percent above the century average but significantly lower than the record USD157 billion in 2017 and USD100 billion in 2018. This means the protection gap, which is the portion of economic losses not covered by insurance, was 69 percent in 2019 - the fifth-lowest since 2000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 12-months under review witnessed 41 billion-dollar economic loss events, and 12 billion-dollar insured loss events, with the two costliest insurance events, Typhoon Hagibis and Typhoon Faxai, occurring in Japan and causing USD9bn and USD6bn in insured losses respectively, due to each storm tracking through a highly urbanized area. The costliest individual peril was inland flooding, which caused economic losses globally of USD82 billion; preceded by tropical cyclone, at USD68 billion.</p><p>From a climate perspective, 2019 was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures since 1851. Notably, record temperatures of 46.0\u00b0C were seen in France and 42.6\u00b0C in Germany, while the January to May period was the wettest on record in the United States, with 15.71 inches (399 millimeters) of rainfall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andy Marcell, CEO of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, commented:</emphasis> \"Following two costly back-to-back years for natural disasters in 2017 and 2018, there were several moderately large catastrophes but strong capitalization has allowed the re/insurance industry to comfortably manage recent losses. However, as socioeconomic patterns further combine with scientific factors such as climate change or extreme weather variability, the potential financial costs at play are only going to increase so building resilience is key.\"</p><p>2010-2019 marked the costliest decade on record with economic damage reaching USD2.98 trillion - some USD1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 and with Asia-Pacific accounting for 44 percent. Private and public insurance entities paid out USD845 billion during the decade with the U.S. accounting for 55 percent alone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Bowen, Director and Meteorologist at Aon's Impact Forecasting team, commented:</emphasis> \"Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils - such as wildfire, flood, and drought - becoming much more costly and impactful. Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas. As the public and private sectors balance an understanding of the science with smart business solutions, this will lead to new advances that lower the physical risk and improve overall awareness.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other significant regional events during the year included: </emphasis><br/>  \u00b7 Wettest 12-month stretch in the contiguous U.S. on record dating to 1895 with river flooding across the Mississippi River watershed causing more than USD20 billion in economic losses<br/>  \u00b7 Category 5 Hurricane Dorian made multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a 185 mph (295 kph) storm; tying with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane as the strongest landfalling storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean<br/>  \u00b7 Cyclone Idai in Mozambique caused the most substantial humanitarian crisis killing 1,303 people and destroying more than 300,000 homes with USD2 billion economic losses.<br/>  \u00b7 Windstorm Eberhard was the lone event in Europe to surpass USD1 billion in insured losses after tracking across Western and Central Europe in March.<br/>  \u00b7 Globe's deadliest earthquake occurred in Albania on November 26, killing 52 people<br/>  \u00b7 Monsoon rains led to a combined USD25 billion in flood-related damage in China (USD15 billion) and India (USD10 billion) alone<br/>  \u00b7 Intense multi-year drought and record-setting spring and summer heat led to conditions able to ignite destructive bushfires in Australia. Some 18.2 million hectares (46 million acres) burned and more than 2,500 homes were destroyed, likely to result in insured losses topping USD1 billion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aon.com/global-weather-catastrophe-natural-disasters-costs-climate-change-2019-annual-report/index.html?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=mediarelease&amp;utm_campaign=natcat20\">Weather, Climate &amp;

Of that total, private sector and government-sponsored insurance programs covered USD71 billion of the total - six percent above the century average but significantly lower than the record USD157 billion in 2017 and USD100 billion in 2018. This means the protection gap, which is the portion of economic losses not covered by insurance, was 69 percent in 2019 - the fifth-lowest since 2000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 12-months under review witnessed 41 billion-dollar economic loss events, and 12 billion-dollar insured loss events, with the two costliest insurance events, Typhoon Hagibis and Typhoon Faxai, occurring in Japan and causing USD9bn and USD6bn in insured losses respectively, due to each storm tracking through a highly urbanized area. The costliest individual peril was inland flooding, which caused economic losses globally of USD82 billion; preceded by tropical cyclone, at USD68 billion.</p><p>From a climate perspective, 2019 was the second warmest year on record for land and ocean temperatures since 1851. Notably, record temperatures of 46.0\u00b0C were seen in France and 42.6\u00b0C in Germany, while the January to May period was the wettest on record in the United States, with 15.71 inches (399 millimeters) of rainfall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andy Marcell, CEO of Aon's Reinsurance Solutions business, commented:</emphasis> \"Following two costly back-to-back years for natural disasters in 2017 and 2018, there were several moderately large catastrophes but strong capitalization has allowed the re/insurance industry to comfortably manage recent losses. However, as socioeconomic patterns further combine with scientific factors such as climate change or extreme weather variability, the potential financial costs at play are only going to increase so building resilience is key.\"</p><p>2010-2019 marked the costliest decade on record with economic damage reaching USD2.98 trillion - some USD1.19 trillion higher than 2000-2009 and with Asia-Pacific accounting for 44 percent. Private and public insurance entities paid out USD845 billion during the decade with the U.S. accounting for 55 percent alone.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Steve Bowen, Director and Meteorologist at Aon's Impact Forecasting team, commented:</emphasis> \"Perhaps the biggest takeaway from the last decade of natural disasters was the emergence of previously considered 'secondary' perils - such as wildfire, flood, and drought - becoming much more costly and impactful. Scientific research indicates that climate change will continue to affect all types of weather phenomena and subsequently impact increasingly urbanized areas. As the public and private sectors balance an understanding of the science with smart business solutions, this will lead to new advances that lower the physical risk and improve overall awareness.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other significant regional events during the year included: </emphasis><br/>  \u00b7 Wettest 12-month stretch in the contiguous U.S. on record dating to 1895 with river flooding across the Mississippi River watershed causing more than USD20 billion in economic losses<br/>  \u00b7 Category 5 Hurricane Dorian made multiple landfalls in The Bahamas as a 185 mph (295 kph) storm; tying with the 1935 Labor Day Hurricane as the strongest landfalling storm on record in the Atlantic Ocean<br/>  \u00b7 Cyclone Idai in Mozambique caused the most substantial humanitarian crisis killing 1,303 people and destroying more than 300,000 homes with USD2 billion economic losses.<br/>  \u00b7 Windstorm Eberhard was the lone event in Europe to surpass USD1 billion in insured losses after tracking across Western and Central Europe in March.<br/>  \u00b7 Globe's deadliest earthquake occurred in Albania on November 26, killing 52 people<br/>  \u00b7 Monsoon rains led to a combined USD25 billion in flood-related damage in China (USD15 billion) and India (USD10 billion) alone<br/>  \u00b7 Intense multi-year drought and record-setting spring and summer heat led to conditions able to ignite destructive bushfires in Australia. Some 18.2 million hectares (46 million acres) burned and more than 2,500 homes were destroyed, likely to result in insured losses topping USD1 billion.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aon.com/global-weather-catastrophe-natural-disasters-costs-climate-change-2019-annual-report/index.html?utm_source=prnewswire&amp;utm_medium=mediarelease&amp;utm_campaign=natcat20\">Weather, Climate &amp;

New Zealand 63-10 Italy (Papali'i, 57)  </p><p> Poor from Italy.  That\u2019s as close to an own goal as you can get in rugby. The line-out sails right over the top. It\u2019s shovelled on for Telea who carries multiple Italians with him. A short pass for Papali\u2019i finds the rampaging back-rower and he\u2019s over.

New Zealand shove Italy right off the ball. It goes all the way right. B Barrett is almost through. There\u2019s a cross kick for Telea out on the left. Capuozzo catches but instead of marking he chooses to run it from a mile away. He is tackled, spills the ball and Roigard thinks he\u2019s scored after gather the ball and bobbling over the line. But is it two movements? </p><p>block-time published-time 9.19pm BST </p><p> 53 mins:  Roigard is on for Smith. This get a little scrappy from both sides. Mo\u2019unga kicks and Capuozzo fields. He then spills it and Roigard has it. It\u2019s getting really messy now. We could go back for a few knock-ons but it\u2019s an Italian scrum just inside New Zealand\u2019s territory. </p><p>block-time published-time 9.16pm BST </p><p> TRY! New Zealand 54-10 Italy (Retallick, 50)  </p><p> What? This game is getting silly now.  The replacement nine for Italy, Page-Relo, has his box kick charged down inside his own 22.

It comes out the back. Ioane steps Mo\u2019unga, feeds Allan and then Capuozzo has it near the touchline and dives and scores with a wonder finish. Great try. A few more of those and we have a game.

New Zealand counter but Italy get over the ball and win their third penalty on the ground in five minutes. Allan hoofs a great touch finder.

Italy didn\u2019t help themselves by missing 17 tackles and conceding eight penalties, but this was an All Blacks performance that will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s been watching them for more than four years. Clinical at the breakdown and at set-piece. Hard runs from midfield and out wide. Silky skills. A fly-half with the ball on a string and variation in attack. Aaron Smith bagged a hat-trick while Ardie Savea has two. I expect there\u2019ll be a few more names next to the try scorer\u2019s list by the time this is done.

Italy show slick hands but it\u2019s too lateral and the New Zealand defence can watch them snake across the field. When the opportunity presents itself they strike and get over the isolated ball carrier to steal a penalty. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.43pm BST </p><p> 39 mins:  Front foot ball at last for Italy as it\u2019s clean off the top of the line-out. Ioane carries well but there\u2019s a big hit in midfield and New Zealand come roaring back. A kick ahead and Ioane has to come across and clean up. He does brilliantly. He held the ball under pressure and waited for the support to arrive. It came at last and Italy win the penalty. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.41pm BST </p><p> 38 mins:  An early shove from the ABs gives Italy a free kick. Garbisi rakes a kick up field that is nowhere close to finding touch. B Barrett\u2019s return isn\u2019t great so that\u2019s a small win for the Italians who have the line-out. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.40pm BST </p><p>There\u2019s a break in play as Riccioni receives attention. That\u2019ll be a problem for Italy as they lost Fischetti around the 18th minute mark. Anyway, the scrum is just about ready to go. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.38pm BST </p><p> 37 mins:  Taylor is accurate again from the line-out. Savea with a strong carry. Jordan and Ioane involved. The Italian defence is struggling to keep up. They manage to pry the ball loose and will have the scrum feed but they look spent. They just can\u2019t get a foothold on the game. Crowley is on camera laughing in the coach\u2019s box. He\u2019ll be fuming on the inside.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.39pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 8.37pm BST </p><p> 36 mins:  Italy infringe at the breakdown right from the kick-off. Another very impressive carry from Frizell. He adds something few All Black flankers bring. J Barrett finds another good touch down field. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.35pm BST </p><p> TRY! New Zealand 42-3 Italy (Smith, 34)  </p><p> Smith has a hat-trick!  Again it\u2019s so simple. Mo\u2019unga with the show and go. J Barrett off the shoulder is found with a lovely pop pass. Smith, running a typically scrum-half\u2019s support line, is there to finish it under the poles. Mo\u2019unga could have back-heeled that if he wanted. He\u2019s not missing from there.</p><p>    Aaron Smith goes over for his hat-trick.

Ione goes it alone and is well tackled by Brex. Italy pinch it and hack it anywhere. Jordan counters and almost wriggles through. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.33pm BST </p><p> 32 mins:  The scrum takes an age to set and it ends with New Zealand winning the free-kick. Nothing is working for Italy. New Zealand call for another scrum just outside the 22 more or less in front of the poles. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.31pm BST </p><p> 30 mins:  Telea hammers Allan after making a lung bursting chase on Smith\u2019s high kick. New Zealand win the ball back and Frizell carries with meaty intent up the guts. He\u2019s there again and bumps off another tackler. He\u2019s having a great game. Ione at outside centre stoops to gather the ball but can\u2019t control it. Italy have a chance to catch their breath. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.28pm BST </p><p> TRY! New Zealand 35-3 Italy (Smith, 27)  </p><p> Too easy.  The maul sucked in all the Italian forwards. It turned slightly and opened up the blindside. Taylor recognised the chance, peeled away and then fed Smith off the shoulder. The nippy scrummie stepped and dotted down. Mo\u2019unga can\u2019t miss. New Zealand sending a reminder that they remain a force.</p><p>    Aaron Smith scores again! Photograph: Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images    </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.37pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 8.27pm BST </p><p> 27 mins:  J Barrett is kicking really well out of hand. He finds a great touch down field. Only 10 metres out. Taylor finds Retallick at the front. The maul sets. On it rumbles\u2026</p><p>block-time published-time 8.26pm BST </p><p> 25 mins:  Mo\u2019unga skews a kick out of touch just beyond New Zealand\u2019s 22. So Italy have a chance to launch an attack. Nope. Not when Nicotera can\u2019t throw straight from the line-out. Italy are falling apart. All Blacks get the scrum and win a penalty advantage. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.24pm BST </p><p> TRY! New Zealand 28-3 Italy (Savea, 22)  </p><p> Where was the Italian defence?  Off the back of the line-out, Savea has it on the loop. But rather than meet any resistance he simply canters through almost unopposed. Poor defence. Italy haven\u2019t shown up. Mo\u2019unga converts his easiest shot of the night. Eight missed tackles so far for the Italians. Just not good enough.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.24pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 8.22pm BST </p><p> 21 mins:  All New Zealand now. Taylor around half-way gets over the ball and steals a turnover. J Barrett hoofs it into touch near Italy\u2019s line. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.20pm BST </p><p> TRY! New Zealand 21-3 Italy (Telea, 19)  </p><p> Oh wow! They\u2019ve gone right up the field from the kick-off.  Savea with a superb line against the grain saw him burst up field and runn about 30 metres. B Barrett had it, spun out of a few tacklers and then spiralled a wide ball for Telea. The big man had a lot to do and didn\u2019t he do it well. Brushed off three Italians and wrestled the ball down. Mo\u2019unga makes no mistake from the left.</p><p>    Mark Telea holds off Tommaso Allan to score again for New Zealand.

New Zealand 14-3 Italy (Smith, 17)  </p><p>The rolling maul does it! It\u2019s an unlikely scorer in Smith. The little scrummie stole in and nabbed the ball at the right moment to go over. Frizell brought the ball down from the middle of the line-out and a strong shove got the maul rumbling. A few backs joined in and by the time Smith had the ball it was a done deal. Mo\u2019unga slots the conversion from the right.</p><p>    Aaron Smith scores for the All Blacks. Photograph: Andrew Fosker/Shutterstock    </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.29pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 8.17pm BST </p><p> 16 mins:  Taylor loops around the line-out and there\u2019s a mighty contact off the back of that set move. J Barrett running at pace meets Nicotera. But an Italian hasn\u2019t rolled away so it\u2019s another penalty. J Barrett kicks to the corner. Five out. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.15pm BST </p><p> 15 mins:  Retallick is clean at the line-out. Capuozzo fields a kick and sends it back. Mo\u2019unga returns the favour. Garbisi is wrapped up around halfway and J Barrett gets over the ball and makes the steal. Clinical. New Zealand nudge it to the 22.</p><p>block-time published-time 8.14pm BST </p><p> 14 mins:  Taylor goes short at the line-out with S Barrett bringing it down. A firm carry gives Smith the chance to clear. It\u2019s not out so Ione carries it back. Garbisi attempts a cross-kick to Capuozzo but can\u2019t find him. That one is straight out. Italy aren\u2019t here to take part. They\u2019re looking to play.</p><p>block-time published-time 8.12pm BST </p><p> 12 mins:  B Barrett hoofs his restart straight into touch. So Italy get the scrum on halfway. Brex down the right charges through midfield. Italy get wuick ball but New Zealand\u2019s defence is firm. Frizell with another mighty hit. Retallick slows it down but Italy still with it. Varney\u2019s box is outstanding on the angle. He puts it right in the corner.</p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.13pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 8.11pm BST </p><p> Penalty!

Ione gets hold of it and is wrapped up by Frizell. They keep it tight and until Savea loses his cool at the breakdown and coughs up a penalty. Allan, who hasn\u2019t missed a kick all tournament, lines up a shot at goal.</p><p>block-time published-time 8.08pm BST </p><p> TRY! New Zealand 7-0 Italy (Jordan, 7)  </p><p> What a try!  Pinpoint from B Barrett off the boot as his cross-kick to a flying Jordan is inch perfect. That still needed a lot of finishing. He was in the air when he dotted down under pressure. Sensational. Mo\u2019unga squeezes his conversion inside the right upright.</p><p>You\u2019ll want to get a clip of that finish from Jordan. A truly brilliant piece of athleticism.</p><p>    Will Jordan goes over in the corner to give New Zealand the lead. Photograph: Francis Bompard/AFP/Getty Images    </p><p>block-time updated-timeUpdated at 8.13pm BST</p><p>block-time published-time 8.07pm BST </p><p> 6 mins:  The go right. A neat wrap-round involving Mo\u2019unga almost makes the space but swift defence from the Italians snuffs it out. Papali\u2019i has to get things going again from a standing start. Smith is back to the 22. Retallick charges from short range. Then S Barrett. An Italian is off his feet so New Zealand have an advantage\u2026.</p><p>block-time published-time 8.04pm BST </p><p> 4 min:  Italy just about bring their line-out down. It wasn\u2019t clean ball. New Zealand got some jumpers up to disrupt. In their panic to exit, there\u2019s a forward pass from Italy. New Zealand will have the scrum 10m out right in front of the poles. Barrett standing right behind it. Could go either way.</p><p>block-time published-time 8.03pm BST </p><p> 3 min:  Negri gets it in the right tram. Swift hands from Garbisi and then Allan and Brex down the line. But New Zealand steal it getting over the ball. Now they run with Savea up to half way. Barrett up to first receiver shovels it on. The ball still hasn\u2019t gone out. Smith dinks a kick over the top and finds touch in Italy\u2019s 22.</p><p>block-time published-time 8.01pm BST </p><p> 1 min:  Telea catches and carries into the chasing Italians. B Barrett\u2019s exit isn\u2019t a brilliant one so Garbisi takes it back up field. Italy build in the middle of the park and Capuozzo jinks around a couple of tacklers. </p><p>block-time published-time 8.00pm BST </p><p> Here we go!  </p><p>Peeeeep!  Italy in white shirts and blue shorts kick off. The All Blacks, all in black, receive. Do or die for the three-times champs.</p><p>block-time published-time 7.58pm BST </p><p> Now for the Haka!  They start in a circular huddle. It\u2019s a slow build, a few calls and answers and then they break into formation. Aaron Smith holding a a stick/prop/faux spear (my apologies, I\u2019m not sure what it is). He\u2019s pretty motionless as the troops around whir and chant. A classic Haka.

Either the rugby world is going to experience a seismic shock that will recalibrate everything we thought we knew about the game and likely lead to revolution in an archipelago nation in the South Pacific. Or it will be business as usual and all the pre-match hype will dissipate in an instant.</p><p>If you\u2019re asking me, I\u2019m predicting the latter.</p><p>In 15 matches across 36 years, the New Zealand All Blacks have never lost to Italy. One game is recorded as a draw, though that was at the 2019 World Cup when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/oct/10/italy-sergio-parisse-all-blacks-rugby-world-cup-cancellation\">Typhoon Hagibis saw the sides share the points</url>. </p><p>When they have played, it\u2019s been pretty one-sided. Back at the 1999 World Cup New Zealand won by a staggering score of 101-3. There have been four other totals north of 70 and and five more between 50 and 69.</p><p>In fact, the closest Italy have come to an upset was in 2009 at the San Siro in Milan when they lost 20-6 to a second string All Blacks outfit.</p><p>But this is a different Italian side. Coached by the Kiwi Kieran Crowley \u2013 who won the 1987 World Cup after New Zealand kicked off their campaign with a win over Italy \u2013 they\u2019ve found extra gears on attack and a greater tenacity in defence.</p><p>Will it pay off?

Last year I remember strong winds but when we actually got there it was windy outside but, on the field, it wasn't too bad. </p><p>\"It'll be whether the rain comes down, too. I've been looking at the weather forecast every day and it has started to close in, it's now looking like it'll be wet and windy around kick-off time.\"</p><p>Scotland may have held the famous old trophy for two years now but, as ever, England start as heavy odds-on favourites. The conditions may be a levelling factor but Townsend is a coach, as he was a player, who would prefer a dry ball and track.</p><p>Asked if he would like to see a roof at Murrayfield, he smiled and replied: \"That would be a great idea. But I don't think it's happening anytime soon.\"</p><p>Townsend has made only one change to the starting XV that impressed at times, battled well but ultimately fell short 19-12 through a combination of poor discipline, misfortune and an inability to finish despite spending a full six minutes in the Irish 22.</p><p>Magnus Bradbury missed Dublin due to a minor thigh strain but returns to the No 8 jersey he filled so magnificently in last year's epic 38-38 meeting between the sides at Twickenham, his storming try proving critical in the  fightback surge.</p><p>\"I thought his performance at Twickenham last year as a No 8, it was the first time he'd played there for us, was outstanding,\" said Townsend. \"He had two really great carries off the base of the scrum, he had carries from restarts, under pressure, being the first man and gave us go-forward. </p><p>\"And a great run-in for a try, too. He was maybe 50-50 at the weekend and we knew it would have been a risky one if we played him. It enabled Nick [Haining] to show what he could do at international level. Magnus is fit this week and has trained fully.\"</p><p>Haining may have been an unknown quantity to many viewers last week but he was one of Scotland's standouts on the day.</p><p>Asked if it was a difficult  decision to drop him to the bench, Townsend said: \"Yes and no. It was a good debut from Nick but Magnus has played very well for us in the World Cup and at No 8 against England at Twickenham. He's worked more with the two back-row colleagues in Jamie [Ritchie] and Hamish [Watson]. We trained with Magnus at No 8 for about four or five days leading up to the Ireland game.\"</p><p>With the hype and mindgames flying around, it is important on these occasions to ensure the passion doesn't take away from the precision, something the coach accepts may have happened in that chastening first half at Twickenham last year.</p><p>Reflecting on how he dealt with that balance during his Calcutta Cup career, Townsend smiled and said: \"I don't think I did it very well because I lost nine times out of ten against England. </p><p>\"I used to get too pumped up... It's important our players are ready for the physical battle but are in control. In control of their discipline first of all but if they have that fire inside of them.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCTMAN-AE5FD2CD53D14E138F263199053943DBELM83986510SWTS</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCTMAN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y54-T2T1-JDPH-B1J3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">377101</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"609\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 JPIMedia Publishing Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Scotsman</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"13512\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 6, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Primary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>england rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>scotland rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Secondary Topics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sport</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rugby union</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>six nations</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N511000CC</classCode><className>PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The company said that the rainwater entered Hokuriku Shinkansen depot in Nagano when the Chikuma River overflowed. </p><p>The facility is used to store and repair bullet trains. The water caused damage to ten trains (120 carriages). According to The Japan Times, the total damage to the trains is estimated to be JPY32.8bn ($302.8m). The Hokuriku Shinkansen fleet is operated by both West Japan Railway Company (JR West) and JR East. Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) had to cancel the high-speed Tokaido Shinkansen train services from 12 to 13 October Both JR East and JR West have started an hourly service from Tokyo to Nagano. For access to the Hokuriku area and Kanazawa, JR East has directed passengers to use JR Central's Tokaido Shinkansen to Maibara station and take the Shirasagi Express operated by JR West. The Tokyo Metro service was suspended on 12 October. It resumed normal operations from 13 October. Japanese newspaper NHK reported that the Yamagata Shinkansen services were cancelled on 13 October. The services on the Tohoku and Akita Shinkansen services were delayed due to dirt and rocks on the tracks. The Sanyo Shinkansen and Tokaido services also commenced on 13 October.
