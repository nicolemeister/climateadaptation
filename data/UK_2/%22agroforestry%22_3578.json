For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p><br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>*Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach. Reported information following Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidelines for near-term target excludes Capital Goods, Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials, Employee Commuting, Downstream Transportation at Customer, and End of Life Treatment.The long-term target excludes these same categories, except for Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials and Employee Commuting. We have recalculated our base year 2018 and most recent years (2023 and 2024) inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards. Recent updates incorporate acquisitions Chipita and Ricolino. The footprint includes all acquisitions and divestitures to date except for Evirth. For more details, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual. Reported information is verified by an independent third-party and available in our ESG Reporting  Disclosure Reporting Archive. In the context of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an \"absolute target\" refers to a reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a specific percentage or amount, measured against a baseline year, rather than a reduction per unit of production or activity.<br/><br/>(2) Our near-term goal aligns with the latest standards and guidelines including the current SBTi Net Zero Standard (from March 2024) and the current SBTi FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) Guidance (from December 2023) by setting near-term targets in line with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.<br/><br/>(3) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for West Africa includes Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana.<br/><br/>(4) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 covers Brazil, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria unless otherwise stated (which differs from prior years).<br/><br/>(5) Reported information includes all divestitures to date and the following acquisitions (which were not included in previous years): Chipita, Clif bar, Give  Go, Gourmet Foods, Ricolino and Tate's Bake Shop except for Evirth (subject to future data integration).

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.<br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach. Reported information following Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidelines for near-term target excludes Capital Goods, Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials, Employee Commuting, Downstream Transportation at Customer, and End of Life Treatment.The long-term target excludes these same categories, except for Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials and Employee Commuting. We have recalculated our base year 2018 and most recent years (2023 and 2024) inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards. Recent updates incorporate acquisitions Chipita and Ricolino. The footprint includes all acquisitions and divestitures to date except for Evirth. For more details, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual. Reported information is verified by an independent third-party and available in our ESG Reporting  Disclosure Reporting Archive. In the context of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an \"absolute target\" refers to a reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a specific percentage or amount, measured against a baseline year, rather than a reduction per unit of production or activity.<br/><br/>(2) Our near-term goal aligns with the latest standards and guidelines including the current SBTi Net Zero Standard (from March 2024) and the current SBTi FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) Guidance (from December 2023) by setting near-term targets in line with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.<br/><br/>(3) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for West Africa includes Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana.<br/><br/>(4) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 covers Brazil, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria unless otherwise stated (which differs from prior years).<br/><br/>(5) Reported information includes all divestitures to date and the following acquisitions (which were not included in previous years): Chipita, Clif bar, Give  Go, Gourmet Foods, Ricolino and Tate's Bake Shop except for Evirth (subject to future data integration). We have recalculated our base year 2018 (where applicable) and most recent years (2023 and 2024) for year-over-year comparison.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.<br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach. Reported information following Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidelines for near-term target excludes Capital Goods, Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials, Employee Commuting, Downstream Transportation at Customer, and End of Life Treatment.The long-term target excludes these same categories, except for Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials and Employee Commuting. We have recalculated our base year 2018 and most recent years (2023 and 2024) inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards. Recent updates incorporate acquisitions Chipita and Ricolino. The footprint includes all acquisitions and divestitures to date except for Evirth. For more details, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual. Reported information is verified by an independent third-party and available in our ESG Reporting  Disclosure Reporting Archive. In the context of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an \"absolute target\" refers to a reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a specific percentage or amount, measured against a baseline year, rather than a reduction per unit of production or activity.<br/><br/>(2) Our near-term goal aligns with the latest standards and guidelines including the current SBTi Net Zero Standard (from March 2024) and the current SBTi FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) Guidance (from December 2023) by setting near-term targets in line with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.<br/><br/>(3) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for West Africa includes Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana.<br/><br/>(4) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 covers Brazil, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria unless otherwise stated (which differs from prior years).<br/><br/>(5) Reported information includes all divestitures to date and the following acquisitions (which were not included in previous years): Chipita, Clif bar, Give  Go, Gourmet Foods, Ricolino and Tate's Bake Shop except for Evirth (subject to future data integration). We have recalculated our base year 2018 (where applicable) and most recent years (2023 and 2024) for year-over-year comparison.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.<br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p><br/><br/>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.<br/><br/>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY<br/><br/>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.<br/><br/>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.<br/><br/>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway.(1) (2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.<br/><br/>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.<br/><br/>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.<br/><br/>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.<br/><br/>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.<br/><br/>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON<br/><br/>At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.<br/><br/>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>Completeness  Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)<br/><br/>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.<br/><br/>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.<br/><br/>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO2e emissions in base year 2018).(1)<br/><br/>CLIMATE RISKS  RESILIENT COMMUNITIES<br/><br/>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.<br/><br/>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.<br/><br/>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.<br/><br/>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.<br/><br/>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.<br/><br/>For more details please read our Annual Report<br/><br/>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION<br/><br/>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :<br/><br/>1 Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights<br/><br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/><br/>2 Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/><br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/><br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy<br/><br/>Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.<br/><br/>Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.<br/><br/>Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/><br/>3 Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/><br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.<br/><br/>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS<br/><br/>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS  INGREDIENT SOURCING<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA<br/><br/>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.<br/><br/>*Read more about our deforestation position on our website<br/><br/>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.<br/><br/>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.<br/><br/>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.<br/><br/>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices.(4)<br/><br/>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms.(29)<br/><br/>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry<br/><br/>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).<br/><br/>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:<br/><br/>*Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/><br/>*Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/><br/>*Biodiversity preservation.<br/><br/>*Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/><br/>*Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.<br/><br/>We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.<br/><br/>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.<br/><br/>Understanding Our Impact on Forests<br/><br/>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.<br/><br/>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria.<br/><br/>Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms.(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.<br/><br/>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact<br/><br/>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/><br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.<br/><br/>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes<br/><br/>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.<br/><br/>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY<br/><br/>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka and Philadelphia, and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.<br/><br/>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs<br/><br/>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018.<br/><br/>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.<br/><br/>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.<br/><br/>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.<br/><br/>Australia on Its Way<br/><br/>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.<br/><br/>Emerging Technologies  Innovations in Dairy<br/><br/>Our Research  Development (RD) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/><br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.<br/><br/>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation  Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.<br/><br/>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.<br/><br/>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector<br/><br/>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.<br/><br/>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.<br/><br/>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL<br/><br/>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.<br/><br/>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.<br/><br/>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.<br/><br/>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT<br/><br/>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.<br/><br/>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:<br/><br/>*Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/><br/>*Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/><br/>*Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/><br/>*Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.<br/><br/>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.<br/><br/>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact<br/><br/>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.<br/><br/>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.<br/><br/>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.<br/><br/>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.<br/><br/>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING<br/><br/>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023.(5)<br/><br/>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.<br/><br/>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS<br/><br/>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO2e emissions.(1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.<br/><br/>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/><br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.<br/><br/>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.<br/><br/>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.<br/><br/>PACKAGING<br/><br/>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.<br/><br/>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.<br/><br/>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS<br/><br/>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.<br/><br/>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.<br/><br/>INNOVATION<br/><br/>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:<br/><br/>*Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/><br/>*Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/><br/>*Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>*Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/><br/>*EcoDesign Development: RD colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/><br/>*Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.<br/><br/>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM<br/><br/>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials.(1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.<br/><br/>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.<br/><br/>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year.(1)<br/><br/>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1  2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.<br/><br/>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa.(1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.<br/><br/>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. <br/><br/>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach. Reported information following Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidelines for near-term target excludes Capital Goods, Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials, Employee Commuting, Downstream Transportation at Customer, and End of Life Treatment.The long-term target excludes these same categories, except for Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials and Employee Commuting. We have recalculated our base year 2018 and most recent years (2023 and 2024) inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards. Recent updates incorporate acquisitions Chipita and Ricolino. The footprint includes all acquisitions and divestitures to date except for Evirth. For more details, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual. Reported information is verified by an independent third-party and available in our ESG Reporting  Disclosure Reporting Archive. In the context of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an \"absolute target\" refers to a reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a specific percentage or amount, measured against a baseline year, rather than a reduction per unit of production or activity.<br/><br/>(2) Our near-term goal aligns with the latest standards and guidelines including the current SBTi Net Zero Standard (from March 2024) and the current SBTi FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) Guidance (from December 2023) by setting near-term targets in line with limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C.<br/><br/>(3) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for West Africa includes Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana.<br/><br/>(4) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 covers Brazil, Cameroon, Cote d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria unless otherwise stated (which differs from prior years).<br/><br/>(5) Reported information includes all divestitures to date and the following acquisitions (which were not included in previous years): Chipita, Clif bar, Give  Go, Gourmet Foods, Ricolino and Tate's Bake Shop except for Evirth (subject to future data integration). We have recalculated our base year 2018 (where applicable) and most recent years (2023 and 2024) for year-over-year comparison.

The collaboration aims to empower rural communities through decentralized finance and sustainable trade opportunities.<br/><br/>Driving Growth Through Blockchain Solutions<br/><br/>Bybit's $ 1 million liquidity investment is already fueling measurable results. To date, EthicHub has facilitated more than $ 5 million in loans across its network, maintaining a default rate below 3 percent, fully covered to protect lenders. The platform has also enabled the sale of over 300 tons of coffee, generating more than $ 2 million in revenue, and directly supporting more than 10.000 coffee farmers in LATAM.<br/><br/>So far, 40 percent of Bybit's investment has been deployed in two high-impact projects:<br/><br/>* Cosechando Riqueza (Chiapas, Mexico): supported 25 families cultivating 70 hectares of high-quality coffee, promoting agroforestry in regions historically affected by violence.<br/><br/>* Costal Campesino (Cauca and Nari\u00f1o, Colombia): helped 22 families producing \"Caf\u00e9 de Paz,\" or Peace Coffee -- a sustainable alternative for former guerrilla fighters transitioning from coca cultivation to coffee farming.<br/><br/>Coffees from these projects are expected to reach European markets starting in August, with a projected increase in sales beginning in September. Shipments of these coffees to Europe are scheduled to begin in August, with sales projected to reach approximately $ 1.3 million in the months ahead.<br/><br/>\"EthicHub's model is a powerful example of how blockchain technology can create real economic opportunities and resilience for farming communities that have long been underserved,\" said Freya Chen, Executive Director at the Blockchain for Good Alliance (BGA). \"The results we're seeing -- millions in loans, strong repayment rates, and growing coffee sales -- prove that decentralized finance can deliver measurable benefits on the ground.\"<br/><br/>#Bybit / #TheCryptoArk / #BGA<br/><br/>About Bybit<br/><br/>Bybit is the world's second-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, serving a global community of over 70 million users.

wildlife on a flagship farm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust has secured the funding from Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy to transform 48 hectares of Lower Moor Farm.</p><p>The project will combine conservation efforts with sustainable farming practices to increase biodiversity, improve climate resilience, provide natural flood management, and demonstrate how traditional farming can evolve to support wildlife.</p><p>The two-year project, which will launch in July, will see the creation of various habitats, including silvopasture roundels in the grazed pastureland at Lower Moor Farm.</p><p>This innovative agroforestry technique will boost the wildlife value of each field while ensuring they can continue to be used as grazing pasture.</p><p>This will not only support a healthy grazing herd but also significantly improve the welfare of individual animals.</p><p>Sam Stork, director for countryside and land management, said: \"This project, which has been made possible thanks to funding from WWCE, embodies our vision of helping nature to recover by looking inwards at our own land and ensuring we-re maximising wildlife benefits across all areas.</p><p>\"By introducing silvopasture techniques and improving how water interacts with our land, we're benefiting species, climate, and our local community.</p><p>\"The transformation of these 48 hectares will provide crucial habitat for species under pressure including invertebrates, birds, reptiles and amphibians, while maintaining productive grazing land for our farming enterprise.\"</p><p>The project will also include assessing how water interacts with the land.</p><p>A hydrological assessment will inform how the site can be improved for wildlife and potentially alleviate some localised flooding issues through allowing certain areas to become wetter or store water over the winter.</p><p>Julian Barlow, chair of WWCE, said: \"At Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy, one of our core aims is to protect and enhance wildlife across the county, so I'm pleased to be able to support the Lower Moor Farm project with 100,000 of funding.</p><p>\"We believe in the power of community-led action to restore nature and tackle the climate crisis, and this project represents an exciting opportunity to encourage a proliferation of species across our landscapes, while engaging people in the long-term care and recovery of our natural environment.</p><p>\"We-re thrilled to play a part in making that happen and look forward to seeing it get underway.\"</p><p>The transformation aligns with research showing that wood pasture systems provide additional benefits, including enhanced carbon sequestration and soil water retention, all crucial elements for adapting to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It aims to contribute to rural households' food, nutrition, and income security through a more sustainable ecosystem, particularly targeting women, youth, and vulnerable communities living in the Cherangany Hills and Mau West water towers.<br/><br/>\"It is now evident from our work that natural resource management is linked to livelihood activities and agroforestry can be sustainable and provide multiple benefits. INReMP will leverage knowledge from our projects and scale-up interventions that have been proven to work in our previous investments in the country,\" said Sara Mbago-Bhunu, Regional Director.<br/><br/>PR-49-2025<br/><br/>@Ministry of Agriculture<br/><br/>Agriculture contributes 33 per cent to Kenya's GDP and employs 53 per cent of the population, but farming output has not kept up with the rapid population growth of nearly 2 per cent annually. At the same time, Kenya is ranked 52 amongst the most vulnerable countries to climate change and extreme weather, contributing to low yields, loss of livelihoods, and depletion of natural resources.<br/><br/>\"This programme is not just about conserving the environment, it's about securing the livelihoods of our rural communities, restoring their natural resources, and building resilience for future generations,\" said Hon. FCPA John Mbadi Ng'ong'o', Cabinet Secretary, The National Treasury and Economic Planning.<br/><br/>Current projections indicate that temperatures will rise by 1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C from 2046 to 2065, with erratic rainfall patterns and increasing droughts and floods, which severely impact agriculture. In addition, the country's natural resources are threatened by over-exploitation and unsustainable land use practices.<br/><br/>The Cherangany Hills and Mau Forest are two of Kenya's five major water towers, vital for water supply and ecosystem health. Despite this, rural communities living within these two water towers face high levels of natural resource degradation, over-reliance on unsustainable economic activities, cross-boundary conflicts and limited access to water for irrigation infrastructure and inefficient resource use.<br/><br/>To boost the communities' resilience to the climate shocks, the project will support them in managing their forests, rangelands, arable land, wetlands and water resources. This will lead to an increase in forest cover and carbon sequestration while decreasing soil erosion and reducing natural resources-related conflicts.<br/><br/>To ensure these conservation efforts bring long-term benefits, the project will also help farmers generate income through activities such as dairy, poultry, apiculture, horticulture, and agroforestry. In addition, the project will invest in climate-proofed water infrastructure, climate and weather information systems, renewable energy, and facilitate access to climate financing.<br/><br/>The total cost of the programme is US$ 262.8 financed by IFAD (US$ 126.8 million), Green Climate Fund (US$ 40 million), the Government of Kenya (US$ 23.5 million), Global Environment Fund (US$ 7.14 million), the private sector (US$ 10.1 million) and project participants (US$ 8 million). A financing envelope of US$ 47 million is open to new and interested financiers.<br/><br/>Since 1979, IFAD and its partners have financed 21 projects with a total of US$ 1.2 billion, reaching over four million households in Kenya.<br/><br/>Note to editors:<br/><br/>Water Towers are elevated landscapes, usually forested and act as water catchment areas. The water in these catchment areas soaks into the ground, gets stored, and is gradually released into springs, rivers, and lakes. This natural process supports diverse ecosystems and provides water for use.<br/><br/>Media contact: Linda Odhiambo | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:l.odhiambo@ifad.org\">l.odhiambo@ifad.org</email> | +254 780 320073<br/><br/>Follow on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, X, YouTube<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>No.: IFAD/49/2025<br/><br/>IFAD is an international financial institution, and a United Nations specialized agency.

It aims to contribute to rural households' food, nutrition, and income security through a more sustainable ecosystem, particularly targeting women, youth, and vulnerable communities living in the Cherangany Hills and Mau West water towers.<br/><br/>\"It is now evident from our work that natural resource management is linked to livelihood activities and agroforestry can be sustainable and provide multiple benefits. INReMP will leverage knowledge from our projects and scale-up interventions that have been proven to work in our previous investments in the country,\" said Sara Mbago-Bhunu, Regional Director.<br/><br/>PR-49-2025<br/><br/>@Ministry of Agriculture<br/><br/>Agriculture contributes 33 per cent to Kenya's GDP and employs 53 per cent of the population, but farming output has not kept up with the rapid population growth of nearly 2 per cent annually. At the same time, Kenya is ranked 52 amongst the most vulnerable countries to climate change and extreme weather, contributing to low yields, loss of livelihoods, and depletion of natural resources.<br/><br/>\"This programme is not just about conserving the environment, it's about securing the livelihoods of our rural communities, restoring their natural resources, and building resilience for future generations,\" said Hon. FCPA John Mbadi Ng'ong'o', Cabinet Secretary, The National Treasury and Economic Planning.<br/><br/>Current projections indicate that temperatures will rise by 1.5\u00b0C to 2.5\u00b0C from 2046 to 2065, with erratic rainfall patterns and increasing droughts and floods, which severely impact agriculture. In addition, the country's natural resources are threatened by over-exploitation and unsustainable land use practices.<br/><br/>The Cherangany Hills and Mau Forest are two of Kenya's five major water towers, vital for water supply and ecosystem health. Despite this, rural communities living within these two water towers face high levels of natural resource degradation, over-reliance on unsustainable economic activities, cross-boundary conflicts and limited access to water for irrigation infrastructure and inefficient resource use.<br/><br/>To boost the communities' resilience to the climate shocks, the project will support them in managing their forests, rangelands, arable land, wetlands and water resources. This will lead to an increase in forest cover and carbon sequestration while decreasing soil erosion and reducing natural resources-related conflicts.<br/><br/>To ensure these conservation efforts bring long-term benefits, the project will also help farmers generate income through activities such as dairy, poultry, apiculture, horticulture, and agroforestry. In addition, the project will invest in climate-proofed water infrastructure, climate and weather information systems, renewable energy, and facilitate access to climate financing.<br/><br/>The total cost of the programme is US$ 262.8 financed by IFAD (US$ 126.8 million), Green Climate Fund (US$ 40 million), the Government of Kenya (US$ 23.5 million), Global Environment Fund (US$ 7.14 million), the private sector (US$ 10.1 million) and project participants (US$ 8 million). A financing envelope of US$ 47 million is open to new and interested financiers.<br/><br/>Since 1979, IFAD and its partners have financed 21 projects with a total of US$ 1.2 billion, reaching over four million households in Kenya.<br/><br/>Note to editors:<br/><br/>Water Towers are elevated landscapes, usually forested and act as water catchment areas. The water in these catchment areas soaks into the ground, gets stored, and is gradually released into springs, rivers, and lakes. This natural process supports diverse ecosystems and provides water for use.<br/><br/>Media contact: Linda Odhiambo | <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:l.odhiambo@ifad.org\">l.odhiambo@ifad.org</email> | +254 780 320073<br/><br/>Follow on Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, X, YouTube<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>No.: IFAD/49/2025<br/><br/>IFAD is an international financial institution, and a United Nations specialized agency.

Throughout the year, the Foundation provides funding to help its partners improve nutrition and create opportunities for financial stability. Each project is community-led and designed to create lasting impact in communities worldwide.</p><p><br/><br/>From supporting agroforestry in Bolivia to improving children's access to healthy food in American schools, these carefully selected programs represent the Foundation's dedication to fostering sustainable economic growth and resilience where it's needed most. Learn more about each project below:<br/><br/>Chef Ann Foundation | United States<br/><br/>The Foundation's long-term partner, Chef Ann Foundation, which promotes scratch cooking in schools across the United States, will receive a 1-year, $ 300,000 grant to support 8 fellows in the Healthy School Food Pathway Fellowship program (HSFP). This fellowship is a 13-month program designed for mid-level school food professionals-like chefs, site managers, and supervisors-who are committed to transforming school food systems to be healthier. This program was developed in response to a needs assessment report conducted by the Food Institute Group in collaboration with the Chef Ann Foundation, which identified the current gaps in approaches in school food transformation. This project aims to address the critical workforce development gap in school food systems that are not currently addressed by other programs.<br/><br/>Chomateo | Bolivia<br/><br/>Chomateo, a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 50,000 grant that will support 110 smallholder farmers working in agroforestry across Bolivia. The organization focuses its efforts on adding value to coffee, cocoa, and forest products like artisanal soaps and essential oils. Alongside supporting farmers, Chomateo is committed to sustainable livelihoods, preserving biodiversity and enhancing cultural heritage.<br/><br/>ColdHubs | Nigeria<br/><br/>ColdHubs, a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 350,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to maintain and grow their network of solar-powered cold rooms and ice points that will serve small-scale rural markets, while providing post-harvest management trainings to smallholder farmers. Food spoilage is a widespread challenge for Nigerian farmers- over 90 million smallholder farmers report lost wages due to lack of cold storage at key points along the food supply chain. ColdHubs will use their funds to implement three new cold hubs and three ice points, impacting an estimated 640 smallholder farmers and market retailers. This is projected to increase their annual revenues by 55-65%.<br/><br/>J-Palm | Liberia<br/><br/>J-Palm Liberia (JPL), a partner of the Foundation since 2021, will receive a $ 448,528 3-year, zero percent interest loan. This funding will allow the organization to expand their harvesting initiatives by purchasing palm from 3,500 wild palm collectors. In addition, JPL has purchased a new machine to transform the discarded palm kernel shells into fuel efficient briquettes. They plan to market these briquettes to the Liberian public as a cheaper and cleaner source of fuel. To date, J-Palm Liberia has received $ 686,548 in funding from the Foundation.<br/><br/>Kawadah Farm | Liberia<br/><br/>Smallholder farmers across West Africa face significant challenges, including limited access to infrastructure, farming techniques, and advanced food processing technologies, making it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Kawadah Farm Liberia (KFL) is a for-profit social enterprise in Liberia that sources cassava, soybeans and gari (processed cassava) from Liberian smallholder farmers. Kawadah Farm Liberia will use their 3-year, no-interest loan of $ 290,000 to increase processing capacity so they can expand their network to reach 5,000 more farmers, provide training and small tool loans to increase farmer production and increase smallholder income in Liberia.<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited | Tanzania<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited (KKL), a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 300,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to purchase cocoa from a minimum of 533 farmers. Because cocoa is a year-round crop, these funds will be leveraged multiple times a year. Kokoa Kamili will also provide smallholder cocoa farmers with comprehensive services including seedlings, agronomic support, organic certification support, and above market pricing for their cocoa harvest through access to global premium markets.<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks | Cote d'Ivoire<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks is a for-profit social enterprise that creates additional income for smallholder farmers in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire by sourcing cocoa fruit juice- a byproduct of cocoa bean harvesting that is typically discarded- and transforming it into a marketable beverage. As a first-time partner, Kumasi Drinks will receive a 1-year $ 66,600 loan to bring online its Cote d'Ivoire supply chain, starting with cocoa juice purchases from 231 farmers to fulfill the needs of Ivorio, a leading juice brand in West Africa. In future cycles, they expect to grow their sourcing capacity through the Ivorio partnership and reach 1,286 farmers over the next 3 years.<br/><br/>Partners for Education, Agriculture and Sustainability (PEAS) | Texas<br/><br/>Partners for Education, Agriculture and Sustainability (PEAS), has been a partner with the Foundation since 2015. They will receive a 1-year, $ 100,000 grant to support 8 of their core staff members in engaging 4,500 students at 28 school sites across the Austin, TX metro area in garden education. PEAS also operates in a high-need area: the schools they serve have an average of 69% of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, notably above the national average.

Throughout the year, the Foundation provides funding to help its partners improve nutrition and create opportunities for financial stability. Each project is community-led and designed to create lasting impact in communities worldwide.</p><p><br/><br/>From supporting agroforestry in Bolivia to improving children's access to healthy food in American schools, these carefully selected programs represent the Foundation's dedication to fostering sustainable economic growth and resilience where it's needed most. Learn more about each project below:<br/><br/>Chef Ann Foundation | United States<br/><br/>The Foundation's long-term partner, Chef Ann Foundation, which promotes scratch cooking in schools across the United States, will receive a 1-year, $ 300,000 grant to support 8 fellows in the Healthy School Food Pathway Fellowship program (HSFP). This fellowship is a 13-month program designed for mid-level school food professionals-like chefs, site managers, and supervisors-who are committed to transforming school food systems to be healthier. This program was developed in response to a needs assessment report conducted by the Food Institute Group in collaboration with the Chef Ann Foundation, which identified the current gaps in approaches in school food transformation. This project aims to address the critical workforce development gap in school food systems that are not currently addressed by other programs.<br/><br/>Chomateo | Bolivia<br/><br/>Chomateo, a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 50,000 grant that will support 110 smallholder farmers working in agroforestry across Bolivia. The organization focuses its efforts on adding value to coffee, cocoa, and forest products like artisanal soaps and essential oils. Alongside supporting farmers, Chomateo is committed to sustainable livelihoods, preserving biodiversity and enhancing cultural heritage.<br/><br/>ColdHubs | Nigeria<br/><br/>ColdHubs, a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 350,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to maintain and grow their network of solar-powered cold rooms and ice points that will serve small-scale rural markets, while providing post-harvest management trainings to smallholder farmers. Food spoilage is a widespread challenge for Nigerian farmers- over 90 million smallholder farmers report lost wages due to lack of cold storage at key points along the food supply chain. ColdHubs will use their funds to implement three new cold hubs and three ice points, impacting an estimated 640 smallholder farmers and market retailers. This is projected to increase their annual revenues by 55-65%.<br/><br/>J-Palm | Liberia<br/><br/>J-Palm Liberia (JPL), a partner of the Foundation since 2021, will receive a $ 448,528 3-year, zero percent interest loan. This funding will allow the organization to expand their harvesting initiatives by purchasing palm from 3,500 wild palm collectors. In addition, JPL has purchased a new machine to transform the discarded palm kernel shells into fuel efficient briquettes. They plan to market these briquettes to the Liberian public as a cheaper and cleaner source of fuel. To date, J-Palm Liberia has received $ 686,548 in funding from the Foundation.<br/><br/>Kawadah Farm | Liberia<br/><br/>Smallholder farmers across West Africa face significant challenges, including limited access to infrastructure, farming techniques, and advanced food processing technologies, making it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Kawadah Farm Liberia (KFL) is a for-profit social enterprise in Liberia that sources cassava, soybeans and gari (processed cassava) from Liberian smallholder farmers. Kawadah Farm Liberia will use their 3-year, no-interest loan of $ 290,000 to increase processing capacity so they can expand their network to reach 5,000 more farmers, provide training and small tool loans to increase farmer production and increase smallholder income in Liberia.<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited | Tanzania<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited (KKL), a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 300,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to purchase cocoa from a minimum of 533 farmers. Because cocoa is a year-round crop, these funds will be leveraged multiple times a year. Kokoa Kamili will also provide smallholder cocoa farmers with comprehensive services including seedlings, agronomic support, organic certification support, and above market pricing for their cocoa harvest through access to global premium markets.<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks | Cote d'Ivoire<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks is a for-profit social enterprise that creates additional income for smallholder farmers in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire by sourcing cocoa fruit juice- a byproduct of cocoa bean harvesting that is typically discarded- and transforming it into a marketable beverage. As a first-time partner, Kumasi Drinks will receive a 1-year $ 66,600 loan to bring online its Cote d'Ivoire supply chain, starting with cocoa juice purchases from 231 farmers to fulfill the needs of Ivorio, a leading juice brand in West Africa. In future cycles, they expect to grow their sourcing capacity through the Ivorio partnership and reach 1,286 farmers over the next 3 years.<br/><br/>Partners for Education, Agriculture and Sustainability (PEAS) | Texas<br/><br/>Partners for Education, Agriculture and Sustainability (PEAS), has been a partner with the Foundation since 2015. They will receive a 1-year, $ 100,000 grant to support 8 of their core staff members in engaging 4,500 students at 28 school sites across the Austin, TX metro area in garden education. PEAS also operates in a high-need area: the schools they serve have an average of 69% of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, notably above the national average. PEAS will also use their grant to develop supplemental revenue streams, including caregiver cooking classes, PEAS farm field trips, professional development services, workshops and presentations, consultation, summer camps, and curriculum.<br/><br/>Since 2005, Whole Foods Market Foundation, has invested over $ 197 million supporting over 16,750 partner organizations and schools in 81countries around the world.<br/><br/>For more information, visit wholefoodsmarketfoundation.org/funding-announcements.<br/><br/>ABOUT WHOLE FOODS MARKET FOUNDATION<br/><br/>Whole Foods Market Foundation works to nourish people and the planet by providing access to essential resources to improve nutrition and create opportunities for financial stability.

permission to live in an off-grid cabin in the woods for three years to establish the enterprise.<br/>Torridge District Council is being asked to approve a temporary rural worker's dwelling for Damon Palmer and Lindsay Smith as well as retrospective planning permission for a packing shed.<br/>The goal by the applicants is to restore ancient woodland and establish Wolf Valley Woodland Farm in the 11-hectare Slew Wood, south of Roadford Lake.<br/>They will integrate woodland management, organic food production, and off-grid living principles, in line with their commitment to low-impact development, planning documents say.<br/>They plan to produce high-value timber, harvest charcoal, raise livestock such as goats and sheep and grow wild mushrooms.<br/>Horse-powered timber extraction would be used to minimise the use of machines.<br/>A woodland management plan is being developed with the aim of enhancing biodiversity, improving carbon sequestration and regenerating soils through productive land use.<br/>Once approved by the Forestry Commission, the site will be managed with a focus on sustainability.<br/>The applicants say the proposed temporary dwelling will enable them to continue developing the enterprise in a way that is 'ecologically regenerative and economically viable'.<br/>They said many tasks require attention outside conventional working hours and a\u00a0temporary home for three years would support the early stages of the project, allowing them 'to demonstrate the long-term viability of the enterprise and potentially justify future applications for permanent accommodation'.<br/>Mounted on blocks for easy relocation, the cabin would have solar panels with battery storage, rainwater harvesting and a compost toilet.<br/>ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE

They would like to further develop the ecological understanding and practical application of agroforestry principles on their farm.</p><p>Laura Simpson from Parc y Dderwen, Llangolman, Pembrokeshire would like to investigate the establishment of perennial horticulture crops to seek out alternative routes for business diversification. She's hoping to monitor and report on ground cultivation, planting, establishment, weeding, and pest management throughout the season, including perennial bed overwintering for next year's healthy crop.</p><p>The other local farmers added to the network are Andrew Rees, Moor Farm, Rhosson, Pembrokeshire (Dairy); Jonathan Evans, Berry Hill, Newport, Pembrokeshire (Dairy); and Michael James, Nant Yr Hebog, Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire (Dairy).</p><p>Another farm added to the Our Farms Network is Pengelli Isaf, Caernarfon run by Tudur Parry. Energy and electricity are a major cost to the business like any other dairy farming business. Tudur is hoping to explore cost-effective energy alternatives, by performing a feasibility study on renewable electricity production, calculating the return on investment and payback period to offset bank interest expenses.</p><p>These farmers are joined by Aled Wyn Evans, Fferm Penllyn, Tywyn, Meirionnydd (Red Meat); Leonard Griffith Swain, Ty'n Yr Onnen, Waunfawr, Gwynedd (Woodland); Rhodri Jones, Pen y Parc, Llanerfyl, Montgomeryshire (Dairy); Jonathan Lewis, Carneddau, Builth Wells, Brecknock (Red Meat); Peter and Jacob Anthony, Cwmrisca Farm, Ton-du, Bridgend; and Caryl Hughes, Tuhwntir Afon, Llanarmon, Dyffryn Ceiriog.</p><p>Through Farming Connect's Our Farms network, and with support from sector-specific industry experts, farmers have been driving improvements in efficiency, sustainability, and profitability since 2015.</p><p>Siwan Howatson, Head of Technical at Farming Connect, says, \"The network provides a fantastic platform for practical, on-farm innovation, driven by the farmers themselves. The diverse range of projects, from regenerative practices and renewable energy to animal health and diversification into horticulture and agroforestry, truly reflects the commitment within the Welsh agricultural sector to embrace new technologies and sustainable approaches for a resilient and profitable future.\"</p><p>Read More</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.narberth-and-whitland-today.co.uk/news/entertainment/paul-davies-ms-hosts-festival-launch-to-promote-major-programme-of-summer-concerts-789457\">Paul Davies MS hosts festival launch to promote major programme of summer concerts</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.narberth-and-whitland-today.co.uk/news/community-news/milford-haven-royal-marine-cadets-invite-young-adventurers-in-pembrokeshire-789551\">Milford Haven Royal Marine Cadets invite young adventurers in Pembrokeshire</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.narberth-and-whitland-today.co.uk/news/community-news/genealogy-expert-colin-potter-guides-narberth-probus-club-on-tracing-family-history-789030\">Genealogy expert on family history at Narberth Probus</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.narberth-and-whitland-today.co.uk/news/community-news/alison-jones-raises-ps1095-for-guide-dogs-on-pembrokeshire-coast-path-walk-788336\">Alison Jones' Pembrokeshire coast walk raises over \u00a31k for Guide Dogs</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWHVER-httpswwwnarberthandwhitlandtodaycouknewsfarmingfarmingconnectsourfarmsnetworkwelcomes12newfarms788641</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWHVER2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FPX-J8H3-RRSB-724H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">485370</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"533\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Tindle News  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Narberth &amp;

Throughout the year, the Foundation provides funding to help its partners improve nutrition and create opportunities for financial stability. Each project is community-led and designed to create lasting impact in communities worldwide.</p><p><br/><br/>From supporting agroforestry in Bolivia to improving children's access to healthy food in American schools, these carefully selected programs represent the Foundation's dedication to fostering sustainable economic growth and resilience where it's needed most. Learn more about each project below:<br/><br/>Chef Ann Foundation | United States<br/><br/>The Foundation's long-term partner, Chef Ann Foundation, which promotes scratch cooking in schools across the United States, will receive a 1-year, $ 300,000 grant to support 8 fellows in the Healthy School Food Pathway Fellowship program (HSFP). This fellowship is a 13-month program designed for mid-level school food professionals-like chefs, site managers, and supervisors-who are committed to transforming school food systems to be healthier. This program was developed in response to a needs assessment report conducted by the Food Institute Group in collaboration with the Chef Ann Foundation, which identified the current gaps in approaches in school food transformation. This project aims to address the critical workforce development gap in school food systems that are not currently addressed by other programs.<br/><br/>Chomateo | Bolivia<br/><br/>Chomateo, a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 50,000 grant that will support 110 smallholder farmers working in agroforestry across Bolivia. The organization focuses its efforts on adding value to coffee, cocoa, and forest products like artisanal soaps and essential oils. Alongside supporting farmers, Chomateo is committed to sustainable livelihoods, preserving biodiversity and enhancing cultural heritage.<br/><br/>ColdHubs | Nigeria<br/><br/>ColdHubs, a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 350,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to maintain and grow their network of solar-powered cold rooms and ice points that will serve small-scale rural markets, while providing post-harvest management trainings to smallholder farmers. Food spoilage is a widespread challenge for Nigerian farmers- over 90 million smallholder farmers report lost wages due to lack of cold storage at key points along the food supply chain. ColdHubs will use their funds to implement three new cold hubs and three ice points, impacting an estimated 640 smallholder farmers and market retailers. This is projected to increase their annual revenues by 55-65%.<br/><br/>J-Palm | Liberia<br/><br/>J-Palm Liberia (JPL), a partner of the Foundation since 2021, will receive a $ 448,528 3-year, zero percent interest loan. This funding will allow the organization to expand their harvesting initiatives by purchasing palm from 3,500 wild palm collectors. In addition, JPL has purchased a new machine to transform the discarded palm kernel shells into fuel efficient briquettes. They plan to market these briquettes to the Liberian public as a cheaper and cleaner source of fuel. To date, J-Palm Liberia has received $ 686,548 in funding from the Foundation.<br/><br/>Kawadah Farm | Liberia<br/><br/>Smallholder farmers across West Africa face significant challenges, including limited access to infrastructure, farming techniques, and advanced food processing technologies, making it difficult to sustain their livelihoods. Kawadah Farm Liberia (KFL) is a for-profit social enterprise in Liberia that sources cassava, soybeans and gari (processed cassava) from Liberian smallholder farmers. Kawadah Farm Liberia will use their 3-year, no-interest loan of $ 290,000 to increase processing capacity so they can expand their network to reach 5,000 more farmers, provide training and small tool loans to increase farmer production and increase smallholder income in Liberia.<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited | Tanzania<br/><br/>Kokoa Kamili Limited (KKL), a new partner of the Foundation, will receive a $ 300,000, 3-year, zero percent interest loan to purchase cocoa from a minimum of 533 farmers. Because cocoa is a year-round crop, these funds will be leveraged multiple times a year. Kokoa Kamili will also provide smallholder cocoa farmers with comprehensive services including seedlings, agronomic support, organic certification support, and above market pricing for their cocoa harvest through access to global premium markets.<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks | Cote d'Ivoire<br/><br/>Kumasi Drinks is a for-profit social enterprise that creates additional income for smallholder farmers in Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire by sourcing cocoa fruit juice- a byproduct of cocoa bean harvesting that is typically discarded- and transforming it into a marketable beverage. As a first-time partner, Kumasi Drinks will receive a 1-year $ 66,600 loan to bring online its Cote d'Ivoire supply chain, starting with cocoa juice purchases from 231 farmers to fulfill the needs of Ivorio, a leading juice brand in West Africa. In future cycles, they expect to grow their sourcing capacity through the Ivorio partnership and reach 1,286 farmers over the next 3 years.<br/><br/>Partners for Education, Agriculture and Sustainability (PEAS) | Texas<br/><br/>Partners for Education, Agriculture and Sustainability (PEAS), has been a partner with the Foundation since 2015. They will receive a 1-year, $ 100,000 grant to support 8 of their core staff members in engaging 4,500 students at 28 school sites across the Austin, TX metro area in garden education. PEAS also operates in a high-need area: the schools they serve have an average of 69% of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch, notably above the national average.

Ghana.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Caendon, an international development charity based in Llandudno, has been awarded a 9,900 grant to support an agroforestry programme in the African country.</p><p>READ MORE:</p><p>Stranded yacht saved by Conwy and Llandudno lifeboat crews<br/></p><p>The project, which will be implemented over 2024 and 2025, will provide assistance for tree planting, which will help to alleviate poverty and benefit the environment.</p><p>Caendon said the project will have a \"significant climate change mitigation impact\" as trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p><p>The scheme will also help to improve biodiversity and will provide alternative livelihoods for those suffering from crop failures due to climate change.</p><p>Part of the grant will also be used to help develop sustainable coffee production.</p><p>Caendon is working with four partner NGOs in Ghana, and the grant will help to provide access to seedlings, training, networking, and financial support.</p><p>The charity said the project demonstrates the Welsh Government's commitment to tackling long-term problems such as poverty, health inequalities, and climate change, as set out in the Wellbeing of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015.</p><p>The project will also provide a link between communities in Wales and Africa through a volunteer opportunities programme, allowing people in Wales to be part of the project.</p><p>Caendon also plans to share the lessons learnt from the project with organisations and young people in Wales to help increase their understanding of conservation in other parts of the world.</p><p>The project is funded through the Welsh Government's 'Wales and Africa' grant scheme, which is administered by the WCVA.</p><p>A spokesman for Caendon said: \"This project will not only deliver an environmental benefit but will also help alleviate poverty.</p><p>\"Trees are known to be one of the primary means of absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and so this project has a significant climate change mitigation impact.</p><p>\"The tree planting scheme being implemented will also provide additional environmental and biodiversity improvement benefits, a wider aspiration that agroforestry seeks to achieve.\"</p><p>For further information on Caendon or this project, email <email

And that's because they once let slip the chores their children have been set during a previous school break -and it is not the usual tidying up or washing the dishes. </p><p>Back in 2022 during a visit to Wales, Kate once told how George had been put to work while enjoying some time at at the family's Anmer HallNorfolk home on the Sandringham estate.</p><p>On a visit to a goat farm with Prince William, Kate told how George had been responsible for moving animal feed on the estate. It came after William spotted a robot silage sweeper in one of the barns and pointed it out to the farmer. The farmer then explained it could also be used to move feed, and Kate replied: \"That was George's job at half term - moving feed.\"</p><p>After William told his host his children had been getting involved on the farm at Sandringham, where his own dad Charles has been working to turn the estate into a fully organic operation and added: \"We are trying some Agroforestry as well.\"</p><p>It comes as royal expert Jennie Bond told the Mirror that one major issue facing parents everywhere this summer is how much screen time to allow their children, something William and Kate will be painfully aware of as they navigate raising their kids in a digital world.</p><p>In recent times, on a trip to the Lake District with the Scouts, Kate has talked about getting out into nature and using traditional paper maps rather than relying on phones to plot walking routes. Meanwhile, William has also warned youngsters about the importance of putting down their devices.</p><p>And with the holidays in full swing, Jennie explained: \"William has spoken about George's love of video games, and they have both talked about 'regulating' their children's screen time. Even TV watching can apparently be problematic, with battles over who should be in charge of the remote.</p><p>\"But, especially with Catherine's expertise in children's development, I'm sure they'll be pretty rigorous about monitoring who watches what -and for how long.\"</p><p>But it's not just screen time that Jennie believes Kate will be keeping an eye on; she also thinks that the princess will be encouraging her children to pull their weight around the house.</p><p>And even though it might be the summer holidays and a time for fun, Jennie believes simple jobs might still remain for the children, set by Kate and William. </p><p>She explained: \"I wouldn't be in the least surprised if the children were given a few household chores such as tidying their rooms, filling the dishwasher, brushing the dog and cleaning up after the puppies.</p><p>\"William and Catherine have both lived life outside the Palace walls, shopping, cooking and cleaning when they were at university and, afterwards, when they lived on Anglesey. They will want their children to understand that, even if you're royal, you can still treat your home and parents with respect -and pull your weight.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MIRONL-113401479</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MIRONL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBS-XWG3-RWBX-T16C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">419001</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"519\"/><timeReceived>7:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Reach PLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>mirror.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"36685\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 26, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper;

nitf:lede=\"true\">The Wiltshire Wildlife Trust was awarded the funding by Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy to enhance the Lower Moor Farm nature reserve as part of their 2030 strategy to increase species abundance.</p><p>This will transform more than 48 hectares of the flagship site into various habitats using a combination of conservation and sustainable farming.</p><p/><p>Read more: Thames Water warns that hosepipe ban is inevitable unless things change</p><p/><p>The reserve at Lower Moor Farm Complex, near Cricklade, represents 37 per cent of the entire 129-hectare site.</p><p>It is currently pastureland and as part of the work will be transformed into silvopasture roundels - an agroforestry technique.</p><p>This means the site will be able to continue as pastureland, supporting the herd of Shorthorn cattle, while it will also create a range of habitats to support wildlife.</p><p>These areas also have benefits for climate change as they have better carbon sequestration and soil water retention.</p><p>The project is due to start in July 2025 and will take two years.</p><p>In that time, a hydrological assessment will look at how water interacts with the site and how it could be used to reduce localised flooding.</p><p>Sam Stork, director for countryside and land management at the trust, said: \"This project, which has been made possible thanks to funding from WWCE, embodies our vision of helping nature to recover by looking inwards at our own land and ensuring we-re maximising wildlife benefits across all areas.</p><p>\"By introducing silvopasture techniques and improving how water interacts with our land, we're benefiting species, climate, and our local community.</p><p>\"The transformation of these 48 hectares will provide crucial habitat for species under pressure, including invertebrates, birds, reptiles, and amphibians, while maintaining productive grazing land for our farming enterprise.\"</p><p>Over the next few months, the trust will consult with stakeholders, including Natural England and other site users, to finalise the project design.</p><p/><p>Read more: Met Office warns another heatwave is heading for UK</p><p>There will be monitoring throughout the project to see how it impacts species abundance and diversity.</p><p>Julian Barlow, chair of Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy, said: \"At Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy, one of our core aims is to protect and enhance wildlife across the county, so I'm pleased to be able to support the Lower Moor Farm project with 100,000 of funding.</p><p>\"We believe in the power of community-led action to restore nature and tackle the climate crisis, and this project represents an exciting opportunity to encourage a proliferation of species across our landscapes, while engaging people in the long-term care and recovery of our natural environment.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

and climate resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Lothian Esk Catchment Partnership (LECP) aims to restore nature and address climate change in the Lothian Esk river catchment area, which spans across East Lothian and Midlothian.</p><p>The partnership brings together Forth Rivers Trust, East Lothian Council, Midlothian Council, NatureScot, SEPA and Scottish Water to pool expertise and resources.</p><p>A spokesman for the LECP said: \"We are incredibly thankful to NatureScot for providing the funding to kickstart our ambitions for landscape-scale restoration in the Lothian Esk catchment.</p><p>\"Working closely with landowners and partners is key to its success.</p><p>\"We-re here to offer support and guidance on sustainable practices that can benefit both the environment and those who live and work in the catchment.</p><p>\"We encourage any landowners or stakeholders interested in exploring nature-based solutions to contact the partnership through Forth Rivers Trust and become part of this exciting initiative.\"</p><p>The North Esk begins in the Pentland Hills and the South Esk in the Moorfoot Hills, converging in Dalkeith Country Park before flowing into the Firth of Forth at Musselburgh.</p><p>The catchment faces ongoing challenges, including invasive non-native species, water pollution, flooding and historical modifications such as river straightening.</p><p>In late 2024, the partnership secured 91,000 from the Scottish Government-s Nature Restoration Fund to develop a catchment route map.</p><p>This funding, supported by East Lothian Council, Midlothian Council and SEPA, will help identify and prioritise future restoration actions.</p><p>Councillor John McMillan, East Lothian Council-s cabinet spokesman for environment, economic development, and tourism, said: \"We are very excited about the formation of the partnership and its potential to deliver nature-based solutions and improvement.</p><p>\"In 2023, East Lothian Council declared a nature emergency which recognised the decline in biodiversity and the impact of climate change on wildlife and the natural world.</p><p>\"We are committed to tackling this crisis through a range of strategies and projects, working alongside partner agencies, community groups and volunteers, and the work of the LECP will further contribute towards that vital objective.\"</p><p>The partnership will use tools such as drone surveys, biodiversity recording and flood modelling to identify opportunities for nature-based solutions.</p><p>A key focus will be working with landowners to promote nature-friendly farming practices and sustainable land management.</p><p>Potential actions include wetlands creation, leaky dams and agroforestry to reduce flooding, improve water quality and support biodiversity.</p><p>These measures could also provide alternative income streams for land managers while building resilience to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Here-s what the finalists of the Agroforestry and Contractor categories had to say.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Best Agroforestry Award</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Michael Alexander, Cantyhall Farming Partnership</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">-We are a small farm in Fife and have been here over 10 years. We have been working slowly away at improving the environmental conditions. In the last five years we introduced more hedges, tree cover, and shelter belts. This has improved wildlife habitats as well as the general flora and fauna.</p><p>-We also had the opportunity to introduce agroforestry which included 10 acres of apple trees, this adds another diversification to the farm with the apples going to a local cider maker.</p><p>-At Cantyhall Farm, we are continuing at working to improve the business and we are delighted to be shortlisted for the award. The nomination was certainly not expected but we are honoured to be recognised and look forward to the ceremony in October.-</p><p/><p>Michael Alexander, Cantyhall Farm</p><p>Andrew Barbour, Mains of Fincastle</p><p>-At Mains of Fincastle we are a 500ha upland beef and sheep farm on the Bonskeid Estate, near Pitlochry. As a business it is run by my family with my wife Seonag and daughter Catherine.</p><p>-This year we have 55 to 60 suckler commercial cows that will be put in calf. They are first put to a Whitebred Shorthorn bull to create the base cow with a Limousin bull being used as a terminal sire.</p><p>-On the sheep side we run 700 ewes using a mix of North Country Cheviots, Lleyns, and Texels for producing lambs for the store and prime rings.</p><p>-We have established woodland on farm including shelter belts and woodland grazing in small blocks. We have always run a regenerative model, using the regenerative abilities of the woods; using seed fall to restock, and designing felling areas to make sure we-re never too far from any seed source. This results in very diverse forest.</p><p>-Our nomination is primarily based on our development into integrating a Silvopasture model into our current business. We have never been nominated for an award before and we are surprised and touched to be shortlisted.-</p><p/><p>The Barbour family at Mains of Fincastle: Andrew, Seonag, and Catherine</p><p>David Carruth, The Woolly Pig Company</p><p>-I am the sustainable farming manager at Brodoclea and I work the farm alongside Ken Porter who is the agroforestry lead at The Future Forest Company. Last year I was awarded a Scottish Finest Woodland award for young farmers. I grew up dairy farming in Renfrewshire and Ken worked in organic farming for over thirty years before joining us.</p><p>-We are a 430 acre woodland unit farming Mangalitsa Pigs in the hills of North Ayrshire. We sell our forest raised pork online to individuals and restaurants all over the UK through our shop The Woolly Pig Company. We are one of the largest agroforestry plots in the UK and an example of how agriculture can continue in an upland reforested landscape. We farm the pigs in a way that creates new opportunities for increasing biodiversity and also environmental benefits. There is also a big community aspect to the work we do with the woodland being open to the public, a number of community groups using the woodland and the project being used as an educational tool to help others learn more about agroforestry.</p><p>-It-s really fantastic to be picked as a finalist for this award for the second year running but it-s even better to be selected alongside two other fantastic examples of agroforestry. It goes to show the strengthening diversity in practice taking place within this growing sector in Scotland. Each adding something unique to our agricultural landscape.-</p><p/><p>David Carruth, The Woolly Pig Company</p><p>Contractor of the year</p><p>Drew and John Watson, Drew Watson Agri-Services</p><p>-We are a family run Agricultural Business established by father and son Drew and John Watson over 50 years ago. We have built up the skills, equipment, manpower and ability to complete most agricultural work. As a business we are always looking at the market to upgrade our equipment and closely monitor new products that can assist us in supporting our customers. A vast majority of our work is carried out within Dumfries and Galloway, and across the border into England.

long-term commitment here is to build on these early signs, creating a resilient, connected landscape where both wildlife and sustainable farming can flourish.</p><p>\"We're laying the foundations for

supported by the Trees for Climate fund through the Great Western Community Forest.</p><p>Around 11,000 trees were planted over the winter, alongside seed sowing, fencing, and other infrastructure improvements.</p><p>The new woodlands will include broadleaved forests with open glades, agroforestry rows within arable fields, and wood pasture parkland combining grassland and scattered trees.</p><p>The project marks the first large-scale changes at the site under a 49-year lease held by Wiltshire Wildlife Trust, which aims to create a model of regenerative farming and nature

secured.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lower Moor Farm nature reserve first opened in 2007 as part of Cotswold Water Park, and is home to a large array of wildlife, as well as a cafe which opens to visitors during the winter months.</p><p>Wiltshire Wildlife Trust hopes to \"transform\" the 48-acre beauty spot between Swindon and Cirencester, after securing funding for the site.</p><p>The trust claims its the largest grant that Wiltshire Wildlife Community Energy (WWCE), a community solar farm group, has ever awarded to a single organisation.</p><p/><p>Lower Moor Farm forms part of the Cotswold Water Park, between Swindon and Cirencester (Image: Wiltshire Wildlife Trust)</p><p/><p/><p>\"We are delighted to announce funding from partner organisation WWCE to enhance 48 hectares of land for nature at one of our flagship reserves,\" said a spokesperson for Wiltshire Wildlife Trust.</p><p/><p/><p/><p>\"The project, starting this month, aims to transform the area into a dynamic mosaic of habitats through an innovative approach combining conservation with sustainable farming practices.\"</p><p/><p/><p>The two-year project, launching in July 2025, aims to enhance the grazed pastureland at Lower Moor Farm through creating a semi-forest grazing pasture called silvopasture roundels.</p><p/><p>This is an agroforestry technique that boosts the wildlife value of each field and ensures they can continue to be used as grazing pasture, not only supporting a healthy grazing herd but also significantly improving the welfare of individual animals through a concentric circular system of trees.</p><p/><p>Phil Heads, chair of Wiltshire Wildlife Trust (Image: Wiltshire Wildlife Trust)</p><p/><p>The project will also assess how water interacts with the land, and could alleviate some localised flooding issues.</p><p/><p>A hydrological assessment will inform how Wiltshire Wildlife Trust can improve the site for wildlife and tackle floods.</p><p/><p/><p>Recommended

protected Roman villa site</p><p/><p/><p>\"This project, which has been made possible thanks to funding from WWCE, embodies our vision of helping nature to recover by looking inwards at our own land and ensuring we-re maximising wildlife benefits across all areas,\" said Sam Stork, director for countryside and land management at Wiltshire Wildlife Trust.</p><p/><p>\"By introducing silvopasture techniques and improving how water interacts with our land, we're benefiting species, climate, and our local community.\"</p><p/><p>Julian Barlow, chair of WWCE, added: \"One of our core aims is to protect and enhance wildlife across the county, so I'm pleased to be able to support the Lower Moor Farm project with 100,000 of funding.</p><p/><p>\"We believe in the power of community-led action to restore nature and tackle the climate crisis, and this project represents an exciting opportunity to encourage a proliferation of species across our landscapes.\"</p><p>Over the next few months, Wiltshire Wildlife Trust will be liaising closely with stakeholders, including Natural England and other site users to finalise the project design.</p><p>The trust says performance of this approach at Lower Moor Farm will also likely inform future conservation projects across the Trust's network of reserves.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Tudur is hoping to explore cost-effective energy alternatives, by performing a feasibility study on renewable electricity production, calculating the return on investment and payback period to offset bank interest expenses.</p><p>Caryl Hughes who farms at Tuhwntir Afon, Llanarmon, Dyffryn Ceiriog would like to focus on sheep health and performance.</p><p>She's hoping to investigate the effects of different footbath solutions on sheep lameness and the impact of bolusing tup lambs on their weight gain and overall performance to reduce the number of lambs sold after four months post-weaning.</p><p>Also recruited to the network is Pencedni Farm, Glandwr, Pembrokeshire, a smallholding managed by Tom Clare and Jacqui Banks that integrates trees into its pasture-based system, reflecting a growing interest in regenerative agriculture and agroforestry.</p><p>They would like to further develop the ecological understanding and practical application of agroforestry principles on their farm.</p><p>Laura Simpson, from Parc y Dderwen, Llangolman, Pembrokeshire, would like to investigate the establishment of perennial horticulture crops to seek out alternative routes for business diversification.</p><p>She's hoping to monitor and report on ground cultivation, planting, establishment, weeding, and pest management throughout the season, including perennial bed overwintering for next year's healthy crop.</p><p>Other farmers recruited are Peter and Jacob Anthony who farm at Cwmrisca Farm, Ton-du, Bridgend.</p><p>They would like to explore farming practices from a regenerative approach by investigating how to get started with applying regenerative principles to the management of the cattle and sheep on the farm.</p><p>Siwan Howatson, Head of Technical at Farming Connect, says, \"We are delighted to welcome these twelve new forwardthinking farms to the Our Farms network.</p><p>\"The network provides a fantastic platform for practical, onfarm innovation, driven by the farmers themselves.</p><p>\"The diverse range of projects, from regenerative practices and renewable energy to animal health and diversification into horticulture and agroforestry, truly reflects the commitment within the Welsh agricultural sector to embrace new technologies and sustainable approaches for a resilient and profitable future.\"</p><p>The other new

The project, estimated at $ 23.72 million (over 73 million Tunisian dinars), is being funded by the African Development Bank through the Climate Investment Funds' Strategic Climate Fund, which is contributing $ 17 million. The Tunisian Government is providing $ 6.06 million, while project beneficiaries contribute $ 660,000.<br/><br/>The initiative aligns with Tunisia's national development priorities, including the 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy and the country's commitment to reducing carbon intensity by 45% by 2030. It is expected to generate nearly 4,500 green jobs across the governorates of Beja, Siliana, and Bizerte.<br/><br/>'This project marks a major milestone in Tunisia's efforts to tackle the complex challenges of climate change and promote sustainable development in rural areas,' said Mohamed Naoufel Ben Haha, Director General of Forests at the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries.<br/><br/>Measurable Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact<br/><br/>'This project addresses the urgent need to protect natural resources through an integrated, value chain-based approach,' said Malinne Blomberg, African Development Bank Deputy Director General for North Africa and Country Manager for Tunisia. 'It targets both ecological restoration and the creation of sustainable economic and social opportunities for rural communities.'<br/><br/>Key targets of the project include the restoration or stabilization of 33,200 hectares of land, including 2,450 hectares of private land under sub-projects focused on agroforestry, forestry, and the cultivation of aromatic and medicinal plants. Additionally, 42,000 people will receive training in sustainable land management practices. Over a 25-year horizon, the project is expected to enable sequestration of 32 million tonnes of carbon, significantly contributing to Tunisia's climate goals.<br/><br/>Group photo of participants at the PARFD project launch workshop in Tunis.<br/><br/>Group photo of participants at the PARFD project launch workshop in Tunis.<br/><br/>An Innovative Approach to Climate Resilience, Food and Water Security<br/><br/>The project adopts an innovative public-private partnership model, engaging Tunisian farmers in the rehabilitation of private lands close to state-owned forests. This integrated approach combines ecological restoration with economic empowerment by developing sustainable value chains for high-value crops.<br/><br/>By integrating sustainable agroforestry and forestry practices into agricultural systems, the project will support greenhouse gas emission reductions, bolster food and water security, and improve household livelihoods in some of Tunisia's most vulnerable communities. It is also expected to strengthen Tunisia's carbon footprint and improve the adaptive capacity of communities to the impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>Participants attending the PARFD project launch ceremony in Tunis.<br/><br/>Participants attending the PARFD project launch ceremony in Tunis.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Frederic Bambara, Communication and External Relations Department, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@afdb.org\">media@afdb.org</email>(link sends e-mail)<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]     </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">M2PW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">M2PW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FNV-68N3-RVKP-C18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">162367</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>M2 PressWIRE</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"21233\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The guide aims to help inform farmers who are looking at agroforestry - the process of integrating trees into farming systems - choose the right tree species based on the individual needs and conditions of their farm.</p><p>The Forestry Commission says trees on agricultural land can offer a range of benefits, including protecting soils, storing carbon, sheltering and shading livestock and diversifying farm incomes into timber, fruit and nuts.</p><p>Planting the right kind of trees in the right place can help farms be resilient to climate change and the worsening extremes such as flooding and heatwaves it is bringing, and reducing exposure to fluctuating agricultural markets, the agency said.</p><p>The guide highlights species such as hornbeams, which are suitable on most farms, live for a long time and can produce specialised timber, and beeches which are suitable for upland farms, have longevity and value for timber.</p><p>Walnut and black walnut trees produce nuts and offer benefits to livestock, while goat willow trees can be used for biomass and tannins and common and red alder trees are able to capture nitrogen to improve the soil and forage grassland, the guide says.</p><p>Farmers can get grants for planting and maintaining trees on agricultural land including the new nature-friendly farming scheme that is replacing old EUera subsidies and woodland creation grants from the Forestry Commission.</p><p>Forestry Commission chief executive Richard Stanford said: \"Food production and environmental goals are under increasing scrutiny and the effects of climate change are becoming apparent to us all.</p><p>\"Agroforestry can offer improved productivity from livestock and crops and help to build resilience to climate change.\"</p><p>\"This indispensable guide outlines which tree species are most suited to farmers' needs and the conditions specific to their land,\" he said, adding it would help them benefit from incorporating trees into farmland while maximising food production.</p><p>Tom Breeze, from the University of Reading, said: \"Farming with trees is a great way for farmers to meet environmental goals without compromising food production, but the barriers to entry can feel overwhelming.</p><p>\"Drawing on years of research from the University of Reading, this guide aims to equip farmers with the practical knowledge and tools they need to get started.</p><p>\"Our goal is to make farming with trees more accessible, increase awareness of its benefits, and spark a conversation about how agroforestry can transform agriculture in the UK.\"</p><p>Agroforestry can offer improved productivity from livestock and crops and help to build resilience to climate change RICHARD

a productive landscape that also acts as a haven for biodiversity.</p><p>\"We're bringing together traditional Derbyshire fruit-growing heritage, sustainable viticulture and modern regenerative practices to create a space that's not only ecologically rich but agriculturally meaningful.\"</p><p>The founder of Amber Valley Vineyards has already been nurturing a pocket rainforest across an acre of land by encouraging and introducing all the necessary combined conditions, vegetation, lichens and fungi and wildlife to support a healthy and thriving damp environment.</p><p>He has been transforming wet woodland forest including a rich marsh and meadow on land adjacent to his Amber Valley Vineyard into something like a rather rare and wild temperate rainforest more closely associated with Central and South America, Africa and SouthEast Asia.</p><p>But as climate change has been brought more sharply into focus in recent years with wetter, warmer weather and floods in the UK, the importance of developing temperate rainforests in sheltered and damp areas is becoming even more vital in the UK to both support the environment and to help neighbouring crop development.</p><p>Generous planting of alder, willow rowans, and birch trees and new hawthorns has been underway at the pocket rainforest off Doehole Lane which is considered to be acceptable because the undulating, damp land will be designated for a rainforest rather than just standard woodland alongside other efforts to establish new ferns including hart's tongue.</p><p>Amber Valley Vineyards already boasts two patches of vines off Back Lane on land that is a designated wildlife with nutrient rich soil which creates greater biodiversity and more species.</p><p>However, the nearby woodland and boggy brook is no good for growing crops but by transforming this into a pocket rainforest it should increase the area's biodiversity and even encourage more predatory insects which will help to protect the adjacent vines from other harmful insects and tie in with the principles of regenerative agriculture.</p><p>In addition to planting over 130 orchard trees - primarily heritage apple and pear varieties - the Agroforestry Orchard site will feature wildflower-rich grasslands, integrated grapevines, and beehives to support pollination and local honey production.</p><p>A key feature of the site, according to Mr Lewis, will be the use of limited conservation grazing with horses, cattle and potentially pigs used to manage vegetation and suppress invasive species in a lowimpact, natural way.</p><p>Mr Lewis, who is leader of Derbyshire County Council, said the project has already attracted interest from the University of Derby with students assisting on ecological management and species restoration planning.</p><p>Early supporters have also helped launch a crowdfunding campaign to fund the specialised equipment and infrastructure needed to manage the challenging terrain and control invasive species.</p><p>Vineyard employee Kate RathodBurton, of Matlock, said: \"This isn't a quick-return commercial project. It's a long-term investment in the land.</p><p>\"Regenerative farming takes time, and we're asking the community to help us make it a reality by sponsoring trees, supporting the campaign, or volunteering to help plant and manage the site.\"</p><p>Amber Valley Vineyards plans to host educational visits, guided tours, and provide a living demonstration of how agriculture, biodiversity and rural sustainability can work together once the orchard project has been established.</p><p>Anyone interested in supportng the Amber Valley Agroforestry Orchard Project can visit https:// gofund.me/d7a19d0d for details.</p><p>The conservation and preservation of the Pocket Rainforest site also aims to encourage better symbiotic relationships between farming and the land by supporting a corridor across Derbyshire similar to Derbyshire County Council's Heartwood community forest project aimed at regenerating land and linking Bolsover, Chesterfield, north east Derbyshire, Amber Valley and Erewash.</p><p>Amber Valley Vineyards is so determined to ensure they use what is naturally available in the environment to support their crops they even create their own 'biochar' which works as a fertiliser for their soil by burning land material which is then put back into the ground.</p><p>Regenerative farming takes time, and we're asking the community to help us make it a reality by sponsoring trees, supporting the campaign, or volunteering</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Amber Valley Agroforestry Orchard aims to blend heritage orchards, wildflower meadows, grapevines, and traditional conservation grazing to produce honey, ciders and wines.

Kaukonoahua Ranch estimated that the business would bring in around 1,700 visitors a day. </p><p>Locals recently gathered for a rally to showcase their refusal to accept the development into their hometown. </p><p>The proposal argued that the land would be used for agribusiness facilities to help preserve the land; however, locals have rejected the notion. </p><p>A community group called Keep the North Shore Country is rallying to stop the project, advocating against the development down the historic mountainside. </p><p>'There are many problems with this project, besides that fact that few people want a major tourist attraction on the dangerous, narrow Kaukonahua Rd, or mechanized joy rides up the side of Mt. Kaala,' the group stated on their website. </p><p>'Rather than admit that the primary purpose of this project is to generate money from tourist attractions, the developer is exploiting zoning laws by calling the project an agribusiness operation.'</p><p>Residents have frequently protested the effort and shown their opposition to the gondola at community meetings.</p><p>At a protest this week resident Kathleen Pahinui told local CBS affiliate, Hawaii News Now, that visitors should go elsewhere for tourist attractions. </p><p>'We're not Disneyland. We're not a theme park. There are places in this world where you can go to do those kinds of things,' she said.</p><p>'This is Hawaii. We are not a theme park and we shouldn't be treated like a theme park.'</p><p>Racquel Achiu echoed a similar sentiment, telling the outlet: 'We're tired of people coming in, buying up lands, and then telling us what we need and what would be right.</p><p>'They're not of this place. They don't even live here. They know nothing about our culture or our history and know nothing about what our community is, but yet want to hugely impact it.'</p><p>Denise Antolini told Hawaii News Now that building a theme park over sacred Hawaiian lands was 'a complete desecration'. </p><p>A petition was launched to stop the developer from continuing to pursue the land for agritourism. </p><p>'I'm supporting this cause because protecting Kaala (Mount Kaala) is essential for preserving not only the land but the cultural and spiritual heritage of the Native Hawaiian community,' one comment on the petition read. </p><p>'This mountain holds deep significance, and it's crucial that we stand together to ensure it's respected and protected for future generations.'</p><p>'All my life this mountain and its beauty is all I know.. Untouched and Preserved,' another agreed. </p><p>Kaukonoahua Ranch proposed the project for agricultural use, stating the intention is 'To expand existing agriculture with comprehensive agroforestry, conservation areas (native tree reforestation), valley agriculture (including some traditional crops) and cattle ranching, while enhancing the property with educational, cultural and agricultural tourism.' </p><p>The proposal added that recreational activities, including trails, the tramway, and the zipline, would support the agricultural uses of the property. </p><p>The ranch's general manager, Mark Taylor, told Hawaii News Now that the agribusiness project is working to meet the requirements of the Conditional Use Permit for agricultural use. </p><p>Kaukonoahua submitted edits to the permit to reduce the scale of the project and is awaiting a decision from the City and County of Honolulu's Department of Planning and Permitting. </p><p>'We remain committed to being good community stewards for Kaukonahua Ranch,' Taylor said in a statement to the outlet.</p><p>'We continue to focus on enhancing our cattle ranching and crop-growing operations, the reforestation of native trees, and creating an agricultural-based model that is in keeping with the rural qualities, unique country feeling, and agricultural history of the north shore.'</p><p>'We look forward to sharing the latest details of our project with the community and how it will support the future of Kaukonahua Ranch, create more local jobs, and foster community partnerships and opportunities.'</p><p>Daily Mail reached out to Kaukonahua Ranch for additional comment on the business proposal. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MAILON-113571463</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MAILON2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GDG-6N23-S0F9-301D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397135</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><timeReceived>7:24 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Associated Newspapers Ltd.

The project, estimated at $ 23.72 million (over 73 million Tunisian dinars), is being funded by the African Development Bank through the Climate Investment Funds' Strategic Climate Fund, which is contributing $ 17 million. The Tunisian Government is providing $ 6.06 million, while project beneficiaries contribute $ 660,000.<br/><br/>The initiative aligns with Tunisia's national development priorities, including the 2030 Sustainable Development Strategy and the country's commitment to reducing carbon intensity by 45% by 2030. It is expected to generate nearly 4,500 green jobs across the governorates of Beja, Siliana, and Bizerte.<br/><br/>'This project marks a major milestone in Tunisia's efforts to tackle the complex challenges of climate change and promote sustainable development in rural areas,' said Mohamed Naoufel Ben Haha, Director General of Forests at the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and Fisheries.<br/><br/>Measurable Environmental and Socio-Economic Impact<br/><br/>'This project addresses the urgent need to protect natural resources through an integrated, value chain-based approach,' said Malinne Blomberg, African Development Bank Deputy Director General for North Africa and Country Manager for Tunisia. 'It targets both ecological restoration and the creation of sustainable economic and social opportunities for rural communities.'<br/><br/>Key targets of the project include the restoration or stabilization of 33,200 hectares of land, including 2,450 hectares of private land under sub-projects focused on agroforestry, forestry, and the cultivation of aromatic and medicinal plants. Additionally, 42,000 people will receive training in sustainable land management practices. Over a 25-year horizon, the project is expected to enable sequestration of 32 million tonnes of carbon, significantly contributing to Tunisia's climate goals.<br/><br/>Group photo of participants at the PARFD project launch workshop in Tunis.<br/><br/>Group photo of participants at the PARFD project launch workshop in Tunis.<br/><br/>An Innovative Approach to Climate Resilience, Food and Water Security<br/><br/>The project adopts an innovative public-private partnership model, engaging Tunisian farmers in the rehabilitation of private lands close to state-owned forests. This integrated approach combines ecological restoration with economic empowerment by developing sustainable value chains for high-value crops.<br/><br/>By integrating sustainable agroforestry and forestry practices into agricultural systems, the project will support greenhouse gas emission reductions, bolster food and water security, and improve household livelihoods in some of Tunisia's most vulnerable communities. It is also expected to strengthen Tunisia's carbon footprint and improve the adaptive capacity of communities to the impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>Participants attending the PARFD project launch ceremony in Tunis.<br/><br/>Participants attending the PARFD project launch ceremony in Tunis.<br/><br/>Contact:<br/><br/>Frederic Bambara, Communication and External Relations Department, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:media@afdb.org\">media@afdb.org</email>(link sends e-mail)<br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FNV-68N3-RVKP-C15W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"657\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The acquisition of Burapha Agro-Forestry, which is highly regarded for its agroforestry and wood processing processes and local community engagement work, aligns with this aim. Additionally, Laos' availability of land, conducive biological growth conditions, and strategic location near areas of significant wood deficit make it an attractive investment destination. </p><p>Mirova and another minority stakeholder acquired a smaller stake in Burapha, while New Forest currently owns 76.5% of the company. The 6000-hectare property includes conservation areas, a plywood mill, and a voluntary carbon project that has been producing Verified Carbon Standards-compliant carbon credits since 2023 and focuses on plantation afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR). According to Geoffrey Seeto, senior managing director of New Forests Asia, there is a lot of room for Burapha's plantation forest lands to grow, and the voluntary carbon project that has already been created and put into action can be expanded. \"Laos' availability of land, combined with possessing highly conducive biological growth conditions, and being strategically located in near proximity to areas of significant wood deficit, makes it an attractive investment destination,\" he said. This is TAFF2's third acquisition. The fund's initial investment was in the preservation and restoration of Thailand's second-largest peat swamp forest area, the Kuan Kreng Landscape (KKL).</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"400\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Acquisition</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-Category</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Majority Acquisition</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Status</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Completed: 2025-04-29</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><h>Deal Participants</h><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"384\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Target (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Burapha Agro-Forestry Co Ltd</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">New Forests Pty Limited</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><h>Deal Rationale</h><p>The acquisition of Burapha Agro-Forestry, which is highly regarded for its agroforestry and wood processing processes and local community engagement work, aligns with this aim.

The acquisition of Burapha Agro-Forestry, which is highly regarded for its agroforestry and wood processing processes and local community engagement work, aligns with this aim. Additionally, Laos' availability of land, conducive biological growth conditions, and strategic location near areas of significant wood deficit make it an attractive investment destination. </p><p>Mirova and another minority stakeholder acquired a smaller stake in Burapha, while New Forest currently owns 76.5% of the company. The 6000-hectare property includes conservation areas, a plywood mill, and a voluntary carbon project that has been producing Verified Carbon Standards-compliant carbon credits since 2023 and focuses on plantation afforestation, reforestation, and revegetation (ARR). According to Geoffrey Seeto, senior managing director of New Forests Asia, there is a lot of room for Burapha's plantation forest lands to grow, and the voluntary carbon project that has already been created and put into action can be expanded. \"Laos' availability of land, combined with possessing highly conducive biological growth conditions, and being strategically located in near proximity to areas of significant wood deficit, makes it an attractive investment destination,\" he said. This is TAFF2's third acquisition. The fund's initial investment was in the preservation and restoration of Thailand's second-largest peat swamp forest area, the Kuan Kreng Landscape (KKL).</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"400\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Type</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Acquisition</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sub-Category</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Majority Acquisition</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deal Status</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Completed: 2025-04-29</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><h>Deal Participants</h><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"384\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Target (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Burapha Agro-Forestry Co Ltd</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Acquirer (Company)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">New Forests Pty Limited</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><h>Deal Rationale</h><p>The acquisition of Burapha Agro-Forestry, which is highly regarded for its agroforestry and wood processing processes and local community engagement work, aligns with this aim.

We provide upfront dollars to developers. In exchange, we secure a contractual right to a percentage of the credits they mint over a set period (say 10-15 years), often at a fixed or formula-based price. Those future credits (or the proceeds when they're sold) flow back to us-and by extension to token holders-pro rata. No guessing when a project will refinance or sell; the flow is baked in from day one.</p><p>How investors can make money</p><p>Credit distributions: A share of the carbon credits (or cash from their sale) is dropped to the token treasury and streamed to holders. Redeem, retire, or resell-your call.</p><p>Token price upside: If secondary demand for high-integrity credits rises-or if the token trades at a premium to NAV-holders benefit.</p><p>Buybacks / revenue share: A portion of monetized credits can be used to buy back and burn tokens, or paid out as stablecoin yield, depending on final tokenomics.</p><p>Arbitrage between off-chain and on-chain markets: Access to wholesale-priced credits through the stream can open spreads that aren't available to retail buyers.</p><p>None of this is risk-free. Methodology changes, registry pauses, policy shifts, illiquidity-these are real. We're not sugar-coating that.</p><p>Project pipeline &amp; geography</p><p>Our first tranche targets projects where additionality and permanence aren't marketing fluff:</p><p>Congo Basin: Avoided deforestation (jurisdictional REDD+), community-led agroforestry, and peatland restoration-hard, messy work with outsized climate impact.</p><p>Latin America: Regenerative cattle ranching, reforestation of degraded pasture, mangrove restoration, improved cookstoves at real scale-not boutique pilots.</p><p>Central Asia: Wind and solar hybrids tied to outdated grids, methane capture from legacy oil operations, and rangeland management.</p><p>All projects are being screened against the ICVCM Core Carbon Principles, work with registries like Verra, Gold Standard, ACR, or ART/TREES, and carry third-party verification. If a project can't clear scrutiny on baselines, leakage, or permanence, it doesn't get into the stream.</p><p>Why tokenized?</p><p>Because carbon markets are still opaque and slow. Putting the stream on-chain lets us:</p><p>Track flows transparently (no back-room reallocations).</p><p>Settle distributions automatically.</p><p>Let investors trade exposure without waiting months for paperwork.</p><p>We're not pretending the blockchain fixes everything, but it kills a lot of the friction that keeps capital stuck on the sidelines.</p><p>Where we are right now</p><p>Stage: Pre-launch. SAFEs are being signed now.</p><p>Use of proceeds: Advance payments to the first cohort of projects and build-out of the on-chain distribution rails.</p><p>Launch window: Token generation event targeted once the first stream contracts are inked and verified (exact date to follow).</p><p>'Investors are tired of hand-wavy climate pitches. We structured this like a commodity stream: clear contracts, clear flows, and real collateral,' said [Insert Name], Managing Partner at FG Capital Advisors. 'If we're not getting paid in credits (or cash from credits), nobody is. That alignment matters.'</p><p>About FG CapitalAdvisors</p><p>FG CapitalAdvisors structures and finances real-asset climate deals with an on-chain wrapper, giving investors transparent exposure to verifiable carbon outcomes.

Yield Variability And Climate ResilienceYield variability remains a significant concern for Colombia's coffee sector, with climate change playing a pivotal role in shaping production outcomes from 2025 to 2029. Colombia's diverse topography and microclimates lead to fluctuating yields, exacerbated by increasingly unpredictable weather patterns such as prolonged droughts and erratic rainfall. In response, Colombian coffee producers are likely to invest in research and development aimed at enhancing climate resilience. Organisations like Cenicaf\u00e9 are expected to focus on breeding disease-resistant and climate-adaptive coffee varieties to stabilise yields. Additionally, the adoption of precision agriculture technologies, including soil and weather monitoring systems, will be crucial for optimising farming practices and mitigating yield variability. These advancements will be essential to ensure consistent production levels and support Colombia's standing as a top coffee producer in the face of climatic challenges. However, the pace of adaptation may vary, with larger farms likely leading the way in implementing these technologies.

BMI                         2. Land Availability And Utilisation ChallengesThe availability and utilisation of land present ongoing challenges for Colombia's coffee sector as urbanisation and competing agricultural demands increase. From 2025 to 2029, coffee producers may face difficulties in securing suitable land for cultivation, impacting production capacity. Population growth and land use shifts towards other agricultural activities or urban development contribute to land fragmentation. Addressing these challenges will require innovative land management practices, such as sustainable land use planning and agroforestry systems that integrate coffee with other crops or forest conservation efforts. Collaborations with environmental organisations and government agencies could facilitate policies to protect coffee-growing regions and promote efficient land use. Additionally, educating farmers on optimising existing land resources can enhance productivity without expanding into new areas. Balancing coffee production needs with environmental conservation and urban development pressures will be essential for sustaining Colombia's coffee sector.        3. Commitment To Sustainable PracticesSustainability is increasingly becoming a focal point for Colombia's coffee sector as it aligns with global consumer trends favouring environmentally friendly and socially responsible products. From 2025 to 2029, Colombian coffee producers are expected to intensify efforts to integrate sustainable practices throughout their operations. This includes reducing chemical inputs, implementing water conservation techniques and promoting biodiversity through shade-grown coffee systems. Certifications such as Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance and Organic are anticipated to become more prevalent, helping producers access premium markets and enhance their reputations. Companies like Juan Valdez may lead in prioritising sustainability within their business models. Supporting smallholder farmers in adopting sustainable practices will be crucial, as they form the backbone of the sector. Government support and international partnerships will play vital roles in facilitating this transition, ensuring the long-term viability and competitiveness of Colombian coffee in the global market. However, widespread adoption of sustainable practices may progress gradually as producers balance costs with economic realities.                           </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BMINWS-2678A388A0AE4F96AA7FCCB6C1C339E6</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BMINWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GD2-F7G3-S2R9-94G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">252475</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"963\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Business Monitor International Ltd.

which is celebrating its fifth anniversary.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Residents, farmers, landholders, community groups and organisations have contributed by growing tree saplings in fields, farms, towns, villages, schools, parks and gardens.</p><p>A new map listing Forest for Cornwall planting projects has been produced showing the breadth and variety of places that have benefitted from increased tree cover.</p><p>Cornwall Council launched the initiative in summer 2019 to help the region respond to climate change, boost nature recovery and create more green spaces for one and all.</p><p>Expanding the Forest for Cornwall is a key priority in the Cornwall and Isles of Scilly Nature Recovery Strategy, one of the first plans of its kind in the country to detail actions needed to reverse the decline of nature and bring species of wildlife back from the brink.</p><p>Cllr Loic Rich, cabinet member for environment and climate change, said: \"We're celebrating an incredible five years of Forest for Cornwall and we want to say a huge thank you to all of you who have got involved so far and to all those to come.</p><p>\"Not only has this scheme brought benefits for nature recovery, absorbed carbon emissions and improved flooding resilience in many locations across Cornwall, it has also had a tangible effect on improving the immediate environment where people live with many trees being planted near people's homes and in amenity spaces.</p><p>\"We have many more trees planned in the pipeline for this winter and if you haven't already got involved, get in touch with our Forest for Cornwall for lots of tips and advice on planting and looking after trees whether you're a farmer or organisation or individual.\"</p><p>Examples of tree-planting for the Forest for Cornwall include: \u00a6 Back Garden Forest: More than 15,000 free trees were given free to residents across Cornwall to be planted in gardens. \u00a6 Free range egg and arable farm Cornhill near Camborne planted 10,000 trees as shelters, fodder crops and hedgerows. \u00a6 The Trees for Streets scheme saw 54 trees planted by Camborne residents in their gardens and 10 trees in streets.</p><p>\u00a6 National Trust attraction Cotehele planted 1.3 hectares of fruit and nut orchards for crop production including apples and cherries. \u00a6 Cut flower business Petalon near Newquay planted 10 hectares of trees to improve shelter and growing conditions and provide foliage for their bouquets. \u00a6 Mora Farm near Liskeard planted 500 trees to help reduce valley water run-off and provide wind breaks. \u00a6 Residents planted 135 mixed berry and nut hedging and orchard trees at Threemilestone Community Orchard to improve their green space and provide produce for the community. \u00a6 Trenow Farm near Penzance planted 5,500 trees as part of their agroforestry scheme.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>&gt;The Forest

ERIP scales up ecosystem restoration efforts by transforming degraded lands into thriving ecosystems and promotes private sector engagement and South-South exchange across the beneficiary countries. Conservation International is the ERIP lead agency.<br/><br/>'This project reflects the strong partnership between the World Bank and the Government of Rwanda in building climate resilience and driving inclusive green growth,' said Sahr Kpundeh, World Bank Country Manager for Rwanda. 'It aligns with our Country Partnership Framework and global priorities on climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and empowering local communities to lead sustainable change.'<br/><br/>The Rwanda GEF-8 will support the rehabilitation of 2,162 hectares of forests and wetlands, promote sustainable land management practices across 8,931 hectares of farmland, and help develop income-generating activities that reduce pressure on fragile ecosystems, directly benefiting more than 289,000 people in Ruhango, Nyanza, and Nyamagabe Districts.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the World Bank Group's core objective of creating more and better jobs to reduce poverty and unlock economic opportunities, especially for the youth. Early estimates suggests that the project could generate over 2,200 jobs through sustainable livelihoods interventions. These include the development of non-timber forest product value chains, fruit tree planting, and support for small businesses in the green economy. The project will also engage the private sector to explore investment opportunities that promote climate-smart land use and sustainable forest management.<br/><br/>'This is a timely intervention that combines ecological restoration with community resilience,' said Tuuli Bernardini, Senior Environmental Specialist at the World Bank. 'By centering the role of women, youth, and local enterprises in landscape management, the project supports inclusive development and paves the way for scalable nature-based solutions.'<br/><br/>Implemented by the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), the project adopts a landscape-based approach to address environmental degradation, food insecurity, climate risks, such as floods and landslides; threats that disrupt infrastructure, destroy crops, and deepen poverty in the Southern province. At its core, the Rwanda GEF-8 aims to restore ecosystems that provide critical services such as erosion control, flood regulation and habitats for biodiversity. Key interventions will include afforestation, reforestation, riverbank and wetland rehabilitation and the promotion of agroforestry and other climate-smart agricultural practices.<br/><br/>The Rwanda GEF-8 forms part of a broader suite of World Bank-supported investments in conservation and sustainable land management along the Congo-Nile divide covering parts of the Northern, Western, and Southern Province.

Before this, it has been quite a year for the beloved bean, with prices <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2025/02/06/cocoa-prices-hit-record-high-what-does-this-mean-for-food-and-beverage/\">reaching record highs</url> in January in the face of pressures from climate change and disease. Even now, they\u2019re still high.</p><p>Even in this environment, Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Income Accelerator programme has seen success. </p><p>What is Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Income Accelerator Programme?</p><p>Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Income Accelerator programme, based in C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, is an initiative that aims to help cocoa farmers increase their incomes. </p><p>The programme provides \u20ac100 incentives to farmers for four key activities. Firstly, they are incentivised to take on new agricultural techniques, such as pruning, in order to improve yields; secondly, to take part in agroforestry programmes; thirdly, to develop additional sources of income, such as running a business; and lastly, to enrol their children at school. </p><p>They can get an additional \u20ac100 for completing all of these things, meaning that the total reaches \u20ac500. After two years, this falls to \u20ac250.</p><p>The current phase of the programme was launched at the beginning of 2022. </p><p>How much progress has the programme made?</p><p>Despite the pressures on cocoa prices, the programme has made significant progress since its inception. </p><p>An independent evaluation by the KIT Institute, a non-profit, revealed that in 2024 those in the programme saw a yield increase of 18% higher than farmers not in the programme. </p><p>This has meant that their net income has risen 15% more than other farmers. </p><p>Under the programme, the amount of children enrolled in school increased by 7%, from 81% in 2022 to 88% in 2024.</p><p>Farms in the programme, according to Nestl\u00e9, are also healthier, due to agricultural methods such as pruning, weeding, pest control and shade management. Since the start of the programme, Nestl\u00e9 has also added composting to these methods. </p><p>The programme is due to expand further, including into neighbouring country Ghana, which is second only to C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire in terms of levels of cocoa production. </p><p>How have cocoa prices affected profits?</p><p>Rising cocoa prices have not gone unnoticed by farmers. For example, net profit has increased by 21% compared to farms not in the programme, which according to Nestl\u00e9 has been accelerated by rising cocoa prices. </p><p>While farmgate prices also rose, due to much of cocoa produced being bought by forward contracts \u2013 in other words, before the price rises \u2013 they did not go up as significantly. </p><p>Nevertheless, for the 2023/2024 season, the weighted farmgate price was 23% higher than it was for the previous season. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FUDNAV-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FUDNAV2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4D-YH43-RWH3-T2W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">397562</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"455\"/><timeReceived>8:15 AM GMT+1</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 William Reed Business Media Ltd.

ERIP scales up ecosystem restoration efforts by transforming degraded lands into thriving ecosystems and promotes private sector engagement and South-South exchange across the beneficiary countries. Conservation International is the ERIP lead agency.<br/><br/>'This project reflects the strong partnership between the World Bank and the Government of Rwanda in building climate resilience and driving inclusive green growth,' said Sahr Kpundeh, World Bank Country Manager for Rwanda. 'It aligns with our Country Partnership Framework and global priorities on climate adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and empowering local communities to lead sustainable change.'<br/><br/>The Rwanda GEF-8 will support the rehabilitation of 2,162 hectares of forests and wetlands, promote sustainable land management practices across 8,931 hectares of farmland, and help develop income-generating activities that reduce pressure on fragile ecosystems, directly benefiting more than 289,000 people in Ruhango, Nyanza, and Nyamagabe Districts.<br/><br/>The project will contribute to the World Bank Group's core objective of creating more and better jobs to reduce poverty and unlock economic opportunities, especially for the youth. Early estimates suggests that the project could generate over 2,200 jobs through sustainable livelihoods interventions. These include the development of non-timber forest product value chains, fruit tree planting, and support for small businesses in the green economy. The project will also engage the private sector to explore investment opportunities that promote climate-smart land use and sustainable forest management.<br/><br/>'This is a timely intervention that combines ecological restoration with community resilience,' said Tuuli Bernardini, Senior Environmental Specialist at the World Bank. 'By centering the role of women, youth, and local enterprises in landscape management, the project supports inclusive development and paves the way for scalable nature-based solutions.'<br/><br/>Implemented by the Rwanda Environment Management Authority (REMA), the project adopts a landscape-based approach to address environmental degradation, food insecurity, climate risks, such as floods and landslides; threats that disrupt infrastructure, destroy crops, and deepen poverty in the Southern province. At its core, the Rwanda GEF-8 aims to restore ecosystems that provide critical services such as erosion control, flood regulation and habitats for biodiversity. Key interventions will include afforestation, reforestation, riverbank and wetland rehabilitation and the promotion of agroforestry and other climate-smart agricultural practices.<br/><br/>The Rwanda GEF-8 forms part of a broader suite of World Bank-supported investments in conservation and sustainable land management along the Congo-Nile divide covering parts of the Northern, Western, and Southern Province. These include the Volcanoes Community Resilience Project and Commercialization and De-Risking for Agricultural Transformation Project. Building on lessons from Rwanda's earlier efforts such as the Landscape Approach to Forest Restoration and Conservation (LAFREC), these initiatives align with the National Strategy for Transformation (NST2), and are expected to deliver significant outcomes in biodiversity conservation, resilience building and improved community livelihoods.<br/><br/>Contacts:<br/><br/>In Kigali: Collin Haba, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chaba@worldbankgroup.org\">chaba@worldbankgroup.org</email><br/><br/>In Washington: Daniella van Leggelo-Padilla, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:dvanleggelo@worldbank.org\">dvanleggelo@worldbank.org</email><br/><br/>[Editorial queries for this story should be sent to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:newswire@enpublishing.co.uk\">newswire@enpublishing.co.uk</email> ]   </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ENPNWS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ENPNWS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G6S-0HS3-RRY4-T465-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">344171</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"691\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Normans Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ENP Newswire</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"61140\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 7, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;
