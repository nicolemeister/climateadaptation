It's part of an urge to feel more directly connected to the cause.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">KYIV - When Ihor Sumliennyi, a young environmental activist, arrived at the site of a recent missile strike, the rubble had barely stopped smoking.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Police officers guarded the street. People who had lived in the smashed apartment building stared in disbelief, some making the sign of the cross next to him. He started poking around.       </p><p>And then, bam! His eyes lit up. Right in front of him, lying near the sidewalk, was exactly what he was looking for: a mangled chunk of shrapnel, a piece of the actual Russian cruise missile that had slammed into the building.       </p><p>He scooped it up, pricking himself in the process on the jagged steel edges, stuffed it in his backpack and briskly walked the hour home - \"I didn't want the police to stop me and think I was a terrorist.\"       </p><p>That ugly chunk of steel has now become the star of his \"war trophies\" collection, which spans everything from ammunition tins and a used rocket-propelled grenade shaft to a pair of black Russian boots he found in the battered city of Bucha.       </p><p>\"Those have really bad energy,\" he said.       </p><p>It might seem eccentric, even macabre, to collect war debris like this. But Mr. Sumliennyi isn't the only one. Across Ukraine, many civilians and soldiers are foraging for shrapnel pieces, mortar fins, spent bullet casings and bits of bombs.       </p><p>Ukrainian artists are weaving them into their work. Auction houses are moving discarded pieces of weapons and other battlefield finds, raising thousands of dollars for Ukrainian soldiers. One woman is even making sculptures from the uniforms of dead Russians.       </p><p>It clearly speaks to something bigger. So many Ukrainians want to be on the front lines - or to somehow feel connected to the cause even if they are far from the fighting or don't see themselves as cut out for combat. With patriotism cresting and their country's existence at stake, they are seeking out something tangible they can hold in their hands that represents this enormous, overwhelming moment. They crave their own little piece of history.       </p><p>\"Each piece has a story,\" said Serhii Petrov, a well-known artist working in Lviv. He's now incorporating spent bullet cartridges into the masks he makes.       </p><p>As he handled one, he mused, \"Maybe it was someone's last bullet.\"       </p><p>At a charity auction in Lviv on Sunday, Valentyn Lapotkov, a computer programmer, paid more than $500 for an empty missile tube that had been used, the auctioneers said, to blow up a Russian armored personnel carrier. He said that when he touched it he felt \"close to our heroes.\"       </p><p>Memorializing the war, even when it's likely far from over, is a way to show solidarity with the soldiers and those who have suffered. One of Kyiv's biggest museums recently staged an exhibition of war artifacts collected since the Russians invaded in February. The rooms are full of gas masks, missile tubes and charred debris. The message is clear: See, this is what real war really looks like.       </p><p>On a personal level, Mr. Sumliennyi is doing something similar. Thirty-one years old, he's an auditor by training but a climate justice activist by heart. From Kyiv, he works with Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement, organizing social media campaigns against fossil fuels, and during the hundreds of video calls he makes, he shows off his war trophies. He also sends some out of the country with female activists to \"go on tour\" (he can't travel himself, because of Ukraine's ban on military-age men leaving the country).       </p><p>\"It's very interesting,\" explained Mr. Sumliennyi, who is tall and lean and lives in a tiny apartment with his mother. \"You don't feel the war through television or the news. But if you show people these pieces, they feel it.\"       </p><p>That's exactly what one young Polish woman said after Mr. Sumliennyi leaned out of the frame during a video call and returned with his trophies.       </p><p>\"It was mind-blowing,\" said the woman, Dominika Lasota, a climate justice activist from Warsaw. \"I automatically started to laugh at it, in shock, but then realized how dystopian this moment was.\"       </p><p>\"Ihor seemed to be all chill about it,\" she added of Mr. Sumliennyi. \"He actually showed that piece of the bomb with pride - he was smiling.\"       </p><p>It's a coping mechanism, he explained. \"Without black humor, we can't live in the war,\" he said. \"It's a protection reaction for the organism.\"       </p><p>Still, he and his friends handle the war objects carefully, almost as solemnly as soldiers would fold a flag for a fallen comrade.       </p><p>\"When I touch this,\" he said of the missile piece he recovered in April, \"I feel really bad energy in my fingers.\"       </p><p>He said he had spoken to weapons experts and determined the five-pound chunk was part of the tail of a Russian Kalibr cruise missile.       </p><p>In Lviv, Tetiana Okhten helps run the U-AID foundation, a volunteer network that, among the many things it's doing, has sold more than 15 pieces of war debris, including several missile and rocket tubes used by the Ukrainian military that are big hits. All told, the war debris has netted more than $4,000, which the foundation spends on protective vests, medicine and other supplies for Ukrainian troops.       </p><p>\"We are taking things used to kill people to now save lives,\" she said.       </p><p>She said that one young Ukrainian soldier fighting in the Donbas region has been a huge help in finding things from the front lines. He has jumped out of trenches even as Russian shells were exploding around him and fellow soldiers were yelling at him to take cover. But, she said, he's close to a bunch of volunteers and yells back, \"I have to go. My friends need this stuff!\"       </p><p>In frontline areas, some shellshocked residents were surprised to learn that pieces of war debris were becoming collectors' items.       </p><p>\"That's crazy,\" said Vova Hurzhyi, who lives in a Donbas town that the Russians keep attacking. \"This stuff is coming here to kill you.\"       </p><p>Still, Mr. Sumliennyi keeps hunting. A few weeks ago, he and some environmentalist friends drove to Bucha, a Kyiv suburb where Russian troops slaughtered hundreds of civilians, to take photos for a social media campaign about the connection between fossil fuels and Russia's war machine.       </p><p>Just by chance, they stumbled into a backyard where they found a Russian military jacket and the pair of black boots (size 10). They remain among his prized items.       </p><p>\"We didn't go to Bucha looking for this,\" he said. \"We just got lucky.\"       </p><p>Diego Ibarra Sanchez contributed reporting from Lviv and Oleksandra Mykolyshyn from Kyiv. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008460244</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:667J-07J1-JC85-N1CV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1213\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 26, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001150</classCode><className>MISSILE SYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001982</classCode><className>WEAPONS &amp;

DME, caused by blood vessels leaking fluid into the retina, affects around 37 million people globally each year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A problem of accessibility</emphasis></p><p>A cure for DME exists but is expensive and requires either surgical implants or injections to the back of the eye performed by trained ophthalmologists in a sterile environment. So far, only a small minority of patients can access full treatments.</p><p>\"It's extremely important to be able to deliver drugs to treat blinding retinal diseases with a non-invasive and a simpler approach,\" Stef\u00e1nsson told EURACTIV during the European Inventor Award held in Valencia last week, adding that simplicity brings accessibility.</p><p>The new drug, which is now undergoing clinical trials with positive early results, could reach millions of people suffering from diabetes, who could buy it in local pharmacies and treat themselves autonomously.</p><p>\"For some people, it may be good to have an alternative to injections. For other people [who don't have access to treatment], it may be an alternative to no treatment,\" Stef\u00e1nsson said.</p><p>\"But then also, you might prefer an eye drop rather than having somebody stick a needle in your eye, right?\" he added.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Surpassing barriers</emphasis></p><p>Externally, the new drug looks similar to traditional eye drops but it works in a different way.</p><p>Conventional eye drops only deliver a small portion of the drug into the eye - around 5% - while the rest is washed away by the water layer protecting the surface of the eye. Moreover, they cannot pass through a second protective layer - a lipid wall - and reach the retina.</p><p>\"Most molecules are either hydrophilic or lipophilic, they tend not to be both,\" Stef\u00e1nsson explained, adding that they needed to find a molecule \"able to cross two barriers which are completely unlike each other.\"</p><p>Eventually, they found what they were looking for - a nanoparticle made from cyclodextrins, which are produced from starch.</p><p>\"It's eight glucose units that form a cylinder like a doughnut, and the doughnut is water soluble on the outside and lipophilic on the inside,\" the researcher said.</p><p>The drug molecule contained in the eye drops hides in the hole of the doughnut and manages to reach the back of the eye after the cylinder dissolves.</p><p>\"What's beautiful is that the doughnut is made of big hydrophilic molecules that are digested by alpha-amylase, the basic enzyme that we use to cleave carbohydrates,\" the researcher said.</p><p>In a nutshell, the molecule breaks down into glucose, without generating any waste product.</p><p>\"And amazingly, this starts even in the tear film itself,\" Stef\u00e1nsson added, calling the invention a \"friendly technology.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From theory to practice, slowly</emphasis></p><p>Stef\u00e1nsson and Loftsson worked for more than 30 years to go from theory to practice.</p><p>\"Over 15-20 years, we studied the [protective] barriers and managed to breach them one by one.\"</p><p>Then it took them another 10 to 15 years to develop a drug that could be placed on the market.</p><p>\"I don't think I ever thought it was not going to work. But it was a different question whether we would succeed in bringing it to market,\" Stef\u00e1nsson said, highlighting the regulatory, financial, and marketing aspects of placing a new medicine on the market.</p><p>\"But we understand the science and the technology and we were confident about that, although these things take an enormously long time,\" he added.</p><p>Asked what motivated him to pursue three-decade-long research to develop the new scientific technology, he said: \"I tell my students that they will recognise the truth when they see it because it's going to be simple and it's going to be beautiful.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Silvia Ellena</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/subscribe-to-the-health-brief/\">Subscribe to\u00a0EURACTIV's Health Brief</url>, where you'll find the latest roundup of news covering health from across Europe.

However they say the text needs to go further if it is to protect Indigenous populations from mining companies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In February 2022, the European Commission adopted a proposal called the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.</p><p>It's goal is to ensure that businesses are held accountable for the consequences of their decisions with regards to human rights, climate change and environment, including in their value chains inside and outside Europe.</p><p>It's a move away from voluntary audits to an imposed legal responsibility enshrined in international and national laws.</p><p>As the European Union looks outwards to meet its needs for a green transition in terms of energy, transport and technology, one of the industries in the spotlight for diligence is mining.</p><p>The International Energy Agency forecasts that mineral requirements for clean energy technologies will quadruple by 2040.</p><p>Most of the world's untapped reserves for transitional minerals such as nickel, lithium, cobalt and copper, used in battery technology, are found in Indigenous territories such as South America, Africa and Asia.</p><p>Edson Krenak, a descendant of the Krenak people of Brazil, was one of three Indigenous leaders representing the American NGO Cultural Survival who came to Brussels last week to bring attention to the impacts extractive industries such as oil, gas, and mining have on Indigenous Peoples' rights, lands and environments.</p><p>Krenak says that while he was pleased by the European initiative, he is concerned it will not stand up to the pressure faced by Indigenous groups.</p><p>Vague text</p><p>Only 1 percent of companies in Europe are large enough to come under the jurisdiction of the proposed law, Krenak told RFI, adding that smaller partners of the larger companies may be able to slip through the net.</p><p>He said the text remained too vague on Indigenous Peoples' affairs.</p><p>The EU directive does not make specific reference to the right to free, prior and informed consent covered by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), nor the International Labour Organisation convention 169, Krenak said.</p><p>In some cases, Cultural Survival noted that previously included annexes referring to Indigenous rights had been deleted.</p><p>\"We need more visibility, more dialogue. This is going to be a huge fight,\" Krenak says, hoping that EU representatives will realise just how potentially ground-breaking the deal could be.</p><p>Indigenous people represent 470 million people around the world, or about 6 percent of the total population.</p><p>\"There can be no climate justice without the effective participation of Indigenous peoples, the main stewards of the planet's biodiversity,\" Krenak says.</p><p>Biodiversity goals crucial to saving planet, experts tell climate summit</p><p>The Business and Human Rights Resources Centre reported in 2021 that there had been 495 human rights allegations made against 115 companies involved in transition mineral extraction over a period of 10 years.</p><p>For this to change, access to justice must be improved, Krenak said, adding the communities concerned by mining projects are often in extremely remote areas, where no English, Spanish or Portuguese is spoken, only local dialects.</p><p>Krenak told RFI the people do not have enough money to for expensive legal aid for cases that can take years to come to a head.</p><p>He said a more conclusive legal structure that regulates the industry could lay the groundwork to change this and avoid debacles that have left entire communities without justice.</p><p>Waiting for justice</p><p>One example Krenak refers to is the Brumadinho disaster in January 2019. Nearly 300 people were killed when a mining dam collapsed triggering a toxic mudslide which swamped the town in southeastern Brazil.</p><p>A judge in Brazil ordered Vale \u2013 the mine owner \u2013 to pay compensation to victims in what is considered the country's worst mining accident.</p><p>The contamination of the nearby rivers has meant the destruction of livelihoods for many communities, like the Pataxo Ha-ha-hae Indigenous group. Moved to temporary shelter in schools, they have been fighting to be properly relocated, but they are still waiting for a legal resolution.</p><p>Investigators later found evidence the German company T\u00dcV S\u00fcd that certified the structure as safe knew it was vulnerable to collapse. A class action lawsuit against T\u00dcV S\u00fcd in Munich began in 2021.</p><p>The inspection agency denies bearing any legal responsibility for the dam bursting, arguing that it was Vale who did not comply with the recommendations it made in its safety report.</p><p>Krenak says a similar situation has befallen his own people following an earlier disaster in 2015 when Vale's Mariana mining dam burst, contaminating the Rio Doce river, also in Brazil's Minas Gerais state.</p><p>Saving the planet means stopping land abuse, warns leaked IPCC report<br/>Only the beginning</p><p>\"I think the level of sensitivity is rising across the board, however, there is so much more work that needs to be done,\" Galina Angarova, a member of the Buryat people and fellow representative of Cultural Survival, told RFI after the talks in Brussels.</p><p>On a positive note, she says her delegation held talks with an \"important player\" willing to include an Indigenous Peoples' policy as part of their supplier code of conduct.</p><p>\"Another important achievement is that in the EU Battery regulation, despite the deletion of the reference to the UNDRIP and a result of our advocacy, we obtained two references to Indigenous Peoples, one being in the risk categories. I hope this is just the beginning,\" Angarova says.</p><p>\"We believe that the transition is inevitable but justice is not. And for this we need to ensure that justice is the core of this transition, every step of the way.\"</p><p>Meanwhile Krenak warns that limitless growth for European people equals poverty in other parts of the world. He calls on people to question why they think they need a new car every three years, and general patterns of consumerism.</p><p>Krenak likens humanity's predicament to the image of a sinking boat. When Mother Earth goes down, so does everyone else.</p><p>The proposal will go to the European Parliament and the council for approval later this year. Once adopted, member states will have two years to integrate the rules into national law.</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-112533724</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67PX-5KJ1-F11P-X4MK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1084\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

Our mission is to protect creation,\" Eber explains.</p><p>Like several members of the group, he is a regular participant in this ecumenical pilgrimage for climate justice, which is now in its fifth year.</p><p>The project was launched in 2015 and is supported by the Catholic and Protestant Churches in Germany. Church-affiliated charitable organizations such as Misereor and Brot f\u00fcr die Welt (Bread for the World) are also sponsors.</p><p>Each year the pilgrimage has a specific emphasis. This year it is promoting more environmentally friendly agriculture, food and transport.</p><p>\"We are just one of many small groups, but I think we are having an impact,\" Kn\u00f6lker says.</p><p>\"The dialogue is particularly intense with the people who house us,\" he notes.</p><p>But sometimes there are ugly incidents.\u00a0</p><p>In 2018, when the pilgrimage\u2019s theme was to end dependence on coal, the group was attacked by miners in the Ruhr, Germany\u2019s industrial heartland.\u00a0</p><p>\"This year, we did not have any problems when we passed through the Lusatia mining region in the eastern part of the country. On the contrary, the contact was more relaxed,\" says Wolfgang Eber.</p><p>In the meantime, Germany has made progress on the issue and announced that by 2038 it will no longer produce electricity from coal.</p><p>The pilgrims make two-night stops in the same place, as in G\u00f6ttingen. This allows them to get to the heart of the matter with the host communities.</p><p>In the Protestant parish of Saint-Christophe, about 40 people took part in a debate on the role of local churches in the fight against global warming.</p><p>The experience of the Protestant Church of Berlin-Brandenburg was astonishing. In particular, it has decided to no longer install fossil fuel heating beginning next January.\u00a0</p><p>\"Churches are natural allies for environmental protection movements,\" says Kn\u00f6lker, who describes himself as a \"green\" as much as a practicing Christian.</p><p>Eber also sees the role of religious institutions as central, but regrets their reluctance to get involved.</p><p>\"I am very proud that Pope Francis is so committed to the climate,\" says Eber, who points out that he carried a copy of the encyclical\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato si'</emphasis>in his bag during his first pilgrimage in 2015.\u00a0</p><p>\"Awareness is growing in the parishes, but the actions are insufficient,\" he laments.</p><p>That\u2019s why he\u2019s committed to walking between 20-25 kilometers per day towards Glasgow with a 10 kg rucksack on his back \u2013 in order to make a difference.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/uploads/news/2021/09/pilgrims-walk-to-bring-awareness-to-climate-change-14965-100.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LCRXIN-14965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LCRXIN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63R5-F241-JDH4-40C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438647</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Bayard-Presse All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>La Croix International</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"57188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/news/environment/pilgrims-walk-to-bring-awareness-to-climate-change/14965\">https://international.la-croix.com/news/environment/pilgrims-walk-to-bring-awareness-to-climate-change/14965</url><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 29, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

In other places, the tops of cars are just visible but the water around them ripples with raindrops, closing in fast.       </p><p>The rain is not the only factor.       </p><p>Every year, neighboring Cameroon - which runs along the length of Nigeria's eastern border - releases water from a dam in northern Cameroon, causing flooding downstream in Nigeria. At the time of the dam's construction, in the 1980s, the two countries agreed that a twin dam would be built on the Nigerian side to contain the overflow. But the second one was never realized.       </p><p>Nigeria's minister of humanitarian affairs, Sadiya Umar Farouq, blamed the scale of the disaster on the failure by branches of government other than her own to take action. \"There was enough warning and information about the 2022 flood, but states, local governments and communities appear not to take heed,\" the minister wrote on Twitter.       </p><p>Another critical factor is climate change.       </p><p>Matthias Schmale, the United Nations' humanitarian coordinator for the country, said in a briefing last week that this largely explains the extreme flooding.       </p><p>\"Climate change is real, as we are yet again discovering in Nigeria,\" he said.       </p><p>The phenomenon is causing ruin across Africa, and as the continent is heavily dependent on agriculture, the effects are particularly devastating economically.       </p><p>Nigeria, which is by far Africa's most populous country with more than 200 million people, lists in a national climate policy document droughts, poor air quality, imperiled human health and habitat loss alongside floods as the effects of climate change.       </p><p> A recent paper on climate justice by the nonprofit Africa Center together with the Energy for Growth Hub, a Washington research institute, says almost all African countries have contributed \"essentially nothing\" to climate change. On the other hand, it says, the United States, the European Union, China, India and Russia are the big emitters of carbon, known to contribute to climate change. But despite pledges to help fund climate adaptation in Africa, rich nations have, so far, produced very few funds, high-level African officials say.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Here are scenes from the floods in Nigeria.</emphasis></p><p>A woman weeping in a flooded street in Anambra, one of the worst-affected states.       </p><p>People stranded on a half-submerged road in Kogi, a central state, on Oct. 6.

They are both members of the European Parliament\u2019s Environment Committee and are attending the UN Climate Change Summit.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a child, you learn at some point to clean up when you\u2019ve left a mess behind. Well, that\u2019s a lesson that many people don\u2019t seem to have learned \u2013 people who are now in powerful jobs and making enormous profits, including by polluting the earth and not cleaning up their mess.</p><p>Rich industrialised countries have used the Earth\u2019s atmosphere as a free dumping ground for more than 150 years. The wealthiest 10% of the world\u2019s population exceed the target per capita emissions by a factor of nine, and the wealthiest 1% by a factor of 30. According to Oxfam, the super-rich live like ecological vandals with a free pass to destroy our climate.</p><p>Now we are facing a dangerous and alarming era of climate change impacts, causing massive loss and damage and driving up inequality in the world\u2019s poorest countries that have contributed least to the climate crisis. Pakistan, for example, is one of the world\u2019s most affected by climate change, even though it accounts for less than 1% of global emissions.</p><p>Developed and developing countries alike are affected by loss and damage. However, losses and damages have a greater impact on the most vulnerable people, communities and countries, most of which are in the Global South. Compared to rich countries, they lack the resources to reduce and address loss and damage.</p><p>Developing countries have long called for a financing mechanism for such \u201closs and damage\u201d in international climate negotiations.</p><p>For over 30 years, Parties to the UN Climate Change Summit, COP, have discussed the issue. However, rich countries continue to refuse to assume their responsibility to pay for loss and damage in developing countries.</p><p>Adopting its motion for resolution on the upcoming Climate Change Summit COP27, MEPs called on the EU to push for the establishment of a loss and damage finance mechanism at the next COP and for loss and damage to be a standing agenda item for future COPs.</p><p>The issue will likely be a source of controversy right at the beginning of the summit. We are hosting an event on climate reparations ahead of COP27, and you can register <url normalizedValue=\"https://left.eu/events/climate-reparations-now-the-case-for-eu-support-for-loss-and-damage-financing/\">here</url>.</p><p>The upcoming UN Climate Change Summit is not only about emissions, it is about hope and justice \u2013 and about cash, huge amounts of money, think trillions.</p><p>Thus, very little can be promised if the finance ministers of the parties are back home and COP negotiators face only strict mandates and little room for manoeuvre. When important questions involving finance are on the table, we need the finance ministers there.</p><p>Climate justice will not be possible without redesigning the global financial architecture. With up to 94 countries facing debt distress, while losses and damages grow every year due to climate change necessitating further borrowing, states are locked in a vicious debt cycle.</p><p>Detailed proposals have been laid out, including debt for climate swaps, emphasis on grants-based finance, and the issuance of new Special Drawing Rights to serve low-carbon development plans.</p><p>Climate finance needs bold ideas, not business as usual. Big polluters must be kept out or at least forced to act responsibly.</p><p>The 60 biggest global banks have invested US$3.8 trillion in fossil fuels since the Paris climate talks \u2013 40 of those banks are in the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero coalition. As long as the arsonists are advising the fire brigade, the climate cannot be saved.</p><p>It goes without saying that any form of financing mechanism should not be at the expense of public budgets and services of general interest. States should not touch social, education or health spending, nor should a special levy burden those who suffer from inflation, rising rents and energy costs.</p><p>The basic principle must be: make big polluters pay. Or in other words: it\u2019s time for the rich to grow up and clean up their mess.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-httpswwweuractivcomsectionclimateenvironmentopinionwhycop27needsradicalideasandashiftofparadigm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66T9-6TY1-JCMC-W38P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Euractiv Media Network B.V.

This represents an important and promising initiative, the potential benefits of which could be greatly enhanced by channelling international carbon dividends back to poorer nations to support their clean transition.</p><p>Long discussed in economic circles, the climate club idea has recently gained momentum. Its contours are clear: club members commit to ambitious domestic emissions reductions and, at the same time, jointly introduce carbon border adjustment measures to hedge against industry moving to regions with lower climate ambitions. In addition, they cooperate on the transformation of their industrial sectors to establish an international lead market for climate-friendly materials and products. That way, climate policy pioneers will avoid a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace because of their climate efforts, especially when it comes to energy-intensive industries.</p><p>All this is sensible, but to be aligned with the Paris Agreement, a climate club needs to respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, which postulates that while all countries must take responsibility for fighting the global climate crisis, it is necessary to recognise the significant differences in terms of economic development and historical carbon emissions.</p><p>For a climate club to respect this principle and to live up to the imperative of climate justice, it is key to support to emerging economies and developing countries in their transition to a low carbon future. The German proposal hints at helping emerging economies and developing countries to potentially become members of the climate club, but it remains vague on the issue.</p><p>Much like domestic carbon taxes, carbon border adjustment measures can also hit the poor harder than the rich - now on a global scale, that is in the Global South. And as carbon dividends can be seen as the building blocks for a future climate safety net for citizens, revenues of carbon border adjustment measures can amount to the same at the global level.</p><p>Short of that, the rich will end up taxing the poor. This not only unacceptable from an ethical point of view. It also risks discouraging the much-needed support from Global South nations for international climate action. And this is exactly the reason why revenues obtained from the mechanism must be used as international carbon dividends.</p><p>Critics claim is that trade should not be used as a climate policy instrument. In our view, this is just inevitable. To act in line with their domestic climate goals, countries need to act beyond their borders. The recent proposal to curb EU-driven deforestation gains teeth by banning imports of products such as beef, palm oil, cocoa linked to deforestation globally. Short of a climate leviathan - that is, in the absence of coercive powers in the framework of the Paris Agreement - low ambition in climate action can only be upped via raising the costs, that is, through trade.</p><p>The world is at a crossroads. We need to find new ways of stimulating global climate action and addressing the free-rider problem stemming from climate policy costs being largely national while the benefits are global. Clearly, the Paris Agreement must remain the central pillar of global climate action. But the world needs complementary measures to speed-up climate efforts. During its G7 presidency, Germany should therefore provide a strong push for a climate club.</p><p>That said, such a club should indeed be open and cooperative. That centrally means membership can be thought of as a tit-for-tat: prospective club members commit to climate action, in return for which they benefit from international carbon dividends and a clear commitment by club members to join forces in fostering technology transfer and climate finance.</p><p>One thing's for sure, though: against the backdrop of the global climate crisis, the key question is not whether trade should or should not be used to incentivise climate action. The question is how it should be used to do so. In our view, a climate club built around the notion of international carbon dividends represents an important step in the right direction - and 2022 might be the year to deliver it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1695580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64H3-5HR1-JCF9-40MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 10, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>carbon border adjustment mechanism</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>carbon border tax</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>cbam</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>G7</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

We must also rapidly phase out the fossil fuels we're using.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In moments like this, the media rarely focuses on African countries like mine, Uganda. When it does, it covers the impacts - the devastation we are already experiencing and the catastrophes that loom. They are right to: Mozambique has been battered in recent years by cyclones intensified by climate change. Drought in Kenya linked to climate change has left millions hungry. In Uganda, we are now more frequently hit by extreme flash floods that destroy lives and livelihoods.       </p><p>But this latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, on how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent more of these impacts, has implications for Africa's energy systems, too. Africa isn't only a victim of the climate crisis, but also a place where infrastructure decisions made in the coming years will shape how it unfolds.       </p><p>TotalEnergies, a French energy company, this year announced a $10 billion investment decision, which involves a nearly 900-mile oil pipeline from Kabaale, Uganda, to a peninsula near Tanga, Tanzania. From there, the oil would be exported to the international market.       </p><p>Despite local opposition, TotalEnergies and a partner, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, have pushed ahead. The project might have a difficult time securing additional financing, as many banks have already ruled out the project. The multinational insurance company Munich Re has also vowed not to insure it, at least in part because of the harm it would do to the climate.       </p><p>Burning the oil that the pipeline will transport could emit as much as 36 million tons of carbon dioxide per year, according to one estimate. That is roughly seven times the total annual emissions of Uganda.       </p><p>More immediately, the East African Crude Oil Pipeline will have terrible consequences for people in Uganda and Tanzania. An estimated 14,000 households will lose land, according to Oxfam International, with thousands of people set to be economically or physically displaced. There are reports that compensation payments offered to some communities are completely insufficient. The pipeline will also disturb wildlife habitats. The climate writer and activist Bill McKibben said that it looks almost as if the route had been \"drawn to endanger as many animals as possible.\" An oil spill would be even more catastrophic for habitats and our freshwater supplies. (TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation previously said they are working to avoid causing damage to the countries.)       </p><p>Oil pipelines have become a symbol around the world of the fight for climate justice. In 2021 the Biden administration halted the Keystone XL pipeline in the United States after a decade-long fight led by Indigenous groups, climate activists and farmers. In East Africa the Stop EACOP campaign is a similar alliance that has emerged to fight fossil fuel infrastructure. Over a million people have signed a petition calling on TotalEnergies and the pipeline's other backers to stop the project.       </p><p>However, the Ugandan government remains largely in favor of the pipeline. Politicians have seemingly bet their political futures on the promise of revenues it could generate. Understandably, many people in Uganda not directly affected by the pipeline also think the oil could be a door to wealth. Our country has low levels of formal employment, and many people struggle to feed their families. Oil was discovered in the Lake Albert basin in 2006, when I was in primary school, and I remember my teacher proudly announcing to the class that Uganda had found \"black gold.\"       </p><p>But the discovery of oil in Nigeria, Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo has not brought widespread prosperity. Instead, it has brought poverty, violence and the loss of traditional lands and cultures. Much of the profits have gone to foreign multinationals and investors and to the pockets of corrupt local officials. TotalEnergies and the China National Offshore Oil Corporation will own 70 percent of the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, with Uganda and Tanzania sharing the remaining 30 percent. This pipeline is not an investment for the people.       </p><p>It is also not an investment for the long term. The International Energy Agency projects that growth in renewable energy will accelerate in the next four years. Fossil fuel projects like EACOP could lead to short-term gains but eventually huge losses - and might end up among the estimated $1.3 trillion of stranded oil and gas assets by around 2050.       </p><p>Research presented by the International Renewable Energy Agency found that sub-Saharan Africa can meet almost 70 percent of its electricity needs from local renewable energy by 2030, which would provide up to two million additional green jobs in the region by 2050. Africa possesses 39 percent of the world's potential for renewable energy, according to Carbon Tracker, but along with the Middle East, receives only 2 percent of annual investment. Africa needs the climate financing it has been promised by rich countries, as well as from private institutions, to develop clean energy.       </p><p>There is a huge appetite for clean energy alternatives here. I have seen it through my work to install solar panels and clean stoves in rural schools. These efforts sometimes feel hopeless when money floods in from foreign banks and governments for fossil fuels. But Africa is where critical investments should go in our fight for a stable climate in the coming years. Financial institutions must reject the East African Crude Oil Pipeline and fossil fuel projects like it, in favor of clean energy. The science is clear. So is the case for investment.       </p><p>Vanessa Nakate is a Ugandan climate justice activist.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

With the encouragement of conservation groups, wildlife fans observed International Cheetah Day with #savethecheetah videos, facts and fund-raising appeals. \"The cheetah is racing against extinction! Spread the word,\" a post in circulation read.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Conservation groups, urban zoos and makers of animated films have long relied on the charisma of large, fuzzy and highly endangered species to draw attention. Entreaties to save the cheetah, a species that numbers fewer than 7,000 worldwide, raised more than $4 million from U.S. donors last year. Cheetahs do need humans' help to survive. But by creating and leveraging what one researcher calls \"spectacles of extinction,\" such campaigns distract from a larger crisis that threatens all species, including ours.       </p><p>When humans destroy forests, grasslands, swamps, coral reefs and other living systems, we are not only harming other species but also destroying our own food supplies, subjecting our homes to extreme weather and polluting our air and water. Though we treat conservation as an altruistic pursuit - a special interest championed by a passionate few - it's also a selfish cause. We should approach conservation not as an opportunity for heroics, but as an obligation to the relationships we depend on for survival.       </p><p>This week, delegates from more than 190 countries are gathered in Montreal for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference, known as COP15, where they are trying to agree on a strategy for halting biodiversity loss by 2030 and reversing it by 2050. Other goals include protection of the estimated one million species that human activity is driving toward extinction, many of which are more immediately threatened by habitat destruction and over-hunting than climate change.       </p><p>But compared with the 2021 United Nations climate conference in Glasgow, or its follow-up meeting in Egypt last month, this gathering is getting little press coverage. And while there are some protesters in the streets of Montreal, the mass movement for biodiversity is far smaller than the one demanding climate justice.       </p><p>One reason for the relative quiet may be that it can be easier, and in some cases more satisfying, to focus on spectacles of extinction. Rescuing a threatened species from oblivion is enormously difficult, but it is far simpler than changing our priorities to restore the complex, interdependent systems of life on Earth.       </p><p>Biodiversity protection is more complicated than climate protection, since it relies less directly on technology such as cheaper solar panels and has fewer clear measures of success.       </p><p>So we dwell, with appalled fascination, on the northern white rhino, a subspecies that has only two surviving members - both female - and whose future may depend on the ability of reproductive scientists to turn skin cells into stem cells and eventually into viable sperm and egg cells. We ponder curiosities such as so-called de-extinction, an unproven technology that may one day succeed in creating a hybrid individual with DNA from extinct and extant species, but will never reverse extinction. Or we post and donate on behalf of vulnerable species on other continents, conflating our concern with effective action. Suzanne Brandon, a Ph.D. student in sociology who studied the experiences of \"voluntourists\" in Namibia, found that while they felt outrage about the overall plight of the species, they were largely unaware or dismissive of local conservation policies and practices.       </p><p>That's the real trouble with spectacles of extinction: By seizing our attention and our hearts, they obscure the countless ongoing efforts to protect biodiversity from the ground up. Throughout the plains of North America, for example, the Indigenous communities whose expertise the conservation movement has long ignored are returning bison to the prairie ecosystem. In watersheds in North America and Europe, beavers, once persecuted as pests, have been embraced by an enthusiastic network of landowners and public-land managers as partners in restoration. Where I live, in the Pacific Northwest, a small, not particularly flashy butterfly called the Fender's blue inspired a collaboration that has not only recovered the species but helped restore its prairie habitat. And in Namibia, a leader in the worldwide community-led conservation movement, a national system of local conservancies has enabled those who live alongside endangered and other species to both participate in their protection and benefit from the resulting tourism and hunting opportunities. Thanks in part to the sustained efforts of Namibian conservancy members, the country's cheetah population is not - for now, at least - racing against extinction, but stable.       </p><p>All of these endeavors are at least a little bit selfish, benefiting their hardworking human participants as well as other species. None, of course, is anything close to a cure-all. But with political savvy and persistence, they are beginning to change attitudes and economies, creating opportunities to fulfill our broader obligations to the rest of life. They need all the support they can get - from the delegates in Montreal, from governments at every level and from all of us whose futures depend on their success.       </p><p>Michelle Nijhuis is the author of \"Beloved Beasts: Fighting for Life in an Age of Extinction.\"       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

At the American Geophysical Union meeting in December, just before speakers took the stage for a plenary session, my fellow climate scientist Peter Kalmus and I unfurled a banner that read, \"Out of the lab &amp; into the streets.\" In the few seconds before the banner was ripped from our hands, we implored our colleagues to use their leverage as scientists to wake the public up to the dying planet.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Soon after this brief action, the A.G.U., an organization with 60,000 members in the earth and space sciences, expelled us from the conference and withdrew the research that we presented that week from the program. Eventually it began a professional misconduct inquiry. (It's ongoing.)       </p><p>Then, on Jan. 3, Oak Ridge, the laboratory outside Knoxville where I had worked as an associate scientist for one year, terminated my employment. I am the first earth scientist I know of to be fired for climate activism. I fear I will not be the last.       </p><p>Oak Ridge said it was forced to fire me because I misused government resources by engaging in a personal activity on a work trip and because I did not adhere to its code of business ethics and conduct. The code has points on scientific integrity, maintaining the institution's reputation and using government resources \"only as authorized and appropriate and with integrity, responsibility and care.\"       </p><p>When Dr. Kalmus and I decided to make our statement during the lunch plenary session, I knew that we risked being asked to leave the stage or the conference. But I did not expect that our research would be removed from the program or that I would lose my job. When I began participating in climate actions with other scientists in 2022, senior managers at Oak Ridge asked that I make it clear to the public and the media that I spoke and acted on my own behalf. I followed these guidelines to the best of my ability, including at the A.G.U., where Dr. Kalmus, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and I did not mention our institutions in our statements.       </p><p>The retaliation I faced from the A.G.U. and Oak Ridge ultimately highlights a disappointing reality: that established scientific institutions will not even support scientists interrupting a meeting for the climate. I'm all for decorum, but not when it will cost us the earth.       </p><p>I used to be a well-behaved scientist. I stood quietly on melting permafrost in Utqiagvik, Alaska, and measured how much greenhouse gas was released into the atmosphere. I filled spreadsheets and ran simulations about how warming temperatures would increase the carbon emissions from soil.       </p><p>To do my job, I dissociated the data I was working with from the terrifying future it represented. But in the field, smelling the dense rot of New England hemlock trees that were being eaten by a pest that now survives the warming winters, I felt loss and dread. Only my peers read my articles, which didn't seem to have any tangible effects. Though I saw firsthand the oncoming catastrophe of climate change, I felt powerless to help.       </p><p>I did, however, believe that if scientists told the truth about the climate emergency, our scientific institutions would get out the message to policymakers, government officials, the media and the public. But they didn't - at least not sufficiently - even as carbon emissions continued to rise and the climate continued to warm.       </p><p>A few years ago, Scientist Rebellion, an international network of scientists concerned about climate change, began a series of strategic acts of nonviolent civil disobedience. After years of waiting in vain for meaningful public action to address climate change, I decided to join them.       </p><p>For my first action, I chained myself to a White House gate to demand that the Biden administration declare a climate emergency. Since I locked that first chain around my waist, I have been arrested three times in nonviolent actions. My superiors at Oak Ridge warned me to be careful but did not discipline me.       </p><p>But I was motivated to continue because these scientist-led political campaigns have attracted positive media attention and contributed to major policy wins. At the end of last year, a group of us protested the impact of luxury travel at more than a dozen private airport terminals in 13 countries; within a month of our actions, the Podemos party of Spain submitted a request to the European Commission to take measures to reduce the use of private planes. When scientists take action, people listen.       </p><p>The scientific community has tried writing dutiful reports for decades, with no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels to show for it. It is time to try something new. We must work to change the culture of our institutions, be honest about our values, advocate climate justice and experiment. Great experiments push at the boundaries of knowledge and propriety. They are risky, volatile, blasphemous. But when they work, the world changes.       </p><p>Scientific institutions should support activism and advocacy, especially by experts. The A.G.U. should do more to publicly support policies informed by its members' science, such as declaring a climate emergency and ending fossil fuel extraction and subsidies.       </p><p>I did not make the decision to become an activist lightly; I recognized that my actions would have consequences, and I knew that I could face retaliation. But inaction during this critical time will have far greater consequences.       </p><p>Rose Abramoff is an earth scientist who studies the effects of climate change on natural and managed ecosystems. She is also a climate activist, working with Scientist Rebellion and other groups.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times is committed to publishing </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">a diversity of letters</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> to the editor.

While the times of war increased the risks for infection, civil society is showing dedication to addressing the rising health concerns.\u00a0</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was 1st June when a medical van stopped at Lozova, in Kharkiv oblast, Eastern Ukraine. Prior to Russia's invasion, Lozova was home to 50,000 people - though the war has displaced over 30% of the country's population, either internally or beyond Ukraine's borders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As the van stopped in the town, people started gathering around. The van is one of the six vans from the Alliance for Public Health in Ukraine that operate with medical teams aiming to address medical needs in the frontline territories as well as providing testing of viral infections.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During rapid testing for viral hepatitis C, two positive results were recorded - one for a 40-year-old woman, and the other for her 45-year-old husband. The following day another case was reported for a 37-year-old man in a different city - Shevchenkiv.\u00a0</p><p>The unifying factor for the likelihood of infection, according to Iryna Filenko, a social worker of the Blago Foundation, was the local dentist in Kupyansk that they visited in the past six months.\u00a0</p><p>\"Perhaps the infection occurred there because this city is 8 km from the front. Frequent artillery fire. Frequent power outages. In the zone of active hostilities, non-compliance with the rules of instrument sterilisation is possible,\" Filenko explained to EURACRIV.</p><p>The example Filenko gave encapsulates how wartimes increase the spread of viruses, such as hepatitis C. While sharing drug injection equipment is the driving risk for the virus spread, wartimes create new ways and new risk groups.</p><p>\"In terms of injecting drug use, the risks remain as they were but they are higher now because people taking less care about sterility,\" Tetiana Deshko, director of International Programs at Alliance for Public Health in Ukraine, told EURACTIV at the EASL liver congress in Vienna, Austria.\u00a0</p><p>But frontlines create further risk groups, as there is a lot of blood contact among the military.</p><p>\"I have to say military people are now so much affected by hepatitis,\" Deshko said, adding that so far there are no statistics on this available.\u00a0</p><p>\"We think that this is one of the gaps that the country would soon have to address more significantly,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Another risk group are sex workers, whose number increased in the frontline areas, according to Deshko, as destroyed industries have led to reduced employment opportunities.</p><p>Taking the increased risks of hepatitis spread into account, Ukraine is in a particularly difficult situation as \"even before the war the situation with hepatitis was very challenging in Ukraine\". In the opening press conference of the EASL liver congress, Deshko said that an estimated 5% of the adult population lives with hepatitis C infection.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's 1.3 million people, it's a massive population,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>Moreover, as viral hepatitis does not show symptoms until serious health complications occur, only one in 10 people infected with the hepatitis C virus are aware of their condition, Deshko said. Because of this, the disease is known as the \"silent killer\".</p><p>Deshko's organisation, the International Programs at Alliance for Public Health, responds to HIV, hepatitis and tuberculosis, going closer to communities with mobile units to ensure linkage to care to the risk groups. Since the war started, they also provide humanitarian help and general healthcare.\u00a0</p><p>The group operates in frontline territories with a team of a doctor, a nurse, a social worker, and a driver. Among a number of medical tests available, they provide hepatitis C testing, as well as basic medications and hygiene products.</p><p>\"First, you see no one,\" Deshko started telling how the situation is when visiting with the mobile units.\u00a0</p><p>\"After 10 minutes, people start coming out from underground of their houses. And they're often elderly people, but also young people. They say that they haven't seen any medical worker for the last half a year or so. So they come with very basic needs,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/352201316_202900532220350_8482647832035967421_n.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Visit of the mobile team by Alliance for Public Health in Zaporizhzhia region. [Dmytro Korobenko]</p><p>The mobile units address a variety of medical needs, as access to healthcare is challenging in times of war - while at the same time providing a chance to diagnose people infected with hepatitis C.\u00a0</p><p>\"Health-seeking behaviour is very low in people. Especially men - when they offered rapid testing for hepatitis C, they would rather say no,\" Deshko said.</p><p>\"But if they are coming for humanitarian aid to get some things which are necessary for the home, while they are standing in the queue, there is time to persuade the person a little bit and really kind of motivate them to seek medical advice as well.\"\u00a0</p><p>However, diagnosis does not ensure treatment and with the majority of Ukraine's budget dedicated to war, the situation still runs up against difficulties.</p><p>The Ukrainian government used to procure medications for treating between 16,000 and 18,000 patients with hepatitis C annually. However, currently, as 60% of the national budget is the war budget, according to Deshko, the number of treated patients was reduced to about 12,000 in 2022.\u00a0</p><p>\"It is largely because there are not enough medications to treat people and there are just too many structural barriers, populations are moving across the country. Some of the facilities are not available anymore as one in 10 health facilities in Ukraine has been either destroyed or damaged by Russian shelling,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p>When it comes to hepatitis treatment, of the 230 medical hospitals that offered treatment before the war, only around 80 are still offering the treatment.\u00a0</p><p>While the Alliance for public health procured some medication, Deshko called it a \"drop in the ocean\".</p><p>\"War veterans are coming without hands and without legs. They have to have proper proteases but they also need to get the proper checks for hepatitis and other blood-borne infections,\" Deshko urged.\u00a0</p><p>\"It's so important that we think about this response now,\" she said.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">By Giedre Peseckyte</emphasis></p><p>\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/subscribe-to-the-health-brief/\">Subscribe to\u00a0EURACTIV's Health Brief</url>, where you'll find the latest roundup of news covering health from across Europe.

However, the emergence of new risk factors, linked in particular to climate change, a more sedentary lifestyle and greater exposure to UV rays, are also contributing to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Only seven EU countries recognise the right to be forgotten for former cancer patients. </emphasis>Despite efforts by EU Institutions, cancer survivors in the European Union <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/oncological-right-to-be-forgotten-remains-an-unresolved-issue-in-the-eu/\">continue to experience difficulties in accessing financial services</url> like insurance or mortgages, years after successfully completing treatment.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">EU's new legislation gives EMCDDA more power.</emphasis> A new regulation of the European Parliament and the Council updated the mandate of the\u00a0 European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), according to a press release published on Friday (30 June) by EMCDDA. The future legislation will grant more power to the EMCDDA to better face the quick and complex changes in the drug landscape in Europe. It will come into application on 1 July 2024 and the EMCDDA will change its name to European Union Drugs Agency (EUDA). \"In recent years, there has been an increasing disconnect between the complexity and developments of today's drug phenomenon and the provision of the current mandate,\" the press release reads. The future EUDA will focus more on three key areas: monitoring, preparedness and competence development for better interventions. \"With a more proactive remit, adapted to the current reality, the new EUDA will be better equipped to support the EU and its Member States in addressing emerging issues in this field\", EMCDDA said. The new legislation initially comes from a proposal from the European Commission dated 12 January 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) lays out a Mental Health Action Plan.</emphasis> The organisation presented on Monday (3 July) a strategy to support the protection and promotion of mental well-being among athletes. The communication recognises that \"athlete's mental health needs are as important for their performance and well-being as their physical health needs\". The IOC has put in place certain key targets that aims to achieve by 2026 in order to guarantee good mental health in sports. For the implementation of this plan, the IOC will put in place expert-led tools to improve mental health literacy and encourage safe environments for athletes where they will be able to seek help and reduce stigma. According to the communication, the Olympic organisation will put special emphasis on addressing cross-cultural differences and sport-specific stressors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New European network of vaccine manufacturers to better prepare for future health threats. </emphasis>The European Commission announced on Friday (30 June) a new network of vaccine manufacturers in the EU, \"EU FAB\". The idea is to create a net of producers with capacities to respond to future health emergencies. This network will be financed by the Health Emergency and Response Authority (HERA) together with the European Health and Digital Executive Agency (HaDEA) and will receive (EURO)160 million per year. \"EU FAB\" will be able to quickly produce up to 325 million vaccines every year if needed in facilities in Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain. The companies members of this network will be responsible for ensuring that facilities, staff and supply chains are maintained to enable them to quickly start manufacturing whenever the European Commission asks to do so.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Aviation Health Safety Protocol that was in place during the COVID-19 pandemic officially ends its work. </emphasis>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) have formally withdrawn the safety protocol that was in place during the pandemic. After the World Health Organisation declared that COVID-19 is no longer a public health emergency in May 2023 and following the stable trends in the EU, the responsible health authorities consider that the protocol is no longer needed. The AHSP was first presented in May 2020 with the idea of implementing measures that allowed to ensure health safety in aviation, both for passengers and stakeholders, without endangering flight safety. According to both agencies, they will continue to work together to prevent similar situations to happen in the future.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The ECDC warns of an increase in legionnaires disease in Europe.</emphasis> The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) published on Monday (3 July) a report that shows a rising number of cases of legionnaires disease, a form of pneumonia, in the EU during the year 2021, with more than 10,700 cases and 704 deaths reported. Only four countries - Italy, Spain, Germany and France - account for 75% of the cases. According to the ECDC, the causes of this increase are not clear, but it identifies some factors that can contribute to it, like changes in national testing policies, ageing population, conditions of water systems and changes in climate. The health agency recommends that public health authorities be vigilant and prepared to identify possible outbreaks.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Medicine regulatory agencies conclude that COVID-19 vaccines saved millions of lives and play a key role in tackling the pandemic. </emphasis>The International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (IMCRA) affirmed the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine by analysing long-term data obtained from the more than 13 billion doses administrated worldwide during the last two years. Health authorities determine that the vaccine helped to significantly reduce the risk of severe disease and death from COVID infection. While they recognise some rare serious side effects, it also concludes that the \"benefits of the approved vaccines far outweigh the possible risks\". The <url normalizedValue=\"https://icmra.info/drupal/strategicinitiatives/vaccines/safety_statement\">statement</url> issued by IMCRA also addresses the consequences of misinformation during the pandemic and debunks the idea that vaccines caused excess mortality. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://ci4.googleusercontent.com/proxy/BKNGWFV5RApoJ0-ex9lrrZCQuM5lc2qZhhppHHdAugTm8vP8Lg2rxcC3iOQucIsqw8Ecjq1MWyimwt2SotAMe6O60w=s0-d-e1-ft#https://api-esp.piano.io/-s/MpzTCHwBQ4p2jWscmJz-\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LISBON</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Portugal's health minister calls for 'prudence' in decriminalisation of synthetic drugs. </emphasis>Portuguese Health Minister Manuel Pizarro called for 'a lot of prudence' in the process of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/portugals-health-minister-calls-for-prudence-in-decriminalisation-of-synthetic-drugs/\">decriminalising synthetic drugs</url> to ensure that this 'good idea' does not end up disrupting the distinction between consumption and trafficking.

A group of organisations based in Africa and in Europe is starting a process to tackle challenging climate-related topics in the African context in the run-up to the next UN climate change conference, COP27, scheduled to take place in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, between 6-18 November 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The African Climate Dialogues, which bring together Church and civil society actors including communities and religious leaders from across the African continent and European organisations, are being launched today, 19 July. The main goal of the dialogues is to discuss African realities, personal experiences and perspectives on key topics related to the climate crisis. They will take the form of a series of meetings on key topics (see below) throughout August - September 2022, when expert participants will be invited to share their perspectives, discuss priorities and put forward solutions.</p><p>Inspired by Pope Francis's call for synodality (journeying together in dialogue) and the Laudato Si' encyclical, these participatory dialogues will reflect on climate realities of communities on the ground through the lens of Catholic Social Teachings, as well as climate science, distilling concrete policy outputs for COP27.</p><p>The outputs of these dialogues will be shared ahead of and during COP27 through a joint communiqu\u00e9, composed of inputs from climate realities on the ground, spiritual and technical reflections directed at governments at the national, regional and international levels. Ahead of COP27, the ACD stakeholders will present the joint communiqu\u00e9 to the media at a press conference, using the COP pressure to advance domestic policies that promote the best policy and action outcomes.</p><p>\"African communities are among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts in the world. Carbon trade leaves more questions unanswered in the climate negotiations and should be thrown out in COP 27.\" Chika Onyejiuwa, AEFJN</p><p>\"The youth are bearing a disproportionate burden in this climate crisis and they must be involved to a larger extent around the discussions and the negotiations. Ensuring that a majority of them are there and have a say when decisions about their future are made is imperative to changing the tide and inducing the much-needed change. They have the numbers, the capacity and solutions to address the global challenges confronting the world.\" Francisca Ziniel, CYNESA</p><p>\"As the dialogues create spaces for listening, reflection, debate and construction of solutions from a global perspective, they are connecting the priority biomes and territories for the planet (Congo, Amazon region, Mesoamerica, Asia, Guaran\u00ed Aquifer) so that different voices around the world can be heard with their complaints and suggestions\". Ecclesial Network Alliance</p><p>\"Science is clear that we stand to face unavoidable multiple climate hazards over the next two decades with global warming of 1.5\u00b0C (2.7\u00b0F). Already we are feeling dire climate impacts and people and ecosystems least able to cope are being hardest hit. COP27 must deliver real and urgent climate action now and we must put our differences aside and unite towards protecting and preserving our common home!\" Lydia Machaka, CIDSE</p><p>NOTES TO THE EDITORS </p><p>The following sessions will be part of the dialogues (more information here): </p><p>False Solutions and the Congo Basin - 19th July<br/>Food Systems, Agriculture Adaptation - 10th August<br/>Climate Finance - 31st August<br/>Loss and Damage - 8th September <br/>Migration  Displacement - 15th September<br/>The following organisations are part of the African Climate Dialogues Steering Committee: AEFJN, AFSA, CAFOD, Caritas Africa, Caritas Internationalis, CIDSE, CISONECC, CYNESA, Friends of the Earth Africa, Friends of the Earth International, Jesuits Conference of Africa and Madagascar, Jesuits Justice and Ecology network Africa, Laudato Si' Movement, REBAC, SCIAF, SECAM.</p><p>For general inquiries about the dialogues, please contact: Lydia Machaka, Climate Justice and Energy Officer, CIDSE (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:machaka@cidse.org\">machaka@cidse.org</email>)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWPRES-EN316061</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWPRES2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:664F-KH01-F12G-X0MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">338615</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"707\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 NEWS Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>NEWS Press (English)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"59010\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 10, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

As countries across the world fail to meet climate commitments to keep global temperatures below a fateful 2 degrees Celsius, can this year's COP27 in Egypt rise above the failures of the past \u2014 or is it destined to disappoint?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For almost 30 years, the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) has been the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of international climate talks. This year's COP27 kicks off on Sunday in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, under the aegis of the UN. Some 200 countries will take part, along with various companies, NGOs, scientists and journalists.</p><p>Although these monumental talks are meant to bring solutions on how to tackle climate change, they are often criticised for bringing a scant number of results to the table. A witness to last year's COP in Glasgow, Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg branded the conferences as \"greenwashing [...] not really meant to change the whole system\". The 19-year-old will not be attending COP27.</p><p>&gt;&gt; CO2 capture and storage: Environmental lifeline or blank cheque for polluters?</p><p>\"One of the main reasons behind the criticism is that we don't see the concrete effects of the commitments made. There is a lack of accountability and follow-up for the resources and means promised [by attendees],\" says S\u00e9bastien Treyer, director of the Institute for Sustainable Development and International Relations (IDDRI), referring to the global methane pledge and the financial alliance for net-zero, both devised at the COP26 in Glasgow last year.</p><p>To their detractors, COP conferences have served very little or no purpose at all. And perhaps with good reason. Greenhouse gas emissions hit a new high in 2021, the loss of biodiversity has been rampant and global warming has rapidly accelerated, causing intense heatwaves, devastating wildfires and historic floods.</p><p>Worse yet, former commitments made by attending countries are not being met. The Paris climate agreement, signed in 2015 at COP21, pledged to limit temperature rises to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. But the world is far off track, headed for a rise of around 2.5C by the end of the century. A \"catastrophic\" trajectory, according to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.</p><p>It's hard to believe that the upcoming COP can reverse this trend, given the looming energy crisis and ongoing tensions between China and the US, the world's two biggest polluters.</p><p>A 'transition' COP</p><p>Even if miraculous outcomes should not be expected at COP27, this year's conference is useful in several ways. First, to help prepare the ground for future conferences. Climate negotiations are so complex that they regularly require so-called \"transition\" COPs.</p><p>\"COP27 is a chance to prepare for the first global review in 2023, which will take stock of the Paris agreement's implementation. It's a matter of defining what criteria will be used to measure the progress that has been made,\" explains Greenpeace climate campaigner Cl\u00e9ment S\u00e9n\u00e9chal, a few hours before his departure to Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>The first of its kind to be held in Africa, the world's least polluting continent, COP27 is expected to be a milestone for climate justice. The countries most vulnerable to climate change intend to join forces and hold industrialised countries to account this year.</p><p>In 2009, wealthy countries pledged to mobilise 100 billion dollars per year starting 2020 for climate action in developing countries. But developed countries now say they won't meet that commitment until 2023, three years late. Only 79.6 billion dollars' worth of climate finance have been provided, far less than the 340 billion per year needed for adaptation by 2030, according to the UN.</p><p>\"We are facing an extremely complicated geopolitical moment in which countries in the Global South are showing their distrust towards the West. We hope that Germany and Canada, who lead the group of northern countries on this issue, will come up with more precise commitments in order to rebuild trust in the South, which has immense needs for investment,\" S\u00e9bastien Treyer explains.</p><p>The COP's raison d'\u00eatre </p><p>Providing a platform for vulnerable countries to speak as equals with the Global North is undoubtedly the COP's greatest strength. \"It's the only multilateral forum where discussions like these actually take place,\" campaigner Cl\u00e9ment S\u00e9n\u00e9chal insists. But the downside is that decisions must be taken unanimously. \"Every country has a veto, so we generally end up with the lowest common denominator.\"</p><p>\"The multilateral forum isn't perfect, but it's the best we've got,\" says IDDRI director Treyer, who insists on the importance of reaching \"agreements at the highest level\" to accelerate ecological transition.</p><p>By mobilizing civil society and raising public awareness, COP conferences also have the virtue of creating a common culture around major climate issues, crucial when such differing countries are part of the same conversation.</p><p>The annual climate convention encourages \"collective learning and the sharing of experiences,\" Treyer says. \"Weaning off coal is a real challenge in South Africa and Indonesia, as it has been for Germany. It's important for these countries to talk about their experiences and understand how to launch complex political and social negotiations in order to begin the transition.\"</p><p>&gt;&gt; Nile River under threat: A closer look at Egypt's water crisis</p><p>\"The COP events also keep diplomatic channels open on issues that have critical geopolitical implications. Climate change leads to population displacement, tensions over natural resources and challenges powerful interests,\" Greenpeace's S\u00e9n\u00e9chal says. \"Without this, the alternative is war and power struggles at the international level,\" he concludes.</p><p>This article was translated from the original in French.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-94641036</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66T2-WV11-F11P-X23B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

But unlike other protesters, some of whom had always been anti-establishment, Ms. Yamin had spent most of her life not only believing in the system but working at its top levels.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"My life and my work is a dance between an insider and an outsider,\" she said.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her experience as an insider goes back more than 30 years. Ms. Yamin, 57, is an internationally recognized environmental lawyer and a respected adviser to developing countries and small island nations like the Marshall Islands, working on their behalf at the international level.       </p><p>She is also a leading author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and was a key architect of the Paris climate agreement. Ms. Yamin is widely seen as responsible for securing, through behind-the-scenes diplomacy, a central element of the pact: The goal of net-zero emissions by midcentury.       </p><p>After the agreement, though, as Donald J. Trump rose to power in the United States and other countries continually delayed strong action on climate change, she said her faith in institutions began to crumble.       </p><p>\"I was na\u00efve about what we could achieve,\" Ms. Yasmin said of her intellectual journey. \"I've learned we cannot rely on lawyers and diplomats alone.\"       </p><p>That journey started when Ms. Yamin was studying law in her 20s. Growing up as a Pakistani immigrant in England who experienced racism, Ms. Yamin knew she wanted to spend her career fighting injustice. When she embarked on an internship with a small environmental law firm in 1991 as a recent Oxford graduate, Ms. Yamin knew she had found her calling. \"I never looked back,\" she said. \"I was optimistic.\"       </p><p>Since then, Ms. Yamin has attended nearly every major international climate conference, but she is best known for her work at the negotiations that led to the Paris Agreement.       </p><p>She had spent years working with academics, civil society groups and lawyers to make net-zero emissions - the idea of using reductions, carbon capture and carbon offsets to ensure that no additional greenhouse gases are added to the atmosphere - the rallying call of the 2015 conference. \"Farhana was among a handful of collaborators who was willing to step up and champion this quest,\" said Bernice Lee, a research director on sustainability at Chatham House, a London research organization.       </p><p>But just months after Ms. Yamin achieved one of the biggest victories of her career, she said, things took a turn for the worse. By 2016, some Western countries were seeing a rise of nationalism and a growing distrust of international institutions, with Britain voting to leave the European Union and Donald J. Trump threatening to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement if elected.       </p><p>\"I felt that the whole multilateral world, the international framework for human rights, was just collapsing around me,\" Ms. Yamin said.       </p><p>When, from a meeting room at a United Nations climate conference in Marrakesh, Morocco, Ms. Yamin watched Mr. Trump win the election, she was despondent. She felt that her 30-year career as a government lawyer and climate negotiator had amounted to nothing.       </p><p>\"All of it was going up in smoke,\" she said. \"I couldn't tell my clients, I couldn't lie to the Marshall Islands, that we would fix this.\" Ms. Yamin took a year off, spending most of her time in nature therapy classes and camping in the wilderness for weeks at a time.       </p><p>During her time off, Ms. Yamin began reading about other social movements, like the anti-apartheid campaign and the suffragist movement, that used social mobilization and nonviolent resistance to advance their causes. \"I felt that the climate movement was almost unique and fragile, relying mostly on insider tactics and not on movement building,\" she said. \"It wasn't relying on the full sets of tools.\"       </p><p>It was this idea that reignited Ms. Yamin's passion for climate and helped her get back to work. Instead of returning to climate diplomacy, Ms. Yamin joined the nascent Extinction Rebellion movement, a decentralized group that uses nonviolent action and civil disobedience, in 2018.       </p><p>Initially, Ms. Yamin became the leader of Extinction Rebellion's political team, using her knowledge of the diplomatic terrain to help the movement be more strategic in its activism and get more funding. Even in her new activist role, though, Ms. Yamin felt she was relying too heavily on her intellectual skills instead of putting her body on the line. When an Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report was issued in October 2018, Ms. Yamin was reading the report as activists filled Parliament Square in London. As she saw pictures of young people refusing to move and waiting to be arrested, she thought, \"I want to be with them.\"       </p><p>Ms. Yamin spent the following two years working with Extinction Rebellion, organizing and protesting alongside other activists. She stepped down from her role with the group in 2020 because of disagreements with other leaders. Ms. Yamin said she believed the movement was not focused enough on climate justice.       </p><p>Since then, Ms. Yamin has been charting a new path, one that does not depend on institutions or activist groups.       </p><p>At COP26, the latest United Nations climate summit, held last year in Glasgow, Ms. Yamin worked as hard as she always has at these events, eager to defend the legacy of Paris. But rather than spend her days in the negotiating room, surrounded by what she calls a \"toxic positivity,\" Ms. Yamin focused on movement-building and listening to vulnerable people who spoke outside the conference center.       </p><p>She said she left Glasgow heartbroken, both by the outcome of the conference and the stories she heard from marginalized communities about climate impacts. \"I could almost cry. We keep pushing the deadlines out,\" she said. \"At what point do we say, 'Enough?'\"       </p><p>For her next chapter, Ms. Yamin said she wants to work directly with frontline communities of color in Britain and help to mobilize the cultural sector to become more engaged in climate issues.       </p><p>\"We need the cultural sector and the creatives to help us imagine our way out of the crisis,\" she said. She also wants to educate philanthropic organizations on climate justice to help get more money to frontline communities. Her goal is to make sure every pocket of society is fighting the climate crisis. \"Everyone should have 'activist' on their C.V.,\" she said.       </p><p>When asked how she feels looking back at her career, Ms. Yamin paused. \"I'm proud of my achievements,\" she said. \"But I can't keep carrying on doing that in the face of known indifference.\"       </p><p>She added, \"I'm much more honest now.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008211065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6546-87T1-JC85-N183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>April 1, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009F0K</classCode><className>ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS447110 GASOLINE STATIONS WITH CONVENIENCE STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RDS.A (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RDS.A (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>RDS.A (EUR)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

It currently owes some $150m to the Portuguese state; and over $400m to its banks and other companies in Portugal.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa says the debt-for-nature deal will trade-off Cabo Verde's debt for improved environmental conditions, greater investment in energy transition, and will help in the reduction of impact from climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'This is a new seed that we sow in our future cooperation. Climate change is a challenge that takes place on a global scale and no country will be environmentally sustainable if all countries are not sustainable,' said Costa on Portugal's RTP television.</p><p>Debt-for-nature is a financial swap deal in which part of a country's foreign debt is pardoned in exchange for commitments to invest in climate and environmental reforms. The success of such a swap means there would be a relief or reduction in the public debt estimates of poor and developing countries who often have little resources to combat the impacts of climate change.</p><p>Globally, many countries have not recovered from the significant damage of Covid-19, and for many countries in the west Africa region, poor debt servicing and climate change remain a big challenge in the post-pandemic aftermath, including Cabo Verde.</p><p>Cabo Verde's economic and environmental shortfalls</p><p>The West African island nation does not have a solid reputation when it comes to its economy. Data obtained from the Africa Development Bank (AFDB) shows that its public debt increased from 155% of GDP in 2020 to 156.7% in 2021. During the first pandemic year, there was a decline in the social conditions that pushed the poverty level to 31.6 % and unemployment moved from 11.3% to 14.5% in the same period.</p><p>'As of 2021, Cape Verde owed $2bn to external creditors. The government of Portugal is one of the country's biggest creditors accounting for pound 140m [$149m] of its debt stock, but its share pales in comparison to that of Caixa Geral de Dep\u00f3sitos, a Portuguese state-owned banking corporation to which Cape Verde owes $427m,' Sarah Colenbrander, the director of ODI's climate and sustainability programme, a global affairs think-tank based in UK, tells The Africa Report.</p><p>'The World Bank and Africa Development Bank are also major creditors, at $523m and $263m respectively. In 2021, Cabo Verde spent $81m servicing debts to these and other external creditors - around 8.6% of GDP,' she says.</p><p>READ MORE AU summit: Opening ceremony casts light on debts, conflicts, climate change</p><p>The natural ecosystem and habitats of Cabo Verde, which are facing serious challenges, are the backbone of its tourism, agriculture, and other services that account for its financial growth. Deals like the debt-for-nature have been described by experts as an indirect attempt to solve the dilemma faced by global leaders on how and who should pay (financially) for actions taken to alleviate the impact of climate change.</p><p>'The debt-for-nature deal is linked to climate pledges since money is tied to the deal - and more deals could also reduce the debt burden of African countries. Although it is a $12m deal compared to the [over] $400m debt of Cabo Verde, [which means] it does not completely solve the debt issue, [..] it is still a positive development,' Paul Samson, an expert on global policy issues and president of the Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), based in Canada, tells The Africa Report.</p><p>Transparency needed in deal</p><p>According to the initial debt repayment schedule, Cabo Verde had a $12m debt obligation until 2025, but it was to be restructured into the fund aid and ultimately, the entire debt repayments were to be redirected to this fund, allowing the island nation to invest in energy transition, ocean conservation as well as climate adaptation plans, said the Portuguese prime minister.</p><p>READ MORE African Union: Comoros leadership puts island nations' priorities on the agenda</p><p>Despite the affirmations of Costa, it is not still clear whether the other debts, especially the $400m Portuguese bank and company loans owed by Cabo Verde, will be included in the swap deal. Analysts say more transparency in the fund aid is needed.</p><p>Is this a post-COP27 success?</p><p>Due to Cabo Verde's geographical location, the island is exposed to climatic and environmental catastrophic events, especially disasters like tropical storms, landslides, volcanic eruptions, droughts, and floods. The impact of climate change has worsened the situation for an already vulnerable nation.</p><p>In September 2020, tens of thousands of Cape Verdeans were affected by floods costing them their homes and farmlands. The AFDB says in one of its reports that erratic rainfalls on the island leads to a yearly $2m loss and destruction of agriculture crops.</p><p>At COP27 last November, there were several calls by climate activists and representatives of vulnerable countries hit hard by climate disasters for talks on climate reparations, known as 'Loss and Damage': a compensation fund for climate damages caused by the industrial activities of the world's rich economies.</p><p>READ MORE Egypt COP27: Loss  and  Damage officially on agenda, what is it and why is it so contentious?</p><p>Although a major headway was made for the fund at the conference, along with other climate alleviation schemes, concrete plans and action have yet to materialise. Since the Paris Agreement in 2015, wealthy countries continue to fall short of climate goals and climate financial and policy pledges, while turning a blind eye to the clamour for climate justice.</p><p>African countries contribute very little to global climate. Despite the ongoing social and environmental reforms in Cabo Verde, it could still lose between 0.1% and 0.27% of its per Capita GDP by 2030 and 2050 respectively, if the historic and neglected Paris Agreement is not met.</p><p>READ MORE COP27: Africa at the heart of the climate crisis</p><p>According to AFDB, the African continent loses about 15% of its GDP per capita every year, owing to the ravages of climate change. In the same report, the AFDB says up to $1.6trn will be needed between 2022 and 2030 to bridge the climate financing gap.</p><p>'Cabo Verde is just one of over 50 countries facing high levels of debt distress. Portugal's willingness to explore innovative solutions is to be commended in the wake of COP27. Let us hope other major creditors now step up with an ambitious and joined-up response to the interconnected debt, climate and nature crises,' says Colenbrander.</p><p>'It's dangerous,' says Daniel Nwagu, a Nigerian climate activist and advocate for sustainable smart agriculture. 'If these countries continue to pay below the benchmark of the climate pledges, it will increase the time frame for the world to achieve the neutralisation of [...] global warming.'</p><p>Impetus for debt-for-nature deal</p><p>In Africa, the novelty and the pursuit of the debt-for-nature deal is hugely credited to the Seychelles. After the 2008 (global) financial crisis pushed the country into serious debts that crippled its investment goals for a Blue Economy, it sought new options.</p><p>The archipelago of 115 islands in the Indian Ocean came up with an innovative approach that rescued its Blue Economy by converting its $21.6m of national debt to a debt-for-nature swap. Currently, these deals are gaining the interest of other African countries, such as Eswatini and Kenya.</p><p>READ MORE African countries are joining the world in decarbonising, but is this fair?</p><p>Cabo Verde's debt crisis is strongly linked to public-fund abuses. The archipelago suffers from a string of shocks and stresses: the impact of the pandemic, the fallout from the Russian-Ukraine war on food security, past droughts, and its dwindling tax revenues.</p><p>Over the years, the island nation's borrowings have been channelled towards the sustenance of vital services and the maintenance of key systems and infrastructure that have been (majorly) affected by the impacts of climate change, experts tell The Africa Report.</p><p>According to a study of ODI, Portugal is one of the global emitters of carbon which have failed to meet its climate pledges. The study revealed that in 2020, Portugal paid a small percentage of its expected share.</p><p>The Portuguese government paid just $70m when it was supposed to pay about $688m to add up to the wealthy countries' collective $100bn climate pledge and target.</p><p>It is not clear if Portugal will count the debt-for-nature swap deals as part of its long climate finance vows and experts are very concerned about the opaque nature of Portugal's swap deal with Cabo Verde.</p><p>READ MORE Africa: Carbon emissions play a central role in current economic crisis</p><p>'The new debt-for-climate deal is an important step, but not sufficient. We also need more detail about the terms and conditions to assess the package. Will this deal affect Cabo Verde's credit rating going forward? Will Portugal count this arrangement towards its international climate finance?

It's just one of several sporting events targeted this summer by climate activists to get their message across.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Racing in the 10th stage of the Tour de France was halted for 15 minutes with 38kms to go to the finish line at the Alpine town of Megeve due to a protest staged by nine\u00a0activists from the group.</p><p>While police removed the protesters\u00a0from the road, riders took a break to cool down with some water, while TV cameras panned across the crowd of enthusiastic spectators.</p><p>A woman identified as Aliz\u00e9e\u00a0brandished her white t-shirt with the words: \"We have 989 days left\" at the cameras.</p><p>\"I would prefer not to have had to do this,\" she says, explaining she would rather have been with her grandfather watching the tour on the television from his sofa.</p><p>Better housing</p><p>Last Renovation, which was created in April this year, took the\u00a0opportunity to publish messages on Twitter explaining their actions which, they said, fit into an international civil resistance movement.</p><p>\"The effects of the announcement, the pitiful effects of language on the so-called \"radicality\" of the environmental action of (the French government) and Emmanuel Macron are intolerable and criminal.</p><p>\"We demand that the government properly renovate ... all homes by 2040,\" a reference to the need to overhaul building standards to incorporate better energy saving mechanisms.</p><p>They also want more\u00a0financial aid for middle income families to cope with the cost of living.</p><p>'Now or never': Experts warn climate inaction has world on path to 3.2C warming</p><p>\"We can no longer sit by and watch this climate disaster. It must change,\" it added.</p><p>The same group members interrupted the French tennis open at Roland Garros in June.</p><p>A member of the group wore a top with \"We have 1,028 days left\" and tied herself to the net before she was removed from the court but not without reaching a huge audience.</p><p>Sit-in</p><p>The same group also staged a \"sit-in\" on the major ring road around Paris last Saturday\u00a0to coincide with the massive departure of many people on holidays.</p><p>\"It's an extremely strong symbol\u00a0to sit down on the asphalt of a road,\" Paul told reporters from France Info.</p><p>\"We are unarmed; we only have our bodies to give.\"</p><p>\"I don't want to regret that I didn't do anything to stop the climate catastrophe,\" agrees Julien.</p><p>Using international sporting events as platforms for environmental activists to share protest messages is gaining traction.</p><p>Marchons, marchons! Defenders of climate and social justice rally across France</p><p>Some estimates say the Tour de France, over the 21 stages, reaches up to 3.5 billion viewers across the 190 countries in which it is broadcast, more if social media views are included.</p><p>With this kind of audience in mind, climate activists from the group \"Just Stop Oil\" garnered a great deal of publicity at the British Grand Prix Silverstone circuit in July.</p><p>The group,\u00a0which calls for the cessation of the exploitation of fossil fuels in the UK, had demanded the government \"immediately put an end to new oil and gas projects\" and warned \"they would continue to disrupt sporting and cultural events (...) until this request is met\".</p><p>Destroying the future</p><p>During the Li\u00e8ge-Bastogne-Li\u00e8ge cycling classic, on 24 April, a young man was invited to the course very close to the finish, just before the arrival of the winner of the race, the Belgian Remco Evenepoel.</p><p>The protester wore a tee-shirt that read \"Climate Justice Now\".</p><p>Earlier in the season, on 3 April, an activist from the Extinction Rebellion\u00a0briefly disrupted the Tour of Flanders. These\u00a0same activists then clung to a goal during the final of the Belgian Football Cup on April 18, this time with the message \"Won't our children die from the climate crisis?\"</p><p>In England, several football matches have also been disrupted.</p><p>On 18 March, Louis McKechnie, also involved in the action during the British GP, interrupted the Everton-Newcastle match by tying himself by the neck to a post.</p><p>\"Our government is knowingly destroying my future and condemning billions of people around the world to death,\" he said.</p><p>(with wires)</p><p>More videos available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr\">http://www.english.rfi.fr</url>/</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-316121845</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65Y0-5J31-F11P-X035-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

Four leading youth activists were received by the French National Assembly yesterday (Wednesday) to pressure the government to take a stance on the project. Vanessa Nakate, nicknamed the \"African Greta Thunberg\", was among them.</p><p>Nakate is a Ugandan climate activist and author of the book \u00a0A Bigger Picture. She talked to RFI's Christina\u00a0Okello and told her that she had come to France to ask the government to make it clear what its position on the East African Crude Oil Pipeline, (EACOP).</p><p>French, Chinese oil firms agree controversial pipeline deal with Uganda,Tanzania</p><p>The EACOP, which is currently under construction is also known as the Uganda\u2013Tanzania Crude Oil Pipeline. Its purpose is to transport crude oil from Uganda's oil fields to the Port of Tanga, Tanzania on the Indian Ocean. Once completed, the pipeline will be the longest heated crude oil pipeline in the world</p><p>\"I've come here to ask the French government to stand with us, to stand with the people, and with the planet, to make a decision about whether they are in support of the EACOP project in my country or not,\" Nakate said.</p><p>Environment watchdogs slam arrest of Ugandan activists protesting Total oil project</p><p>RFI: What is EACOP?</p><p>VN: EACOP is the East African Crude Oil Pipeline that is going to affect the lives of so many people. The communities that are being impacted right now, people are being left homeless. It is going to go through some of our wildlife habitats like the Murchison Falls, it is going to go through Lake Victoria, which is depended upon by over 40 million people. Any kind of oil spill would mean suffering for so many people as this is a source of food and a source of income for so many communities.</p><p>RFI: Won't EACOP create jobs?</p><p>VN: I understand when my government and the people in my country say that EACOP is going to give jobs to so many people but when I look at the environmental impact of oil extraction in other countries, which\u00a0is just short-term benefits, we need to look at the long-term benefits of our lives and of our planet.</p><p>That's why in our demands we demand for climate finance from global north countries, from richer countries. Climate finance for countries like mine that are on the frontlines that are not responsible for the climate crisis, because there is a need for us to develop but to develop in the right way, in a sustainable way, to develop and lift people out of poverty without harming the planet.</p><p>RFI: Is Africa being heard?</p><p>VN: That incident that happened in Davos in 2020, it shows how many activists from the African continent struggle to have their voices listened to and their voices amplified and platformed. And while the African continent is suffering the worst impacts of climate change, we don't see it on the world's papers. So, it's important for people to know that we won't have climate justice if the most affected people are not listened to, are not platformed and are not amplified.</p><p>More videos available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr\">http://www.english.rfi.fr</url>/</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-297790915</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6515-W071-F11P-X4G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

How to fill the gap - and compete on par with the US and China - will be a central theme for the 2024 European elections.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen took many by surprise <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/commission-president-eu-sovereignty-fund-will-be-proposed-in-summer/\">when she announced last year</url> that the EU executive would table a proposal for a European \"sovereignty fund\" before the summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We want European industry to keep leading in the green transition. This is why I introduced\u00a0the idea of a sovereignty fund,\" von der Leyen said in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_22_7727\">speech</url> to Parliament on the eve of an EU leaders' summit on 15 December.</p><p>\"We need to galvanise our strong European industrial power in the global fight against climate change. And that calls for common European industrial policy with common European funding,\" she added, saying the Commission would table a proposal \"around summer\" as part of a wider EU mid-term budgetary review.</p><p>The result, as many had feared, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/eu-commission-wants-new-technology-fund-but-no-fresh-cash-in-sight/\">was underwhelming</url>.</p><p>Instead of a mighty sovereignty fund, the EU executive did what it knows best and unveiled a new website with a new acronym, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/eu-budget/strategic-technologies-europe-platform_en#:~:text=STEP%20seeks%20to%20reinforce%2C%20leverage,quality%20label%20for%20sovereignty%20projects.\">Strategic Technologies for Europe Platform (STEP)</url>.</p><p>More importantly, there was no extra money on the table to rival the US Inflation Reduction Act and its $370 billion in cash for clean energy investments. Instead, the Commission chief said the money will be rehashed from existing EU funds, with a proposed (EURO)10 billion top-up coming from EU member states' coffers.</p><p>Even if EU countries agree to the proposed budgetary top-up - <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/FT/status/1671138396197072896?s=20\">which looks uncertain at best</url> - the EU's green industrial policy budget will look miserable compared to the hundreds of billions put forward by the US and China.</p><p>\"We have limited budgets,\" von der Leyen said, as if admitting defeat.</p><p>The fundamental reasons behind this are well known. While poorer EU countries want a fund allowing them to catch up with the rest of the EU, \"richer member states - who might be expected to benefit most since they have more start-ups - may not see the need for such a fund,\" <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/european-sovereignty-fund-commissions-best-chance-or-empty-shell/\">said Zach Meyers, a research fellow at the Centre for European Reform (CER)</url>.</p><p>At the end of the day, too many countries were against the idea of holding another round of budgetary talks, which are always divisive at the EU level.</p><p>While France has backed the idea of a large fund financed by common European debt, other member states <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/economy-jobs/news/german-finance-ministry-firmly-rejects-new-eu-common-debt/\">like Germany</url> and the Netherlands argue there is still plenty of unused cash in the EU's (EURO)800 billion COVID-19 recovery fund.</p><p>The resulting flop was all the more predictable, observers say.</p><p>\"It's clear that the initial ambition of creating a sovereignty fund at EU level to respond to the US Inflation Reduction Act has quickly vanished,\" said Simone Tagliapietra, a senior fellow at the Bruegel economic think tank in Brussels.</p><p>What remains in terms of clean tech funding in Europe is mainly state aid, which is covered by national budgets and can now happen more easily thanks to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_1563\">Temporary Crisis Framework</url> adopted in March last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war.</p><p>However, this means national spending is not counterbalanced at the EU level by an instrument ensuring cohesion and scale among the 27 EU member states, Tagliapietra warned.</p><p>\"And that leaves Europe in a situation where member states with more fiscal space can spend more than others, which is problematic from an internal market perspective because it creates fragmentation,\" he says.</p><p>\"Looking at this proposal and the Net-Zero Industry Act - which is weak in terms of governance and focuses mostly on permitting - it's now clear that the EU's green industrial policy response, for now, has been pretty weak,\" Tagliapietra told EURACTIV.</p><p>Yet, the need for a green industrial policy is unlikely to go away. If anything, it is going to be felt more strongly as the EU moves closer to its objective of reducing emissions to net zero, which requires a complete transformation of the European industrial landscape.</p><p>In the absence of a sufficient EU budget to counterbalance national state aid for clean tech, the European Commission will also eventually be left with no choice but to reintroduce stricter rules on state aid, which will hinder the capacity of Germany and France to support their national clean tech champions.</p><p>Resistance against a genuine European industrial policy has always tended to come from big EU member states like Germany, who think they can move faster than others to secure jobs and growth for themselves.</p><p>But even if larger eurozone economies can score a few wins, they will always lack the scale to compete against China and the US in the global clean tech race.</p><p>\"There is no viable German, French, Italian or Spanish answer here; Europe can only be competitive globally with a common answer that creates an edge for European companies on global markets,\" Tagliapietra said.</p><p>\"Without a strong European dimension, EU countries will only end up cannibalising each other. And that certainly won't help Europe gain a competitive edge in the global race for clean tech,\" he argued.</p><p>As we get closer to the European elections in June 2024, the question will therefore inevitably return on the EU's agenda, Tagliapietra predicted.</p><p>\"It will be up to the new EU institutions after the European elections to do that. And if we don't do that, I think Europe will face problems in the future because the EU economy is carbon-intensive.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">- Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Simon</emphasis></p><h>Top stories</h><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/EPP-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/climate-environment/news/eus-nature-restoration-law-in-the-balance-ahead-of-decisive-july-vote/\">EU's Nature Restoration Law hangs in the balance ahead of decisive July vote</url></h><p>Europe's law to restore nature is in the balance, following a vote in the European Parliament's environment committee on Tuesday (27 June) that opened up the possibility for it to be definitely rejected by lawmakers during a whole Parliament vote in July.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/11560213-1-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/france-germany-italy-pledge-close-cooperation-on-critical-raw-materials/\">France, Germany, Italy pledge close cooperation on critical raw materials</url></h><p>France, Germany and Italy will cooperate more closely on critical raw materials as ministers pledged in Berlin on Monday (26 June) to invest in joint projects and exchange views on the EU's currently debated Critical Raw Materials Act.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/Berlaymont-800x600.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/news/europe-risks-missing-2030-climate-goal-eu-auditors-warn/\">Europe risks missing 2030 climate goal, EU auditors warn</url></h><p>EU countries have so far filed only vague plans to meet their climate targets, with early indications pointing to a significant financing gap to meet the EU's objective of reducing emissions 55% below 1990 levels by 2030, the European Court of Auditors (ECA) said in a new report on Monday (26 June).</p><h>The Capitals - editor's pick</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">PARIS.

African voices from church and civil society demand climate justice in one of the most vulnerable continents to increasing climate impacts as COP27 starts in Sharm El Sheikh (Egypt). The Catholic church in Africa hopes that the EU would lead in raising climate ambition and action ensuring that the international climate talks are held with the best interest of all living beings and our Common Home at heart. Like Pope Francis recently said, COP27 \u201crepresents the next opportunity for all to join in promoting the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement.\u201d</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">His Eminence Fridolin Besungu Cardinal Ambongo is the\u00a0Archbishop of Kinshasa and the Vice-President of SECAM and President of the Justice, Peace and Development Commission (SECAM).</emphasis></p><p>While Europe recently has also experienced climate change consequences such as sudden droughts and floods, the climate crisis has been a lived reality for people across Africa for way too long. Recent summer heatwaves in the north of the continent have caused massive social and economic losses and damages, breaking temperature records and severely disrupting agri-food systems in an already hungry region. Storms and cyclones early in the year caused devastation in Southern Africa and in Madagascar, resulting in the destruction of homes and the loss of lives. Eastern Africa is facing the worst food crisis in a generation, precipitated by extreme drought. In West Africa, cities are flooded, communities in the creeks are submerged, conflicts which have simmered for years are now intensifying due to climate-induced displacement. Climate change impedes on Africa\u2019s development, in a context already struggling due to an unjust global economic system.</p><p>Equally important, the Congo Basin, known as the \u201clungs of Africa\u201d, is absorbing more carbon than the Amazon. 1.5% of the world\u2019s carbon emissions are absorbed by the Republic of Congo alone. Six countries share its rainforest, providing food security and essential livelihoods to indigenous and local populations and sustaining endangered species. Africa\u2019s future, as well as the world\u2019s, depends on preserving the Congo Basin forests. The Congo Basin forests must be preserved for the sake of the future of not only Africa, but the world in general. To combat climate change and biodiversity loss, we must preserve this rich and lush ecosystem, which is increasingly being threatened by deforestation, environmental degradation, and worsening climate change impacts.\u00a0</p><p>In these days, world leaders are making their way to Africa to attend the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change \u2013 otherwise known as COP27. All people of God, wherever they are in the world, must surely agree that this conference must deliver for Africa.\u00a0 There is no doubt that the EU and more generally the Global North has a great responsibility in this regard as one of the major contributors to the climate crisis and must contribute their fair share to address it. Progressive EU Member States should use this moment to step up their climate action and support for vulnerable countries by pushing for the highest ambition level for the EU by 2030.\u00a0 They should be leading the way in emissions reductions, providing funding for climate adaptation, loss and damage, and supporting countries in the Global South to achieve just levels of development within planetary boundaries. We know that the most promising solutions will reflect key principles of Catholic Social Teaching, such as the common good, social justice between generations, care for our common home and the preferential option for the poor. The solutions to this crisis must not continue the business-as-usual approach that is responsible for creating the problem in the first place and will only enrich wealthy nations and individuals at the expense of the world\u2019s poor.</p><p>And yet, in the face of these certainties, it can still be challenging to understand the precise routes to change. In the latest Encyclical, Fratelli Tutti, Pope Francis proposed dialogue and encounter as a means of building a more just world (n\u00b0199,203). This was the inspiration for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidse.org/2022/06/30/african-climate-dialogues-towards-cop27/\">African Climate Dialogues</url> \u2013 a series of conversations hosted by Catholic Church actors and civil society in Africa to discuss, learn from each other and identify key policy priorities ahead of COP27 in Egypt. These dialogues included community and civil society representatives with lived experiences of climate change, researchers and professional advocates with policy expertise, officials from all levels of government, and leaders in the Catholic Church who could frame the pressing ethical questions raised by climate change in terms of the action of God and the demands of justice.</p><p>On 17th October, I was proud to launch a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidse.org/2022/10/17/african-climate-dialogues-communique/\">communiqu\u00e9</url> from the African Climate Dialogues process, alongside leaders from youth movements, NGOs and Governments representing Africa at COP27. This document serves as a road-map for action at COP27 on the key topics of appropriate solutions, climate finance, migration and displacement, food systems and loss and damage. It sets out demands for the conference, informed by practitioners, communities and experts in light of theological reflection on the sacred scriptures. I will travel to Sharm El Sheikh to bring these cries for action to the negotiating table, and to show that the Church in Africa is standing up for communities already suffering from climate change in my continent.</p><p>Climate change is a moral outrage. It is a tragic and striking example of structural sin (St John Paul II, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sollicitudo rei socialis, </emphasis>n\u00b036), facilitated by callous indifference and selfish greed. The climate crisis is leading to the destruction of our planet, the devastation of the lives of the poor, and the detriment of future generations. We church leaders and civil society organisations in Africa and beyond demand from EU decision-makers, world leaders, and business leaders to heed to this important communiqu\u00e9, in so doing, heed to the cry of the poor and the cry of the earth.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Press conference: \u2018<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgPiuSUDB3E&amp;t=2s\">launch of Africa Climate Dialogues Communique</url>\u2019</p><p>More information about the African Climate Dialogues and a copy of the communiqu\u00e9 can be accessed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cidse.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/EN-The-African-Climate-Dialogues-Communique_final.pdf\">here.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/11/Capture.png\">Link to Image</url>Sponsored content funded by the European Union.

It almost certainly won't be the last. By 2050, climate change will lead to an additional 78 million people experiencing chronic hunger - over half of them in Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Children in the Horn of Africa are already experiencing one of the worst climate-induced humanitarian catastrophes of the past 40 years, as they need treatment for severe acute malnutrition, and with the lowest levels of funding on record the global humanitarian community is unable to respond as needed.</p><p>Covid  and  Droughts: Can Madagascar break the cycle of poverty?</p><p>Africa's contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions is less than 4%, but the continent suffers due to the actions of other parts of the world. Yet, the African nations are being asked to spend around 2% to 3% of GDP per year to address a problem that they did not create.</p><p>This is climate injustice.</p><p>'Climate change is not a thing of the future'</p><p>We need to strive for true climate justice based on equity and fairness. This means looking at the science, the facts, and the figures. The availability of means of implementation must be guided by the principles of common, but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities and equities, as set out in the Paris Agreement. Thus, it is disheartening that only 2% of global investments in renewable energy over the last two decades were made in Africa.</p><p>European private sector notably absent at Africa Adaptation Summit</p><p>Investment in cleaner energy is essential for Africa to meet its development goals and transition to a newer sustainable economic model, especially given that around 60 million Africans do not have access to energy and around 900 million Africans do not have access to clean cooking.</p><p>Climate change is not a thing of the future. The impacts are real and now. Moreover, by 2025, climate change is expected to lead to 230 million Africans facing water scarcity, and 460 million more living in water-stressed areas.</p><p>Wake up to the essential with the Editor's picks.</p><p>Email Address</p><p>Also receive offers from The Africa Report</p><p>Also receive offers from The Africa Report's partners</p><p>Lack of food and water massively impact upon other problems and risking lives and livelihoods. Eight of the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries in Africa have 60% of the working population employed in the climate-sensitive agricultural sector. When that suffers, it doesn't only lead to loss of income, but creates a further strain on an already dwindling food supply.</p><p>We will create an environment that enables constructive dialogue and is conducive to success, because we can no longer wait.</p><p>As a result, it's projected we are likely to see the displacement and migration of over 85 million people, fleeing famine and drought hoping to find a better life elsewhere in their own country, only to discover that other places are suffering from the same problems.</p><p>A bold response is needed to achieve a water-secure world</p><p>It is important that Africa continues to focus on its goals. As incoming Presidency, we believe that the Paris Agreement provided the needed balance and identified our ultimate objective. It's now up to us to work on defining the pathway and to manage the transition, with a focus on reducing emissions and enhancing resilience.</p><p>Aim of COP27</p><p>With the support of the governments of Africa, the COP27 Presidency aims to achieve an outcome that contributes to delivering the appropriate finance on the scale needed. An outcome that leaves no one behind, through a just transition perspective that allows for different pathways to low emissions and resilient development that keeps the Paris goals within reach.</p><p>As COP President, we will create an environment that enables constructive dialogue and is conducive to success, because we can no longer wait.</p><p>Egypt: 'No more useless promises' says UN climate champion Mohieldin</p><p>Egypt hosting COP27 later this year is not only significant, but also incredibly important for Africa and the world. If COP26 was about countries making promises to avoid catastrophic climate change, the broader themes in Egypt will be moving from ambition to action, especially in Africa.</p><p>At COP15 in Copenhagen, over 12 years ago, the world's richest countries promised $100bn every year from 2020 to 2025 to help developing countries affected by climate change adapt to its effects and encourage them to take ambitious mitigation actions as well. The world has fallen short of these pledges, with promised funding now likely not being delivered until 2023 at a time when credible reports are pointing to $5.6trn as the needed finance for developing countries nationally determined contributions.</p><p>Nigeria's Energy Transition Plan needs $410bn by 2060 to be successful</p><p>This lagging on commitments, coupled with a slowing down in the transition to renewables, makes the Paris Agreement targets increasingly difficult to attain. More implementation is urgently needed if the pledges of the past are not to become empty promises. We need to refocus ourselves on the task in hand, despite the global headwinds. Nations can show that by delivering on their commitments, raise their ambition and further global and regional climate agenda ahead of COP27.</p><p>Financing for Africa hasn't been forthcoming despite pledges. Africans are suffering without this, but at Egypt's COP27 there will be a chance to finally deliver. To move from talk and pledging to action - it may be the last chance we have. The countries attending COP27 in Egypt have the power to make a positive change via funding, and it can be done.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT0709202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66BG-GKF1-F00C-60W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 7, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Governments' inaction on climate issues is frequently cited as promoting this distress.\u00a0</p><p>The study compiles several surveys of 10,000 children and youth (16-25 years old) in 10 countries around the world (Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, Philippines, Portugal, United Kingdom and United States). When asked how they see the future, 75% of all young people surveyed described it as \"frightening.\"</p><p>More than half of the people surveyed said they felt \"afraid,\" \"sad,\" \"anxious,\" \"angry,\" \"powerless\" or \"helpless\"... A percentage that rises to 81% in southern countries such as Portugal and even to 92% in the Philippines.</p><p>Nearly half of young people surveyed worldwide (45%) say that climate-related anxiety and distress affect their daily lives. Of these young people, 64% believe that their governments are \"not doing enough\" to avoid a climate catastrophe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"I grew up being afraid of drowning in my own bedroom\"</emphasis></p><p>While 55% think that they won't have access to the same opportunities that [their] parents had\" to take action for the climate, 65% believe that governments are \"failing young people,\" with 58% going so far as to call this inaction a \"betrayal\" for future generations. \u00a0</p><p>\"I grew up being afraid of drowning in my own bedroom. Society tells me that this anxiety is an irrational fear that needs to be overcome -- one that meditation and healthy coping mechanisms will \u2018fix.' At its root, our climate anxiety comes from this deep-set feeling of betrayal because of government inaction. To truly address our growing climate anxiety, we need justice,\" said 23-year-old Mitzi Tan of the Philippines.</p><p>\"Our children's anxiety is a completely rational reaction given the inadequate responses to climate change they are seeing from governments... This study makes an important contribution to these legal arguments, framing climate anxiety and distress as a \u2018moral injury',\" outlined Caroline Hickman,\u00a0of the University of Bath, UK,\u00a0Climate Psychology Alliance\u00a0and co-lead author on the study. \u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Young people mobilizing for climate action, across the planet</emphasis></p><p>\"We must consider the futures of young people, listen to their voices and place them at the centre of decision making. By bringing together all generations, we can demand that\u00a0that governments engage in the urgent action on climate change we so desperately need,\" notes her colleague Liz Marks.</p><p>All over the world, young people are mobilizing for the climate. At the end of the first week of COP26, which took place in November in the city of Glasgow, thousands of young people took to the streets around the world, determined to make their voices heard and demand climate justice.\u00a0</p><p>\"When I was 16... I went through phases of feeling utterly helpless in face of this immense problem, and then would launch myself into organising protests or changing things within my school.... It's so damaging to put this problem on the shoulders of young people -- hope needs to come instead from palpable structural action,\" outlines Beth Irving, a 19-year-old climate activist who was behind the Cardiff student strikes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64DB-MY91-JDVB-600S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>WELL-BEING</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 28, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLFX</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX454</classCode><className>GLASGOW, SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC310</classCode><className>PHILIPPINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC338</classCode><className>BRAZIL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC334</classCode><className>NIGERIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Growing up in Canada we even had school events to teach us about the environment and why recycling glass and aluminum were important. My parents, having immigrated from Egypt, thought it was cute, but rarely followed suite. The environment was not a concern of theirs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The obligation to recycle grew during the 90s. At the time, my father felt obliged to learn about it and do his part. My mother, on the other hand, let me take care of it, but she wasn't convinced about it and there were no repercussions for her unwillingness to see why it could help.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Greenwashing is not new</p><p>Sadly, much of our efforts in our squeaky-clean persona of Canada were for nought. A lot of the waste was not recycled in Canada, but rather shipped off to China or Malaysia. Even today, much of the recycling of waste from Canada is done in India.</p><p>In 1995, as I was coming of age in this environmental quagmire, the first COP was held and this is where the Kyoto Protocol was established. This past week, I covered COP27 for our publication. 27 means the 27th year of trying to figure out climate change.</p><p>Ahead of COP27, there was talk of greenwashing, as is the case at every COP; and yes, this year is as abundant as any other. Eco-friendly goody bags are given out for free, filled with a glass water bottle, and recycled paper pad and pencils. Food can be purchased (at exorbitant prices) all wrapped in paper, apart from the plastic juice bottles.</p><p>In every event room, the air conditioners are cranked up to the max because the heat beneath the Sinai sun is hot and foreigners may not like to feel warm. The local architecture that could have been used to keep heat at bay is not seen as modern or Western.</p><p>However, the moment you step into the pseudo-real world of Sharm, a resort town, you step back into the true reality: overly packaged goods, people throwing stuff on the street, and development in all directions clearly impacting the natural environment, which huge billboards announce is important.</p><p>The awareness has not trickled down.</p><p>This reality is not specific to Egypt (apart from human rights). It happens at every COP and every country outside of COP: A beautiful veneer of 'we can do this!' coupled with 'eco-friendly' items or venues and the belief that maybe this year we'll figure it out.</p><p>We're not that smart</p><p>Humanity has proven itself to be the stupidest of all species. I say this as a member of this collective group. Wars, inequalities, racism, genderism, selfishness, etc....can be traced back to every culture and empire, regardless of geography. We refuse to learn. We refuse to evolve.</p><p>The only common thread in our thousands of years of existence is the drive for profit - be it in exchange for food, jewels, territory or money.</p><p>People keep saying the youth can make a difference. I'd like to believe it too, but the reality is a whole other story, and frankly it's a lazy way of putting-off hard decisions. The youth can drive awareness. They can make noise, but they can't effect change high up.</p><p>Here at COP27, there was a day to celebrate their voice - one group was visible on site. I walked by, as did others. Some took photos, some stopped to listen to their cheer: 'What do [we] want? Climate Justice. When do we want it? Now!' Lots of applause, and then back to business.</p><p>Journalists cover this important business - from the signing of this 'near-ban on coal deal', the celebration of 'country X to offer more funding', to how leaders 'agree to tackle climate change by 2030'. That business is shrouded in power trips. When someone high up from any one of these events grants the lowly journalist a moment to ask a question, it's often very rushed, the I-don't-have-time-for-you-I'm-very-important-and-needed, because at the end of the day, the person also doesn't know how this will help solve the problem.</p><p>So long as humanity is driven by blind greed, our planet will continue on the same trajectory. We can produce as many eco-friendly gadgets as we want, strut around like peacocks at these grand COP events, sign deals, take photos as proof of our good intentions, and then perhaps granting a journalist a comment to say: 'I'm so excited about this, this is a real game-changer'. However, nothing will change until we start to block out profit and focus on change.</p><p>Government action</p><p>I have close family friends who run a plastic business in an undisclosed African country. We jokingly argue about how companies like theirs are the problem. They sell plastic pellets (even if they are less plastic and more carbon carbonate) to other factories to melt down and make into bags, containers etc.</p><p>Whenever I mention that they are part of the problem of our climate crisis, I am told quite simply that it's a question of profit and that turning to alternatives, such as bio-plastics, is not profitable. On top of this is that there's no impetus to alter the status quo. If 'governments banned plastic' then companies, such as the plastic business, would be faced to make changes. This is the bottom line of our latest discussion.</p><p>Ahead of COP27, Coca Cola, aka the 'King of Plastic Pollution' - one of the official sponsors (who provided endless amounts of glass-bottled coke during the event, but has since secretly pulled out of its sponsorship) - increased the use of its newly manufactured plastic by 3.5% since 2019, reported the Financial Times.</p><p>They may sign deals to offset carbon through the carbon credit market, or provide glass bottles, but so long as plastic is still a viable alternative, and their factories continue to function as they do - producing as much CO2 as two large generating plants, not to mention the other toxic pollutants often dumped at nearby communities (if unregulated) - we will continue to have a classic case of profit over change.</p><p>At no point, between my early environmental years and the present, has a government taken the high position of banning such practices. Bangladesh and Rwanda have both banned plastic bags, but there's always someone smuggling bags into each respective country.</p><p>Other countries and regions, including the EU, have banned single-use plastics. Is it enforced? When I grab take-out from nearby restaurants in my rather bobo-left-leaning neighbourhood in Paris, the answer is no. Much of it is still served in plastic because the companies producing such items have no reason to stop.</p><p>What is real power in action</p><p>Small declarations, such as what will come out of COP27, are band-aid solutions. The trick to ripping off a band-aid with little pain is to do it fast. The one way to really make huge strides in saving this planet, which is run by humans who are still functioning the same way they did thousands of years ago, is to enforce change.</p><p>Leaders from the top - however they are elected - wield power. Rather than walk around these events surrounded by bodyguards to ensure their power is intact, why not use that power to bring about concrete change? Not an idea, or another possible deal to sign, but a real change that may hamper profits in the short-term, but benefit everyone in the long-term.</p><p>Doing so would force all citizens to pay attention and to readjust. Without access to plastic bags, or polluting factories, people would adjust, as they always have. Even my mother would then recycle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREPO-AFRREPORT1811202200006</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREPO2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66WV-63B1-JCH9-G0N0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">434204</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1218\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Africa Report All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>The Africa Report</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"29874\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"11\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>November 18, 2022 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001458</classCode><className>MATERIALS RECOVERY &amp; RECYCLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNWB</classCode><className>GREENWASHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp; XENOPHOBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000887</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000632</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES &amp; AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001458</classCode><className>MATERIALS RECOVERY &amp; RECYCLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNWB</classCode><className>GREENWASHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000CRKZ</classCode><className>PACKAGED GOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009R9I</classCode><className>PLASTIC BOTTLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC332</classCode><className>EGYPT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC304</classCode><className>INDIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It is an insurance policy for this generation and future ones, so they may live with plastic and not be doomed by it,\" said Inger Andersen, executive director of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p>Strides\u00a0on the African continent</p><p>African climate activists continue to play their part in educating and curbing plastic use. Civil society groups such as Pan African Climate Justice Alliance (PACJA), are calling on African leaders to resist any trade deals and plans that may render their streets and communities a dumping ground for waste.</p><p>\"As we speak right now, a huge percentage of plastic waste is inadequately disposed of in many countries across Africa adding that this posed threats to rivers and oceans,\" says Mithika Mwenda, PACJA executive director.</p><p>Africa already receives millions of tons of waste from western countries annually - the World Bank estimates that by 2050 waste generated in Sub-Saharan Africa will triple, he added.</p><p>On the fringes of the UNEA-5 conference, UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed visited Kawangware primary school in Nairobi, where a mural of Kenyan environmentalist, the late Wangari Mathai, indicates the school's dedication to sustainability activities.</p><p>For those living in informal settlements in Kenya, residents learn about the environment through the Eco-Friendly club, which helps students carry out conservation activities in the real world, according to the club's patron, Joseph Kinyua.</p><p>\"Despite coming from informal settlement students are learning how to be responsible from their environment,\" says\u00a0Kinyua.</p><p>Treaty resolution</p><p>Grassroots steps are crucial alongside global treaties. The UNEP estimates that one million plastics are purchased every minute worldwide.</p><p>The jump in plastic production soared from two million tonnes in 1950 to 348 million tonnes in 2017, a 500-billion-euro industry.</p><p>The resolution, based on three initial draft resolutions from various nations, establishes an intergovernmental negotiating committee, which will begin work this year, with an expected legally binding agreement to be completed by 2024.</p><p>In the interim, UNEP will be at the heart of science-based discussions until the committee finishes its work. A conference will be held at that time to officially adopt the outcome and open it for signatures.</p><p>For Gjenge Makers' entrepreneur Nzambi Matee, these discussions go hand-in-hand with her environmental vision.</p><p>\"I quit a high paying job for this. It has been four years of hard work,\" said Matee.</p><p>She admitted that their first bricks were not saleable, but after more research, she had her prototype.</p><p>\"We found the best measurements and the right mixture. 2019 was our first year in the market, and so far, we are doing great,\" she adds.</p><p>More videos available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.english.rfi.fr\">http://www.english.rfi.fr</url>/</p><p>Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RFIENG-293306764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RFIENG2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64X6-XJD1-JDJN-63MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407847</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"716\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Radio France Internationale - All rights of reproduction and distribution reserved.

Art or life [and] the protection of our planet?\u2019 One Just Stop Oil activist claimed the protests kickstarted the conversation \u2018so that we can ask the questions that matter\u2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whatever the publicity from these symbolic acts of vandalism, the implied opposition between art and environmental ethics is misleading. Artists have long been in the vanguard of raising public awareness of the fragility of nature. Judging by the fruits of a Europe-wide scheme to immerse artists in cutting-edge science and technology (roughly half these EU projects involve ecology)\u00a0(1), the questions posed by this rising avant-garde are arguably more nuanced, profound and conducive to behavioural and political change than protesters\u2019 shock tactics.</p><p>At the Bozar Centre for Fine Arts in Brussels last month, laboratory-like installations by Haseeb Ahmed, an American artist based in Belgium, warned of the pharmaceutical pollution of water through human urine \u2014 a counterpoint to the city\u2019s landmark <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Manneken Pis</emphasis> fountain with its urinating cherub near the Grand Place. One of these, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Fountain of the Amazons </emphasis>(alluding to legendary female warriors), demonstrates unintended effects on aquatic life of contraceptive hormones entering the water system: an artificial vagina squirts a pill per day into a vat of orange urine in which a mutant creature floats as though plucked from a Hieronymus Bosch painting.</p><p>In a companion artwork, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fountain of Eternal Youth,</emphasis> human growth hormones ingested for their putative anti-ageing properties are dripped via an IV tube into a circular pool whose mirror surface (evoking Narcissus) invites viewers to weigh the costs of their own habits and desires.</p><p>Ahmed\u2019s artistic \u2018scenarios\u2019 convert research on large-scale phenomena \u2018to a scale the body can experience, addressing our senses,\u2019 he told me. His aim is not protest \u2018art against pharmaceuticals, because it\u2019s complex; we rely on them to maintain our quality of life. The pill brought social freedom for women, but it\u2019s also affecting the androgynisation of fish. So I create machines to help us think together about our ambivalence.\u2019</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2018Thinking machines\u2019</emphasis></p><p>Ahmed\u2019s intriguing, disturbing \u2018thinking machines\u2019 were part of a Bozar group show, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Faces of Water,</emphasis> resulting from artists\u2019 residencies with scientists and engineers around Europe to explore phenomena from toxins to melting glaciers. He worked closely with pharma companies, and also water treatment and public policy experts: \u2018Because knowledge has become hyper-specialised, we\u2019re trying to tie knots between fields, to understand the world we\u2019re producing.\u2019 While not without friction, these collaborations can spark dialogue. One company, he recalled, was \u2018unhappy with an accusation in the press that they\u2019re not doing enough, so they took out an ad to say what they <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">are</emphasis> doing.\u2019</p><p>The residencies were instigated by S+T+ARTS, a European Commission programme funding collaborations between science, technology and the arts since 2016. The aim of embedding artists in R&amp;D teams in industry and universities is not only to raise awareness of global challenges through exhibitions, but to act as a catalyst to tomorrow\u2019s digital innovations. \u2018It\u2019s important to bring in new ideas to change mindsets,\u2019 said Ralph Dum of DG Connect (the EC\u2019s directorate general for information and communications technology). Dum, the founding head of the S+T+ARTS programme, is a quantum physicist who joined the Commission 20 years ago, pioneering interdisciplinary programmes that combined experts, such as biologists with data scientists. \u2018Now it\u2019s standard, but that didn\u2019t exist then.\u2019</p><p>   It's important to bring in new ideas to change mindsets ... Artists profit from technology but engineers also profit from artists   Ralph Dum  </p><p>In the Renaissance and Baroque <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kunst- und Wunderkammer</emphasis> (the cabinet of arts and curiosities that presaged the modern museum), art objects were viewed alongside scientific instruments and natural marvels. However, 18th-century Enlightenment rationalism and empiricism sundered arts from sciences. By 1959 the British scientist and writer CP Snow, in his famous Cambridge lecture <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Two Cultures,</emphasis> lamented the \u2018gulf of mutual incomprehension\u2019 between science and the humanities; even engineers and pure scientists were unable to communicate. Now, Dum said, \u2018people know more and more about less and less ... it\u2019s almost impossible to bridge the gaps.\u2019 Yet, he argued, \u2018science and art are not so different; both relate to curiosity.\u2019</p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Manneken Pis</emphasis> fountain was a 17th-century sculptor\u2019s solution to the challenge of providing urban drinking water \u2014 a union of aesthetics and engineering explicitly embraced by the Bauhaus movement in 1920s Germany. For Dum, \u2018artists are very practical people; they address issues in concrete ways.\u2019 He cites a product emerging from <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Project Alias</emphasis> by Bj\u00f8rn Karmann and Tore Knudsen, tackling the invasion of privacy of smart home assistants such as Amazon\u2019s Alexa: \u2018There\u2019s no way of making Alexa deaf. So they manipulated the software to ensure Alexa only listens when you want.\u2019 That project won the S+T+ARTS annual Grand Prix for Artistic Exploration in 2019. The previous year\u2019s winning project for Innovative Collaboration, the 3D-printed steel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">MX3D Bridge,</emphasis>now spans an Amsterdam canal. Besides S+T+ARTS funding for research projects and residences (150 to date, with 70 more this year), more than 200 prizewinners have been chosen from among 15,000 open-call submissions.</p><p>For Gerfried Stocker, artistic director of Ars Electronica, at the interface of culture and tech in the Austrian city of Linz since 1979, S+T+ARTS has become a \u2018driving force influencing how Europe is going into the digital future. It\u2019s reached critical mass. Art-and-science is cool now.\u2019</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u2018Artists see things we don\u2019t\u2019</emphasis></p><p>Until the pandemic, S+T+ARTS prizewinners were exhibited annually at Bozar. Emma Dumartheray, exhibitions coordinator for Bozar Lab, views the programme\u2019s residencies as a distinct model of art sponsorship, with companies donating employees\u2019 time and knowledge. Partners such as Ars Electronica contribute experience of brokering collaborations, negotiating patent agreements in case of lucrative breakthroughs. For Dum, \u2018artists profit from technology but engineers also profit from artists. Now people understand we don\u2019t interfere with the art.\u2019</p><p>\u2018Artists see things we don\u2019t ... because you need distance,\u2019 Christophe De Jaeger, director of another key partner, Gluon in Brussels, told me. Before starting Bozar Lab in 2017, he founded Gluon (in 2009) to send artists into industrial R&amp;D labs. \u2018Employees gain holistic perspectives, talking to other experts in a non-competitive environment; artists can be very weird \u2014 emotionally engaged, radical, intuitive, serendipitous, and they don\u2019t care if they make mistakes ... they don\u2019t have to prove things.\u2019 Art \u2018can only be useful if it\u2019s allowed to be totally useless,\u2019 said Stocker, who sees the programme\u2019s unique value as enabling experimentation free from \u2018a creative industries focus on going to market\u2019.</p><p>   We rely on pharmaceuticals to maintain our quality of life. The pill brought social freedom for women, but it's also affecting the androgynisation of fish. So I create machines to help us think together about our ambivalence   Haseeb Ahmed  </p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not just about painting the iPhone pink,\u2019 Dum told me. Instead of using regulation and ethical committees to rein in technology, the goal is for artists to \u2018humanise its whole development\u2019, raising ethical and green concerns at each stage of innovation. In shaping interaction between people and machines, \u2018engineers are sometimes very nerdy; they don\u2019t have the human touch.\u2019 Yet do artists necessarily introduce moral perspectives? \u2018It\u2019s a touchy subject,\u2019 the physicist replied. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t claim artists are more moral than scientists, but they\u2019re very critical in different ways.\u2019</p><p>The artist\u2019s critical eye is ubiquitous in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Navigating the Digital Realm,</emphasis>\u00a0(2) a S+T+ARTS group exhibition at DG Connect until 28\u00a0February, which explores frontier technology and big data \u2014 from deepfakes, surveillance and dating apps to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The AI-generated videos of Egor Kraft\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Content Aware Studies</emphasis> (2019) show how machine learning reconstructs lost fragments of classical sculptures using datasets of thousands of scanned antiquities. The \u2018speculative restorations\u2019 are 3D-printed and CNC-routed in marble and synthetic materials but the algorithms can produce grotesque errors, such as creating a face on the back of a caryatid\u2019s head. One of his aims, Kraft told me, was to \u2018destroy the romanticism of AI\u2019 \u2014 a fabulous but dangerously fallible tool.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New avant-garde is \u2018proposing alternatives\u2019</emphasis></p><p>\u2018It\u2019s not just artistic commentary; they\u2019re also proposing alternatives,\u2019 Stocker said. Between the \u2018super data capitalism of the US\u2019 and the \u2018electronic totalitarianism of China,\u2019 he asked, \u2018what remains for Europe? We can try to do it differently.\u2019 Climate change and CO2 emissions have become paramount concerns as the EU strives through the European Green Deal to create the first climate-neutral continent. \u2018The Internet, AI, blockchain,\u2019 De Jaeger said, \u2018all these technologies might have positive or negative impacts on the larger challenges of climate justice, equality, migration.\u2019</p><p>Pre-Enlightenment <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wunderkammern</emphasis> projected the power of their collectors, but were also cabinets of wonder. They may share something with a 21st-century avant-garde that aims through frontier technology to revive awe and respect for nature. Olga Kisseleva\u2019s <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cities Live Like Trees: Green Index Formula</emphasis> drives an app that connects citizens to green zones in their city, based on \u2018deep listening between humans and trees.\u2019 John Palmesino, co-founder of Territorial Agency, uses open-access data (\u2018sensors accumulating trillions of terabytes every day\u2019) to help create a new understanding of the ocean as a \u2018sensorium\u2019 of human activity.</p><p>\u2018All life in the universe exists in a thin layer of atmosphere which has its dynamic,\u2019 said Ahmed, whose solo show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">18 Winds</emphasis> uses AI and wind machines to track the cultural and historical connotations of the Sirocco, and other winds. \u2018How do we relate to natural environments without imposing ourselves?\u2019 he asked me. These are vital questions: \u2018By separating nature from what we make it mean to us, maybe we can start to think again.\u2019</p><p>(1)\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">S+T+ARTS Prize 2016-20: A Journey into a New Culture of Collaborations, 2020.</emphasis></p><p>(2)\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Navigating the Digital Realm</emphasis> is at DG Connect, 51 Rue de la Loi, Brussels, until 28\u00a0February 2023;

Mass protests led the German government to step in and save an old-growth forest from coal expansion just two years ago. And the Green party notched its best showing ever in elections last year, a sign of how fighting climate change had become a winning political issue in Europe's largest economy.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"If there were 50,000 on the street, politicians would have to do something,\" said Eckardt Heukamp, 58, the last farmer remaining in L\u00fctzerath, who put up some of the protesters in apartments on his property. Others built tree houses, pitched tents or moved into abandoned houses in the village.       </p><p>But the hoped-for surge in protesters never materialized. And last week, the government effectively sealed L\u00fctzerath's fate by announcing that RWE, Germany's largest energy company, needed the coal under the village - to make up for gas that had stopped flowing in from Russia.       </p><p>The war in Ukraine, and the looming prospect of a winter without cheap Russian fuel, has cooled enthusiasm in Germany for greener policies, at least for now. In a nation that has pledged to wean itself off coal entirely by 2030, it has been an abrupt retreat - and for some, a difficult one.       </p><p>\"Putin's war of aggression is forcing us to temporarily make greater use of lignite so that we save gas in electricity generation,\" said Robert Habeck, the German economy minister and a former leader of the Green party, referring to the low-grade coal under the village. \"This is painful but necessary in view of the gas shortage.\"       </p><p>Russia once supplied more than half of Germany's gas imports - a major source of fuel for heating. After the Russian invasion of Ukraine set off a chain reaction of European sanctions and Russian countermeasures, that flow was shut off. From the start of the war, the German government knew it would have to scramble for fuel to get through the coming winter.       </p><p>In June, Mr. Habeck announced the reopening of some coal plants - a bitter pill after the Greens' success, just months earlier, at getting the new government to speed up its exit from coal by eight years. When a drought this summer compounded energy jitters by slowing coal transport on rivers, the government gave cargo trains carrying coal and other fuels priority over passenger ones.       </p><p>And yet so far, there has been little public backlash.       </p><p>A poll taken this summer found that 56 percent of Germans were in favor of turning coal plants back on, with just 36 percent against. That compares to the 73 percent of the population who supported ending coal use \"as soon as possible\" in a 2019 poll.       </p><p>Part of the reason for the lack of protesters in L\u00fctzerath may have been wariness among many about taking on a losing battle.       </p><p>\"We're hearing from many that they simply can't face it,\" said Cornelia Senne, a theologian who recently led an overnight church service outside Mr. Heukamp's front door. \"With all that's going on, some people cannot bear to watch another catastrophe unfold.\"       </p><p>Though tens of thousands of climate activists marched in cities across Germany in late September, they focused their demands mainly on issues like climate justice for developing countries and accessible public transport - not the end of coal in Germany.       </p><p>Since the crisis began, Germany has seen a nearly 5 percent rise in coal-generated electricity. Coal currently accounts for nearly a third of all electricity made in Germany.       </p><p>Much of that coal comes from places like the Garzweiler mine near L\u00fctzerath, which is owned by RWE and where some of the world's biggest digging machines continuously work the sprawling 12-square-mile pit.       </p><p>For decades, when coal was a way of life in much of Germany, residents of communities like L\u00fctzerath accepted the inevitability of coal mining, including a legal requirement to move and make way when state governments struck deals with energy companies like RWE. Since World War II, some 300 German villages have been razed for the coal beneath them.       </p><p>But activists had hoped to draw the line in L\u00fctzerath, once a village of about 90 people, and make the fight to save it a cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Even if they failed, it seemed, the town might be the last German village to be wiped out for coal mining.       </p><p>Even many climate activists concede that Germany will need to use more so-called \"hard\" coal this winter. But they insist that does not justify the demolition of L\u00fctzerath, which sits above deposits of lignite, the more polluting, softer variety.       </p><p>\"We are in a schizophrenic situation: We are going for a 2030 exit, but we are still allowing RWE to go for lignite in L\u00fctzerath,\" said Karsten Smid, a German climate and energy campaigner at Greenpeace. \"If you are doing this for the energy crisis, you don't need L\u00fctzerath's coal.\"       </p><p>Calculations by energy experts published in August suggested that the coal under L\u00fctzerath is actually not needed even with a short-term increase in demand this winter.       </p><p>German officials, however, suggest that any increase in coal emissions will be offset by the fact that RWE has agreed to the 2030 deadline for an end to coal use.       </p><p>While emissions from coal will likely increase this winter, Andrzej Ancygier, a Berlin-based analyst at Climate Analytics, says it is too early to know by how much.       </p><p>\"At this point crunching the numbers doesn't make sense yet, because there are just too many factors,\" said Mr. Ancygier, citing weather conditions and the question of when France will be able to reactivate its huge fleet of nuclear power plants and begin exporting the electricity they generate to Germany.       </p><p>Mr. Ancygier said changes to rules on burning coal will not affect Germany's long-term progress on renewable energy, which he predicts will continue to make up an ever-bigger portion of Germany's power mix. German lawmakers agreed to a new set of rules in July promoting renewables by making them more lucrative for smaller producers.       </p><p>But small and medium-sized businesses worry they will be facing bankruptcy before they can make it to warmer weather, and households are preparing for power outages if the winter is exceptionally cold.       </p><p>The protesters in L\u00fctzerath - balaclava-clad environmental activists, middle-class residents from nearby towns and a religious community that recently carried a cross around the village - say they are exhausted by their efforts but plan to keep fighting.       </p><p>One activist, who refused to take off his white face covering or give his real name out of fear of legal retribution, has lived in a treehouse in L\u00fctzerath since the spring, and said he was prepared for a showdown with the police when the bulldozers finally come.       </p><p>Even with the sound of the mining machines in the distance, Mr. Heukamp had stubbornly refused to give in, planting crops in the spring and harvesting in the summer and fall. He harvested the last of this season's wheat in August.       </p><p>But at the beginning of this month, Mr. Heukamp finally gave up, packing up his equipment and abandoning his family farm.       </p><p>Blaming state politics for the decision to go ahead with the destruction of his farm, he said: \"If they had wanted to save this village, they could have done it.\"       </p><p>RWE has not said when the bulldozers will move in to level the farm Mr. Heukamp left behind. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000008523789</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66M6-HGR1-JC85-N368-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1311\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 15, 2022 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DTNM</classCode><className>ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSTY</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp;

Trees are, science tells us, social beings and do some of the same things we humans do, at least when we're acting our best. They trade tips about health, news about weather. They nourish, and protect, and support each other. They support fellow beings too: birds, insects, us. They live sane lives. They generate excellent karma.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unlike us. In a goes-around-comes-around universe, the karma we're producing - through competitive greed, unthinking waste and targeted malice - is killing the world around us. We're at war with the planet and everything on it, trees included.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The artist and architect Maya Lin began her career with a response to a war. Her 1982 Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, a blade of black granite slashed into American soil, commemorates a \"foreign\" war that became an internal one and divided the nation. Her new installation, \"Ghost Forest,\" on view in Madison Square Park in Manhattan through Nov. 14, is commemorative too. It's a sky-reaching memorial to a war in progress directed against everything we call Nature.       </p><p>Is \"directed against\" too active a phrase? Some people simply don't know that human-sourced climate change exists. Others underestimate its gravity. Still others - a recent United States president - dismisses it as a fiction. In not dissimilar ways, we ignored or downplayed the Vietnam War in its early phases, until protests got really noisy, pictures of the My Lai massacre leaked out, and guys we'd partied with in high school came home in body bags.       </p><p>Now, as then, cluelessness and denial are hard to sustain. Temperatures are climbing, shores are flooding, fields are shriveling up. Entire species - four-footed, winged, finned and rooted - are suddenly M.I.A., and the casualty list is growing. Yet, in the United States, public protest against climate breakdown is still sporadic and tepid, which is why every resistant gesture feels crucial, as \"Ghost Forest\" does.       </p><p>Commissioned by the Madison Square Park Conservancy, \"Ghost Forest\" is basically a reconstituted patch of damaged nature. From the coastal Pine Barrens of New Jersey, Lin brought to Manhattan 49 full-grown Atlantic white cedars, each around 40 feet tall, and planted them together at the center of a bosky Madison Square Park. In the context of the park's arboreal luxe they make an odd sight, because they're leafless, and clearly dead or dying.       </p><p>They'd been harvested from a habitat infiltrated by salt water, a result of climate change. Salt water is poison for trees; it rots them from within. Sick beyond saving, the cedars now in the park had been cleared from their original home to make room for a regeneration effort.       </p><p>Although Lin was trained as an architect - she recently redesigned the Neilson Library at Smith College in Northampton, Mass. - her most memorable public work has been sculpture, and has drawn on the natural world as both a medium and a theme. In 2009, at the Storm King Art Center, 60 miles north of Manhattan, she created, from packed earth and grass, an 11-acre low-rise landscape of gently swelling hills, the forms inspired by ocean waves and the surrounding Hudson Valley mountains.       </p><p>\"My affinity has always been toward sculpting the earth,\" she wrote in her autobiographical book, \"Boundaries,\" published in 2000, \"This impulse has shaped my entire body of work.\"       </p><p>Since that book appeared, the focus on planetary survival has sharpened dramatically. Climate justice, intersecting with other social justice initiatives, is - in Europe, for sure - among the 21st century's frontline activist movements.       </p><p>If \"Ghost Forest\" isn't, technically, activist art - like \"Wave Field\" it's closer to the \"environmental art\" of an earlier time - its stark image of terrestrial loss is motored by the same urgency as climate justice resistance.       </p><p>Still, it takes a few minutes, once you're in the park, for the image to fully register. From a distance, the transplanted cedars blend into the larger arboreal fabric. Then tonal contrasts begin to sort out: The trunks of the park's living trees are loamy browns and blacks; those of the cedars, a dry gray-going-white. (This difference was immediately striking when the installation opened in May, before the park had fully leafed, and probably will be again as summer turns to fall.)       </p><p>Another contrast: Glance upward while standing under the park's resident trees and you see an overhang of green, dense enough to keep off rain; look up while standing under the cedars and you see open sky. Whatever foliage they once had is long gone, and their branches seem to have been shaved away. Only a few remain, like thin sticking-out arms.       </p><p>There's no question that Lin intended \"Ghost Forest\" as an emblem of profound injury. But another image comes through too: an image of sociability, of a community of personalities, a congregation of spirits.       </p><p>To produce it, she has carefully choreographed the placement of the cedars. A few line up in rows like cathedral columns. But most are in asymmetrical groupings, the equivalent of conversational clusters, of a kind you might find at parties and neighborly gatherings, and of a kind that trees in the wild actually form for purposes of communicating through their surfaces and the sharing of nutrients through their roots.       </p><p>In addition, the \"Ghost Forest\" project comes with what Lin refers to as \"advocacy components.\" She has arranged a fall planting of a thousand trees throughout the five boroughs to offset the carbon used in moving the cedars to Manhattan. And she maintains an online database, \"What is Missing?,\" which monitors the disappearance of plant and animal species. (She calls the website, whatismissing.org, the \"last memorial.\")       </p><p>But what's most moving - and, for that reason, most politically effective - about \"Ghost Forest,\" is the way it personalizes its subject. Without sentimentalizing or metaphorizing, it presents trees as the living, breathing, dying relatable beings and karmic companions they are, ones I observe, with love, from my Bronx window, and ones that John Ashbery celebrates in these lines from one of his early poems, \"Some Trees\":       </p><p>These are amazing: eachJoining a neighbor, as though speechWere a still performance.Arranging by chanceTo meet as far this morningFrom the world as agreeingWith it, you and IAre suddenly what the trees tryTo tell us we are:That their merely being thereMeans something; that soonWe may touch, love, explain.              </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maya Lin: Ghost Forest</emphasis></p><p>Through Nov. 14, Madison Square Park, Manhattan; 212-520-7600; madisonsquarepark.org. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IHT-100000007839970</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IHT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6332-7K11-JC85-N006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8357</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1143\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 International Herald Tribune All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New York Times - International Edition</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 7, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XGL</classCode><className>VIETNAM WAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSTY</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001797</classCode><className>VETERANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DLPN</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N921110MM</classCode><className>US PRESIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001421</classCode><className>PROTESTS &amp; DEMONSTRATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was against this background that the Kunstfest Weimar, a late summer event that is the largest contemporary arts festival in eastern Germany, took place with an emphasis on climate justice and our collective responsibility to strive for a better world.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Helpless in the face of these environmental calamities, many of us are probably feeling a measure of \"solastalgia.\" That term was coined in 2004 by the Australian philosopher Glenn Albrecht, who defined it as \"a type of homesickness or melancholia that you feel when you're at home and your home environment is changing around you in ways that you feel are profoundly negative.\" Put more succinctly, it is \"a form of homesickness one gets when one is still at 'home.'\"       </p><p>\"Solastalgia\" is also the name of a new play by Thomas K\u00f6ck that had its premiere last week at the Kunstfest, held annually since 1990 in this small, culturally rich city and shrewdly curated this year by Rolf C. Hemke. A coproduction between the festival and Schauspiel Frankfurt, \"Solastalgia\" is an artful and elegant lamentation about the state of our planet. K\u00f6ck, a young Austrian theater maker, finds an arrestingly poetic register for this meditation on the grief and panic that are common responses to seeing nature perish. Essentially a 70-minute-long monologue that K\u00f6ck, who also directs the energetic and music-filled production, distributes among three actresses, it is by turns humorous, absurd, surreal and horrifying.       </p><p>On a simple, semicircular set, the actresses Miriam Schiweck, Katharina Linder and Mateja Meded, in costumes that seem stitched together from garbage, declaim K\u00f6ck's fragmented text, which contains ruminations on Germany's increasingly ravaged forests and a narrative about a former builder for whom solastalgia becomes not only an existential but also a physical malady. K\u00f6ck's text is lyrical and poetic, with rhythms and cadences of overlapping dialogue creating musical effects.       </p><p>For artists who set out to make works about burning issues like climate change, there is always a danger of sliding into righteousness, or sermonizing. Yet there's a fundamental openness to K\u00f6ck's play that prevents it from becoming propagandistic. How ought we mourn the destruction of our habitat? How best do we live with the knowledge that the forests, beaches and oceans we love are vanishing? \"Solastalgia\" offers few answers, but its barrage of powerful images and incantatory language creates room for poetic and philosophical reflection.       </p><p>The ecological outrage and anxiety at the core of \"Solastalgia\" were also central to \"Welcome to Paradise Lost,\" a musical theater work that might best be described as an immersive environmental agitprop Gesamtkunstwerk. During the performance, the audience follows a cast of actors, singers and musicians through various indoor and outdoor locations in a former electrical power plant on the edge of Weimar's historic center. Unfortunately, much of \"Welcome to Paradise Lost,\" adapted from a recent play by Falk Richter, a leading German dramatist, has a hectoring tone that makes it less compelling than the inventive production, directed by Andrea Moses.       </p><p>Although the direct source material for \"Welcome to Paradise Lost\" is the Persian verse epic \"The Conference of the Birds,\" in which winged creatures gather to seek an enlightened sovereign, Richter's text also nods to Aristophanes and Alfred Hitchcock. In Farid ud-Din Attar's 12th-century poem, the birds travel through a succession of allegorically named valleys where they are confronted with human vices and stupidities. In Richter's version, the Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg (sung by the young Swedish soprano Ylva Stenberg) guides a chorus of 14 youngsters wearing rubber bird masks on the path of resistance and uprising.       </p><p>As Greta leads her panicked flock, alarmed over the loss of their habitat, their methods evolve. Impassioned yet peaceful gatherings reminiscent of Fridays for Future give way to the disruptive tactics associated with Extinction Rebellion in an exciting smoke- and flare-filled outdoor scene where the birds plot terroristic revenge on humankind. But for all the undeniable energy of the production and the performances, \"Welcome to Paradise Lost\" isn't exactly the climate change opera we've been waiting for.       </p><p>The music by the local composer J\u00f6rn Arnecke has moments of arresting lyricism yet is just as often pedestrian. Most crucially, perhaps, the libretto itself, containing numerous outside texts, including Thunberg's \"How dare you\" speech to the United Nations, neither hangs together nor gives any sense of a narrative or a poetic progression. It is loopier and more freewheeling than \"Solastalgia\" but also has the subtlety of a cudgel, thanks to sloganizing and finger wagging.       </p><p>Shifting registers, the Kunstfest turned from environmental alarm to the scourge of right-wing radicalism in Germany.       </p><p>\"Werwolfkommandos,\" a sobering piece of docudrama directed by Marie Schwesinger, is an almost clinical probe into two recent trials that roiled the nation: the first, of a neo-Nazi who in 2019 assassinated Walter L\u00fcbcke, a regional official in the city of Kassel; the second, of the German military officer who had posed as a Syrian refugee and was planning a string of assassinations at the time of his arrest in 2017.       </p><p>Rage-filled yet coolly dispassionate, \"Werwolfkommandos\" consists largely of verbal reconstructions of the trials. Dressed monochromatically, four steely actors bring sang-froid to the courtroom proceedings. The way the actors keep sifting through the evidence, the arguments and the timelines, and the minutiae of the proceedings becomes infuriating and exasperating, which is, of course, precisely the point. At the end of the production, the house lights go dark, and the actors, their faces uncannily illumined by the glow of their cellphones, recite headlines about right-wing extremism. The night of the premiere, the most recent news item was just three days old.       </p><p>Right-wing terror has a particular significance in Weimar. You have only to venture 20 minutes outside of the picturesque old city, with its monuments to Goethe and Schiller, to arrive at the Nazi concentration camp Buchenwald. To travel the six miles between them is to be confronted with the proximity of culture and barbarism that is inscribed in German history.       </p><p>An installation by the American artist Aura Rosenberg, which is part of the Kunstfest's program, offers a poetic reflection on Walter Benjamin's essay \"On the Concept of History,\" which famously interprets a print by the Bauhaus artist Paul Klee, \"Angelus Novus,\" as the emblem of history, unable to turn away from the catastrophes of the past as it is blown into the future.       </p><p>At the center of Rosenberg's installation, on view at the Bauhaus Museum Weimar until Oct. 31, is a multilayered video work, \"Angel of Paradise,\" that literalizes Benjamin's vision of history as \"one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage\" in a trippy computer-animated collage. And yet, at the center of the rubble of civilization heaped together onscreen, we find visual echoes of Benjamin's \"spark of hope in the past\" that drives us to imagine a brighter tomorrow, despite the calamities of history.       </p><p>A similar hope courses through the works of artists invited by the Kunstfest Weimar to share their theatrical responses to our deeply imperfect present.       </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solastalgia.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Directed by Thomas K\u00f6ck.</emphasis> Sept. 23 through Oct. 21 at Schauspiel Frankfurt.<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Welcome to Paradise Lost.</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Directed by Andrea Moses.</emphasis> Deutsches Nationaltheater Weimar.

He\u2019s an ally of Sara Duterte, the mayor of Davao. She\u2019s the daughter of the outgoing head of state and a candidate for the vice-presidency.</p><p>Also running for the nation\u2019s top office are the current liberal vice-president, Leni Robredo, and the legendary retired boxer Manny Pacquiao.</p><p>The Filipino bishops, spiritual leaders of some 89 million Catholics, have been careful not to back any particular candidate.\u00a0</p><p>Instead, they are urging voters to \"consider the common good as foremost concern\" in choosing a new president \u2013 keeping in mind such issues as climate justice, the fight against endemic corruption, hunger and poverty.</p><p>The heads of men\u2019s and women\u2019s religious orders in the Philippines took a similar position in a statement issued on February 22 in which they asked voters to examine the candidates \"through the lens of the Gospel\".</p><p>It is a way to implicitly stand up against the risk of new authoritarianism with Marcos Jr and Sara Duterte in power.</p><p>\"Marcos Jr. called the period of martial law the 'golden age' of the Philippines. This is a very poor vision of history, paradoxically supported by many young people who did not live through that time,\" said Jaypee Calleja, a lawyer and journalist who writes for UCA News from Manila.</p><p>\"Some Catholic universities and lay associations are openly calling, sometimes with the blessing of their bishops, to vote for Leni Robredo,\" noted Father Holzer.</p><p>\"We know that she is not the Messiah, but she could bring back some of the decency that our country has lost. When we remember that Rodrigo Duterte called God 'stupid'...\" sighed Calleja.</p><p>In recent months, the bishops have encouraged parishes to form \"discernment groups\" in the run-up to the election.</p><p>\"It is still difficult to measure the extent to which this approach is followed,\" Holzer said.</p><p>In Asia\u2019s most Catholic country, Rodrigo Duterte has had substantial support the past six years from many Catholics, even though his statements and policies often clashed with the Church\u2019s values.</p><p>This is particularly true on the controversial debate surrounding the reinstatement of the death penalty and on the thousands of extrajudicial killings, a phenomenon that began in 2016 with the government's war on drugs.</p><p>\"Some Catholics, the more conservative ones, are asking the bishops to respect their choice to vote for Marcos Jr.,\u201d Calleja said.</p><p>\u201cAn Opus Dei priest even accused them of dividing the electorate,\" the journalist explained.</p><p>\"The voice of the CBCP is not as audible as it was in the past. The bishops are still quite fearful, even though the new CBCP president since December, Bishop Pablo Virgilio David, has been at the forefront against Duterte,\" Father Holzer pointed out.</p><p>He believes the Church has been too slow to advocate a social program with education at the center, which would make it possible to win back the most neglected popular strata.</p><p>\"Awareness needs to be raised by linking the spiritual with people's lives,\" the missionary priest added.</p><p>\"In the Philippines, we are Catholic on Sundays, but not much beyond that...\"</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://international.la-croix.com/uploads/news/2022/03/aux-philippines-lglise-veut-faire-entendre-sa-voix-dans-la-prsidentielle-15766-23.jpeg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Worshippers gather outside a church in Manila, the capital, on December 20, 2021.

For his mother, the time has come for the world to act and not be hoodwinked by Egypt's greenwashing of human rights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On Monday morning, as world leaders were gathering for the COP27 climate summit in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, Laila Soueif arrived at the Wadi el-Natrun prison north of Cairo to see her son, Alaa Abdel Fattah, one of Egypt's most prominent human rights activists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Her 40-year-old imprisoned son stopped drinking water on Sunday, escalating a hunger strike that has lasted seven months in a desperate campaign for his release.</p><p>Soueif \u2013 a mathematics professor who is also a leading human rights activist \u2013 arrived at the prison with books, letters, and a clean set of clothes for her son. But by noon local time, she sounded resigned about her prospects of meeting her son.</p><p>\"I won't see him today,\" she told FRANCE 24 in a phone interview from the waiting area for family members outside the prison gates. \"There is no visit scheduled. I'm waiting here, I'm hoping to get a letter.\"</p><p>The last letter Soueif received from Fattah was on Monday, October 31, informing the family that if he was not released, he would stop drinking water on Sunday, November 6, the day the COP27 summit opened.</p><p>Fattah, who was one of the leading youth leaders during the 2011 Arab Spring, started a hunger strike in prison on April 2, initially ingesting only water and salt. He later kept his calory intake at 100, a starvation level far below the daily 2,000 calories needed by the human body.</p><p>Already weakened and emaciated following his seven-month hunger strike, Fattah was effectively stating he was willing to pay with his life for liberty. It's an ultimate price that Fattah is also shouldering to highlight the plight of thousands of people \u2013 including human rights defenders, journalists, students, opposition politicians and peaceful protesters \u2013 detained in Egypt's jails.</p><p>This latest act of protest has sparked a media storm amid calls for his release by top human rights defenders.</p><p>Amnesty International Secretary-General Agn\u00e8s Callamard on Sunday warned that the proceedings at COP27 would be stained if Egyptian authorities were faced with Fattah's death in custody. \"If they do not want to end up with a death they should have and could have prevented, they must act now,\" she said.</p><p>Callamard was speaking to journalists in Cairo, where she also met Soueif in the family home. \"Mother Courage. Inspiring. Moving,\" tweeted Callamard with a photograph of the Amnesty International chief holding Soueif's hand in a display of solidarity.</p><p>Family on the frontlines of the fight for human rights</p><p>Benevolence, compassion and a respect for basic human rights are not attributes associated with the Egyptian state, particularly after President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi assumed office in 2014 following a vicious crackdown on Muslim Brotherhood supporters. In October 2021, Egypt's army chief-turned-president announced the lifting of a state of emergency. But within days, the country's parliament approved laws broadening the scope of military tribunals and the definition of \"fake news\".</p><p>An Egyptian and British dual national, Fattah has spent much of the past decade behind bars on various charges. His latest arrest, on October 29, 2021, came just six months after being released from a five-year prison term and while he was still on probation.</p><p>His next five-year sentence, the one he is currently serving, is for \"spreading false news undermining state security\". Fattah's offense was to retweet a post condemning prison conditions in Egypt.</p><p>The irony of sentencing a former prisoner on \"false news\" charges for a statement on jail conditions appeared to be lost on Egyptian authorities.</p><p>But then Fattah and his family know a thing or two about Egypt's prisons and justice system.</p><p>His late father, Ahmed Seif el-Islam, an eminent human rights defender and lawyer, was in and out of jail since the 1970s. His last detention was in 2011, just three years before his death aged 63.</p><p>Fattah's sister, Sanaa Seif, was arrested in 2014 while protesting against Egypt's anti-demonstration law. She was released a year later only to be detained again in June 2020 as she was trying to file an assault complaint at the public prosecutor's office. Following her release, she staged sit-ins outside the British Foreign Office in London calling for her brother's release. On Monday, Sanaa Seif landed in Sharm el-Sheikh to campaign for her brother's release.</p><p>His other sister, Mona, is also a human rights activist.</p><p>\"Alaa comes from a family of Egyptian activists who have always stood up to authorities,\" explained Souleimene Benghazi, Amnesty International's Egypt campaigner. \"It definitely looks like Egyptian authorities are determined to make him pay for his activism.\"</p><p>New prison complex, old violations</p><p>Several human rights campaigners have criticised the decision for Egypt to host COP27, citing \"rampant crimes under international law and other serious human rights violations committed with impunity\", according to an Amnesty International report released in September.</p><p>The report came a year after the Egyptian government launched a National Human Rights Strategy (NHRS) at an event attended by President Sisi, who extolled the progress made by his administration in upholding existing legal and constitutional guarantees.</p><p>Days later, the government opened the Badr and Wadi el-Natrun prison complexes, which was hailed as an effort to modernise Egypt's prisons. Fattah and several other prisoners were transferred from Egypt's ill-reputed Tohra prison complex to the new facilities.</p><p>The gloss and spin have failed to convince human rights defenders as well as families of prisoners detained for expressing dissent. In its 48-page report, Amnesty International noted that the NHRS \"presents a deeply misleading and at times outright false picture of the human rights situation in Egypt\".</p><p>British PM promises to raise issue with Sisi</p><p>Fattah's case is one of the most high-profile detention cases in Egypt, with British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak promising, in a November 5 letter to Sanaa Seif, that it was a priority for his government.</p><p>\"I will continue to stress to President Sisi the importance that we attach to the swift resolution of Alaa's case and an end to his unacceptable treatment,\" Sunak wrote.</p><p>On Monday, Sunak's office said the prime minister had stressed his \"deep concern\" over the case of Egyptian-British hunger striker Alaa Abd el-Fattah during a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi at the COP27 summit.</p><p>\"The prime minister raised the case of Alaa Abd el-Fattah, stressing the UK Government's deep concern on this issue,\" Downing Street said in a readout of the meeting between Sunak and Sisi at the summit in Sharm el-Sheikh.</p><p>\"The prime minister said he hoped to see this resolved as soon as possible and would continue to press for progress.\"</p><p>Greenwashing human rights</p><p>The Egyptian government's failure to act on the case of a dual national from a prominent activist family raises questions on the fate of other prisoners who do not have the sort of agency and international attention that Fattah's detention has attracted.</p><p>It has also raised questions on the intersection of human rights and climate justice in an age when the global environmental crisis requires the engagement of all governments.</p><p>In his welcome address on the COP27 official website, Sisi has promised that, \"Egypt will spare no effort to ensure that COP27 becomes the moment when the world moved from negotiation to implementation and where words were translated to actions, and where we collectively embarked on a path towards sustainability, a just transition and eventually a greener future for coming generations.\"</p><p>The rhetoric has failed to convince most human rights defenders. \"Egyptian authorities are using international events to greenwash their human rights record,\" said Benghazi. \"Ahead of COP27, they were trying to show the international community that they're working on improving their human rights record. It's a PR exercise for them, it's not genuine when thousands of people are detained for exercising their right to free speech, freedom of association and their right to fair trials.\"</p><p>Following Fattah's decision not to drink water, Egyptian officials have not responded to journalist's requests for comment. In earlier comments, the government has noted that he was moved to the new Wadi el-Natrun prison complex, which has better conditions.</p><p>The government's failure to respond to Fattah's case even as it is thrust into the spotlight with the COP27 summit comes as no surprise to experts familiar with Egypt. \"It's really hard to give an opinion on how Egyptian authorities are working or not working on Alaa's case,\" said Benghazi. \"I can only say that they are really trying to push the whole family.\"</p><p>But Laila Soueif is not a woman to be pushed around. During past visits to her jailed son, the indomitable math professor and human rights campaigner explained that she kept her emotions in check. \"I keep my reactions to a minimum. We have only 20 minutes, we're separated by a glass, the conditions are not easy. I listen to him, I take notes, and I tell him that whatever he decides, we will support him.\"</p><p>With campaigners such as Callamard warning that it's just a matter of days for Egyptian authorities to act on Fattah's case before it's too late, Soueif is still keeping her emotions in check as she battles for her son's release. \"I'm very worried,\" she explained on a phone call from the Wadi el-Natrun prison waiting centre. \"I'm also very proud that what he's doing has resonated so much and has put so much focus on the state of prisoners and human rights here.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FR24EN-94872563</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FR24EN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66TB-9MM1-F11P-X0K4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">407771</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1653\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 FRANCE 24 Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

Building a network of Black HIV movement lawyers. Tackling structural racism through the power of dance. Organizing differently-abled people who have engaged with the criminal justice system. Providing a toolkit to help those affected by the criminalization of immigration.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are just a few of the projects being undertaken by the 2020 class of Soros Justice Fellows, a mix of artists, advocates, organizers, and researchers dedicated to advancing reforms and addressing the ills of the U.S. criminal justice system. These 19 fellows, who hail from eight different states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C., will receive a stipend of $57,500 to $127,500, for full-time projects lasting between 12 and 18 months.</p><p>\"The 2020 class of Soros Justice Fellows begin their work at a critical juncture in American history, coming on the heels of a racial justice reckoning heard around the world,\" said Adam Culbreath, who runs the program along with Christina Voight. \"Their energy, industry, and diverse approaches to some of the country's toughest challenges give me hope that they will build on the energy we saw in the streets this year and lead us to a more just and equitable society.\"</p><p>Among the other projects being undertaken by this year's fellows: an effort to promote healing trends in the movement to end mass incarceration; work to explore and develop connections between the environmental and climate justice movements and movements to combat punitive policing and prison policies; and a bid to bring an abolitionist queer feminist lens to antideportation work in the Southeast Asian community.</p><p>Other fellows will work to help those in the informal economy fight attempts to criminalize their work, research the landscape of the sex trade, call out abusive surveillance practices targeting immigrants, combat state violence in Puerto Rico, and use beekeeping as a tool to help provide financial opportunity to the formerly incarcerated.</p><p>\"It's exciting to see the incredible range of ideas and tools these fellows bring to the cause of advancing justice,\" said Leonard Noisette, who oversees the fellowship program as leader of the Justice team in Open Society-U.S. \"We are proud to help support the next generation of leaders in the movement to bring this country closer to its ideals.\"</p><p>The 2020 fellows join over 400 other individuals who, since 1997, have received support through the Soros Justice Fellowships to build more vibrant and inclusive democracies.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 Soros Justice Fellows</emphasis></p><p><url

And there is anger.</p><p>\"Young people, myself included, feel betrayed by world leaders,\" the 22-year-old said at a climate protest ahead of the COP26 summit.</p><p>To deal with her anxiety, she campaigns.</p><p>\"Sometimes it can feel quite hopeless until I am back and organising with my community,\" she said.</p><p>In Johannesburg, clinical psychologist Garret Barnwell showed sympathy and understanding for the young people facing difficult emotions over the crisis.</p><p>\"It's a reality that children are facing this changing world. They're experiencing fear, anger, hopelessness, helplessness,\" Barnwell said.</p><p>The pressures of climate change also amplify pre-existing social injustices, he said, so younger generations are not only concerned about the environment but also, for example, healthcare access.</p><p>Yet despite this, when young people articulate their fears to adults such as teachers, often they find their feels are \"invalidated\", Barnwell added.</p><p>He welcomed the growing global awareness of climate anxiety, adding that while therapy can be helpful ultimately what is needed was political action.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">- 'We bear the burden' -</emphasis></p><p>But in the eyes of many young activists, that concrete action is lacking.</p><p>At the COP26 summit, dozens of countries this week joined a United States and European Union pledge to cut methane emissions.</p><p>The initiative, which experts say could have a powerful short-term impact on global heating, followed an agreement by 100 nations to end deforestation by 2030.</p><p>But a simmering diplomatic spat between the United States, China and Russia over their climate action ambitions showed the fragile nature of the talks.</p><p>\"The previous COP, COP25, really sort of brought out this eco-anxiety I felt,\" said eco-feminist Jennifer Uchendu, 29, in Lagos.</p><p>She said she believed climate anxiety was especially an issue for younger people growing up in nations disproportionately affected by climate change.</p><p>\"We bear the burden of climate change, even though we contributed the least to it,\" she said, a frown creasing her face.</p><p>Uchendu said that rather than bury her fears, she tries to accept them as valid.</p><p>\"It's OK to feel overwhelmed,\" she said.</p><p>\"It's OK to be afraid, scared and even anxious in the face of something so big and so overwhelming.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6418-5N51-F19C-X46V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>WELL-BEING</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 6, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D05Y</classCode><className>MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

The National Labour Relations Board (NLRB), an agency of the US federal government, found against Amazon in a complaint filed by former employees Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa.  The pair had campaigned publicly for Amazon to adopt more climate-friendly policies.  When the pandemic began they expanded their activities into other areas, such as highlighting safety issues for staff in Amazon warehouses.Cunningham and Costa were fired last April.

The NLRB's decisions are not self-executing, and it must apply for a court enforcement order to put them into action.  The agency said it would do so if Amazon did not settle the case.  \"It's a moral victory and really shows that we are on the right side of history and the right side of the law,\" Cunningham told the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/technology/amazon-nlrb-activist-workers.html\">New York Times</url>, which first reported the decision.  Dozens of Amazon staff have filed complaints with the NLRB over illegal relatiations in the past year, with most relating to their complaints to the company about pandemic safety.  The claims may prompt the NLRB to launch a nationwide investigation of Amazon, the agency told NBC News. Complaints are usually handled via the board's regional offices. </p><h>Illegal retaliation</h><p>Amazon's labour practices have come under scrutiny over the past year, as pandemic demand has seen it expand its workforce in the US to nearly one million people.  Unusually, lawmakers across the political spectrum have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/workspace/us-senator-adds-support-to-amazon-union-vote-387632\">spoken in support of a union drive at a facility near Birmingham, Alabama</url>, Amazon's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-management/lay-off/amazon-appeals-us-labor-ruling-350281\">first since 2014</url>.  In Europe, the company has been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-management/amazon-workers-in-german-strike-on-prime-day-348301\">hit by strike actions</url>.  Costa and Cunningham worked as designers at Amazon's Seattle headquarters, and began publicly criticising the company over its environmental practices in 2018.  They were part of a group calledAmazon Employees for Climate Justice, which signed up more than 8,700 staff.  Amazon fired them shortly after they announced an internal event for warehouse workers to speak to tech staff about their working conditions.

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) had claimed Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa were illegally fired for publicly speaking out about the company's climate record and labour policies.  It is fair to say that Amazon is facing a number of legal challenges at the moment. In May the Attorney General of the District of Columbia (Washington DC) <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/ecommerce/amazon-sued-washington-attorney-general-399537\">Karl Racine sued Amazon on antitrust grounds,</url> claiming the company's practices have \"raised prices for consumers and stifled innovation and choice across the entire online retail market.\"  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/AttorneyGeneralKarlRacine.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p><h>Amazon lawsuits</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And in February this year Letitia James,<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/ecommerce/new-york-sues-amazon-pandemic-383784\">New York's attorney general, filed a lawsuit against Amazon</url>, alleging it failed to protect workers during the Coronavirus pandemic.  Besides these two high profile lawsuits, Amazon is also <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-management/jobs/judge-dismisses-amazon-coronavirus-lawsuit-348740\">dealing with a number of other legal actions</url> over whether it<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/ecommerce/coronavirus-amazon-fires-two-more-staff-339563\"> unlawfully fired</url> or <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/ecommerce/coronavirus-amazon-promises-protection-workers-338326\">disciplined employees</url> who had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-management/jobs/coronavirus-amazons-jeff-bezos-quizzed-over-sacked-worker-339154\">reported safety concerns</url> or unsafe working conditions.  The lawsuit filed by Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa concerned Amazon's climate record and its labour policies.  Now a settlement has been announced by NLRB Administrative Law Judge John Giannopoulos at a virtual hearing, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/amazon-settles-with-employees-who-said-they-were-fired-over-activism.html\">CNBC reported</url>. </p><h>Case background</h><p> It comes after the NLRB found in April that Amazon illegally fired them after they advocated for better working conditions during the pandemic.  Amazon however said it had fired Costa and Cunningham for \"repeatedly violating internal policies,\" and it challenged the NLRB findings.  What is known is that Cunningham and Costa reportedly worked at Amazon's Seattle headquarters for 15 years as user experience designers.  However in 2018 they criticised Amazon's climate stance and founded a staff advocacy group that urged the company to reduce its impact on climate change.  The group, called 'Amazon Employees for Climate Justice', gained the support of more than 8,700 employees. More than 1,500 employees reportedly walked out in protest of Amazon's climate policies.  When the Coronavirus pandemic hit, Cunningham and Costa raised concerns about Amazon's treatment of warehouse workers.  According to CNBC, both of them shared a petition from warehouse workers advocating for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.silicon.co.uk/e-marketing/coronavirus-amazon-staff-unlimited-sick-days-335918\">more coronavirus protections</url>, and their employee advocacy group reportedly planned an internal event allowing Amazon tech workers and warehouse employees to discuss workplace conditions. </p><h>Settlement agreement</h><p> NLRB Administrative Law Judge John Giannopoulos had been expected to review the NLRB's complaint.  However this week NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado confirmed a private settlement was reached between the parties.  The settlement amount was not disclosed, but Amazon is required to pay the two fired employees their back wages. \"We are thrilled to announce that we have reached an agreement to settle the charge against Amazon at the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) alleging that the company illegally fired us for speaking up about warehouse workers' conditions during Covid,\" said the two fired staffers in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15kVQrpyqH_sbtOXvQ38DeXZx7lwLAn3GVsZUDb6i0e8/edit\">statement</url>.  \"This is a win for protecting workers rights, and shows that we were right to stand up for each other, for justice, and for our world,\" they said. \"Amazon will be required to pay us our lost wages and post a notice to all of its tech and warehouse workers nationwide that Amazon can't fire workers for organising and exercising their rights.\"  \"It's also not lost on us that we are two women who were targeted for firing,\" the statement added. \"Inequality, racism, and sexism are at the heart of both the climate crisis and the pandemic.\" Amazon said it welcomed the resolution of this case, which avoids the need for a potentially lengthy trial. \"We have reached a mutual agreement that resolves the legal issues in this case and welcome the resolution of this matter,\" an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLCNUK-418871</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLCNUK2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63RC-KGG1-F19T-R3PN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">462789</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><timeReceived>11:43 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 MEDIA365 All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>silicon.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"64647\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 30, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>eCommerce</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Green-IT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Incomes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Innovation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Jobs</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Legal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Marketing</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Regulation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Skills</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Administrative Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjMxMjc0MUIzQjkzNEM4MEI4NkZGQjVCREJCRDk4OUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRERUYwMzZBNEU4NDk0NkI4QkFGNThFOTA1ODgzMjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODU4MEYyMjVGOEFENDdDQTk4OEQzRkQ1QUE2QjVBMUI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>Labor &amp;

It sets the stage for young climate activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There's just a few weeks to go until the COP26 United Nations climate change conference kicks off, bringing together world leaders. But ahead of this major event, young people are in the spotlight, taking the stage at the \"Youth4Climate: Driving Ambition.\" For three days, starting Tuesday, September 28, nearly 400 activists aged 15 to 29 and from 186 countries will meet in Milan to discuss the fate of the planet.</p><p>Among them are the activist Greta Thunberg (who needs no introduction), but also 22-year-old Ashley Lashley, 25-year-old Vanessa Nakate and 25-year-old Luisa Neubauer, emblematic figures in the field of climate action in Barbados, Uganda and Germany.</p><p>The objective of this summit is to establish a negotiation sheet with concrete proposals addressed to the 59 ministers of the environment who will be attending the COP26 conference, held November 1 to 12 in Glasgow, Scotland.</p><p>\"The youth delegates will form four working groups according to the following thematic areas: youth driving ambition, sustainable recovery, non-state actors' engagement, and climate-conscious society,\" explains the Youth4Climate website.\u00a0</p><p>\"Over the past few years, I have seen more and more how the climate crisis is affecting the African continent .... You cannot adapt to extinction .... Loss and damage is here with us now, we need to put it at the center of negotiations,\" said Vanessa Nakate in her speech given Tuesday, September 28 in Milan.\u00a0</p><p>Like Greta Thunberg, this Ugandan activist began campaigning outside Parliament on Friday afternoons (instead of going to school) to demand more measures and laws to protect the planet and its inhabitants. She then created the Rise Up movement, through which she was able to carry out local actions, such as installing solar panels in schools in Uganda.</p><p>Powerful remarks from @vanessa_vash, one of our #SDGYoungLeaders, at the opening of the #Youth4Climate: #DrivingAmbition event<br/>Young people need no more empty promises, but to be truly included in decision-making processes &amp; to see concrete #ClimateAction <url normalizedValue=\"https://t.co/zA6LdAvvZC\">https://t.co/zA6LdAvvZC</url></p><p>\u2014 UN Youth Envoy (@UNYouthEnvoy) September 28, 2021</p><p><br/>Alongside Vanessa Nakate, Greta Thunberg also gave a speech which, as usual, doesn't fail to pack a punch, urging world leaders to react to the climate emergency:\u00a0\"We can no longer let the people in power decide what is politically possible. We can no longer let the people in power decide what hope is. Hope is not passive. Hope is not blah, blah, blah. Hope is telling the truth. Hope is taking action. And hope always comes from the people.\"\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Change will come from the streets\"</emphasis></p><p>From Bangladesh to Mexico, Germany, Sweden, France, South Africa, Canada and Argentina... On Friday, September 24, climate marches organized by young protesters took place in more than 1,400 cities around the world. \"Change is going to come but it is going to come from the streets. We will make sure that this message is out there on the 24th,\" Luisa Neubauer, a spokesperson for Fridays For Future in Germany, told The Guardian.</p><p>Last year, when COP26 was postponed to 2021 due to the pandemic, young people around the world mobilized to create their own climate conference. Entitled \"Mock COP26,\" this two-week online summit initiated by British student Josh Tregale and 16 other young people was an opportunity for young activists to debate topics such as climate justice and climate education, or even discuss the measures taken by states to reduce their carbon emissions.</p><p>According to a recent study carried out by the \"Teach The Future\" campaign (which advocates for widespread climate education in the UK), 70% of teachers feel they have not received adequate training to educate students about the climate crisis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RENWSE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RENWSE2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63R5-3W61-JDVB-63PM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">350505</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 ETX Studio All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ETX Daily Up (English International Version)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62221\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>HOUSE &amp;

Annalena Baerbock <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-hydrogen-diplomacy-under-fire-in-ukraine/\">spoke</url>\u00a0in Kyiv about the need for hydrogen diplomacy and intensified cooperation on a 'Green Fund'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For many, these words rang hollow as dozens of armed Russian battalions have already amassed at the border. A feeling of hypocrisy also lingers in the air; the new German government effectively promises hydrogen cooperation to a country that stands to lose billions in natural gas transit fees if the German-Russian Nord Stream 2 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.martenscentre.eu/publication/european-energy-security-in-focus-the-case-against-nord-stream-2/\">pipeline</url>\u00a0becomes operational.</p><p>Physical warfare and energy security are brushed off - climate policy reigns supreme. Emboldened by their righteous cause, the Greens sitting in the Federal Cabinet seem to be proclaiming '<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fiat clima iustitia, et pereat mundus'</emphasis>\u00a0- Let climate justice be done, though the world perish.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">How \"Green\" is Germany?</emphasis></p><p>A common question for all Europeans is whether Berlin should be the inspirational leader in the EU's climate transition. Indeed, Germany follows an elaborate energy transition (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Energiewende</emphasis>) strategy, which has accelerated the amount of electricity production from clean energy sources. Certain parts of the German\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Energiewende</emphasis>\u00a0are laudable, given the common challenges we face due to global warming and rising sea levels.</p><p>However, when digging deeper into the country's actual climate track record and its new stated ambitions, one can feel uncertain about the government's overall direction. Fossil fuels still represent upwards of 75% of Germany's primary energy <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/countries/germany\">supply</url>. After all the strategies and direct subsidies, renewable energy in Germany's mix represents less than 20%. Many would be surprised to learn that Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, Portugal and Croatia have <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Renewable_energy_statistics#:~:text=The%20EU%20reached%20a%2022.1,percentage%20points%20above%20its%20target.&amp;text=The%20share%20of%20renewables%20in,compared%20with%209.6%20%25%20in%202004.\">outpaced</url>\u00a0Germany on this front.</p><p>Currently, German households and industries pay one of the highest <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=Electricity_price_statistics\">prices</url> for electricity across the EU. The 'green premium' on renewables means that German families pay hundreds of euros extra every year. Many are also questioning whether it makes sense to dot a considerable part of public and private space with wind farms, which have an unreliable energy output dependent on weather conditions.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The threat of central planning</emphasis></p><p>German thinking on climate influences Brussels, and it is being replicated in our long-term policies. More money, more ambition, more sacrifices, regardless of the actual result and the unintended consequences. The EU barely covered its climate goals for 2020 on greenhouse gas reduction, renewables and energy efficiency, but we already set new targets for 2030, which are nearly impossible to achieve.</p><p>There is mounting pressure on all European member states to firmly commit to deadlines for the complete phase-out of coal in their economies. Germany is also pushing for the continental-wide ban on the sale of petrol and diesel cars by 2035. Berlin is also leading a vocal minority against adding nuclear energy in the new European taxonomy on sustainable investment and would like to see a limited presence of nuclear reactors in the EU.</p><p>Most worryingly, Brussels is dominated by damaging groupthink that only a decisive top-down operation can provide the necessary fix. It is true that fighting climate change demands better governmental coordination and appropriate incentives. However, contemporary climate policy is becoming far from a gentle nudge - it appears as if the market's invisible hand is tightly clutched.</p><p>As it stands, many Europeans are struggling to cope with rising energy prices, while businesses and industry are pressed to adapt to novel climate regulations, goals or potential bans. Worryingly, around 35 million Europeans are currently in energy poverty.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate realism</emphasis></p><p>European member states should not allow Germany to dominate the EU's climate agenda. The fixation on renewables, unsustainable spending and stringent top-down policies is not the gospel all European capitals should follow. The latest energy price\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.martenscentre.eu/blog/the-inherent-flaws-in-the-eus-green-ambitions-are-already-showing/\">crisis</url> reminds us that there is a hefty price tag on our climate aspirations and that the continent risks painful energy shortages.</p><p>After all, the EU is responsible for less than 7% of global greenhouse gas emissions. European policy-makers should be aware that in a zealous pursuit for the worldwide good, they might cause irreparable damage in our own backyard. We should aim to gradually reduce fossil fuel usage without sacrificing our energy security.</p><p>More importantly, the EU should substantially increase joint-European investment in breakthrough R&amp;D and large-scale research projects on sustainability. An embarrassingly small amount<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>of the mammoth EU funds (MFF and NexGenEU) are allocated to R&amp;D on sustainability. Novel European green tech should promote our export interests globally and have a lasting effect on reducing humanity's negative environmental footprint.</p><p>In terms of worldview and strategic outlook, European policy-makers should recognise that ubiquitous state intervention would not produce the net-zero dream scenario. Market forces<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\u00a0</emphasis>and relevant economic factors should have a stronger role in shaping our progress on decarbonisation. Hasty bans or over-ambitious strategies create a skewed economy with perverse incentives for investment.</p><p>You cannot re-engineer European industry, business and transport in less than a decade through central planning. Some of these policy choices are irreversible, and it would be devastating to make such important decisions motivated only by climate guilt rather than economic reality and the overall wellbeing of European citizens.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1711914</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64SK-B2N1-DYXB-V4GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"942\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 14, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Germany</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>hydrogen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>nuclear energy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Ukraine</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00098A0</classCode><className>FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

Climate change and nature loss are the greatest threats to our planet and the impacts are already being felt worldwide including here in Scotland.</p><p>Unless we act now, we will continue to see an increase in heatwaves, floods, catastrophic storms and water scarcity - a price that our planet simply cannot afford to pay.</p><p>Leaders must come to Glasgow committed to the objectives of the Paris Agreement and ready to turn promises into action. COP26 will only be a success if it delivers the results required to keep the prospect of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C alive.</p><p>Global climate action requires huge commitments from governments at all levels and of all sizes. As the First Minister of Scotland, I am determined to play my part and to support other leaders to do so too.</p><p>It is important to recognise that countries like ours, with rich industrial pasts, have a special responsibility. We have disproportionately contributed to climate change, so we must do more to help tackle it.</p><p>That is why in Scotland, we were one of the first nations to declare a climate emergency. We have decarbonised faster than any G20 country, more than halving our emissions from 1990 levels, and by 2030 we aim to halve them again - all on route to becoming Net Zero by 2045.</p><p>We have funded the restoration of around 30,000 hectares of peatland and have created more than 32,000 hectares of new woodland. And last year the equivalent of 96% of the electricity we consumed came from renewable sources.</p><p>However, being proud of our progress so far does not mean ignoring the scale of the challenge that remains. Ending our contribution to climate change within a generation will require transformational change across all parts of the economy and society.</p><p>The leadership and action of small countries can make a big difference.</p><p>As the European co-chair of the Under2 Coalition - bringing together over 200 states, regions and countries like ourselves, representing almost two billion people - Scotland is encouraging others to sign up to ambitious emission reduction targets.</p><p>Brittany in France, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany and Lombardy in Italy are just a few of the growing number of European members.</p><p>Last week we launched a new set of commitments for members of the group bringing them firmly into line with the Paris agreement and calling for further action to be taken.</p><p>Of course, demonstrating ambition alone is not enough. If we are to successfully respond to the global climate emergency, we must continue to learn from one another and agree shared actions.</p><p>We know the impacts of climate change are not felt equally.</p><p>Agreeing to limit emissions does not go far enough. To deliver the fair and just outcome we all need world leaders must also deliver on the financial commitments required to enable countries to adapt, to mitigate, to introduce new clean technology and to address the loss and damage caused by the climate crisis.</p><p>Climate Justice and a Just Transition must be central to the outcome in Glasgow.</p><p>Future generations have a right to a more equal, just and fair future that leaves no one behind. Not only have children and young people played a significant role in getting climate change on the international agenda, but they will also face the greatest impacts of climate change over their lifetimes.</p><p>We are supporting opportunities for children and young people from Scotland and beyond to ensure their voices are heard by hosting the UN's official youth event for COP26, the Conference of Youth.</p><p>There is no guarantee that COP26 will deliver the results that all of us are counting on but if world leaders come to Scotland willing to grasp the opportunity on offer they can turn ambition into action and bring us all one step closer to securing the future of our planet.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1665936</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63Y9-5N21-JCF9-44V1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"696\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 28, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>COP 26</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Glasgow</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paris Climate Agreement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Scottish National Party</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

Can international climate diplomacy survive two bad COPs in a row?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hosted in the Egyptian beach resort of Sharm El-Sheikh and cooled down to arctic temperatures using copious amounts of energy, COP27 was largely considered terrible, for a multitude of reasons.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To start with, the state of human rights in Egypt overshadowed the conference multiple times. And the last-minute agreement to establish a new fund to compensate for climate disasters did little to paper over the shortcomings exposed in Sharm El-Sheikh when it comes to climate mitigation \u2013 the main reason why COPs were set up in the first place.</p><p>True, this year\u2019s conference will be remembered for reaching a landmark agreement on climate justice, and initiating much-needed talks to set up a compensation fund for \u201closs and damage\u201d caused by climate change.\u00a0</p><p>But for the global South, it is a pyrrhic victory. Antonio Guterres, the UN secretary general, probably found the right words to summarise why:\u00a0</p><p>\u201cA fund for loss and damage is essential \u2013 but it\u2019s not an answer if the climate crisis washes a small island state off the map \u2013 or turns an entire African country to desert. The world still needs a giant leap on climate ambition.\u201d</p><p>And according to many observers, much of the blame can be laid on the Egyptian presidency.</p><p>Presiding over a COP is very much like conducting an orchestra. Presidencies are supposed to act like honest brokers, driving the preparatory work ahead of the two-week COP. A year\u2019s worth of work, leading up to a bombastic finish.</p><p>But this year\u2019s COP by Egypt led to an anticlimax. Saudi Arabia, an oil superpower and close ally of Cairo, played a key role in preventing the conference from backing a strong commitment to limiting temperature increases to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the only hope the world still has to avoid catastrophic climate change.</p><p>At the end of the two-week meeting, the presidency strong-armed delegations into making decisions on texts that only they could see, but not share with their team. Insiders whisper that preparatory meetings were relatively sparse.</p><p>As <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Carbon Brief\u2019s</emphasis> Simon Evans <url normalizedValue=\"https://twitter.com/DrSimEvans/status/1594474721554276352?s=20&amp;t=Jp6OnTs9nVVfBk8DKp_CSw\">pointed out</url>, the Egyptian presidency delayed the crucial negotiations on the \u201ccover decision\u201d until COP was nearly over.</p><p> One could wonder whether the objective was not to tire negotiators by going overtime. EU Climate chief Frans Timmermans admitted that he\u2019d gone without sleep for more than 24 hours by the end of the summit.</p><p>The Egyptian presidency was also criticised for failing to reflect the wish of several countries to mention the objective of phasing down fossil fuels in the final text, stressed Lola Vallejo, climate programme director at IDDRI, a French climate think-tank.</p><p>Granted, the failure of this COP should not be over-estimated: most observers would agree that the real meat when it comes to climate action takes place outside those annual UN jamborees.\u00a0</p><p>But can the world\u2019s climate be saved without COPs? Can it be saved without these nexuses of activity, where campaigners and world leaders brush shoulders and where months of preparatory meetings culminate with in-person exchanges?</p><p>If anything, next year\u2019s COP28 already promises more disappointment. </p><p>If activists complained about Egypt, what will they say about the United Arab Emirates, one of the biggest oil exporters in the world and host of next year\u2019s UN climate summit? Of the 636 fossil fuel lobbyists registered this year in Sharm El-Sheikh, 70 were linked to UAE oil and gas companies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/16/uae-cop28-host-lobby-climate-reputation-cop27\">according to the Guardian</url>.</p><p>In Europe, disillusioned governments are already trying to plan for next year in the hope of saving COP28 from failure.\u00a0</p><p>Germany\u2019s lead on international climate diplomacy, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, bemoaned a \u201cblockade by some large emitters and oil-producing states\u201d in Egypt this year.\u00a0</p><p>IDDRI\u2019s Vallejo stressed that\u00a0\u201cthe UAE\u2019s economic interest, to put it mildly, lies in prolonging oil and gas as part of the solution\u201d.</p><p>Have COPs hit the bottom, or can they sink further?

This puts\u00a0 recycled materials at a disadvantage compared to primary raw materials, EuRIC says. Moreover, free ETS allocations will apply only to large producers, it points out, saying smaller companies like the recyclers represented by EuRIC \u201cwould suffer from unfair competition\u201d as a result.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cPolicymakers should not listen to just a handful of large stakeholders,\u201d EuRIC concludes, urging negotiators to take the view of SMEs on board as well.

The European\u00a0 Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Ukrainian Geological Survey signed a memorandum of understanding on 17 November, with the aim of improving the management of geological data in Ukraine.</p><p>By digitalising geological data, including documents and maps, the MoU will help improve access for investors to raw materials in Ukraine, and facilitate transparency, regulation and governance of Ukraine\u2019s natural resources, the European Commission said in a<url normalizedValue=\"https://neighbourhood-enlargement.ec.europa.eu/news/eu-ukraine-strategic-partnership-raw-materials-european-bank-reconstruction-and-development-will-2022-11-17_en\"> statement</url>.</p><p>Maro\u0161 \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d, the EU commissioner for interinstitutional relations and foresight, was present at the signing ceremony. He said: \u201cRaw materials, critical for green and digital economies, can be found in abundance in Ukraine, which holds deposits of some 20 out of 30 such materials. By integrating Ukraine in EU value chains, we will diversify our supplies, strengthen our industrial base, while helping reconstruct Ukraine\u2019s war-torn economy.\u201d</p><p>The MoU is based on a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/circular-economy/news/eu-ukraine-to-sign-strategic-partnership-on-raw-materials/\"> \u201cstrategic partnership\u201d signed by the EU and Kyiv last year</url>, which seeks to develop an entire value chain for the extraction, refining and recycling of minerals in Ukraine to supply the EU market for electric cars and digital equipment.</p><p>Ukraine\u2019s reserves of titanium accounts for more than 6% of the world\u2019s production, and Ukraine possesses one of the largest reserves of natural graphite. Reserves of cobalt, scandium, rare earth elements, magnesium and lithium are also considerable, \u0160ef\u010dovi\u010d said.

Greater use of renewable energy doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into higher prices and it may in fact help cut inflation compared to continued reliance on fossil fuels, European Central Bank board member Fabio Panetta said on Wednesday.</p><p>Panetta was taking aim at the notion, defended by some economists including his fellow board member Isabel Schnabel, that adopting low-emission sources of energy could initially result in higher costs, particularly during the process of transition.</p><p>\u201cThe green transition need not lead to higher inflation in the future,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cAppropriate public policies that compress the demand for fossil fuels and stimulate the production of cheaper renewable energy sources can help to contain inflationary pressures and may even help to reduce inflation compared with a counterfactual situation.\u201d</p><p>He made the case for lower taxes or subsidies for green energy and the opposite for fossil fuels.</p><p>The ECB is battling with the highest inflation rates in decades although this has mostly been spurred by higher costs for traditional forms of energy, such as natural gas, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine.

But when The Associated Press released a picture of the five from the event, Ms. Nakate had been cropped out.       </p><p>The omission shocked and saddened Ms. Nakate, who in a tearful 10-minute video posted on Twitter denounced the \"racism\" in the global environmental movement and the erasure of Black and African voices from conversations around climate activism, even as their communities and countries are disproportionately affected by the crisis.       </p><p>\"I felt like I had wasted time going to Davos,\" she said in a recent interview in the Ugandan capital, Kampala. \"I felt that I shouldn't have been at the news conference.\"       </p><p>Yet her presence at the event and the effect that the episode had on her elicited a response that reverberated across the world. Her Twitter posts on the issue were liked and retweeted hundreds of thousands of times. The A.P., which apologized to her both publicly and privately, said it would expand diversity training for its journalists and editors worldwide.       </p><p>And by the time Ms. Nakate's flight landed in Uganda a day after she posted her video, she had solidified her place as a leading voice among young Africans passionately arguing for action against climate change.       </p><p>\"I think what really helped me become what I am today is the fact that I spoke up and the fact that people responded with support,\" said Ms. Nakate, who describes herself as \"a fighter for the people and the planet.\" Her book, \"A Bigger Picture: My Fight to Bring a New African Voice to the Climate Crisis,\" will be published in November.       </p><p>Although being edited out of the photo was not an ideal way for people to find out about her work, she said it was certainly a turning point.       </p><p>The A.P., which called the decision  a \"terrible mistake,\" said the picture had been edited to create\u00a0a close-up of Ms. Thunberg and to remove a building that was behind Ms. Nakate. But the deletion of the sole Black activist from the image highlighted both racial injustice globally and the disproportionate effects that climate change and other environmental issues are having on countries that are predominantly home to people of color.       </p><p>The climate crisis \"has a racial issue,\" said Ms. Nakate, who appears soft-spoken by nature but is not one to shy away from debate. \"You cannot have climate justice without racial justice. It isn't justice if it doesn't include everyone.\"       </p><p>Even though Africa produces a relatively low level of greenhouse gas emissions, the continent's people remain particularly vulnerable to the effects of the climate crisis. Changes in climatic patterns have brought desert locusts endangering food security in East Africa, cyclones devastating lives in southern Africa and threats to the Nile's critical water supply.       </p><p>In Uganda, a verdant and landlocked East African nation, communities have in recent years suffered the consequences of adverse weather patterns. That has led to protracted dry spells and devastating floods and landslides, with a loss of homes, crops and businesses.       </p><p>\"People have waged war against nature, and a war against nature means a war against people themselves,\" Ms. Nakate told students at an international school on the outskirts of Kampala on a recent morning. \"Sadly those who are least responsible face the biggest challenges of this crisis.\"       </p><p>Ms. Nakate grew up in Kampala, where her father was the head of a political district. At the family's home in the Kitintale neighborhood, photos of Ms. Nakate in her university graduation gown dot the living room - a testament, she said, of her parents' emphasis on educating her and her four younger siblings and giving them a bright future.       </p><p>She chanced upon environmental activism in 2018 after graduating with a business degree from Makerere University. With no job lined up, Ms. Nakate volunteered with the Rotary Club organization, where she was researching the biggest challenges facing local areas and how she could help. That was when she realized that climate change was not some distant threat, but a problem that at that very moment was eating away at communities and destroying livelihoods.       </p><p>She also found out about Fridays for Future, the movement that Ms. Thunberg started to pressure policymakers to listen to scientists and act.       </p><p>Though eager to take action herself, Ms. Nakate said she was initially afraid of taking to Kampala's streets to protest alone. So on a warm Sunday morning in January 2019, she enlisted her two sisters, Clare and Joan, and two brothers, Paul and Trevor, to help make placards and join her.       </p><p>As passers-by and drivers stared, the siblings protested at various intersections in the capital, holding signs that read \"Nature is life,\" \"Climate Strike Now\" and \"When you plant a tree, you plant a forest.\"       </p><p>\"There was the feeling of 'I have taken so long without doing this, and yet people are suffering,'\" Ms. Nakate said. At that moment, she said, she determined \"to add my voice to the climate movement and demand for climate justice.\"       </p><p>When her siblings returned to school several weeks later, she continued alone, organizing climate strikes in schools and standing outside government offices with signs bearing messages like \"Are you fracking kidding me?\" She urged lawmakers to divest from coal and oil companies and to deal with rising water levels in Lake Victoria and high air pollution levels in cities like Kampala.       </p><p>By the end of the year, Ms. Nakate's work was attracting attention worldwide, making her a fixture in global conferences and on television. In December 2019, she was one of a few young activists who were invited to speak at the United Nations climate talks in Spain.       </p><p>She also turned her attention to the rest of Africa, and created the Rise Up Movement to raise awareness about climate change and co-founded One Million Activist Stories to document the experiences of young activists worldwide.       </p><p>In Uganda, her Green Schools project is installing solar panels and eco-friendly stoves in schools across the country - part of her efforts, she said, to educate young people in rural and urban areas about the realities of climate change.       </p><p>\"They are tomorrow's leaders,\" Ms. Nakate said. \"They are tomorrow's campaigners.

He wants guarantees that the money will end up in the right hands.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">HOUSTON - He's known as the father of environmental justice, but more than half a century ago he was just Bob Bullard from Elba, a flyspeck town deep in Alabama that didn't pave roads, install sewers or put up streetlights in areas where Black families like his lived. His grandmother had a sixth grade education. His father was an electrician and plumber who for years couldn't get licensed because of his race.       </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now, more than four decades after Robert Bullard took an unplanned career turn into environmentalism and civil rights, the movement he helped found is clocking one of its biggest wins yet. Some $60 billion of the $370 billion in climate spending passed by Congress last month has been earmarked for environmental justice, which calls for equal environmental protections for all, the cause to which Dr. Bullard has devoted his life.       </p><p>Some environmentalists have slammed the new legislation for allowing more oil and gas drilling, which generally hits disadvantaged communities the hardest. For Dr. Bullard, the new law is reason for celebration, but also caution. Too often, he said, federal money and relief funds are doled out inequitably by state and local governments, and away from people of color and poor communities, who are the most afflicted by pollution and most vulnerable to climate change. This might be a major moment for environmental justice, he said, but never before has so much been at stake.       </p><p>\"We need government watchdogs to ensure the money follows need,\" Dr. Bullard said in a recent interview. \"Climate change will make the inequities and disparities worse, and widen that gap. That's why this time, we have to get this right.\"       </p><p>Dr. Bullard, 75, is one of the foremost experts of environmental justice in the world. His seminal 1990 book \"Dumping in Dixie,\" about toxic facilities in communities of color, has been cited in scholarly articles more than 5,600 times. He doesn't remember when exactly he began being called the \"Father of Environmental Justice,\" and though the sobriquet is prominently displayed on his website, he didn't come up with it himself (there are other vaunted elders in the field), and affects a degree of humility when asked about it.       </p><p>\"It's better to be called the 'father of' than 'son of,'\" Dr. Bullard said during an interview at Texas Southern University this past spring. \"It's really a compliment, but again, I've been called worse.\"       </p><p>In recent years especially, as environmental justice has come to the fore, Dr. Bullard's visibility has spiked. Requests for talks and interviews pour in daily, in no small part because of his style: He can deliver a blizzard of alarming facts while remaining upbeat, and serve up unvarnished honesty with a smile. Of the roughly two dozen awards and prestigious appointments Dr. Bullard has collected over his career, nearly half have come in the last four years. In 2021, he became a White House adviser, and, with $1.25 million from the Houston Endowment and later $4 million from the Bezos Earth Fund, Texas Southern University opened the Bullard Center for Environmental and Climate Justice.       </p><p>\"I don't know any person on the planet who has done more to advocate and raise awareness on this issue,\" said Paul Mohai, a professor at the School for Environment and Sustainability at the University of Michigan, who has known Dr. Bullard for more than 30 years. \"It's impossible to not have a boost of adrenaline when he speaks.\"       </p><p>Dr. Bullard was born in 1946 to a family that defied the odds. In 1875, 10 years after the official abolishment of slavery, his great-grandparents acquired several hundred acres of timberland in Elba. \"We don't know how they got it,\" Dr. Bullard said. \"We don't ask.\"       </p><p>The land proved a game changer. As property holders, his parents and grandmother could vote under Jim Crow laws. On Election Days, they dressed in their Sunday best and headed to the ballot box, even though it meant paying poll taxes and passing literacy tests. Timber harvested from the land also allowed the family to send Bob and his four siblings to college, a rarity for Black people at the time.       </p><p>After graduating from Alabama A&amp;M University, young Bob Bullard had another stroke of luck. It was the height of the Vietnam War, and he was drafted to the Marines, yet somehow didn't get deployed, escaping the harrowing fate that befell others in his platoon. Funded by the G.I. Bill, he went on to get a master's degree and doctorate in sociology, and emerged determined to model his career on that of his hero, the writer and civil rights champion W.E.B. DuBois.       </p><p>\"He didn't do dead white man sociology, he did what I call kick-ass sociology,\" Dr. Bullard said. \"You can be a scholar and an activist and you can do something to make change.\"       </p><p>The environment wasn't on Dr. Bullard's radar until 1979, when he was teaching sociology at Texas Southern University and his wife, Linda McKeever Bullard, a lawyer, asked for his help. She was filing a class-action lawsuit to stop a landfill from going into a middle class Black community in Houston, and tapped her husband to find out where the city's other landfills were. He enlisted his students, and after painstaking research they discovered that although Black people made up just a quarter of Houston's population, all five of the city's garbage dumps, six of its eight incinerators, and three out of its four privately-owned landfills were in Black neighborhoods.       </p><p>The case spent eight years in court, ending in 1987 with a decision allowing the landfill to proceed. Dr. Bullard was stunned. \"The data and research were solid,\" Dr. Bullard said. \"But it was not enough to overcome the legacy of racism in the county system.\"       </p><p>After the landfill was built in the tree-lined community of Black-owned homes, Dr. Bullard said more industrial sites followed, driving down property values. \"That's theft of wealth,\" he said. Outraged, he was determined to uncover more examples of how communities of color were disproportionately beset with poisoned water, soil and air.       </p><p>In the 1980s, environmentalism and civil rights were by and large on two different tracks, and Dr. Bullard struggled to get backing from either camp. The major environmental groups told him they didn't work on what they characterized as a social issue - \"my response was, 'Is breathing social?'\" Dr. Bullard said. Meanwhile, civil rights organizations often said their focus was on discrimination in housing, voting, employment and education. The \"Dumping in Dixie\" manuscript was rejected a dozen times for similar reasons; Dr. Bullard was told the words \"environment\" and \"racism\" didn't belong together because the environment couldn't be racist. The publisher who finally bought it made it into a textbook, which initially angered Dr. Bullard until he realized it was getting adopted by universities nationwide, seeding his findings in young minds.       </p><p>\"'Dumping in Dixie' is the environmental justice bible,\" said Na'Taki Osborne Jelks, an environmental health scientist who studied under Dr. Bullard as an undergraduate, and now teaches at Spelman College. \"He set up a road map for others to follow who wanted to combine scholarship along with activism and advocacy.\"       </p><p>Today, after decades of organizing and mobilizing, environmental justice is a foremost concern to climate activists, a rise that Peggy Shepard, executive director of WE ACT for Environmental Justice, in Harlem, attributed in large part to the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd's murder. Ms. Shepard added that she'd never seen so much media interest or funding offers. \"We've been fighting the David and Goliath fight with a slingshot,\" she said.       </p><p>And environmental organizations that ignored race 15 years ago were now \"stumbling over each other\" to enlist people of color, Dr. Bullard said. The biggest green groups remain overwhelmingly white, and have faced their own racial reckonings. In 2020, a Black staff member resigned from the Union of Concerned Scientists, publicly slamming what she described as its ingrained tokenism; a few weeks later the Sierra Club said it had to confront the white supremacism of its founder, John Muir.       </p><p>Beverly Wright, founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans, and a longtime collaborator with Dr. Bullard, said the exclusion of people of color came at a cost. Surveys taken in 2020 by Yale University and George Mason University showed that 80 percent of Latinos and 75 percent of Black people were worried about climate change, compared with 59 percent of whites.       </p><p>\"They realized they can't do this by themselves, and need us in the room to get anything done, or passed,\" said Dr. Wright, referring to the major environmental groups. \"All things work better for all of us when we are in the room.\"       </p><p>Still, theirs remains an uphill battle. In August, Democrats made concessions allowing for more fossil fuel expansion in order to secure support for the climate bill from Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat who holds a crucial swing vote in an evenly divided Senate. This infuriated some environmental justice advocates who said marginalized communities, especially those near Gulf Coast petrochemical plants, were being made sacrificial lambs.       </p><p>There are also questions about whether the Democrats are overcounting the $60 billion designated for environmental justice in the new climate law. Sylvia Chi, a strategist with the Just Solutions Collective, calculated the amount to be closer to $40 billion; by her analysis the White House appeared to be including the value of entire programs rather than smaller amounts targeted to disadvantaged communities, or possibly programs that don't target those communities at all.       </p><p>Dr. Bullard, for his part, touted the bill as historic, and applauded the inclusion of community block grants and funding for pollution monitoring near industrial facilities.       </p><p>But he and his colleagues are concerned about oversight and the money getting to disadvantaged communities as intended, and fear that enforceable targets aren't laid out explicitly. \"The implementation is the fight,\" said Dr. Wright.       </p><p>Dr. Bullard pointed to an investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development earlier this year that found a Texas state agency discriminated against people of color when it distributed relief funds after Hurricane Harvey. Research also shows that FEMA, the government agency responsible for helping Americans recover from disasters, has often helped white disaster victims more than people of color, even when the amount of damage is the same.

Deborah Osei-Mensah is a cocoa producer and fair-trade youth ambassador from Ghana.</emphasis></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ahead of the COP 26 climate summit, the EU has been enthusiastically promoting its credentials as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://eeas.europa.eu/headquarters/headquarters-homepage/102985/climate-change-eu-ready-assume-its-global-responsibility_en\">world's climate leader</url>. It points to its plan to cut emissions by 55% by the end of the decade and its <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/resource.html?uri=cellar:5bf4e9d0-71d2-11eb-9ac9-01aa75ed71a1.0001.02/DOC_1&amp;format=PDF\">new policy</url> of aligning trade - or more specifically, free trade agreements (FTAs) - with environmental aims.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On the first of these, the EU's so-called Fit for 55 plan is a start and may help push other major emitters to act, but it is insufficient if it is serious about doing its fair share to avert the worst of climate breakdown.</p><p>The issue of a renewed trade policy - a key element in making the bloc's Green Deal a reality - is the subject of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://trade.ec.europa.eu/consultations/index.cfm?consul_id=301\">public consultation</url>, which runs until the end of the month.</p><p>Taken at face value there is much to shout about: international trade covers a huge amount of exploitative, destructive and carbon-intensive economic activities. Ursula von der Leyen summed it up nicely in <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/political-guidelines-next-commission_en_0.pdf\">her manifesto</url> for the job of Commission president, declaring \"trade is not an end in itself\". In her more recent <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/SPEECH_21_4701\">State of the Union</url> speech, she even called for zero forced labour supply chains, stating that \"business and global trade can never be done at the expense of people's dignity and freedom\".</p><p>So far, so good? A policy worthy of a climate and social rights leader? Well, actually, no. You don't have to look too far to see that in the words of Greta, this is all so much \"blah blah blah\", a triumph of rhetoric over substance, a failure to walk the talk.</p><p>Trade remains the emptiest of all the EU's sustainability policies. And that matters because action <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">and </emphasis>policy coherence are needed now - we can't have policies that will only be aligned at some distant future date. It undermines the vital trust on which climate negotiation and action is based, and further erodes faith in political leadership, most notably for young citizens. Not only that, failure to put the policy into action threatens to lock in high carbon trade at a time when the EU is discussing deals with countries like Indonesia, where so much is at stake on both sides.</p><p>The EU's Brexit deal with the UK was far from perfect. Still, it was widely cited as breaking new ground by making a failure to abide by the Paris Agreement <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/climate-change/news/brexit-deal-climate-change-targets-b1779630.html\">a sanctionable</url> - or punishable - provision. Since then, however, the EU has been on the backslide. Earlier this year, there was a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy-environment/opinion/eu-mercosur-trade-deal-threatens-to-wreck-the-blocs-climate-credibility/\">disgraceful plan</url> to push through ratification of the deeply flawed and outdated agreement with the Mercosur countries.\u00a0 Without a fundamental renegotiation to align with current assessment and best practice, the Amazon, its people and wildlife will be further endangered. At about the same time, the EU reportedly rejected demands from New Zealand to have sanctionable <url normalizedValue=\"https://pro.politico.eu/news/134107\">green provisions</url> in the FTA the two are currently negotiating.</p><p>This begs the question: if not now, when, and with whom? Because New Zealand has been walking the talk, as shown by its trailblazing <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iisd.org/articles/time-accts-five-countries-announce-new-initiative-trade-and-climate-change\">ACCTS</url> trade deal with Costa Rica, Fiji, Iceland, Norway and Switzerland.</p><p>In today's world, talk is cheap, trust is in short supply, and time is running out. You can put all the fine principles you like in deals, but without means for control, monitoring, enforcement or legal consequences for a failure to comply, they aren't worth a thing. These are a prerequisite to climate justice and a just transition.</p><p>Peer through the smokescreen of rhetoric, and you will see that the EU hasn't changed its harmful approach to trade at all. Its focus remains on seeking ever greater market share for its products and services while offering crumbs in return. If it were serious about making trade sustainable, environmental principles and social conventions would be in the DNA that runs through trade agreements. But these are largely absent from the main text of agreements - instead being confined to non-binding and vague \"trade and sustainable development chapters\", which are bolted on as an afterthought.</p><p>Finally, it is hard to believe, but despite sometimes taking place over decades and with so much at stake for all citizens, the EU's trade talks are effectively held in secret. There's no real mechanism to involve stakeholders and civil society in checking progress and understanding whether or not the green rhetoric is being applied.</p><p>Unless that rapidly changes, we'll all be none-the-wiser until it is too late and we are presented with another greenwashed done deal. This is how the EU's leaders will trade away our future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">[Edited by Alice Taylor]</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EURCOM-1663627</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EURCOM2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63X1-B3D1-DYXB-V07K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">398161</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"769\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Acteurs d'Europe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>EurActiv.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33808\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 22, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletter</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newsletters</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Green trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>sustainable trade</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00090NW</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000988Z</classCode><className>FREE TRADE TREATIES &amp;

After a huddle between the envoys from China, India, the United States and European Union, the clause was hurriedly amended to ask countries to \"phase down\" their coal use.</p><p>India's environment and climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, said the revision reflected the \"national circumstances of emerging economies.\"</p><p>\"We are becoming the voice of the developing countries,\" he told Reuters, saying the pact had \"singled out\" coal but kept quiet about oil and natural gas.</p><p>\"We made our effort to make a consensus that is reasonable for developing countries and reasonable for climate justice,\" he said, alluding to the fact that rich nations historically have emitted the largest share of greenhouse gases.</p><p>The single-word change was met with dismay by both rich countries in Europe and small island nations along with others still developing.</p><p>\"We believe we have been side-lined in a non-transparent and non-inclusive process,\" Mexico's envoy Camila Isabel Zepeda Lizama said. \"We all have remaining concerns but were told we could not reopen the text ... while others can still ask to water down their promises.\"</p><p>But Mexico and others said they would let the revised agreement stand.</p><p>\"The approved texts are a compromise,\" said UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. \"They reflect the interests, the conditions, the contradictions and the state of political will in the world today.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">C</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">arbon market breaktrough </emphasis></p><p>Reaching a deal was always a matter of balancing the demands of climate-vulnerable nations, big industrial powers, and those like India and China depending on fossil fuels to lift their economies and populations out of poverty.</p><p>Sharma's voice broke with emotion in response to vulnerable nations' expressing anger over the last-minute changes.</p><p>\"I apologise for the way this process has unfolded,\" he told the assembly. \"I am deeply sorry.\"</p><p>The overarching aim he had set for the conference was one that climate campaigners and vulnerable countries said was too modest - to \"keep alive\" the 2015 Paris Agreement's target to keep global temperatures from rising beyond 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. Scientists say warming beyond this point could unleash irreversible and uncontrollable climate impacts.</p><p>In asking nations to set tougher targets by next year for cutting climate-warming emissions, the agreement effectively acknowledged that commitments were still inadequate. National pledges currently have the world on track for about 2.4C of warming.</p><p>The talks also led to a breakthrough in resolving rules for covering government-led markets for carbon offsets. Companies and countries with vast forest cover had pushed hard for a deal, in hopes also of legitimising the fast-growing global voluntary offset markets.</p><p>The deal allows countries to partially meet their climate targets by buying offset credits representing emission cuts by others, potentially unlocks trillions of dollars for protecting forests, expanding renewable energy and other projects to combat climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'T</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">he era of coal is ending'</emphasis></p><p>Jennifer Morgan, executive director of the campaign group Greenpeace, saw the glass as half-full.</p><p>\"They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP, that the era of coal is ending,\" she said. \"If you're a coal company executive, this COP saw a bad outcome.\"</p><p>Developing countries argue rich nations, whose historical emissions are largely responsible for warming the planet, must finance their efforts both to transition away from fossil fuels and to adapt to increasingly severe climate impacts.</p><p>The deal offered a promise to double adaptation finance by 2025 from 2019, but again no guarantees. A UN committee will report next year on progress towards delivering the $100 billion per year in promised climate funding, after rich nations failed to deliver on a 2020 deadline for the funds. Finance will then be discussed again 2024 and 2026.</p><p>But the deal left many vulnerable nations despondent in offering no funding for climate-linked losses and damages, a promise made in the original pact called the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992.</p><p>Rich nations once again resisted acknowledging financial liability for their years of emissions that drove climate change as they rose to economic prosperity.</p><p>While Glasgow agreement laid out a pathway for addressing the issue by establishing a new secretariat dedicated to the issue, vulnerable countries said that represented a bare minimum of acceptability.</p><p>\"This package is not perfect. The coal change and a weak outcome on loss and damage are blows,\" said Tina Stee, climate envoy from the Marshall Islands. Still, \"elements of the Glasgow Package are a lifeline for my country.
