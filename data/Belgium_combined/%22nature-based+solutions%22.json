The analysis reveals that the EU made little progress in the last year to achieve the necessary targets outlined in the Blue Manifesto. </p><p><br/>Out of eight policy milestones due for achievement by the end of 2021, only one was fully met, three milestones were not met, two were only partly delivered and two others had insufficient progress to establish a score. Worse, three 2020 milestones were downgraded in light of further policy developments in 2021, making the revised overall outcome for 2020 more negative than initially reported(3). Scarce political ambition and delays in the policy process - partly due to the Covid-19 pandemic - were found to be the key reasons for poor progress. <br/>Examples: <br/>The legislation adopted by the EU to prevent plastic pollution set out an encouraging path to transition away from single-use plastics. But the milestone has not been fully met. In fact, Member States only did the bare minimum during the transposition into national legislation, deflating the ambition of the original policy. Moreover, the overall process was also delayed.Along the same line, bycatch of sensitive species remains mostly unaddressed. Whereas some progress was made to protect the Baltic harbour porpoise, overall measures are not yet sufficient to protect sensitive species from unnecessary deaths.While the Council of the EU is seeking to significantly weaken the ambition of the EU Fisheries Control regulation, the EU has also failed to ensure full compliance of the fishing sector with fisheries and nature laws. <br/>'Despite the poor performance scored for two years in a row towards the goal of making the ocean healthy by 2030, the EU can still make up for lost time by stepping up in the eight coming years. The EU faces a challenge where failure is not an option. The ocean supports all life on Earth. And there is no Ocean B,' said Adam Weiss, Head of ClientEarth Ocean programme. He added: 'We call on the European Commission to seize the opportunity to restore and protect our seas and ocean, by keeping ambition high in the upcoming Nature Restoration Law.' <br/>In light of the findings and in anticipation of the upcoming EU Nature Restoration Law, due to be published on June 22, the NGOs behind the analysis - Birdlife Europe &amp; Central Asia, ClientEarth, Oceana, Seas at Risk, Surfrider Foundation Europe and WWF - call on EU decision makers to commit to restore and protect the ocean. <br/>Speaking before the event, Grace O'Sullivan, Member of the European Parliament (Greens), said: \"We are running out of time to turn the tide on ocean degradation. 2022 could be a pivotal moment for ocean conservation and restoration. We need to be ambitious and bring the ocean to the core of the political agenda, following through on the promises of the European Green Deal, while also being effective in implementing the legislation that already exists. Member States must be held to account over their failure to act on the climate and biodiversity crises, before it is too late.\" <br/>Alexandra Cousteau, senior advisor, Oceana and co-founder, Oceans 2050 said: 'Despite a 6-fold increase in the Natura 2000 surface at sea in the last 20 years, most threatened marine habitats and species in the EU remain in poor conservation status. This, along with the climate crisis, require urgent action. The European Commission proposal later this month that will put forward legally-binding targets to restore biodiversity and degraded ecosystems must be ambitious enough to offer the much-needed nature-based solutions to both help reverse this biodiversity loss and contribute to mitigating climate change.\" <br/>Barbara Rodenburg-Geertsema, small-scale fisher, Goede vissers said: \"Good policy-making starts with respect for our seas, as part of the planet that bares us and nourishes us, together with all other living beings.

It is estimated to account for about half of the 1.0 degree Celsius rise in global temperatures that has already occurred since the pre-industrial era. <br/><br/>Last week, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said that 70 percent of methane emissions from gas and oil operations can beeasily prevented[3].[4] <br/><br/>\"The solutions are proven and even profitable in many cases,\" IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said at the time <br/><br/>Delivering on this global pledge could buy the planet some time, since it is estimated to reduce global warming by 0.2 degrees by 2050. <br/><br/>However, according to Inger Andersen from the UN environment programme, countries should not consider it as \"a get-out-of-jail-free card\" to tackle the climate crisis. <br/><br/>\"It is important that we swiftly decarbonise our energy systems, that action on methane should be seen as complementary in the short term to the global efforts on CO2\" in order to achieve the 2015 Paris Agreement targets, Andersen said. <br/><br/>This partnership now covers nine of the world's top 20 methane emitters, representing about 30 percent of global methane emissions and 60 percent of the global economy. <br/><br/>But both the EU and the US hope more countries will support this initiative, when it is formally launched in Glasgow. <br/><br/>\"The pledge's supporters are putting methane squarely on the COP26 agenda, where it belongs, and every country in the world should follow their lead and join the pledge immediately,\" said Sarah Smith from Boston-based NGO Clean Air Task Force. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of 20 philanthropists has announced \u20ac170m to implement the global pledge. <br/><br/>EU imports methane emissions <br/><br/>Over the last three decades, the European Union has reduced methane emissions from landfill almost by half and fossil fuels by almost 65 percent, EU climate chief Frans Timmermans told his counterparts. <br/><br/>\"But the large part of methane emissions associated with the European economy are not happening within our borders. Instead, they take place during the productions and transportation of fossil fuels that we import into the EU,\" he added. <br/><br/>The EU produces some five percent of global methane emissions internally, butit is the world's largest importer of gas and oil.[5] <br/><br/>As a result, the European Commission is expected to put forward a legislative proposal by the end of the year to reduce methane emissions across the whole energy supply chain in the EU and in primary export countries - includingbinding rules[6]on monitoring, reporting, leak detection and repair in the energy sector. <br/><br/>Within the EU, more than half of man-made methane emissions comes from agriculture (53 percent), followed by waste (26%) and energy (19%). <br/><br/>In the agriculture sector, the EU will promote research on innovative methane reducing technologies and nature-based solutions. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://euobserver.com/search?query=%22Elena+S%C3%A1nchez+Nicol%C3%A1s%22\">https://euobserver.com/search?query=%22Elena+S%C3%A1nchez+Nicol%C3%A1s%22</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://euobserver.com/climate/152265\">https://euobserver.com/climate/152265</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/curtailing-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuel-operations\">https://www.iea.org/reports/curtailing-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuel-operations</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/curtailing-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuel-operations\">https://www.iea.org/reports/curtailing-methane-emissions-from-fossil-fuel-operations</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://euobserver.com/opinion/147036\">https://euobserver.com/opinion/147036</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://euobserver.com/environment/149758\">https://euobserver.com/environment/149758</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["\"But the large part of methane emissions associated with the European economy are not happening within our borders.

They say that the EU must remain a world leader in the fight against climate change and that MEPs will work to ensure that the EU's 'Fit for 55 in 2030' climate package is fully in line with the Paris Agreement. <br/><br/>To accelerate the pace of climate action, MEPs wants the EU to support a five-year timeframe for all countries instead of the current ten-year plan. They also say that all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies should be phased out in the EU by 2025 and call on all other countries to take similar measures. <br/><br/>MEPs recall that biodiversity plays a crucial role in enabling humans to combat and adapt to global warming and stress that nature-based solutions are win-win solutions, ones which involve protecting, restoring and sustainably managing ecosystems. <br/><br/>G20 must lead the way <br/><br/>MEPs say that all G20 nations[1] should show global leadership and commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. They also call on the Commission to create an international climate club with other major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters with the aim of setting common standards and raising ambition across the globe through a common carbon border adjustment mechanism[2]. <br/><br/>They welcome the return of the US to the Paris Agreement and President Biden's commitment to cut US GHG emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005. MEPs expect concrete policy measures and financing to meet this goal. <br/><br/>While MEPs acknowledge China's willingness to be a constructive partner in global climate negotiations, it is concerned with the country's dependency on coal and underlines that China's climate targets should cover all GHG emissions and not only carbon dioxide emissions. <br/><br/>More financial support to fight climate change <br/><br/>MEPs say that developed countries must deliver on their promise to raise at least $100bn in climate finance per year for developing countries, increasing that amount from 2025, when emerging economies should also start to contribute. A roadmap outlining each developed country's fair contribution to this financing plan should be agreed. They also want to ensure that all developing countries can participate in COP26 in spite of COVID-19. <br/><br/>Next steps <br/><br/>The resolution will be voted by all MEPs during the plenary session 18-21 October. <br/><br/>A delegation[3] from Parliament led by Pascal Canfin[4] (Renew, FR) will be in Glasgow from 8-13 November. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>Parliament has been pushing for more ambitious EU climate and biodiversity legislation and declared a climate emergency[5] on 28 November 2019. In June 2021, the European Climate Law[6] was adopted by Parliament. It transforms the European Green Deal[7]'s political commitment to EU climate neutrality by 2050 into a binding obligation for the EU and member states. It also increases the EU's target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 level. In July 2021, the Commission presented the 'Fit for 55 in 2030' package[8] in order to enable the EU to reach the more ambitious 2030-target. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.g20.org/about-the-g20.html\">https://www.g20.org/about-the-g20.html</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210304IPR99208/meps-put-a-carbon-price-on-certain-eu-imports-to-raise-global-climate-ambition\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210304IPR99208/meps-put-a-carbon-price-on-certain-eu-imports-to-raise-global-climate-ambition</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20211011RES14630/20211011RES14630.pdf\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/resources/library/media/20211011RES14630/20211011RES14630.pdf</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96711/PASCAL_CANFIN/home\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/meps/en/96711/PASCAL_CANFIN/home</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20191121IPR67110/the-european-parliament-declares-climate-emergency\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20191121IPR67110/the-european-parliament-declares-climate-emergency</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210621IPR06627/eu-climate-law-meps-confirm-deal-on-climate-neutrality-by-2050\">https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20210621IPR06627/eu-climate-law-meps-confirm-deal-on-climate-neutrality-by-2050</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_3541</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Ahead of the UN COP26 Climate Change Conference in Glasgow from 31 October to 12 November 2021, on Tuesday the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee has adopted its input to the COP26, with 60 votes for, 15 votes against and three abstentions. In their resolution, MEPs express concern that the targets announced in Paris in 2015 would result in warming well above three degrees by 2100 compared to pre-industrial levels. They say that the EU must remain a world leader in the fight against climate change and that MEPs will work to ensure that the EU's 'Fit for 55 in 2030' climate package is fully in line with the Paris Agreement. To accelerate the pace of climate action, MEPs wants the EU to support a five-year timeframe for all countries instead of the current ten-year plan. They also say that all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies should be phased out in the EU by 2025 and call on all other countries to take similar measures. MEPs recall that biodiversity plays a crucial role in enabling humans to combat and adapt to global warming and stress that nature-based solutions are win-win solutions, ones which involve protecting, restoring and sustainably managing ecosystems. G20 must lead the way MEPs say that all G20 nations[1] should show global leadership and commit to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. They also call on the Commission to create an international climate club with other major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters with the aim of setting common standards and raising ambition across the globe through a common carbon border adjustment mechanism[2]. They welcome the return of the US to the Paris Agreement and President Biden's commitment to cut US GHG emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005. MEPs expect concrete policy measures and financing to meet this goal. While MEPs acknowledge China's willingness to be a constructive partner in global climate negotiations, it is concerned with the country's dependency on coal and underlines that China's climate targets should cover all GHG emissions and not only carbon dioxide emissions."]}, {"relevance_score": 24, "title": "Commission launches Knowledge Centre to reverse biodiversity loss and protect Europe's ecosystems", "published": "2020-10-23", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Oct 23, 2020( EU Reporter: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eureporter.co\">http://www.eureporter.co</url> Delivered by Newstex)  In the framework of the EU Green Week[1],the European Commission launches a newKnowledge Centre for Biodiversity[2]: a one-stop shop for science-based evidence to restore and protect the natural ecosystems that provide us with food, medicines, materials, recreation, and wellbeing.

Methane is the second biggest contributor to climate change, after carbon dioxide. It is also a potent local air pollutant causing serious health problems. </p><p>Tackling methane emissions is therefore essential to reaching our 2030 climate targets and the 2050 climate neutrality goal, as well as contributing to the Commission's zero-pollution ambition.  This strategy sets out measures to cut methane emissions in Europe and internationally. It presents legislative and non-legislative actions in the energy, agriculture and waste sectors, which account for around 95% of methane emissions associated with human activity worldwide. The Commission will work with the EU's international partners and with industry to achieve emission reductions along the supply chain. Executive Vice President for the Green Deal Frans Timmermans said: 'To become the first climate neutral continent, the European Union will have to cut all greenhouse gases. Methane is the second most powerful greenhouse gas and an important cause of air pollution. Our methane strategy ensures emissions cuts in all sectors, especially agriculture, energy, and waste. It also creates opportunities for rural areas to produce biogas from waste. The European Union's satellite technology will enable us to closely monitor emissions and help raise international standards.' Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said: 'We have adopted today our first strategy to tackle methane emissions since 1996. While the energy, agriculture and waste sectors all have a role to play, energy is where emissions can be cut the quickest with least costs. Europe will lead the way, but we cannot do this alone. We need to work with our international partners to address the methane emissions of the energy we import.' One of the priorities under the strategy is to improve measurement and reporting of methane emissions. The level of monitoring currently varies between sectors and member states and across the international community. In addition to EU-level measures to step up measurement, verification and reporting standards, the Commission will support the establishment of an international methane emission observatory in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme, the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and the International Energy Agency. The EU's Copernicus satellite programme will also improve surveillance and help to detect global super-emitters and identify major methane leaks. To reduce methane emissions in the energy sector, an obligation to improve detection and repair of leaks in gas infrastructure will be proposed and legislation to prohibit routine flaring and venting practices will be considered. The Commission will engage in a dialogue with its international partners and explore possible standards, targets or incentives for energy imports to the EU, and the tools for enforcing them. The Commission will improve reporting of emissions from agriculture through better data collection, and promote opportunities to reduce emissions with support from the Common Agricultural Policy. The main focus will be on best practice sharing for innovative methane-reducing technologies, animal diets, and breeding management. Targeted research on technology, nature based solutions and dietary shift will also contribute. Non-recyclable organic human and agricultural waste and residue streams can be utilized to produce biogas, bio-materials and bio-chemicals. This can generate additional revenue streams in rural areas and avoid methane emissions at the same time. The collection of these waste products will therefore be further incentivized. In the waste sector, the Commission will consider further action to improve the management of landfill gas, harnessing its potential for energy use while reducing emissions, and will review the relevant legislation on landfill in 2024. Minimizing the disposal of biodegradable waste in landfills is crucial to avoid methane formation. The Commission will also consider proposing further research on waste to biomethane technologies. The Commission will also review the Effort Sharing Regulation and will consider expanding the scope of the Industrial Emissions Directive to cover methane emitting sectors not yet included in its scope. Background  On a molecular level, methane is more powerful than carbon dioxide. It contributes to tropospheric ozone formation, and is a potent local air pollutant which causes serious health problems. At the end of its lifecycle, methane is transformed into carbon dioxide and water vapour, contributing further to climate change. Reducing methane emissions therefore contributes to both slowing down climate change and improving air quality. The Impact Assessment for the EU's 2030 Climate Target Plan concluded that stepping up the level of ambition for reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions to at least 55% by 2030 would require an accelerated effort to tackle methane emissions. While the EU produces 5% of global methane emissions domestically, it will encourage international action as the largest global importer of energy and as a strong player in the agriculture and waste sectors. </p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 88, "title": "The important role carbon compensation plays in transitioning to a carbon free society", "published": "2021-12-02", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dec 02, 2021( EU Reporter: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eureporter.co\">http://www.eureporter.co</url> Delivered by Newstex)  <br/> A carbon credit is a certificate representing one metric ton of carbon dioxide equivalent that is either avoided from being emitted into the atmosphere (emissions avoidance/ reduction) or removed from the atmosphere. For a carbon-reduction project to generate carbon credits, it needs to demonstrate that the achieved emission reductions or carbon dioxide removals are real, measurable, permanent, additional, independently verified, and unique, writes Tiago Alves and Silvia Andrade of Reflora Initiative, Portugal. </p><p><br/><br/>Voluntary carbon offsets enable those in unregulated sectors or countries to offset their emissions by buying these carbon credits. This situation applies to those agents that are not under a legal mechanism, allowing the possibility of broad participation. Thus, Voluntary carbon offsets have an important role in the achievement of the different global efforts to achieve net-zero emissions since it involves a variety of participants through the implementation of different kinds of projects. The proceeds from the sale of voluntary carbon credits enable the development of carbon-reduction projects across a wide array of project types. These include renewable energy, avoiding emissions from fossil-fuel- based alternatives, natural climate solutions, such as reforestation, avoided deforestation, energy efficiency, and resource recovery, such as avoiding methane emissions from landfills or wastewater facilities, among others. <br/><br/>Today it represents an incredibly dynamic market that can be part of the solution to the climate crisis because of their economic and environmental efficiency. According to Portuguese based company Reflora Initiative the success of carbon markets depends on guaranteeing the quality of carbon projects by measuring the co- benefits delivered and making sure that every carbon credit sold brings real impact. Especially for voluntary carbon markets, this system also enables companies to gain experience with carbon inventories, emissions reductions, and carbon markets. Consequently, this mechanism may facilitate future participation in a regulated system. <br/><br/>Even though it is important the role that voluntary carbon markets have in contributing to the global effort to achieve net-zero emissions, it is also crucial to establish under what regulations this mechanism should work. For instance, the Science-Based Targets argues that the companies' net-zero targets will require long-term deep decarbonization targets of 90-95% across all scopes before 2050. They also argue that when a company reaches its net-zero target, only a very limited amount of residual emissions can be neutralized with high-quality carbon removals, this will be no more than 5-10%. Therefore, under the definition of net-zero emissions made by SBT, the voluntary carbon offsets should be applied to the amount of residual emissions for each company. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there are also some advances related to article 6 that is part of the Paris Agreement. After five years of negotiations, the world's governments settled on the rules for the global carbon market. Negotiators agreed to avoid double-counting in order to prevent that more than one country could claim the same emissions reductions as counting toward their own climate commitments. It is considered that this is critical to make real progress on reducing emissions. Additionally, this mechanism is also a potential tool for the execution of net-zero pledges in companies. <br/><br/>In addition to the Voluntary carbon markets, there are also the Compliance Markets which are created and regulated by mandatory regional, national, and international carbon reduction regimes, such as the Kyoto Protocol and the European Union's Emissions Trading Scheme. Each of the participants within a cap-and-trade system (usually countries, regions, or industries) is allocated a certain number of allowances based on an emissions reduction target. These allowances are then neither created nor removed, but merely traded among participants. <br/><br/><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Webp.net-compress-image-2.jpg\">https://www.eureporter.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Webp.net-compress-image-2.jpg</url><br/><br/> Given the regulatory framework that a cap-and-trade system has, its mechanism is influenced by policy diffusion. One of the main distinctions with the voluntary carbon market is that this market does not need this policy diffusion. Therefore, companies could execute their climate goals in a faster manner since they do not depend on this compliance framework. Moreover, it is considered that this specific framework by having a cap-and-trade system could limit the emissions that can be offset, which could affect the natural development of the carbon market. <br/><br/>Additionally, the compliance framework has different mechanisms depending on each country. For example, the systems in South Korea and Tokyo stand out as the only ones with specific sectoral caps. Some systems seem to rely heavily on emissions trading to achieve reductions. Other systems include looser references to contributing to overall GHG emissions reductions in the jurisdiction target. In contrast, Voluntary carbon credits have also an important role in democratizing carbon compensation since any company or individual on a voluntary basis could compensate for their emissions. Therefore, even though voluntary carbon markets have a lack of standardized requirements, there is more consistency in terms of the supply/demand forces in this market which could, in turn, help the transition to a decarbonized society. <br/><br/>The Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets (TSVCM) estimates that demand for carbon credits could increase by a factor of 15 or more by 2030 and by a factor of up to 100 by 2050. Overall, the market for carbon credits could be worth upward of $50 billion in 2030. Based on stated demand for carbon credits, demand projections from experts surveyed by the TSVCM, and the volume of negative emissions needed to reduce emissions in line with the 1.5-degree warming goal, McKinsey estimates that annual global demand for carbon credits could reach up to 1.5 to 2.0 gigatons of carbon dioxide (GtCO2) by 2030 and up to 7 to 13 GtCO2 by 2050. Therefore, it is considered that there is still a significant potential in the development of the carbon markets, especially leading by companies that need to offset their emissions. <br/><br/>In terms of Nature-Based Solutions or Nature Climate solutions, several actors argue that any credible pathway to net-zero must include ending deforestation and the degradation of natural ecosystems plus reducing emissions associated with agricultural production and food systems. Reflora Initiative is one of those companies focusing its carbon offsetting services on natural climate solutions and making sure that carbon projects are coupled with co-benefits, such as biodiversity conservation and enhancement, freshwater regulation, and social and economic support to rural and indigenous communities. For instance, a significant proportion of the voluntary market is based on projects in tropical developing nations. it is also considered that NCS also supports both adaptation to climate change and mitigation of emissions. For example, agroforestry systems can create more resilient farming economies, while restoration projects can reduce the impacts of intense rainfall events and floods. <br/><br/>To sum up, there is still a considerable potential for Carbon Credits Markets, specifically for Voluntary Carbon Credits. Companies' Net-zero Targets will need these offsetting tools in order to achieve their decarbonisation goals. Additionally, it also gives the option to individuals to compensate for their emissions. On the other hand, the role of NCS projects is key to remove emissions in the atmosphere, while their co-benefits are generating impacts not only to the biodiversity but also to support rural and indigenous communities. <br/><br/>References <br/><br/> Stockholm Environment Institute.

Therefore, it is considered that there is still a significant potential in the development of the carbon markets, especially leading by companies that need to offset their emissions. In terms of Nature-Based Solutions or Nature Climate solutions, several actors argue that any credible pathway to net-zero must include ending deforestation and the degradation of natural ecosystems plus reducing emissions associated with agricultural production and food systems. Reflora Initiative is one of those companies focusing its carbon offsetting services on natural climate solutions and making sure that carbon projects are coupled with co-benefits, such as biodiversity conservation and enhancement, freshwater regulation, and social and economic support to rural and indigenous communities. For instance, a significant proportion of the voluntary market is based on projects in tropical developing nations. it is also considered that NCS also supports both adaptation to climate change and mitigation of emissions. For example, agroforestry systems can create more resilient farming economies, while restoration projects can reduce the impacts of intense rainfall events and floods. To sum up, there is still a considerable potential for Carbon Credits Markets, specifically for Voluntary Carbon Credits."]}, {"relevance_score": 64, "title": "Building a Climate-Resilient Future - A new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change", "published": "2021-02-26", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Feb 26, 2021( EU Reporter: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.eureporter.co\">http://www.eureporter.co</url> Delivered by Newstex)  The European Commission has adopted a new EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change, setting out the pathway to prepare for the unavoidable impacts of climate change. While the EU does everything within its power to mitigate climate change, domestically and internationally, we must also get ready to face its unavoidable consequences. From deadly heatwaves and devastating droughts, to decimated forests and coastlines eroded by rising sea levels, climate change is already taking its toll in Europe and worldwide. </p><p>Building on the 2013 Climate Change Adaptation Strategy, the aim of today's proposals is to shift the focus from understanding the problem to developing solutions, and to move from planning to implementation.European Green Deal Executive Vice President Frans Timmermans said: 'The COVID-19 pandemic has been a stark reminder that insufficient preparation can have dire consequences. There is no vaccine against the climate crisis, but we can still fight it and prepare for its unavoidable effects. The impacts of climate change are already felt both inside and outside the European Union. The new climate adaptation strategy equips us to speed up and deepen preparations. If we get ready today, we can still build a climate-resilient tomorrow.'Economic losses from more frequent climate-related extreme weather are increasing. In the EU, these losses alone already average over  12 billion per year. Conservative estimates show that exposing today's EU economy to global warming of 3C above pre-industrial levels would result in an annual loss of at least  170 billion. Climate change affects not only the economy, but also the health and well-being of Europeans, who increasingly suffer from heat waves; the deadliest natural disaster of 2019 worldwide was the European heatwave, with 2500 deaths.Our action on climate change adaptation must involve all parts of society and all levels of governance, inside and outside the EU. We will work to build a climate resilient society by improving knowledge of climate impacts and adaptation solutions; by stepping up adaptation planning and climate risk assessments; by accelerating adaptation action; and by helping to strengthen climate resilience globally.Smarter, swifter, and more systemic adaptationAdaptation actions must be informed by robust data and risk assessment tools that are available to all - from families buying, building and renovating homes to businesses in coastal regions or farmers planning their crops. To achieve this, the strategy proposes actions that push the frontiers of knowledge on adaptation so that we can gather more and better data on climate-related risks and losses, making them available to all. Climate-ADAPT[1], the European platform for adaptation knowledge, will be enhanced and expanded, and a dedicated health observatory will be added to better track, analyse and prevent health impacts of climate change.Climate change has impacts at all levels of society and across all sectors of the economy, so adaptation actions must be systemic. The Commission will continue to incorporate climate resilience considerations in all relevant policy fields. It will support the further development and implementation of adaptation strategies and plans with three cross cutting priorities: integrating adaptation into macro-fiscal policy, nature-based solutions for adaptation, and local adaptation action.Stepping up international actionOur climate change adaptation policies must match our global leadership in climate change mitigation. The Paris Agreement established a global goal on adaptation and highlighted adaptation as a key contributor to sustainable development. The EU will promote sub-national, national and regional approaches to adaptation, with a specific focus on adaptation in Africa and Small Island Developing States. We will increase support for international climate resilience and preparedness through the provision of resources, by prioritizing action and increasing effectiveness, through the scaling up of international finance and through stronger global engagement and exchanges on adaptation. We will also work with international partners to close the gap in international climate finance.BackgroundClimate change is happening today, so we have to build a more resilient tomorrow. The world has just concluded the hottest decade on record during which the title for the hottest year was beaten eight times. The frequency and severity of climate and weather extremes is increasing. These extremes range from unprecedented forest fires and heatwaves right above the Arctic Circle to devastating droughts in the Mediterranean region, and from hurricanes ravaging EU outermost regions to forests decimated by unprecedented bark beetle outbreaks in Central and Eastern Europe. Slow onset events, such as desertification, loss of biodiversity, land and ecosystem degradation, ocean acidification or sea level rise are equally destructive over the long term.The European Commission announced this new, more ambitious EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in the Communication on the European Green Deal[2], following a 2018 evaluation of the 2013 Strategy[3] and an open public consultation[4] between May and August 2020. The European Climate Law proposal[5] provides the foundation for increased ambition and policy coherence on adaptation. It integrates the global goal on adaptation in Article 7 of the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goal 13 action into EU law. The proposal commits the EU and Member States to make continuous progress to boost adaptive capacity, strengthen resilience and reduce vulnerability to climate change. The new adaptation strategy will help make this progress a reality.More information2021 EU Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change[6]Questions and Answers[7]Adaptation to climate change website[8]European Green Deal[9]Video stockshots on adaptation to climate change[10] [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\">https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu</url>/ [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:738:FIN\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2018:738:FIN</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-launches-online-public-consultation-new-eu-strategy-adaptation-climate-change_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/news/commission-launches-online-public-consultation-new-eu-strategy-adaptation-climate-change_en</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588581905912&amp;#38;uri=CELEX:52020PC0080\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1588581905912&amp;#38;uri=CELEX:52020PC0080</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/adaptation/what/docs/eu_strategy_2021.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/adaptation/what/docs/eu_strategy_2021.pdf</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_664\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/qanda_21_664</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu\">https://climate-adapt.eea.europa.eu</url>/ [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-193268\">https://audiovisual.ec.europa.eu/en/video/I-193268</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["Smarter, swifter, and more systemic adaptationAdaptation actions must be informed by robust data and risk assessment tools that are available to all - from families buying, building and renovating homes to businesses in coastal regions or farmers planning their crops.

They say that the EU must remain a world leader in the fight against climate change and that MEPs will work to ensure that the EU's 'Fit for 55 in 2030' climate package is fully in line with the Paris Agreement[1]. <br/><br/>To accelerate the pace of climate action, MEPs want the EU to replace the current 10-year plan with a five-year timeframe for all countries. They also say that all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies should be phased out in the EU by 2025 and call on all other countries to take similar measures. <br/><br/>MEPs recall that biodiversity plays a crucial role in enabling humans to combat and adapt to global warming and stress that nature-based solutions are win-win solutions, ones which involve protecting, restoring and sustainably managing fragile ecosystems. <br/><br/>G20 must lead the way <br/><br/>All G20 nations[2] should show global leadership and commit to achieving climate neutrality at the latest by 2050, according to MEPs. They also call on the Commission to create an international climate club with other major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters with the aim of setting common standards and raising ambition across the globe, including through a common carbon border adjustment mechanism[3]. <br/><br/>They welcome the return of the US to the Paris Agreement and President Biden's commitment to cut US GHG emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005. MEPs expect concrete policy measures and financing to meet this goal. <br/><br/>While MEPs acknowledge China's willingness to be a constructive partner in global climate negotiations, they are concerned with the country's dependency on coal. They underline their position that China should increase its ambition and that its climate targets should cover all GHG emissions and not only carbon dioxide emissions. <br/><br/>More climate finance to developing countries <br/><br/>MEPs say that developed countries must deliver on their promise to raise at least $100bn in climate finance per year for developing countries, increasing that amount from 2025, when emerging economies should also start to contribute. A roadmap outlining each developed country's fair contribution to this financing plan should be agreed. They also want to ensure that all developing countries can participate in COP26 despite COVID-19 restrictions. <br/><br/>Next steps <br/><br/>A delegation[4] from Parliament led by Pascal Canfin[5] (Renew, FR) will be in Glasgow from 8-13 November. <br/><br/>Background <br/><br/>Parliament has been pushing for more ambitious EU climate and biodiversity legislation and declared a climate emergency[6] on 28 November 2019. In June 2021, the European Climate Law[7] was adopted by Parliament. It transforms the European Green Deal[8]'s political commitment to EU climate neutrality by 2050 into a binding obligation for the EU and member states. It also increases the EU's target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 from 40% to at least 55%, compared to 1990 level. In July 2021, the Commission presented the 'Fit for 55 in 2030' package[9] to enable the EU to reach the more ambitious 2030-target. <br/><br/>More information <br/><br/> Adopted text will be

In the resolution, MEPs express concern that the national targets announced in Paris in 2015 would result in warming well above three degrees by 2100, compared to pre-industrial levels. They say that the EU must remain a world leader in the fight against climate change and that MEPs will work to ensure that the EU's 'Fit for 55 in 2030' climate package is fully in line with the Paris Agreement[1]. To accelerate the pace of climate action, MEPs want the EU to replace the current 10-year plan with a five-year timeframe for all countries. They also say that all direct and indirect fossil fuel subsidies should be phased out in the EU by 2025 and call on all other countries to take similar measures. MEPs recall that biodiversity plays a crucial role in enabling humans to combat and adapt to global warming and stress that nature-based solutions are win-win solutions, ones which involve protecting, restoring and sustainably managing fragile ecosystems. G20 must lead the way All G20 nations[2] should show global leadership and commit to achieving climate neutrality at the latest by 2050, according to MEPs. They also call on the Commission to create an international climate club with other major greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters with the aim of setting common standards and raising ambition across the globe, including through a common carbon border adjustment mechanism[3]. They welcome the return of the US to the Paris Agreement and President Biden's commitment to cut US GHG emissions in half by 2030 compared to 2005. MEPs expect concrete policy measures and financing to meet this goal.

The Commission aims to at leastdouble renovation rates in the next ten years and make sure renovations lead to higher energy and resource efficiency. This will enhance the quality of life for people living in and using the buildings, reduce Europe's greenhouse gas emissions, foster digitalisation and improve the reuse and recycling of materials. By 2030,35 million buildingscould be renovated and up to 160,000 additional green jobs createdin the construction sector.Buildings are responsible for about 40% of the EU's energy consumption, and 36% of greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>But only 1% of buildings undergo energy efficient renovation every year, so effective action iscrucial to making Europe climate-neutral by 2050. With nearly 34 million Europeans unable to afford keeping their homes heated, public policies to promote energy efficient renovation are alsoa response to energy poverty, support the health and wellbeing of people and help reduce their energy bills. The Commission has also published today a Recommendation for member states on tackling energy poverty. European Green Deal Executive Vice-President Frans Timmermanssaid:'We want everyone in Europe to have a home they can light, heat, or cool without breaking the bank or breaking the planet. The Renovation Wave will improve the places where we work, live and study, while reducing our impact on the environment and providing jobs for thousands of Europeans. We need better buildings if we want to build back better.' Energy Commissioner Kadri Simson said:'The green recovery starts at home. With the Renovation Wave we will tackle the many barriers that today make renovation complex, expensive and time consuming, holding back much needed action. We will propose better ways to measure renovation benefits, minimum energy performance standards, more EU funding and technical assistance encourage green mortgages and support more renewables in heating and cooling. This will be a game changer for home-owners, tenants and public authorities.' The strategy will prioritize action in three areas: decarbonization of heating and cooling; tackling energy poverty and worst-performing buildings; and renovation of public buildings such as schools, hospitals and administrative buildings. The Commission proposes to break down existing barriers throughout the renovation chain - from the conception of a project to its funding and completion - with a set of policy measures, funding tools and technical assistance instruments. The strategy will include the following lead actions: Strongerregulations,standards andinformation on the energy performance of buildings to set better incentives for public and private sector renovations, including a phased introduction of mandatory minimum energy performance standards for existing buildings, updated rules for Energy Performance Certificates, and a possible extension of building renovation requirements for the public sector; ensuring accessible and well-targeted funding, including through the 'Renovate' and 'Power Up' Flagships in the Recovery and Resilience Facilityunder NextGenerationEU, simplified rules for combining different funding streams, and multiple incentives for private financing; increasing capacityto prepare and implement renovation projects, from technical assistance to national and local authorities through to training and skills development for workers innew green jobs; expanding the market for sustainable construction products and services, including the integration of new materials and nature-based solutions, and revised legislation on marketing of construction products and material reuse and recovery targets; creating a New European Bauhaus, an interdisciplinary project co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society. From now until summer 2021 the Commission will conduct a broad participatory co-creation process, and will thenset up of a network of five founding Bauhausin 2022 in different EU countries, and; developing neighbourhood-based approachesfor local communities to integrate renewable and digital solutions and create zero-energy districts, where consumers become prosumers selling energy to the grid. The strategy also includes anAffordable Housing Initiativefor 100 districts. The review of the Renewable Energy Directive in June 2021 will consider strengthening the renewable heating and cooling target and introducing a minimum renewable energy level in buildings. The Commission will also examine how the EU budget resources alongside the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) revenues could be used to fund national energy efficiency and savings schemes targeting lower income populations. The Ecodesign Framework will be further developed to provide efficient products for use in buildings and promote their use. The Renovation Wave is not only about making the existing buildings more energy efficient and climate neutral. It can trigger a large-scale transformation of our cities and built environment. It can be an opportunity to start a forward-looking process to match sustainability with style. As announced by President von der Leyen, the Commission will launch the New European Bauhaus to nurture a new European aesthetic that combines performance with inventiveness. We want to make liveable environments accessible to everyone, and again marry the affordable with the artistic, in a newly sustainable future. Background The COVID-19 crisis has turned the spotlight on our buildings, their importance in our daily lives and their fragilities. Throughout the pandemic, the home has been the focal point of daily life for millions of Europeans: an office for those teleworking, a make-shift nursery or classroom for children and pupils, for many a hub for online shopping or entertainment. Investing in buildings can inject a much-needed stimulus into the construction sector and the macro-economy. Renovation works are labour-intensive, create jobs and investments rooted in often local supply chains, generate demand for highly energy-efficient equipment, increase climate resilience and bring long-term value to properties. To achieve the at least 55% emissions reduction target for 2030, proposed by the Commission in September 2020, the EU must reduce buildings' greenhouse gas emissions by 60%, their energy consumption by 14%, and the energy consumption of heating and cooling by 18%. European policy and funding has already had a positive impact on the energy efficiency of new buildings, which now consume only half the energy of those built over 20 years ago. However, 85% of buildings in the EU were built over 20 years ago, and 85-95% are expected to still be standing in 2050. The Renovation Wave is needed to bring them up to similar standards.

In particular, the new Guidelines: </p><p><br/><br/> Broaden the categories of investments and technologies that member states can support to cover new areas (e.g. clean mobility infrastructure, resource efficiency, biodiversity) and all technologies that can deliver the Green Deal (e.g. renewable hydrogen, electricity storage and demand response, decarbonising production processes). The revised rules generally allow for aid amounts covering up to 100% of the funding gap where aid awards are based on competitive bidding, and to introduce new aid instruments such as Contracts for Difference.Increase flexibility and streamline the existing rules, by introducing a simplified assessment of cross-cutting measures under a single section of the Guidelines (for example the section on aid for the reduction and removal of greenhouse gas emissions, including through support for renewable energy and energy efficiency) and eliminating the requirement for individual notifications of large green projects within aid schemes previously approved by the Commission.Introduce safeguards, such as a public consultation requirement above certain thresholds, to ensure that the aid is effectively directed where it is necessary to improve climate and environmental protection, is limited to what is needed to achieve the environmental goals and does not unduly distort competition or the integrity of the Single Market.Ensure coherence with the relevant EU legislation and policies in the environmental and energy fields, among others by phasing out subsidies for fossil fuels. <br/><br/> How will the CEEAG interact with the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER)? <br/><br/>While the CEEAG include some specific rules for small projects, they are generally designed to cover also larger aid measures. They operate alongside the General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER), which provides scope for certain smaller schemes to be implemented without prior approval by the Commission. <br/><br/>The GBER is currently undergoing a targeted revision with the aim to further facilitate green investments by widening its scope to cover aid for investments in new technologies, such as hydrogen and carbon capture and storage or usage, and for areas that are key to achieve the objectives of the Green Deal, like resource efficiency and biodiversity. Moreover, the rules are more flexible with regard to the definition of eligible costs and aid intensities. <br/><br/>How will the CEEAG contribute to the Green Deal / Fit for 55 package? <br/><br/>The CEEAG will help member states meet the European Green Deal objectives, at the least possible cost for taxpayers and without unduly distorting competition. To this end, the Guidelines are aligned with relevant EU legislation and policies in the environmental and energy fields. In particular: <br/><br/> The CEEAG adopt a technology neutral approach to all the technologies that can contribute to the reduction or removal of greenhouse gases, including renewable energy and energy efficiency. However, technology specific tenders remain possible, for example where Union law establishes specific sectoral or technology based targets, e.g. for renewable energy under the Renewable Energy Directive[2].To facilitate the implementation of the Renovation Wave[3], the CEEAG include for the first time a dedicated section on the energy and environmental performance of buildings. This will enable Member States to combine aid for the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings with aid for any other investment that improve the energy or environmental performance of buildings.The CEEAG provide clear rules for support to clean mobility, in line with the Clean Mobility Package[4]. In particular, the Guidelines feature a dedicated section covering aid for the acquisition of clean vehicles and retrofitting of vehicles, as well as for the deployment of recharging and refuelling infrastructure.The CEEAG provide for a broad coverage of and clearer rules for aid to increase the level of resource efficiency of companies, and allow for the development of a more circular economy, in line with the Circular Economy Action Plan[5].In line with the objectives of the Biodiversity Strategy[6], the CEEAG provide clear rules for member states to support the protection and restoration of biodiversity, the rehabilitation of natural ecosystems and the implementation of nature-based solutions, for which so far no specific State aid guidance existed. <br/><br/> What is the link between the CEEAG and Taxonomy? <br/><br/>The CEEAG and the EU Taxonomy are both important pillars of the European Green Deal, fulfilling different but complementary roles: <br/><br/> The CEEAG are the EU rulebook for public support in the energy and environmental sectors, setting out which projects can be supported with public funds and how this support can be provided, while minimising impacts on the market and providing value to European citizens.The EU Taxonomy is a tool developed to enable private investors to re-orient investments towards more sustainable technologies and businesses. It will help make the EU a global leader in setting standards for sustainable finance. The Taxonomy can be a very useful tool in the context of EU State aid assessments. Where measures meet the taxonomy requirements, the State aid assessment can be simplified. In particular, in balancing the positive and negative effects of the aid, the Commission will pay particular attention to compliance with the 'do no significant harm' principle. <br/><br/> However, there are other conditions in competition rules that would still need to be applied to ensure for example that the aid is necessary and proportionate (by way of example, the taxonomy identifies renewable energy as sustainable, and the competition rules then generally require renewable energy to be supported through competitive bidding processes). Support may in some cases also be granted to projects that do not meet the standards laid down in the Taxonomy so long as their positive effects are justified and a lock-in of non-sustainable activities is avoided. <br/><br/>How can the CEEAG contribute to tackling high energy prices? <br/><br/>The current high energy prices in Europe are mostly the result of global supply and demand patterns in the natural gas market, driven in part by the global economic recovery. <br/><br/>On 13 October, the Commission adopted a Communication on 'tackling rising energy prices while delivering the green transition[7]' that describes the main tools for member states to tackle this challenge, and how the Commission can support them in this respect. Following up to the Communication of 13 October, and as requested by member states, in December 2021[8], the Commission proposed toimprove the resilience of the gas system and strengthen the existing security of supply provisions. <br/><br/>The best way to reduce energy costs in the medium and long term is to reduce the EU's dependence on fossil fuel imports, and thus to accelerate the energy transition towards an energy efficient electricity system, based on renewable energy. The CEEAG support this target. For example, the CEEAG cover support measures to help companies quickly adapt and fully participate in the energy transition. This includes for example support for decarbonization measures or increased energy efficiency, reducing the impact of increased electricity or gas prices for undertakings. <br/><br/>Competition law allows a range of measures that member states can take without unduly distorting competition in the market. These include direct support measures to the most vulnerable and energy-poor, such as payments or energy allowances. Moreover, measures of a general nature, equally helping all energy consumers, do not constitute state aid. Such non-selective measures can take the form of general reductions in taxes or levies, a reduced rate to the supply of natural gas, electricity or district heating. <br/><br/>How do the CEEAG foster the development of renewable energy communities and other smaller actors? <br/><br/>Renewable energy communities (REC) and other small actors play an important role in the achievement of the European Green Deal objectives, as also recognised in the recast Renewable Energy Directive[9] (RED II). This is why the CEEAG provides additional flexibility for these actors, allowing member states to exempt renewable energy community projects and SME-owned projects below six Megawatts (MW) of installed capacity from the competitive bidding requirement. Renewable energy communities and small and micro enterprises may also develop wind projects up to 18 MW without competitive bidding. <br/><br/>More generally, where competitive bidding does apply, the CEEAG enable Member States to design tenders in a way which enhances the participation of energy communities, for example by lowering pre-qualification requirements. <br/><br/>SMEs and small mid-caps can also benefit from aid when they provide energy performance improvement measures under energy performance contracts, either for buildings or industrial activities.Furthermore, aid intensities can be increased by 20 percentage points for small undertakings or by 10 percentage points for medium-sized undertakings for a number of aid categories such as aid for energy performance improvements in buildings, aid for the acquisition of zero-emission vehicles and the deployment of recharging and refuelling infrastructure, aid for resources efficiency, aid for the prevention or the reduction of pollution other than from greenhouse gases, and for studies or consultancy services on matters relating to climate, environmental protection and energy. <br/><br/>Why is nuclear energy not covered by the Guidelines? <br/><br/>The CEEAG follow the same line as the previous guidelines (the 2014 Energy and Environmental Aid Guidelines, EEAG) and therefore do not apply to nuclear energy. This is because support for nuclear energy generally concerns a limited number of very large projects, is particularly sensitive from a security perspective, legally needs to take account particularly of the EURATOM treaty, and thus requires a case-by-case assessment. State aid for nuclear energy can, however, be approved directly under the Treaty and the EURATOM Treaty. <br/><br/>While support for nuclear energy is per se not covered by the CEEAG, support for the production of other energy sources based on nuclear, e.g. low-carbon hydrogen produced using nuclear energy, is possible under the Guidelines so long as these projects deliver emissions reductions and do not lead to increased demand for electricity generated from fossil fuels. <br/><br/>Do the CEEAG cover aid for the production of products contributing to the green transition (e.g. zero-emission vehicles, electrolysers, etc.)? <br/><br/>The CEEAG do not cover aid for the manufacturing of environmentally friendly products, machines or means of transport. <br/><br/>As already recognised under the previous guidelines (2014 EEAG), environmental aid is generally less distortive and more effective if it is granted to the consumer or user of environmentally friendly products instead of the producer or manufacturer of the environmentally friendly product. Aiding the producer or manufacturer of the environmentally friendly product does not bring about an environmental benefit in itself; such benefit materializes only if and when such products substitute more polluting alternatives. However, by creating the right enabling conditions for support, the CEEAG are likely to indirectly boost demand for greener products. For example, support for the acquisition of electric vehicles and/or the roll-out of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles are likely to increase the demand for such vehicles in the market. <br/><br/>In addition, Member States may grant environmental aid to companies to enhance the level of environmental protection of their manufacturing activities. Producers and manufacturers can also receive aid for developing novel environmentally friendly products under the research, development and innovation (R&amp;D&amp;I) State aid rules (GBER or R&amp;D&amp;I Framework). <br/><br/>Can fossil fuels be supported under the CEEAG? <br/><br/>The CEEAG ensure coherence with the Union climate targets by contributing to phasing out the possibility of subsidies for fossil fuels. For the most polluting fossil fuels, the guidelines foresee that a positive assessment by the Commission under State aid rules is unlikely in light of their negative environmental effects. <br/><br/>For natural gas, the Commission acknowledges its role in a transitional period. State aid for projects involving natural gas is subject to important safeguards to ensure compatibility with the EU's 2030 and 2050 climate targets. In that context, it is important that support for natural gas does not lead to lock-in effects. For example, large capital investments in a certain polluting technology are unlikely to incentivise the operator to change to a less polluting technology in the short term. Therefore, measures involving new investments in natural gas are unlikely to be assessed positively under state aid rules, unless it can be clearly demonstrated that the investments are compatible with the Union's 2030 and 2050 climate targets. <br/><br/>This requirement is modulated according to types of investment. For example, for natural gas infrastructure, investments will be required to be 'fit for hydrogen' and renewable gases. For energy generation additional commitments may be required (see next question). <br/><br/>How will the Commission assess whether fossil fuel investments are compatible with the 2030 and 2050 climate targets? <br/><br/>The Commission may require commitments to ensure the 'lock in' of fossil fuels is avoided and fossil fuel installations are compatible with the 2030 and 2050 targets. This may include for example commitments related to the future deployment of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), replacing natural gas with green gas, or a closure timeline for the installation. <br/><br/>The CEEAG include safeguards, such as the requirement for public consultation and quantification of the CO2 abatement cost. Why are they necessary? <br/><br/>By ensuring transparency and inclusiveness, these safeguards contribute to ensuring value for money. Such safeguards are also important to ensure that the increased flexibility and amount of aid allowed under the CEEAG is effectively directed where it is needed to improve environmental protection, is limited to what is needed to achieve the environmental goals and does not unduly distort competition or the integrity of the internal market. Moreover, some of the safeguards - for example the public consultation requirement - are applicable only for schemes or projects that exceed a certain budget, to avoid excessive burdens for smaller aid applicants or straightforward measures. The requirement to quantify the environmental benefit of the measure is important to increase awareness of the relative value for money of different approaches to decarbonisation. <br/><br/>Member States will have time to adapt to these new requirements, which will only apply as from July 2023. <br/><br/>How do the CEEAG facilitate the needed electrification of industries? <br/><br/>The Commission is well aware of the challenges facing the industries in meeting the objectives of the Green Deal. That is why the Guidelines increase the possibilities to grant aid for industrial decarbonisation, including through electrification of production processes. The CEEAG foresee additional flexibility for a variety of aid instruments, they enable aid for the full additional costs of more environmentally friendly activities, and they cover a wider range of technologies to achieve the Green Deal objectives. Where electrification is supported, it is however important to ensure that the emissions from electricity used to meet the additional electricity demand are properly taken into account. <br/><br/>In that context, the new rules for reduction of electricity levies (see question further below) seek a balance between supporting the efforts of energy-intensive users to electrify their industrial processes, while making sure that the right incentives to enhance energy efficiency are also in place. <br/><br/>Will technology neutral competitive bidding favour established technologies against innovative ones? <br/><br/>Competitive bidding procedures have helped to lower the price of renewable energy, favouring the uptake of more efficient technologies like wind and solar energy. Moreover, competitive bidding can reduce the risk of overcompensation, thereby also ensuring the best value for money for tax payers. For these reasons, competitive bidding will be the default mechanism under most sections of the CEEAG to award aid. Where possible, open tenders across comparable areas and technologies are encouraged. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the Guidelines also provide an open list of situations justifying technology specific tenders. These include grid issues, the demonstrated long-term potential of a technology, cost efficiency, and other environmental objectives. Furthermore, in cases, where Union law establishes specific sectoral or technology based targets (e.g. for energy efficiency under the Energy Efficiency Directive or for renewables under the Renewable Energy Directive) or where new technologies need to be demonstrated, the CEEAG offer member states flexibility to design more targeted measures. <br/><br/>What is the 'funding gap'? <br/><br/>The funding gap corresponds to the difference between the costs and revenues of an activity that contributes to the achievement of higher climate, energy or environmental standards compared to the costs and revenues of a similar, less environmentally friendly activity that would be carried out in the absence of aid. Therefore, the funding gap identifies the minimum aid necessary to incentivise the aided activity. <br/><br/>Specific sections/areas of the Guidelines <br/><br/>Renewable energy sources <br/><br/>How do the CEEAG support the deployment of renewables? <br/><br/>Renewable energy remains as important as ever to reach the EU's ambitious climate targets. To enable Member States to support all technologies and approaches that can contribute to the Green Deal, and to ensure the Guidelines are as future proof as possible, the new Guidelines include provisions explicitly covering support for renewable energy. Member States can deploy specific renewable schemes to contribute to the EU's renewable energy targets and support specific renewable technologies where this achieves lower costs or other efficiency or environmental benefits. <br/><br/>Energy and environmental performance of buildings <br/><br/>How do the CEEAG facilitate support energy efficiency of buildings? <br/><br/>The CEEAG include a dedicated section on the energy and environmental performance of buildings, which introduces a simplified assessment, in particular as regards the determination of the eligible costs. Furthermore, the CEEAG enable member states to combine aid for the improvement of the energy efficiency of buildings with aid for any other investments that improve their energy or environmental performance, provided that the aid induces a minimum level of energy savings. Moreover, aid measures that induce ambitious energy savings are eligible for a green bonus. Finally, the section contains specific rules on liquidity aid to Energy Service Companies (ESCOs) for the facilitation of energy performance contracting. <br/><br/>Clean mobility <br/><br/>What do the CEEAG say on clean mobility? <br/><br/>State aid for the acquisition of new transport vehicles and for the retrofitting of vehicles could already be approved under the previous Guidelines (2014 EEAG). The CEEAG introduces four new elements: <br/><br/> Stricter requirements for vehicles to be considered as 'clean'. Aid will no longer be available for marginal improvements in the level of emissions of CO2 or other pollutants.Detailed guidance to member states to help them design their support measures and thereby facilitate the uptake of zero and low-emission vehicles and the roll-out of the necessary infrastructure for their operation. The new rules also clarify that aid can be granted for the greening of all transport modes, including aviation, and provide dedicated provisions catering for the specific characteristics of the different transport modes.Increased flexibility for member states to determine the eligible costs and the amount of support that is necessary.Broader scope, with a new section on aid for the deployment of recharging and refuelling infrastructure for all transport modes. This will help increasing the level of legal certainty for member states and stakeholders and facilitate Member States' support measures in this important area. <br/><br/> Resource efficiency <br/><br/>What is the chapter about resource efficiency about? Does it support green products? <br/><br/>The chapter on aid for resource efficiency has been extensively revised to address the challenges of ensuring the transition towards a circular economy. <br/><br/>State aid for waste management, i.e. aid for the collection, sorting and processing of waste, remains possible. Alongside, the CEEAG also include specific provisions on aid for the reduction, prevention, preparing for re-use, recovery and recycling of waste and other products, as well as aid for other investments improving the resource efficiency of production processes by reducing the amount of resources consumed or by replacing primary raw materials with secondary raw materials. <br/><br/>This section does not cover aid for the production of green products (see above). Instead, the aim of aid for resource efficiency is to incentivise economic operators to reduce the amount of waste they produce, to use fewer resources, to re-use and to better recycle materials, to increase the usage of recycled and bio-based materials and, generally, to switch to more resource-efficient and eco-friendly production processes. <br/><br/>Security of electricity supply <br/><br/>What has changed compared to the 2014 EEAG? <br/><br/>The CEEAG introduce a number of clarifications to better align the security of supply rules with the 2019 Electricity Regulation[10] and to explain how the rules apply to variety of different possible measures for security of supply, including measures related to regional security of supply problems caused by network insufficiency. <br/><br/>The rules also further limit the potential for fossil fuels to benefit from support under security of supply measures, and enable member states to introduce environmental criteria in their security of supply measures to ensure support is targeted at sustainable activities. <br/><br/>Energy intensive users <br/><br/>Why does the Commission allow support to energy-intensive industries in the form of reduction on electricity levies? <br/><br/>The Commission only allows reductions in certain electricity levies for industries that have been identified as being electro-intensive and at the same time open to international trade. Due to these two factors, the cost of electricity may play a role in possible relocation decisions. Should such companies decide to produce outside the EU, they would typically move to countries with lower environmental standards. In addition, the switch to electricity in industrial processes is a promising avenue for the decarbonization of some of these sectors. Lowering decarbonisation levies for particularly exposed sectors may therefore incentivises the electrification of their industrial processes. <br/><br/>Lastly, the new rules also require that levy reductions are conditional upon commitments by the beneficiaries to reduce their carbon footprint, either through energy-efficiency measures, or consumption of carbon-free electricity or investments in state-of-the-art technologies which reduce GHG emissions. <br/><br/>The new Guidelines codify the existing case practice under which reductions may be granted not only for levies financing renewable policies but for all levies financing decarbonisation and social policies. On the other hand, it is not allowed to grant on this basis reductions from the costs of providing electricity, such as network charges. These components finance costs of generating and distributing electricity in a stable and secure way. Electricity prices must reflect these costs to provide efficient signals to customers, which would be undermined by selective reductions from these price components. <br/><br/>The CEEAG allow to extend eligibility to additional sectors and subsectors complying with the thresholds for electro and trade intensity, while making sure that this is consistently based on verified data representative at EU level. This possibility contributes to a level playing field within sectors and subsectors with similar characteristics. <br/><br/>Coal, peat and oil shale closure <br/><br/>What is the rationale for introducing rules for aid for coal, peat and oil shale closure? <br/><br/>The shift away from power generation based on coal, peat and oil shale is one of the most important drivers of decarbonisation in the power sector in the EU, in line with the European Green Deal. The new Guidelines introduce compatibility rules for measures that member states may take to support the early closure of profitable coal, peat and oil shale activities. <br/><br/>The Guidelines also allow aid to cover exceptional costs resulting from the closure of uncompetitive coal, peat and oil shale activities. Such aid can, for example, be used to fund compensatory pensions or re-adaptation and training of workers or costs related to the rehabilitation of former power plants and mines.  <br/><br/>These rules aim to provide a framework for how the Commission will assess such measures, and to incentivize member states to accelerate or facilitate the closure process in order to ensure both legal certainty as well as a safe, just and fair transition. There were no compatibility rules for such measures in the 2014 Environmental and Energy aid Guidelines (EEAG). <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/sectors/energy-and-environment/legislation_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/competition-policy/sectors/energy-and-environment/legislation_en</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en\">https://energy.ec.europa.eu/topics/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-directive-targets-and-rules/renewable-energy-directive_en</url> [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_renovation_wave_strategy.pdf\">https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/eu_renovation_wave_strategy.pdf</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_18_3708\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_18_3708</url> [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/circular-economy-action-plan_en</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/environment/strategy/biodiversity-strategy-2030_en</url> [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0660\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:52021DC0660</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6682\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_21_6682</url> [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/commission-presents-renewable-energy-directive-revision-2021-jul-14_en\">https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/commission-presents-renewable-energy-directive-revision-2021-jul-14_en</url> [ 10]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0943\">https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32019R0943</url></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The CEEAG and the EU Taxonomy are both important pillars of the European Green Deal, fulfilling different but complementary roles:  The CEEAG are the EU rulebook for public support in the energy and environmental sectors, setting out which projects can be supported with public funds and how this support can be provided, while minimising impacts on the market and providing value to European citizens.

Urban poverty: Bergamo (Italy), Getafe (Spain), Milan (Italy), Seraing (Belgium), Landshut (Germany) Example: in Landshut, the 'Home and Care' project will provide special health and childcare to single-parent families. The5thand last call for proposals[5]under the Urban Innovative Actions will be launched in September 2019. It will be the last opportunity for cities under the current EU budget 2014-2020 to seek financing for innovative actions in the areas of culture and cultural heritage, circular economy, air quality and demographic change. The winning cities will be announced in the second quarter of 2020. Background The Urban Innovative Actions provide EU cities with funding to finance innovative projects, with a total budget of \u20ac372m from the ERDF. The Commission works in partnership with French region Hauts-de-France in implementing the programme. From three calls launched on a yearly basis since December 2015, 55 projects from 17 Member States were selected. They are currently testing on the ground innovative solutions on a wide range of urban challenges across all the thematic priorities of theUrban Agenda for the EU[6](integrating migrants, housing, air quality, urban poverty or energy transition, among others). In the next long-term EU budget 2021-2027, the Urban Innovative Actions will be merged into the European Urban Initiative, a new instrument combining all urban tools in a single programme for city-to-city cooperation, innovation and capacity-building across all the thematic priorities of the Urban Agenda for the EU. At the same time, thenew single rulebook[7]will allow for easier combinations between EU funds, for example between the European Regional Development Fund and the Internal Security Fund, in order to develop comprehensive urban development plans, encompassing public space safety measures.

Last year astudy[1]by 16 institutions including several of the Nature4Climate partners found that the land sector contributes a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions, but could deliver as much as a third of the greenhouse gas reductions required by 2030 to keep global warming below 2 degrees, and do so cost-effectively.Natural climate solutions such as reforestation, conservation agriculture and coastal wetland protection enhance nature's ability to absorb and store carbon in forests, farms and wetlands. While there is increasing policy action and investment on renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,governments have been slow to date to address land use. Just38 out of the 160 governments[2]who signed the Paris agreement have specific targets for the sector. </p><p>Moreover, natural climate solutions only receive3% of public mitigation finance[3], despite being the only economic carbon removal solution available today at scale. Nature4Climate is the world's firstcoordinated effort to address the totality of natural climate solutions - across forests, farms, grasslands and wetlands. The group brings together UNDP as well as Conservation International (CI), The Nature Conservancy (TNC), Woods Hole Research Center, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), World Resources Institute (WRI). Together they will work over the next five years with national and subnational governments, and business groups at the global and national levels, to increase policy action and investment on natural climate solutions. Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, said: 'Nature-based solutions for climate are one of the most cost-effective approaches we have for achieving our climate goals. They also provide multiple co-benefits for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals - investing in nature is not only the smart thing to do, it is the right thing to do.' Dr. Andrew Steer, President and CEO of the World Resources Institute, of one of the most effective ways to improve land management said: 'Landscape restoration is the next big thing. It has extraordinary benefits for the economy, jobs, food security, and the climate\u2014but until now, only a sliver of public climate finance and policy attention has been dedicated to land use,' said Dr. Andrew Steer, President and CEO, World Resources Institute. 'The Nature4Climate Initiative is coming at exactly the right moment to build on the growing momentum to restore degraded land, encourage investment, and help save people and the planet.' To date, different NGOs and UN agencies have tended to focus mostly on protecting tropical forests as the main land use climate strategy. As part of the initiative, the partners launched a new website today, atNature4Climate.org[4]. This includes theN4CMapper[5], which shows the potential of 10 natural climate solutions to reduce and store greenhouse gas emissions in 190 countries, both rich and poor, and north and south. Mark Tercek, CEO of The Nature Conservancy, said: 'Natural climate solutions are absolutely critical in addressing the climate challenge\u2014and they include strategies that are available today, in every country, ready to be implemented and scaled. Managing land presents a great opportunity: it is one of the most effective, cost-efficient tools we have to slow the runaway effects of climate change.' Dr. Phil Duffy, President, Woods Hole Research Center, said: 'There is no feasible way to stay under 2C of warming without significant removal of CO2 from the atmosphere. There is no better technology for large scale carbon removal, available right now, than natural systems. Science has shown us the scale and potential. Nature4climate will help national and international climate policy makers to take advantage of this opportunity.' The partners are also engaging with businesses and local, regional and state governments, including at the upcoming Global Climate Summit in California in September. The 3030 Challenge, launched last week, invites non-state actors to increase action on land use, alongside four other key challenge areas, and calls for action on forests, food and land to deliver 30% of the solution to climate change by 2030. Dr. M. Sanjayan, CEO of Conservation International, said:'Under R...or 4.5 billion years, nature is the only carbon sequestration technology that today achieves negative emissions at a meaningful scale. It is also among the most economical forms of climate mitigation available and has hosts of other benefits. We have the knowledge to use land efficiently, to protect carbon in soils, and to keep carbon rich forests standing. What we need is partnerships among governments, businesses, indigenous communities and civil society to get it done.' Peter Bakker, CEO of World Business Council for Sustainable Development, said: 'The implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement is a collective challenge, and the private sector is committed to delivering the required business pathways. Forward-thinking businesses are calling on all leaders to introduce effective economic mechanisms for transitioning to a low-carbon world, including carbon pricing and the recognition of nature's contribution to carbon storage and emission-reduction potential. We are keen to be working in partnership with Nature4Climate to help scale investment, business action, and ambition on natural climate solutions.' About N4C Nature4Climate (N4C) is an initiative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and five world-leading not-for-profits (Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, Woods Hole Research Center, World Business Council for Sustainable Development and World Resources Institute) that aims to increase investment and action on natural climate solutions in support of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.The N4C partners work togethertocatalyse partnerships between governments, civil society, business and investors to cut and remove greenhouse gas emissionsacross the land sector.

And environmental fiscal reforms have the potential to almost double the revenues they currently bring to national treasuries, with benefits for our environment as well as scope for cutting taxes on employment or cutting the deficit. That's a powerful argument for changing the status quo.'<br/> The study on the potential for greener taxes, which pools data from 12 member states, suggests that moving taxes away from labour and towards pollution (increasing taxes on the causes of air and water pollution, for example) would bring in revenues of \u20ac35 billion in real terms in 2016, rising to \u20ac101bn in 2025, with far higher figures involved if steps were also taken to remove environmentally harmful subsidies. The potential revenues range from just over 1% of GDP per annum through to just over 2.5% of GDP per annum in 2025, depending on the member state concerned.<br/> The second study looks at various links between environment and economic policy, including the macro-economic impact of floods, best practices in supporting SMEs focusing on resource efficiency, and environmental expenditure in all member states. The approximate total cost of damage from flooding in the EU over the 2002-2013 period was at least \u20ac150bn. Investing in measures to reduce flooding is highly effective, on average costing some six to eight times less than the damage caused by flooding. Better still, the benefits of investing in green infrastructure - i.e. restoring natural features to help manage and store flood water include better outcomes for biodiversity and could help reduce construction costs.<br/> Background<br/> The studies published today will feed into the European Semester[1], a mechanism established in 2010 to improve the co-ordination of economic policies in European Union countries. It was one of the EU's responses to the financial and economic crisis, which has resulted in economic contraction and rising unemployment in many EU countries. The European Semester is based on the idea that, because EU economies are highly integrated, enhanced policy co-ordination can help boost economic development in the EU generally.<br/> By 'Greening the European Semester[2]', the Commission is aiming to ensure that macroeconomic policies are sustainable, not only economically and socially, but also environmentally. An earlier study highlighting the economic benefits of environment, which looked at implementing waste legislation to boost green growth[3], showed that full implementation would save \u20ac72bn per year, increase the annual turnover of the EU waste management and recycling sector by \u20ac42bn and create more than 400,000 jobs by 2020.<br/> More information<br/> The studies can be consulted here[4].<br/>The European Semester website[5]<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/\">http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm</url> [3]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/study%2012%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/studies/pdf/study%2012%20FINAL%20REPORT.pdf</url> [4]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm\">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/integration/green_semester/index_en.htm</url> [5]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/\">http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making-it-happen/</url></p><p/>", "publisher": "EU Reporter", "instances": ["co Delivered by Newstex)       \u00a0    http://www. eureporter. co/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Severe-flooding-across-so-010. jpgTwo studies published by the European Commission today (3 March) show how environment policy can spur economic growth by boosting flood protection and making more of a switch to greener taxes.

B4Life will now provide the means to step up our efforts to support livelihoods through halting biodiversity loss and combating wildlife crime.'<br/> Biodiversity and development are closely linked and mutually reinforcing: healthy ecosystems sustain development while development impacts on habitats. Seeing ecosystem conservation and restoration as an opportunity to generate growth, create jobs and reduce poverty through a green economy contributes to the EU's development agenda.<br/> It is hoped that the initiative will attract additional funding from other development partners including EU member states.<br/> B4Life will operate in three priority areas:<br/> \u2022 Promoting good governance of natural resources.

The 2030 Agenda is the transformative plan of action for people, planet, prosperity and peace to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development globally.The EU and the UN play a complementary role within the global development architecture. We are natural and longstanding partners in development cooperation, including at country and regional levels, where the benefits of our collaborative actions and respective comparative advantages are clearly felt. The ongoing UN reforms, particularly that of the UN Development System, provide an opportunity to reaffirm and build on the EU-UN partnership in development. </p><p>Within the EU, the new European Consensus on Development frames the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in partnership with all partners. Partnership is essential for delivering on the 2030 Agenda and achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions (social, economic and environmental). With the 2030 Agenda as our joint blueprint for action, we reaffirm the added value in us working together towards the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda in partner countries. Our joint efforts will continue to be targeted towards eradicating poverty, reducing risks and vulnerabilities, building resilience and addressing inequalities to ensure that no one is left behind. We support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (Paris Agreement), the Sendai Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction (Sendai Framework) and other international commitments. Guiding principles The renewed partnership between the EU and the UN in development aims to foster closer collaboration on common policy approaches and create a more strategic framework for cooperation for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in partner countries. We intend to strengthen co-ordination between EU and UN actors, and work more closely in partnership with all other relevant actors to promote the implementation of agendas that promote inclusive and peaceful societies, resilience and sustainable development. We aim to advance on strengthening the means of implementation and revitalising the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development as a key priority of our collaboration in advancing the 2030 Agenda. We also aim to advance development effectiveness, in line with the Busan Declaration and the Nairobi Outcome Document. In the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, we envisage to promote open, inclusive, participatory and transparent processes, recognising the important roles of Civil Society Organisations (CSOs), including youth-led networks, and of foundations, academia, International Financial Institutions (IFIs), the private sector and other relevant partners as active actors in development. We intend to continue to promote gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment and support partners harness the demographic dividend of the youth population as overarching priorities. We fully respect the principles of country ownership, demand-driven partnership and dialogue, recognising that national governments have the primary responsibility for implementing the 2030 Agenda. We should also jointly contribute to raising awareness and ownership of the 2030 Agenda. We reaffirm the importance of multilateralism and strong strategic partnerships as the cornerstone for an inclusive, resilient, sustainable, and secure and peaceful future for everyone. In this context, we recall in particular the importance of the partnership between the African Union, the European Union and the United Nations. Overall objectives  Through this partnership, we intend to encourage and support partner countries in integrating the 2030 Agenda into their national strategies and priorities. We intend to jointly promote development strategies that factor in the 2030 Agenda, supporting integrated policies, actions and approaches in partner countries. We envisage aligning our work and financing with country priorities through better planning, regular and inclusive follow-up and review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. This could include greater focus in building capacity in partner countries for data collection and analysis and integratedpolicy advice to support economic transformation and diversification in partner countries. We intend to enhance joint policy dialogue and consultation with partner countries to identify opportunities for collaboration and possible areas of support including synergies between EU programming (including joint programming) and the UN Development Assistance Frameworks (UNDAFs). Where possible, this should be done through existing platforms rather than creating new layers, and by making use of the Joint Fund for the 2030 Agenda to the extent possible. We should also, where appropriate, promote coordination between the UN Resident Coordinators, UN Country Teams and EU Delegations to strengthen synergies and development impact. We envisage exchanges of views about supporting local authorities, communities and CSOs in their role in SDG implementation, as well as on mobilising the private sector. Strategic focus and intent The renewed partnership concerns, in particular, five focus areas: a. Promoting gender equality, including plans of action for women's and girls'empowerment at country level. We intend to build upon the experience of the Spotlight Initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls, which is an example of innovative EU-UN partnership and supporting the UN's commitment to 'delivering as one' in all areas. We intend to promote girls' and women's empowerment, as well as the abandonment of all forms of harmful practices and discrimination against women and girlsin a range of areas, such as quality education and training, health, including sexual and reproductive health, better nutritional outcomes, access to productive resources, services and information, and political and economic participation. b. Fostering inclusive sustainable growth, strategic investment (both public and private) and decent work to promote conditions for improving the quality of employment and increasing decent employment and entrepreneurship opportunities, especially for youth, building on the recent experience with the European External Investment Plan and ongoing efforts of the UN development system. This includes facilitating access to networks, knowledge and skillstowards inclusive sustainable economic activity. Emphasis on building resilience and sustainability should be prioritised through support to governments to promote agricultural transformation, to undertake integrated rural development initiatives supported byelectrification, and to ensure sustainable development solutions, in a context-specific and tailored approach, including by addressing risks, vulnerabilities, and root causes of crises. We envisage fostering innovation, quality education and training in view of matching skills with labour market needs, improving business environment and investment climate, and triggering and supporting private sector investments in domestic economies of partner countries towards sustainable development pathways, with a focus on decent job creation, value addition, critical physical infrastructure, structural transformation and human capital development. c. Promoting climate action and implementation through development cooperation, through joint efforts to advocate and operationalise collaborations and commitments towards a low-carbon and circular economy, disaster risk reduction, resilience, and gender-responsive transformation and adaptation, within the context of the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework, in particular, by supporting national level implementation. We intend to work with partner countries, governments, financial institutions, private investors, IFIs, think-tanks and other partners to support transformational climate action. This partnership should contribute to disaster risk reduction and resilience by supporting climate-smart agriculture, accelerating access to renewable energy, reducing water scarcity, promoting nature-based solutions, the conservation and sustainable management of natural resources, biodiversity and ecosystems, and developing capacity to prevent and manage natural disasters and climate change vulnerability. d. Strengthening the humanitarian-development nexus and its linkage to sustaining peace, through continued use of joint assessments, conflict analyses and conflict-sensitive programming and implementation, reinforced collaboration and conflict-sensitive joint action in 'fragile and conflict-affected settings', improved early warning mechanisms followed by early action, with a view to help partner countries and their people to prevent, resolve and recover from crises and toreduce human suffering and displacement whilst maintaining different roles, mandates and respecting humanitarian principles. EU-UN joint efforts should address the root causes of conflict and economic and social stability, through institutional strengthening, reducing risks of disasters, stabilisation and support to peacebuilding efforts. They will also seek to advance inclusion of human rights, gender equality and empowerment. e. Enhancing cooperation on the migration-development nexus, aiming towards theachievement of the migration-related targets of the 2030 Agenda and the commitments taken in the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, notably to promote safe, orderly and regular migration. Reinforced and joint efforts by the EU and the UN will contribute to the concrete implementation of the objectives of the two Global Compacts on Migrants and on Refugees at global, regional, national and local level, once these are adopted. Implementation and Follow-Up This partnership will vary depending on the specific context, evolution of development situations and the range of national and international partners involved. A flexible and tailored approach will remain the hallmark of an effective response. We recognise the importance of adequate funding for EU-UN collaboration within the limits of approved financing decisions. We also recognize the diversified nature of financing resources and needs in countries, and intend to pursue our analysis and collaboration in bringing in timely, predictable, sustained, appropriate, and efficient financing instruments. We reaffirm the importance of Addis Ababa Action Agenda. This partnership will continue to provide the framework for a strategic collaboration, recognizing the critical importance of aligning and leveraging financial resources and jointly building, prioritizing and financing innovative, effective operational responses by all stakeholders within the limits of approved financing decisions. We intend to emphasize efforts towards catalyzing innovative financing, leveraging of domestic financing, and private-public partnerships and dialogue with the private sector aiming for private investments in partner countries. This is a living and flexible partnership that, where and when appropriate, will be adapted to changing circumstances. The leadership of the UN and the EU will meet annually to assess and adapt it where necessary. The technical teams of both organisations will continue to meet regularly to ensure effective implementation of co-operation under this partnership, including by enhancing coordination between the teams at the global, regional and country levels.The post European Union and #UnitedNations: A renewed partnership in #Development[1] appeared first on EU Reporter[2].
