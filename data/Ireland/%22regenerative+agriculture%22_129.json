Inaction risks severe consequences, according to Sowing Change, a report by Carlsberg Group partnering with Boston Consulting Group and One Planet Business for Biodiversity.</p><p>The report acknowledges growing tension between ambitious environmental policies and farming realities, highlighted by widespread protests by farmers across Europe in late 2023 and 2024.</p><p>\"One of the farmers' key concerns was waning competitiveness. Factors that farmers said attributed to this include growing regulatory and administrative burdens imposed by environmental policy, including the more stringent ones tied to the CAP; global ised supply chains that favour cheaper goods from outside the EU; the economic obstacles of maintaining functioning farmland; and the lack of sufficient EU incentive mechanisms to help farmers overcome these challenges.</p><p>\"The agri-food system is no longer fit for the future.\"</p><p>Population growth (expected to surpass 8.5bn by 2030) and the rising demand for food are seen as central concerns, alongside climate risks and economic instability marked by global competition, geopolitical instability, and rising costs.</p><p>\"In Europe, drought-related losses alone could reach  65bn annually by 2100. These severe weather events are in turn worsened by climate change, for which agriculture is one of the primary contributors, accounting for 22% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\"</p><p>Urban expansion and soil degradation are shrinking arable land, while agriculture's use of 70% of global freshwater resources is adding to water shortages. Hence the \"pressing need\" for a sustainable agri-food system, to lessen its environmental footprint and strengthen it while maintaining an equitable business model for farmers.</p><p>\"Agriculture has sustained human life for millennia, adapting to population needs and a changing climate. However, the current pace of change driven by rapid climate impacts and growing demand outpaces the slower adaptations of the past.</p><p>\"This accelerating shift calls for a transformation of the agricultural system, rather than incremental evolution. Regenerative agriculture is one of several solutions that can make this transformation a reality.\"</p><p>The first of the report's six recommendations to scale regenerative agriculture across the EU is to create an EU-level outcome-based definition of regenerative agriculture with clear key performance indicators, and an EU-wide protocol for measurement, impact assessment, and reporting.</p><p>To link EU farmer payments with environmental outcomes, the outcome-based criteria should be integrated into the CAP.</p><p>For regenerative agriculture financing, a European Investment Bank transition fund is recommended, along with public-private partnerships with insurers for crop protection, and capital loan programmes. Knowledge-sharing through an online platform for case studies, financing opportunities, and farmer peer-to-peer learning are recommended.</p><p>\"The EU has a critical opportunity to act now, leveraging political momentum, structured dialogue, and upcoming policy milestones to scale regenerative practices and establish agriculture as a key pillar of its sustainability efforts, creating a resilient and environmentally responsible food system\", according to the report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">'The agri-food system is no longer fit for the future,' the report states</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FG3-SFK3-RRSV-80YH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

This results in a particularly rich and complex cheese. It is made in partnership with organic milk producers The Little Milk Company.</p><p>It has added another new cheese to its repertoire, Shepherd's Store, which is a traditional, European-style, semi-hard sheep's milk cheese. It is only made between the months of February and September. Creamier in style than manchego or pecorino, this is a distinctly Irish traditional farmhouse cheese.

With no windows and just the soft glow of a few candles, the darkness of the sauna allows the parasympathetic nervous system to rest. The heat is rounder, softer and has more dimensions than a barrel or box sauna, and there is usually space on the wide benches to spread out and get comfortable. Brothers Peter and Karl Priestley run the unlikely wellness expanse here at The Gap, Glencullen, which has sprung up within the boundaries of a mountain biking park.

Using Connemara granite for the stove and locally sourced timber for the build, Brian Dilleen, the farm owner, created the sauna alongside designer Nathan Nokes, carpenter Alberto Hogan and metal expert Padraig Smith. The exterior of the sauna was blowtorched using the Japanese technique of shou sugi ban, which weatherproofs the wood and gives it a beautifully charred appearance. The sauna stove is fed with storm-felled trees, and the two cold plunges glisten nearby with fresh water. An on-site honesty shop sells eggs from the farm's 2,000 free-range chickens and its freshly picked chemical-free vegetables, all grown within 50 metres of the sauna. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">madyolkfarm.com</emphasis></p><p>Wild Atlantic Seaweed Baths Doolin</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fisher Street, Ballaghaline, Doolin, Co Clare</emphasis></p><p>The sight of a dozen repurposed whiskey barrels filled with hot seawater and seaweed has become a familiar one on Doolin Pier, and the team at Wild Atlantic Seaweed Baths have now added a 'seafoam sauna' to round off the experience. With more than 500 varieties of seaweed found around the coast of Ireland and a long tradition of use for healing in this country, it was only a matter of time before this nutrient-packed algae was combined with sauna. The ritual of bathing in magnesium and iodine-rich seaweed, followed by a sauna-induced sweat and intermittent dips in the Atlantic Ocean, makes this pairing a draw for anyone seeking a natural glow. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">wildatlanticseaweedbaths.com</emphasis></p><p>Galgorm</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">136 Fenaghy Road, Ballymena, Co Antrim, BT42 1EA</emphasis></p><p>A gong goes to herald the beginning of the thrice-daily Aufguss sessions in Galgorm's 'Celtic Infusion Spa'. Aufguss is a German word meaning infusion, but in the world of sauna, it refers to a ritual where an Aufguss master pours water infused with essential oils on the sauna stove's stones to create steam. Often to a background of music, the Aufguss master then spins and swishes a towel to conduct the fragrant steam around the room, intensifying the humidity and feeling of heat for the bathers. As mad as it might sound, it can be a lot of fun. Aufguss dominates in European spas, with countries like Denmark, the Czech Republic and Italy being avid devotees. Now a burgeoning trend in Ireland, Galgorm, the luxury spa outside of Ballymena, has produced two UK Aufguss champions (yes, there are competitions) in Zak Moore and Pavel Poliacek.  Moore regularly performs Aufguss in the Celtic Infusion Sauna. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">galgorm.com</emphasis></p><p>Wild Irish Retreats</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Various locations</emphasis></p><p>Sweat lodges have been used in Ireland for thousands of years, since our Bronze Age ancestors heated stones in fires before laying them in the pit of a tent and gathering around their glow to sweat. The practice has been reawakened in recent years. In back gardens and private fields, more and more sweat lodge ceremonies are now being held around Ireland. These tend to be closed-off, invite-only affairs. Fortunately, the inimitable heat of a lodge can still be experienced on one of Wild Irish's retreats. Wild Irish is run by Diarmuid Lyng, the former Wexford hurling star and his partner, Siobhan de Paor, the Irish language revivalist and poet. They run weekend retreats throughout the year, where building and using the sweat lodge is a central part.

At the end of a fuchsia-lined lane, the sauna appears alongside a pebble beach and a crystal-clear swimming spot. Owned by two locals, Alice Hughes and Adam Donegan, it is the tranquil setting of this barrel sauna that makes it so special. Overlooking Kenmare Bay, with the Iveragh Peninsula on the opposing side, the sauna brings you to a gorgeous expanse you might never see otherwise. As the name suggests, it is a stunning place to watch the sun sink below the horizon and the sky fill with colour. Sunset has two other locations, on Ballydonegan Beach in Allihies and in the pretty port town of Castletownbere. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@sunsetsaunakerry_beara</emphasis></p><p>Common Knowledge</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Boghil, Kilfenora, Co Clare, V95 DK38</emphasis></p><p>Beautifully clad in storm-damaged steel, Common Knowledge's Bog Sauna rests on wooden beams that give it the impression of floating on the land. Built in spring 2025 by a team at the non-profit social enterprise's 50-acre site in the Burren, every element of this sauna has been carefully considered to bring people in closer contact with the bog and the natural surroundings. Reclaimed whiskey barrels filled with mineral-rich bog water serve as natural plunge pools, and bathers are encouraged to take their time, feel passing breezes on bare skin, smell the meadowsweet that surrounds the sauna and breathe deeply. \"We built it with minimal interruption to the ground and the land around it,\" Daith\u00ed O'Reilly, the centre manager for Common Knowledge, says. \"The name Bog Sauna isn't just because of its location but because we are integrating the other elements that dwell in that space.\" The sauna is open to the public, but days and opening hours are sporadic, for now, so check Common Knowledge's website or contact them in advance. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ourcommonknowledge.org</emphasis></p><p>Skellig Sauna</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">St Finian's Bay, Rathkieran, Cahersiveen, Co Kerry</emphasis></p><p>There are just two Unesco World Heritage sites in Ireland, and only one of them can be gazed upon from the perfect bliss of a sauna.

There is a sense of the ethereal, as people move between hot and cold, all within the eyeline of this island that has inspired human devotion for centuries. The bay takes its name from the monk who used to row from the monastic site on the island to say mass at Keel on the mainland. Colin Walsh, a Cahersiveen local, who keeps the Skellig Sauna fires warm, has other locations at Ballinskelligs Beach and Cuas Crom, but St Finian's Bay brings the visual drama. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">skelligsauna.ie</emphasis></p><p>Glendalough Sanctuary</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brockagh, Co Wicklow, A98 VK68</emphasis></p><p>Built into the side of a hill, this pocket sauna has a beautiful view over Derrybawn Mountain. On a summer's evening, the view from inside this wooden haven is one of abundant greenery and plantlife. The wood-fired sauna is a recent addition to Glendalough Sanctuary, and can be experienced independently of the retreat centre's accommodation or courses. It comfortably fits three people, but it is the perfect place to take a sweat on your own, to get to know how hot or cool you like it, to experiment with throwing water on the stove to create steam, or l\u00f6yly (pronounced low-lu) as the Finns call it and to take it slow. Just a few minutes walk from Glendalough Visitor Centre, this still-hidden gem could be the ideal ending to a day spent hiking the valley's spectacular Spinc. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">glendaloughsanctuary.ie</emphasis></p><p>Bosca Beatha</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Glenmalure, Co Wicklow, A67 WF65</emphasis></p><p>For years, Bosca Beatha was one of the only mobile saunas in the country, and owner Shirley Fitzpatrick had to work hard to convince people just to try it out. The sauna scene has changed utterly in the last six years, and new saunas are opening almost every week to keep up with the demand. But Shirley is still pioneering new practices in Irish sweating culture. In recent times, Bosca Beatha has become a training hub for pirtis, the Lithuanian style of sauna, which is designed to awaken and delight all the senses by bringing the forest, flora and fauna into the heat. Shirley offers pirtis sessions to groups and individuals. She uses leaf whisks to boost circulation, along with salt scrubs and honey masks to pamper the skin and soothe the soul. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">boscabeatha.ie</emphasis></p><p>Bluebell Sauna</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bluebell Rd, Inchicore, Dublin 12, D12 RT27</emphasis></p><p>Tucked away beside the Grand Canal's Fifth Lock is the Bungalow Wellness Sanctuary, Dublin 12 - an attractive enclave that is home to a Men's Shed, a vegetable garden, and a fish pond. The newest addition to this special place is a wood-fired community sauna. It was donated by Fad Saoil Saunas and developed with the help of asylum seekers from the Red Cow IPAS centre, as well as many volunteers from the community. The sauna will be used as a resource for people already involved with local services, including Tuaras and Tiglin, but will soon be open to everyone, whether a local, a blow-in or just someone in need of a great sweat in great company. \"The Bluebell Sauna will be available for public bookings at affordable rates,\" Paul Holmes, a community development worker with Bluebell Community Development Project, says.\" The ethos behind everything we do in The Bungalow Wellness Sanctuary is that it's a safe, welcoming space for everyone to enjoy.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bluebellcdp.ie</emphasis></p><p>The Hot Box, Boland's Mills</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barrow Street, Dublin 4, D04 X7X0</emphasis></p><p>The Hot Box, which opened its first sauna at Bective Mill in Co Meath and now has seven locations across Ireland, has built a loyal following and serious sauna know-how. Its latest venture is a contrast therapy centre, featuring three saunas and multiple plunge pools across 4,000 square feet of the former Boland's Mills in Dublin's South Docklands. The new location, which is expected to open in September 2025, will include a wheelchair-accessible sauna and a sauna suitable for large group sessions. Given its location and the investment in the space, this offering is expected to provide Dublin with a parallel experience to the high-end Arc in London's Canary Wharf and Othership in New York's Flatiron District - immersive sauna and ice bath experiences that focus on guided group sessions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thehotboxsauna.ie</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rosanna Cooney is a journalist and author of the bestselling book 'Sweathouse: The New and Ancient Irish Sauna Tradition', published by Irelandia Press and available in all good bookshops</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WICPEO-https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/ireland/12saunaexperienceswithadifferencearoundirelandfromahotboxinabogtoseaweedsoaksinabarrel/a2015384599.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WICPEO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFT-5T43-RS21-F2GS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304307</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Wicklow People (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40443\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 9, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000695</classCode><className>FAMINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001538</classCode><className>SEAWEED &amp;

But Shirley is still pioneering new practices in Irish sweating culture. In recent times, Bosca Beatha has become a training hub for pirtis, the Lithuanian style of sauna, which is designed to awaken and delight all the senses by bringing the forest, flora and fauna into the heat. Shirley offers pirtis sessions to groups and individuals. She uses leaf whisks to boost circulation, along with salt scrubs and honey masks to pamper the skin and soothe the soul. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">boscabeatha.ie</emphasis></p><p>Bluebell Sauna</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bluebell Rd, Inchicore, Dublin 12, D12 RT27</emphasis></p><p>Tucked away beside the Grand Canal's Fifth Lock is the Bungalow Wellness Sanctuary, Dublin 12 - an attractive enclave that is home to a Men's Shed, a vegetable garden, and a fish pond. The newest addition to this special place is a wood-fired community sauna. It was donated by Fad Saoil Saunas and developed with the help of asylum seekers from the Red Cow IPAS centre, as well as many volunteers from the community. The sauna will be used as a resource for people already involved with local services, including Tuaras and Tiglin, but will soon be open to everyone, whether a local, a blow-in or just someone in need of a great sweat in great company. \"The Bluebell Sauna will be available for public bookings at affordable rates,\" Paul Holmes, a community development worker with Bluebell Community Development Project, says.\" The ethos behind everything we do in The Bungalow Wellness Sanctuary is that it's a safe, welcoming space for everyone to enjoy.\" <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">bluebellcdp.ie</emphasis></p><p>The Hot Box, Boland's Mills</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barrow Street, Dublin 4, D04 X7X0</emphasis></p><p>The Hot Box, which opened its first sauna at Bective Mill in Co Meath and now has seven locations across Ireland, has built a loyal following and serious sauna know-how. Its latest venture is a contrast therapy centre, featuring three saunas and multiple plunge pools across 4,000 square feet of the former Boland's Mills in Dublin's South Docklands. The new location, which is expected to open in September 2025, will include a wheelchair-accessible sauna and a sauna suitable for large group sessions. Given its location and the investment in the space, this offering is expected to provide Dublin with a parallel experience to the high-end Arc in London's Canary Wharf and Othership in New York's Flatiron District - immersive sauna and ice bath experiences that focus on guided group sessions. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thehotboxsauna.ie</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Rosanna Cooney is a journalist and author of the bestselling book 'Sweathouse: The New and Ancient Irish Sauna Tradition', published by Irelandia Press and available in all good bookshops</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">KERMAN-https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/ireland/12saunaexperienceswithadifferencearoundirelandfromahotboxinabogtoseaweedsoaksinabarrel/a2015384599.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">KERMAN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFT-5T43-RS21-F2C8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304298</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Kerryman (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40445\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 9, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000695</classCode><className>FAMINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001759</classCode><className>TRENDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001538</classCode><className>SEAWEED &amp;

Trend-led she is not - it's innovation that interests her. She's long been on a mission to harness the bounty of seaweed's bioactives and upscale in a way that fits with her non-negotiables of sustainability and circularity.</p><p>Back in 2011, long before sustainability hit the Zeitgeist, McMahon had been working with companies \"in the natural product area\" that wanted to create global brands.</p><p>\"I felt, OK, if we're going to go to nature to utilise these amazing bioactive ingredients that are locked up in these wonderful plants, we have to be very cognisant of the potential impact that can have on ecosystems,\" she says. \"We need to do it in a way that is sensitive and respectful of the environment.\"</p><p>That principled stance continues to be her north star. Seabody hand-harvests its seaweed MDASH although sustainable seaweed farming is being considered MDASH working with harvesters \"from Donegal, right down along the West coast\". Some of whom, McMahon says, \"have been harvesting seaweed for generations within their family\".</p><p>\"They've inherited the licences, and the know how in terms of how to harvest the seaweed in a way that leaves sufficient plant behind so that it can regenerate within approximately two years. They know how to rotate through the specific locations and also very cleverly identify the different types of seaweed that you need\".</p><p>Kerry to her core MDASH \"I'm green and gold on the inside\" MDASH it's been important to her to base the businesses she's cofounded in her homeplace of Tralee, helping to halt the \"brain drain\" that affects rural and coastal communities.</p><p>\"Supporting local economies, creating highquality jobs, jobs that would pay well, jobs that embrace people who have good technical skills and knowledge is hugely important.\"</p><p>She set up NutraMara in 2017 and, while Seabody is only three years old, it's already seeing significant growth. In the past 20 years, the global seaweed market has tripled and, with the industry set to be worth  22bn by 2028, the recent establishment of an Irish Seaweed Association seems timely.</p><p>\"I think it's wonderful to see that an association has been formed,\" says McMahon.</p><p>She's very clued in on the growing global awareness around seaweed farming, utilisation, and how algae cultivation is uniquely placed to potentially mitigate climate change.</p><p>Seaweed has a low ecological footprint, not needing fresh water, fertiliser or land to grow, and crucially, she says, the renewable resource captures carbon, acts as a biofilter, removing pollutants from its environment, and \"can provide beautiful habitats and support biodiversity within the ocean\".</p><p>Sustainable seaweed farming \"really ties in with this whole concept of regenerative agriculture and linking the land and sea, which I think is really powerful\".</p><p>In the past, \"green\" equalled homespun, but McMahon's brand is super sophisticated, from the elegant minimalism of its packaging, to the \"green chemistry\" that enables its creation, to Maraderm MDASH the \"hero ingredient\" bio-retinol that is a pillar of Seabody's efficacy and unique to the brand.</p><p>\"We are constantly discovering,\" she says, explaining that while the plant's biomolecules are a known quantity, the key to future innovations lies in the \"isolation methods and the combination of the different types of ingredients\".

However, in an Irish context, the benefits can sometimes be over-estimated. In our climate, the benefits to soil carbon and greenhouse gases are small, whereas straw incorporation and cover cropping may contribute more.\"</p><p>But a more comprehensive soil-carbon analysis is required in the study for conclusive results.</p><p>He said the non-inversion systems can be challenged by wet autumns as well as later springs.</p><p>He also reminded farmers of the grass weed threat associated with min-till systems, noting that stale seedbeds, ploughing, and rotations could be important for grass weed control, in the context of expected earlier sowing and milder climates, along with herbicide unavailability and herbicide resistance. These changes could require farmers to alter their grass weed-control strategies.</p><p>Overall, the 23-year tillage system study at Knockbeg showed that the cultivation system had relatively little impact on soil carbon levels. However, min-till systems did increase earthworm and slug populations.</p><p>Performance of continuous winter wheat was often similar in both conventional and min-till establishment systems, with the exception of wet years, when performance from the min-till system dipped.</p><p>However, non-plough systems had lower costs and higher work rates, albeit highly dependent on the depth of the min-till operation. Mr Forristal said the cost of establishing a crop using 120mm min-till was about  135/ha, 67% of the cost of plough-based systems ( 200), and direct drilling costs were about  60, only 30% of plough-based systems.</p><p>Mr Forristal said the Knockbeg experiment was begun in the early 2000s, when interest in alternative establishment systems had grown, due to potential labour, work rate, cost, crop, and soil-structure benefits.</p><p>\"We needed to validate some of these claims under a long-term trial system to capture the cumulative effects. More recently, we have incorporated environmental metrics, such as soil carbon and greenhouse-gas emissions in to our work\".</p><p>The effect of the establishment system (plough versus min-till and straw incorporation) was quantified over a seven-year trial, where continuous winter wheat was the main crop.</p><p>Further research studies at Knockbeg evaluated various nitrogen-application strategies for conventional or min-till systems, and a nine-year study assessed the impact of cultivations and rotations.</p><p>Ploughing resulted in the best average yield overall, followed closely by shallow ploughing, min-till, and strip-till, in that order. This was specifically the case for winter wheat and oilseed rape. How-highly ever, shallow ploughing and strip-till resulted in the best yields of winter oats, followed by ploughing and min-till, in that order.</p><p>There were notable slumps in continuous winter wheat yield after min-till in 2010, 2020, and 2024, and a smaller slump in 2007. Yields were similar in other years, mostly in the eight to 12t/ha range.</p><p>Regenerative agriculture is favoured for the environment and ecology. It combines ploughing less with reducing the use of chemical fertiliser, and protecting the soil, and is expected to lock up increased soil carbon, improve soil health, and even increase yields.</p><p>Its supporters say it produces at least the average of conventional farming output, and more than average of a given crop in specific locations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The 23-year tillage-system study at Knockbeg showed relatively little impact on soil carbon levels.

From Bronze Age sweat lodges to pre-famine stone sweathouses, we've been turning to the healing power of heat for physical and mental relief for thousands of years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Even though our indigenous forms of sweat bathing faded over time, many of Ireland's new wave of saunapreneurs continue our ancient traditions by creating sweaty sanctuaries that allow people to slow down, rest and reconnect.</p><p>While the best sauna is always the one you have regular access to, there are plenty worth making a special trip for, or saving for the sauna lover in your life. Here are a dozen of the most interesting saunas around the country, each one offering something unique, whether it's the ethos behind the build, the beauty of the location, or the chance to experience a sauna ritual.</p><p>As saunas regularly update their opening days and hours, it's always worth checking with the business before visiting.</p><p>Tigh'N Alluis</p><p>Adventure Park, Ballybetagh Road, Glencullen, Co Dublin, D18 Y673 Modelled after a Mongolian design and built with Irish hazel, the yurt sauna at Tigh'N Alluis (meaning sweathouse) has built a cult following since it was erected in summer 2024. From the outside, this black dome betrays nothing of the magic to be experienced within. With no windows and just the soft glow of a few candles, the darkness of the sauna allows the parasympathetic nervous system to rest. The heat is rounder, softer and has more dimensions than a barrel or box sauna, and there is usually space on the wide benches to spread out and get comfortable. Brothers Peter and Karl Priestley run the unlikely wellness expanse here at The Gap, Glencullen, which has sprung up within the boundaries of a mountain biking park. A dunk in the natural pond, with views of the Great Sugarloaf and Bray Head to the east and a forest behind, is a perfect way to cool off. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tighnalluis.ie\">www.tighnalluis.ie</url>Mad Yolk Farm Srah, Craughwell, Co Galway, H91 YDT2 With its grass roof and view over a garden humming with summertime bees, a sauna makes sense as part of the Mad Yolk Farm, a 27-acre holding dedicated to building a resilient ecosystem through regenerative agriculture. Using Connemara granite for the stove and locally sourced timber for the build, Brian Dilleen, the farm owner, created the sauna alongside designer Nathan Nokes, carpenter Alberto Hogan and metal expert Padraig Smith. The exterior of the sauna was blowtorched using the Japanese technique of shou sugi ban, which weatherproofs the wood and gives it a beautifully charred appearance. The sauna stove is fed with storm-felled trees, and the two cold plunges glisten nearby with fresh water. An on-site honesty shop sells eggs from the farm's 2,000 freerange chickens and its freshly picked chemical-free vegetables, all grown within 50 metres of the sauna. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.madyolkfarm.com\">www.madyolkfarm.com</url></p><p>Wild Atlantic Seaweed Baths Doolin</p><p>Fisher Street, Ballaghaline, Doolin, Co Clare The sight of a dozen repurposed whiskey barrels filled with hot seawater and seaweed has become a familiar one on Doolin Pier, and the team at Wild Atlantic Seaweed Baths have now added a 'seafoam sauna' to round off the experience. With more than 500 varieties of seaweed found around the coast of Ireland and a long tradition of use for healing in this country, it was only a matter of time before this nutrientpacked algae was combined with sauna. The ritual of bathing in magnesium and iodine-rich seaweed, followed by a saunainduced sweat and intermittent dips in the Atlantic Ocean, makes this pairing a draw for anyone seeking a natural glow.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wildatlanticseaweedbaths.com\">www.wildatlanticseaweedbaths.com</url></p><p>Galgorm 136 Fenaghy Road, Ballymena, Co Antrim, BT42 1EA A gong goes to herald the beginning of the thrice-daily Aufguss sessions in Galgorm's 'Celtic Infusion Spa'. Aufguss is a German word meaning infusion, but in the world of sauna, it refers to a ritual where an Aufguss master pours water infused with essential oils on the sauna stove's stones to create steam. Often to a background of music, the Aufguss master then spins and swishes a towel to conduct the fragrant steam around the room, intensifying the humidity and feeling of heat for the bathers. As mad as it might sound, it can be a lot of fun. Aufguss dominates in European spas, with countries like Denmark, the Czech Republic and Italy being avid devotees. Now a burgeoning trend in Ireland, Galgorm, the luxury spa outside of Ballymena, has produced two UK Aufguss champions (yes, there are competitions) in Zak Moore and Pavel Poliacek.

The jagged pyramid of Skellig Michael rises eight miles out at sea from St Finian's Bay, where Skellig Sauna has a prime perch. There is a sense of the ethereal, as people move between hot and cold, all within the eyeline of this island that has inspired human devotion for centuries. The bay takes its name from the monk who used to row from the monastic site on the island to say mass at Keel on the mainland. Colin Walsh, a Cahersiveen local who keeps the Skellig Sauna fires warm, has other locations at Ballinskelligs Beach and Cuas Crom, but St Finian's Bay brings the visual drama. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.skelligsauna.ie\">www.skelligsauna.ie</url></p><p>Glendalough Sanctuary</p><p>Brockagh, Co Wicklow, A98 VK68 Built into the side of a hill, this pocket sauna has a beautiful view over Derrybawn Mountain.

There is no silver-bullet solution, but scientists at Maynooth University are applying a breadth of thinking and innovation with a view to putting farming on a surer footing.</p><p>The ultimate aim, says Prof Gerry Lacey, head of the department of electronic engineering, is to optimise yields and resource use  while delivering a resilient ecosystem that nurtures soil health, biodiversity and long-term environmental vitality .</p><p> Our vision is to develop robotics technology that is suited to the Irish farming environment and Irish climate,  he adds.  We re also working closely with farmers and with companies who are in the agribusiness to understand what their needs are and develop a technology that will allow farmers to solve various different issues about being able to plant earlier in the year, when the ground is wetter, because the robots are lighter. </p><p>A key priority too is to use robots with  sensing solutions  to monitor and manage crop cultivation and to deploy vertical solar panels. This also helps solve the problem of being unable to get people when you need them, he says.</p><p>While his work is  above ground , his team works closely with others looking at soil health issues.</p><p>Maynooth campus is home to a one-hectare robot farm and a sustainability research station examining how robots facilitate sustainable approaches, such as using less fertilisers and pesticides.</p><p> We re really looking to apply technology to help farmers move to a more sustainable mode of agriculture using regenerative techniques . . . We ve looked at what are the kind of problems that farmers have, and we ve tried to address those problems that are top of their minds.</p><p> Soil compaction is a big one, making the machines easy to modify and to use as much of the existing equipment as possible, rather than giving them kind of a shrink-wrapped, shiny solution. It s something that they can repair if needed, that they have more agency when it comes to that robot,  Lacey adds.</p><p>This is part of a project called Aura, which co-funded by Enterprise Ireland and Comex McKinnon.</p><p>When it comes to renewable energy, using solar in farm settings is much easier, rather than  mechanically trickier  wind.</p><p> There s no moving parts in a solar panel, so that means they re much easier to maintain. They re relatively low to the ground, so particularly in the vertical solar panels they re very, very easy to install. It s basically a fence,  he says.</p><h>Upright panels with flexible roles </h><p/><h>They are investigating with farmers the effectiveness of vertical solar, ie upright panels that cover only 10 per cent of the land compared with a traditional solar farm. Agrivoltaic systems may not be as efficient compared with the raw energy outputs of turbines, but they are cheaper to install and maintain.</h><p>Dramatic reduction in solar panel prices has coincided with them becoming more flexible. Researchers are looking at possible roles as hedgerows /fences in farm fields with double-facing solar panels generating power while acting as windbreaks for crops and livestock.</p><p>Reducing excessive shading of plants is critical. Scientists in Austria and Denmark have devised two-sided prototypes for use in vertical rows in fields, which maximises space for farming while allowing solar generation during the morning and evening if panels face east and west, which avoids shading when the sun is at its highest. </p><p>In France, flexible panels are used to protect crops including vines which are vulnerable to hail and frost.</p><p>Lacey is evaluating Irish crop growth while integrating robotics with vertical panels, allowing farmers to manage the space around them optimally. Particular conditions pertain to Ireland such as heavy soils in high rainfall areas and saturated land that can delay planting and harvesting, while the country is getting cloudier.</p><p>This has culminated in a partnership with Irish Distillers to develop an  autonomous regenerative agriculture platform  that reduces carbon outputs through robotics and advanced sensing solutions.</p><p>Along with seeking to eliminate the need for chemicals, smart farm technology allows for precision in seed planting and increased regenerative agriculture, Lacey says.</p><p>This is a conservation and rehabilitation approach focused on topsoil regeneration; increasing biodiversity, improving the water cycle, enhancing ecosystem services, supporting carbon capture, increasing resilience to climate change and strengthening the vitality of farm soil.</p><p> We will use mobile farming robots, sensing solutions and vertical solar panels to monitor and manage cereal cultivation, with the aim of optimising grain yields and resource utilisation while delivering a resilient ecosystem that nurtures soil health, biodiversity and long-term environmental vitality,  he says.</p><p>Test plots were planted in spring 2024 with a variety of crops and monitored throughout the summer with 3D cameras and soil testing before being harvested in autumn. They have developed new imaging techniques that use both the shape and colour of leaves to automatically determine plant health using low-cost mobile devices   and enable early intervention, if needed.</p><h>Energy independent </h><p/><h>A lot of work is on scaling up use of robots for planting, weeding and watering purposes.</h><p>Irish Distillers  head of sustainability and compliance Graham Caulwell says it s helping to address one of the biggest challenges of our time. </p><p> With the integration of robotics, this pioneering project aims to support regenerative agriculture while enhancing efficiency. This partnership is more than a commercial alliance; it is the fusion of shared visions for a sustainable future,  he adds.</p><p>Lacey believes robotics, sensoring technology and agrivoltaics will make farmers energy independent. He cites the case of a Waterford dairy farmer working with them using vertical solar and already saving 60 per cent of his energy costs.</p><p> This is about producing all the energy and labour they need with an ability to fix their own equipment. </p><p>But it is also about exploiting  codependence , in helping them become scientists and sharing their data with neighbours;  having the notion of meitheal .</p><p>Their work helping farmers to conduct on farm experiments aimed at improving soil health is called DNET4SSoils. It is led by his colleague Dr Conor Meade, an ecologist in the department of biology, with funding from Research Ireland.</p><p>The technology enables the gathering of crop fitness readings 24/7 from a wide diversity of crop varieties, local soil types, farm-specific soil management approaches and local microclimates. This generates a detailed, live, open-access database of crop cultivation alternatives for the farming community.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21641610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F70-W873-RS11-H35H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1230\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 27, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DS59</classCode><className>SOIL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DPKU</classCode><className>SOLAR POWER INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000047</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F8M</classCode><className>CROP &amp;

My ash plantation, like many others, had been decimated by dieback so it has been harvested and is destined for replanting under the Ash Dieback Scheme.</p><p>I will replant with a multi-species mix of Douglas fir and silver birch, to move forward from monocrop tree planting. Replanting will be designed to remove the silver birch first as it will be the first to mature, with the Douglas fir removed 15 to20 years later.</p><p>I decided to take on the ash harvest project myself rather than use contractors.</p><p>I imported from Finland a machine called a Syketec JOBO ST55, which fits onto my 360 excavator. This machine clamps onto the tree, saws it, fells it, de-limbs it and logs it into required lengths - 3m in my case.</p><p>My intention is to firewood these logs when they dry age next year as a farm diversification project.</p><p>With the dry autumn, we took the opportunity to sow winter beans, whereas in previous years we grew only spring-sown beans. Beans are an ideal break crop, with no fertiliser nitrogen requirement and a decent protein aid payment to make them worthwhile.</p><p>The variety was Wizard sown at 280kg/ha. For this job, we used a 3m</p><p>Claydon strip till drill, modifying the shares to place the seed deeper at 100mm. We also replaced the leading legs with discs to prevent blockages from the chopped barley straw from the previous crop.</p><p>The row spacing was 220mm. This worked extremely well as there was a large volume of chopped straw on the ground. The beans now look a picture as they all struck. There was no crow damage, even though there is a rookery on the farm.</p><p>By getting a chance to sow winter beans instead of spring beans we have a 75/25pc winter/spring crop split for 2025 with very little sowing left, only spring malting barley remaining.</p><p>In January, I joined a regenerative agriculture programme partnered by Boortmalt and Soil Capital. This aims to pay growers a bonus for regenerative farming practices and carbon capture on their farms.</p><p>I look forward to working with them on measures to reduce Scope 3 emissions, and feel this programme is ideal for my farming system.</p><p>My malting barley ground had the overwintered cover crop sprayed off on March 4 with Glyphosate 450 at 2.7L/ha.</p><p>The next task will be to broadcast N, P, K fertiliser onto the stubble followed by a shallow 10mm stubble disking before direct drilling. This year I am growing Planet and a new malting variety Florence.</p><p>Finally, I received my approval for the Farming for Water EIP Project which I applied for a few months ago. I will delve more into the environmental measures I will implement on the farm as the year progresses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tom Tierney in his 40ac forest on his farm at Ballinafagh, Prosperous, Co Kildare.

Nestl\u00e9 is working closely with farmers across the world to support them to adopt regenerative agriculture practices that can create a more resilient and sustainable food system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With more than 70% of the company's greenhouse gas emissions coming from the production of ingredients, working with farmers is an essential step in reducing its environmental impact.</p><p>Country Manager at Nestl\u00e9 Ireland, Kieran Conroy, says: \"Regenerative agriculture is fundamental if we are to achieve a more sustainable food system that protects and restores the environment whilst also helping to improve farmer and community livelihoods.\"</p><p>The food system today vs the food system of tomorrow The food system we have today is a significant contributor to the climate crisis and is often at the centre of a number of environmental and societal challenges, but it also has a unique opportunity to be a significant part of the solution.</p><p>This is where action by companies like Nestl\u00e9 are important. Conroy explains that \"We take action at all stages across the value chain, right from the sourcing of the raw ingredients that make up our products, through manufacturing and distribution, to the way we package products and how consumers use and dispose of them.\" He adds \"It's only by taking this endto-end view that we can ensure our actions are making a difference.\" Regenerative agriculture in practice As Conroy explains that regenerative agriculture is important to tackle both the climate and nature crises and that it can play a critical role in ensuring food security, but it can only be achieved by working in collaboration with farmers. \"It's only by engaging and building trust with farmers that we are able to work together to implement a range of practices that work in harmony with nature. We won't be able to meet our goals to source regeneratively produced ingredients and halve emissions by 2030 to reach net zero by 2050, without them.\"</p><p>\"At our Wyeth Nutrition facility in Limerick, 70% of conventional milk powder is sourced from locally approved suppliers, all of whom also have their own sustainability certification. For our internationally sourced ingredients such as cocoa and coffee we have robust sustainability plans, such as our Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan where we are the first confectionery company in Ireland to use 100% certified sustainable cocoa for all our confectionery brands,\" adds Conroy.</p><p>But the company's ambitions go beyond just its own supply chain and it is keen to work in partnership with other organisations operating in the same landscape to scale up these opportunities. One approach that supports this is Landscape Enterprise Networks (LENs), which connects different stakeholders who rely on and benefit from nature in the landscape, with land managers to create regional, self-governing, trading networks. LENs programmes aim to deliver a wide range of outcomes from improved water quality, flood defence, securing carbon and improving air quality, and have collaboration at their core.</p><p>\"We are committed to being a part of the solution to achieve a more sustainable food system that is good for both people and planet.

As we stand on the edge of another industrial revolution, education must bridge this gap with knowledge, skills, tools and the sustainability mindset needed for meaningful change.</p><p>While most people are aware of renewable energy and decarbonisation, the green economy extends far beyond these pillars. Working on the frontlines of sustainability education, we are witnessing the emergence of entirely new career paths, such as circular economies to regenerative agriculture and climate technology. In fact, some of the jobs our students will pursue don't even exist yet.</p><p>Green innovation and sustainability mindset Technology is central to environmental solutions, from managing smart grid systems and wind turbines to optimising resource efficiency through data analytics. However, key to any career in sustainability is understanding the climate crisis and the why behind the green transition, in order to create a future world that works for both people and planet.</p><p>Starting early, thinking long-term As the education system undergoes reform in both primary and senior cycles, we have an opportunity to create an education system that meets the needs of planetary boundaries, innovation and future careers.</p><p>As a not-for-profit social enterprise delivering programmes in 500 schools nationwide, we see the appetite for climate literacy education. However, schools face challenges with curriculum constraints, teacher training and funding. Through collaboration with teachers, principals and community leaders, we are working to overcome these barriers.</p><p>Climate literacy empowers the future Investing in climate literacy and green skills will empower students to shape a sustainable future. What's more, it's morally and ethically the right thing to do for the future of our planet. By collaborating with educators, communities and industry, we can ensure our young people are ready to seize the opportunities of the green economy and create a world of abundance.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Susan Adams CEO, Education for Sustainability</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-201176842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DKY-MX91-DYTY-C3P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 9, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTM4N0UwOUZFNzc0NDhDOUIzNDNCODU4Mzg5NDE1REQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTRGMkI4ODIzRjgxNEE2RkE2OEE5MTU0MDdFM0Y5RjI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001938</classCode><className>EDUCATION &amp;

Luke Blackwell from CBS Thurles was the runner up individual project at the recent BT Young Scientist and Technology Exhibition.  His project, 'a novel approach to regenerative agriculture through the use of comfrey as a sustainable soil enhancer' also won the ABP Farm Sustainability Award at the event. Comfrey is a plant native to Ireland, which grows in ditches and hedgerows. </p><p>And it was in the hedgerows of his parents' farm near Roscrea that Luke's projected originated. \"I had heard comfrey is high in nitrogen, and I researched it further and found that some gardeners use it, but there's no research on it on a full agricultural scale,\" he says. \"Most farmers would be familiar with comfrey. It's a perennial plant that grows around the edges of fields on most farms. It's quite a large, broad-leafed green plant with purple and blue flowers.\"  \"  Luke's project started in January las year, researching the plant and its structure and its relationship with the environment, then he carried out field trials. \"There was comfrey growing on the farm, so I harvested the leaves and stalks in March and decomposed them down to a liquid and mulch and used the liquid as a fertiliser,\" he says.  His study compared comfrey against artificial fertilisers, focusing on its impact on soil health, crop yield and environmental sustainability. Trials on the family farm demonstrated that comfrey improves soil structure, enhances organic matter and reduces nitrate runoff by 16.7pc, lowering CO2 emissions by 10.6pc compared to artificial fertilisers.  Combining comfrey with slurry further enhanced its effectiveness, providing a practical and sustainable solution to regenerative farming challenges in Ireland, Luke says. \"My dad, David, runs a beef and tillage farm on the Offaly border. It's an interest of mine to put science towards farming to see if we can make it more efficient and sustainable,\" Luke says. \"I wanted to test it combined with slurry and biochar and different things like that. I compared it against artificial fertiliser, and I found that the artificial fertiliser produced a greater yield in terms of the grain weight or the straw weight, but the comfrey improved the soil health a lot more in relation to the organic matter, the earthworm activity and the root structure.\"  \"  Luke conducted the trials on his family's 140ac farm. The spring barley trial ran from April to September, and the grass was over the summer. This month, Luke has begun a trial on winter barley.\"The very low cost of producing the liquid from the comfrey plant outweighed the gain from the artificial fertilisers so it actually resulted in a profit increase,\" he says. \"Even though the artificial fertiliser produced a greater yield of barley, comfrey was extremely low cost. \"Teagasc has a lot of research on organic manure, like slurry and dung, but there's not very much research on comfrey as an agricultural fertiliser. \"My father is very interested to see different ways of becoming more sustainable so he is happy to let me do my experiments on it.\"  \"  Now, the next step for Luke is to look into more detail about how the comfrey liquid fertiliser could be produced on a larger scale and the practical application of it</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Luke Blackwell, a transition-year student in CBS Thurles, with his BT Young Scientist runner-up award in the individual ABP Farm Sustainability section.

She's talking about a holiday to the \"spectacular and beautiful\" Bahamas she and her sister Peaches took last year. The sisters spent idyllic childhoods there, and have a half-sister and half-brother who still live in the Caribbean. (\"Our dad was married several times,\" says Domini.) Peaches is the older of the two and, while they look quite different, the sisters spend so much time together that they finish each other's sentences. If Domini is slightly distracted and checks her phone frequently, it's understandable. She's about to become a grandmother. (A few days later, Lauren, the eldest of her two daughters, gives birth to a baby girl).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a weird thing,\" she says, \"because it's wonderful but, at the same time, I'm thinking, 'Does my child really have to go through this?'\" The sisters came to be born in the Bahamas because that's where their Scottish father, Roy, and Dublin mother, Val, met.</p><p>\"Our dad was an accountant, and our mum travelled out as an au pair to mind children,\" says Peaches. \"The Bahamas is a very beautiful place to grow up. We came to Ireland on holiday every summer.\"</p><p>Roy died in 1982, when Peaches was 17 and Domini only 10. \"He'd had health issues for quite some time,\" says Domini, \"but he was only 57. Our whole world was turned upside down.\"</p><p>Val decided to bring her daughters back to Ireland and the family settled in Meath.</p><p>\"I was supposed to go back to the US, where I'd been to high school, for university but I ended up enrolling in Alix Gardner's cookery school and qualifying there,\" says Peaches. \"It was intended to be a stopgap, but my family - Mum and Dom - were here, and I had no real ties on that side of the Atlantic any more. Really our home was in Europe.\"</p><p>Initially, Peaches found it hard to settle; she missed her friends.</p><p>\"But Ireland is a small place and you can meet people very quickly. There was a racetrack in The Bahamas, and Mum was always trying to train young horses and sell them on, and Dom and I were always around horses; we were all horse crazy. When we moved back to Ireland, Mum did well buying and selling horses. I was doing showjumping and met my future husband through horse racing. So I formed a lot of friendships quite quickly.\"</p><p>For Domini, the transition was more difficult. \"When we first came back, I went to Headfort boarding school for the first year. Dad had just died, I was coming from a very warm tropical climate into a very \u2026 different sort of place. It was a real shock and I struggled. I was so homesick.</p><p>\"If you said nowadays you were sending your kids to boarding school at 10 or 11, people would think you were cruel, but it was par for the course back then. I went home at weekends, but Sunday nights were awful \u2026 you'd be home, eating something lovely and the fire would be lit and all you could think about was having to go back.</p><p>\"Of course, I'd manufacture tummy pains or headaches to delay the 7pm departure time. One night, Peaches dropped me and drove off and I ran down the drive chasing after the car in the dark. I was so miserable. Eventually, I got over it; I still have friends from there and we do laugh about the horror of it. Headfort was a great school, but Alex [Alexandra College, where she went to secondary school], was like summer camp in comparison.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Peaches was dividing her time between horses and catering, and had married. She drafted teenage Domini and her friends in to help out waitressing at events - 'cheap labour', she admits. Domini would sometimes help with the cooking; Peaches remembers her being very good from a young age, even without any formal training.</p><p>\"She was a natural, she'd picked it up from Mum, who'd gone to Cathal Brugha Street but conveniently forgot how to cook once we knew how.\"</p><p>Domini had no interest in school and, when she left, having competed at junior level and represented Ireland in the hunter pony category, tried to make a go of an equestrian career, but found it hard to make the transition to senior level competition. She worked for a Grand Prix showjumper in the US, bought and sold horses, did some teaching and had a tack shop.</p><p>\"I was always trying to hustle because the horses were expensive. I tried to get sponsorship but, in the end, had to accept that continuing wasn't practical. I lacked that killer streak and was too soft to make a career out of it.\"</p><p>She took herself off to Leith's Cookery School in London for a year to get a qualification.</p><p>\"I thought I'd make a career in restaurants and cooking,\" she says. \"I went out to Atlanta to cook during the 1996 Olympics. And then I came back to Ireland and ended up meeting Conrad [Gallagher]. And that was that.\"</p><p>Conrad Gallagher's Peacock Alley had just moved from Baggot Street to South William Street, and Ireland's first celebrity chef - known for his 'tall' food - was in need of help. Depending on the day, Domini was in the kitchen or front of house, running the office, doing whatever needed to be done.</p><p>\"Conrad was an exciting young chef who had landed on the scene and people wanted recipes. He got a book deal, and I looked after all the parts of the business that you don't have time for if you're an owner-operator. The publicity was plentiful and there was always a splash about everything - Conrad was very visible in a way that was unusual at the time, a great presence and a great personality. I was trying to harness that and it was a lot of everything.\"</p><p>Domini and Conrad were together for three intense years, during which they had their daughter, Lauren, won a Michelin Star and moved the restaurant to the Fitzwilliam Hotel. It was all too much.</p><p>When the couple went their separate ways, Peaches and her husband, who were also in business together, were splitting up too. Having always been close, the sisters grew even closer as they supported each other through difficult times and tried to figure out how they might work together.</p><p>\"It was a natural progression,\" says Peaches, \"to do something together. A no-brainer. We didn't have to think twice.\"</p><p>And so Itsa Bagel was born. Domini wanted a daytime business that would allow her to be at home with her young daughter in the evenings, and they both felt there was a dearth of casual eateries in Dublin. Bagels were something they'd enjoyed in New York and thought would go down well in Ireland.</p><p>\"We felt we could do something a bit different, and do some really gorgeous fillings that weren't just sliced red cheddar,\" says Peaches. \"That's where our cooking skill came into it because we were making everything fresh each day on site in this tiny kitchen. We started out with the two of us in December of 1999, and suddenly there were five of us in there and we were churning out an enormous amount of food.\"</p><p>Itsa Bagel's first home was in the Epicurean Food Hall, home to an eclectic bunch of food entrepreneurs before Dublin had anything approaching what you might call a food scene, and just across the road from the smart Itsa Bagel in Arnotts on Abbey Street, where we are meeting.</p><p>Initially, they imported frozen bagels from H&amp;H in New York, but realised how vulnerable their supply was during the Iraq war when the frozen containers were commandeered for food for US troops. They partnered with McCloskey's Bakery in Drogheda,</p><p>who have supplied them with bagels ever since. Itsa Bagel's core range has remained unchanged in 25 years, though they have made tweaks to the fillings in deference to changing tastes. At (EURO)7.75 ,th e Clu b- chicken, bacon, Wicklow brie, red onion relish, tomato, lettuce, mayo and butter - remains Itsa Bagel's biggest seller; the price compares well to that of other lunch options around the city.</p><p>\"We've always kept it affordable,\" says Peaches. \"We've survived the dotcom bubble, the recession, Covid. It does feel like people are getting more price sensitive now though, and that's a hard thing for businesses to be able to juggle.\"</p><p>When carbs began to fall out of favour, the sisters had already begun to diversify, and where once there were multiple Itsa Bagel outlets, now there is just the one. But the sisters are partners in Feast, run by Peaches, which operates the Commons cafe in MoLi, provides the food in the Royal College of Physicians Ireland, and has a big wedding catering operation at Powerscourt. Their B2B operation makes sandwiches, salads and some goodies for Butlers Chocolate cafes.</p><p>Separately, Domini is CEO of Valence Hospitality, where her business partner is Brian Montague of the Winding Stair Group, which operates Nancy Hands pub on Parkgate Street and Lottie's restaurant in Rathmines.</p><p>Between these businesses, Peaches and Domini employ 130 people (85 at Feast/Itsa Bagel and 45 at Valence) and share some services such as procurement, health and safety and HR, tapping into economies of scale. Peaches, who got the accountancy gene from her father, looks after the financial side of the business.</p><p>\"We've learned, over the years, just how important speedy financial information is. You have to be on it. That way, you see the trends very quickly. It's about making sure you give good quality and good service, and that the margins are there. It has been hard because the cost of everything is rising.</p><p>\"When you look at all the obligations hospitality business owners have, with additional bills for everything from outdoor seating to the grease trap licence, it's not surprising there's a sense of fatigue. It's a hard business and we're seeing people being driven out of the sector because they've just had enough. Perhaps because we've weathered so many storms, we know you can never take your foot off the gas, or allow yourself to be overwhelmed with things that come and hit you. It is just part and parcel of being in business and changing economic tides.\"</p><p>After working together for so many years, the Kemp sisters appear to be blessedly free of the tensions plaguing so many other family businesses, and after a quarter of a century in business together, neither is thinking about retirement.</p><p>\"I know this sounds cheesy,\" says Peaches, \"but I love it all. I really do. I love the different aspects of the business. I love the team, I love working with them. And when you've been doing it as long as we have, you know the things to avoid and the things that work. Personally, I'm in a great space, loving what I do and loving every day. Of course, there are challenges, and you can never be complacent, but I don't think there's anything I really don't like doing.\"</p><p>\"The infuriating aspects of the business would be things like why does the dishwasher break at 9.30pm on the Saturday of a bank holiday weekend and not on the Monday morning?\" says Domini.</p><p>\"But age is a wonderful thing to give you perspective and a sense of confidence; you become much more able to recognise those moments for what they are. I keep looking at the bigger picture, being genuinely grateful we are still in business after 25 years.</p><p>\"I was walking past the Trocadero yesterday, and they're now able to say they're Dublin's oldest restaurant. That is such an achievement. We've always tried to drive the business, remain current, do new things, develop new concepts and new brands. And we've done that, we've tried to push from a creative and culinary aspect. Maybe it would've been easier if we had just done one thing and expanded? Perhaps.\"</p><p>There have been blips along the way, brands that did not last. Alchemy, Hatch and Joe's coffee have been consigned to history. But the sisters take these failures on the chin rather than personally.</p><p>\"It's more about running a successful business and learning, rather than being upset if people don't respond to something,\" says Peaches.</p><p>\"There's always a bigger picture.

Many farmer ash plantations have been destroyed, as has ash in natural woodlands.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fireblight infected whitethorn is likely to die. The vast majority of our hedgerows consist of whitethorn. If fireblight spreads further, our landscapes will change dramatically. What can farmers do? Replace diseased trees with healthy Irish plants, and when buying insist on getting a Provenance Cert. Years ago the advice was that when you cut down one tree, you plant two.</p><p>Ash damaged/ killed with dieback become brittle and less flexible in the wind and are likely to fall. All damaged trees within falling distance of roads should be removed before they become a hazard.</p><p>Removal of diseased trees and the litter (leaves and bits of branches) under them will reduce disease spread. Soil degradation Regenerative agriculture is increasingly seen as a viable solution to soil degradation, biodiversity loss and climate change.</p><p>This combines ancient knowledge and cutting-edge science, restoring soil health and functionality through sustainable practices, and optimising agricultural productivity while enhancing environmental resilience. Cover crops Planting non-crop species primarily to cover the soil reduces soil erosion, improves soil structure, enhances moisture retention and increases biodiversity, as well as suppressing weeds.</p><p>Leguminous cover crops, for example, have the unique ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen, enriching the soil for subsequent crops.</p><p>The integration of cover crops leads to a notable increase in soil organic matter, which is crucial for improving water-holding capacities and nutrient availability.</p><p>However, the establishment of cover crops often presents challenges, particularly related to timing and management. Planting cover crops earlier in the season and employing multi-species mixtures will foster resilience against pest pressures. Integration of livestock The ancient practice of integrating livestock into arable rotations is gaining renewed interest, as it can enhance overall soil health and productivity. Specialisation, with farms becoming exclusively dairying, beef, tillage or sheep, has resulted in damage to land and biodiversity.</p><p>The older practice of rotating grass and tillage had numerous agronomic and environmental benefits.</p><p>Conventional tillage and dairy farmers have lots to learn from organic farmers. The target of putting 10pc of our land into organic production opens up a huge opportunity of exporting agricultural manures to organic units as well as to tillage lands.</p><p>Controlled grazing can help to optimise soil nutrients, improve pasture health and manage organic waste effectively. Livestock manure is a valuable resource, adding substantial organic matter and nutrients back into the soil.</p><p>Grazing animals can also help in the management of cover crops by naturally reducing biomass, thereby minimising mechanical cultivations and pesticide usage.</p><p>The livestock benefit from quality forage, while crop land experiences enhanced soil aeration and structure through animal hoof action. Rotational grazing allowing land to rest and recover will enhance biodiversity and resilience.</p><p>Soil biological health This is crucial for maintaining sustainable agricultural systems. Microbial activity is the driver of soil regenerative practices.</p><p>Soil organisms, including bacteria and fungi, play essential roles in nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition and disease suppression.</p><p>Soil biological health is improved by reduced tillage, applications of animal manures and compost, and the introduction of biochar.</p><p>Reduced tillage, in particular, minimises soil disruption, facilitating the formation of stable aggregates that provide habitats for soil organisms. Conclusion Regenerative agriculture techniques that harmoniously blend old traditions with modern innovations holds promise for creating resilient agricultural systems.</p><p>PJ Phelan is a tillage advisor based in Tipperary; he is a member of the ACA and ITCA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ireland's whitethorn hedges are facing a significant threat from fireblight infection.

On the top part was a picture of chickens inside a straw-bedded house labelled 'barn-fed eggs' in the middle was a picture of caged chickens labelled 'organic eggs' and on the bottom part was 'pasture-fed eggs', with hens happily pecking grass outside.</p><p>Obviously organic hens are not caged or permanently housed. Yet this post had garnered so many likes and favourable comments from people who clearly didn't understood the hoops farmers jump through to become organic or even Bord Bia certified. 'Pasture-fed' and 'regenerative farming' are just well-meaning buzzwords without any certification backing in Ireland. In the UK and America, they've started trying to develop standards but they are still a long way off any worldwide or even EU-wide agreement.</p><p>And I'll give you an example of why consumers falling for these buzzwords is dangerous.</p><p>One of our social media reels was outlining how few organic dairy farmers there are in Ireland and a comment in the response section said \"even fewer regenerative farmers\". Well, don't worry anonymous internet commentator: because there is zero credential vetting of 'regenerative farming', I can now start calling the farm a 'regenerative' organic micro-dairy and be as rare as a dairy rainbow unicorn.</p><p>Of course, because of this lack of verification the term 'regenerative' has been hijacked by big corporations cashing in on consumer gullibility. You now have everyone from Mc- Donald's to Nestl\u00e9 claiming that they are supporting farmers who take up regenerative farming.</p><p>Don't think this is just an issue for organic farmers - anything with a Bord Bia logo in a shop is also likely to be met with a sigh of, \"but is it regenerative?\".</p><p>It's clearly something Bord Bia is monitoring, since a page of their website is dedicated to it, with the statistic that 72pc of customers in the US say it's important when choosing a supplier that they are \"supporting regenerative agriculture programmes and the promotion of healthy soils\".</p><p>The 'regenerative consumer community' are the ones with the money in their pockets willing to splash out on this buzzword. Waitrose, the supermarket Mecca for the UK middle class, has bought into the regenerative term in a big way.</p><p>Anyone who watched Clarkson's Farm will be familiar with the renowned DJ turned farmer Andy Cato who co-founded a company called Wildfarmed. Waitrose now stocks their bread and they're taking off in other shops and restaurants too.</p><p>In fairness, they have developed regenerative standards that their farmer suppliers have to meet, and I have nothing against trying to find a way to improve farming to help nature and make money for farmers.</p><p>However, the term 'regenerative' is still cavorting freely around its own version of the Wild West.</p><p>For example, here is what Bord Bia says regenerative farming is: \"An agricultural system that puts more back into the environment and society than it takes out.</p><p>\"By naturally reintroducing carbon and nutrient resources back into the land, this approach can support ecosystem health, mitigate climate change, and support farmers and their livelihoods through more reliable growing yields.\"</p><p>What farmer doesn't agree with that? Maybe we're all regenerative farmers, except I feel like the true advocates of the regenerative area would take issue with us all jumping on the regenerative bandwagon. So maybe they should introduce a certification body before we all start sticking the term on our labels.</p><p>As it is, I might as well tell the team to put it on our social media and website if that's what consumers want. Bring on the regenerative, organic micro-dairy rainbow unicorn.

At times it felt closer to one of those fancy summer schools than the Ploughing, but then when it comes to agriculture these days, there's much to discuss.</p><p>There was a general consensus that the current farming system is broken and that the current agriculture policy, which one speaker described as \"leave it to Tesco et al\", is not helping.</p><p>For many, regenerative agriculture is the answer.</p><p>John Cherry says his definition of regen is quite simple: \"It's any way of farming that enhances the effective functioning of the various systems upon which it relies... It is outcome-based, it is less about what you do as what are the results of what you do.\"</p><p>\"I can see that's annoying to fans of clipboards,\" he said, perhaps hinting at the differences between organic farming and the burgeoning regen movement.</p><p>At a basic level, that difference can be explained as: Organic farming is about following a set of rules, whereas regenerative farming is about focusing on outcomes.</p><p>An example of this would be ploughing. Organic farmers are permitted to till their fields, to kill weeds and fertilise without artificial chemicals. Regenerative farmers, on the other hand, of which most are believers in min till, may feel that it's less damaging to sometimes spray their fields than to disturb the soil with a plough.</p><p>Among the speakers that discussed these differences was Richard Perkins, one of the world's best-known regenerative farmers, with his YouTube videos garnering some 14 million views.</p><p>Perkins built up his influential Ridgedale Farm on a shoestring budget in the harsh climatic, regulatory and economic conditions of Sweden.</p><p>\"The baseline for regenerative agriculture is it must be carbon sequestering and soil building,\" he said. \"If you're not building soil, you're in a degenerative situation.\"</p><p>He said there were a few areas where organic doesn't suit his business and he needs absolute flexibility of management at all times.</p><p>\"An organic broiler chicken must be 84 days old. Some guy in Brussels that has probably never reared a chicken made that number up, and it has no relation to the breed of chicken or their welfare.</p><p>\"I can't have someone in Brussels making decisions about how I, a poultry expert, manage my birds. It doesn't work or make sense.\"</p><p>Relationship marketing But how can consumers have faith in a system without rules?</p><p>Perkins said his farm is certified by their customers and says 'relationship marketing' is the only way for a small farm to work economically.</p><p>\"It's me having a relationship with you, my customers. I don't want to be organically certified. I want to run better than organic certified,\" he said. Whatever about the debate over the environmental merits of the system, interested farmers wanted to know - does it pay?</p><p>Gary Markham, who works for a farm advisory and accountancy business, has been benchmarking the financial performance of his regenerative arable farming clients and conventional farmers for five years.</p><p>He explained that his figures show that although regen farmers are making less money at the margin level, when subsidies, machinery costs and working capital costs are included, they are making more money than their conventional counterparts overall.</p><p>One of the most interesting discussions at the event, and well attended, was focused on this theme of making regen agriculture pay.</p><p>One of the panellists, Tim Coates, was a young farmer who recently took over his family farm and has embraced regenerative practices. However, he believes markets beyond food will be crucial to its success.</p><p>\"I've been coming to Groundswell for three years and we are still asking 'what does regenerative agriculture even mean',\" he said.</p><p>\"I think it means whatever you want it to mean as long as you as a farmer understand what it is and you can communicate that both locally and globally That's what matters because that allows you to trade in markets that are coming.</p><p>\"There is a real risk out there as regenerative agriculture becomes a corporate buzzword that the existing processor actors will try to capture that value themselves, and it wont stay at the farm level. The regenerative premium is not a myth, but it won't be a universal panacea.\"</p><p>Instead, Coates believes the ability of regen farmers to sell ecosystem services such as carbon credits or biodiversity credits will become important income sources in the future.</p><p>The potential of these 'nature markets' was much discussed at the show and several companies in this space were exhibitors seeking to advise farmers on how they can capitalise on them. One company had a banner saying 'BPS is ending - Start receiving carbon payments instead'.</p><p>Nick Down manages a vast 3,000ha estate in Berkshire, and he has been acutely aware of the major changes to farm subsidies in the wake of Brexit.</p><p>In a bid to reduce the impact of these changes on its bottom line, the estate has gradually adopted many regenerative agriculture practices, but</p><p>Down highlighted it must still make sense for the shareholders. \"We took out much of the unproductive and poorly returning land that came with a payment, which was great. It allowed us to streamline the farming operation and stop wasting inputs. When I joined, we were growing four or five crops, and now we have 10 to 11 crops.</p><p>\"We are starting to take cultivation out of our system and integrate cover crops and herbal leys. We have halved our fuel use.\"</p><p>Malting barley However, it hasn't been all straightforward, and Down highlighted his difficulties in securing the coveted 'regenerative premium. He spoke about the experience of trying to partner with a local brewery selling their sustainably-produced malting barley.</p><p>\"We spent a lot of time talking, got their guys out into the field. They said 'this is great. We can use this and all our marketing material. Fantastic. So let's talk about the price of this barley.' It was probably \u00a320/t more, or something like this. Everyone took three steps back and started shaking their head and said absolutely no way, we can't afford to do that.</p><p>\"Everyone buys into the system, but when it starts to cost them, they are not quite so keen. I guess that's one of the key challenges. Can the general public afford to pay for a more sustainable product? I know I can deliver it. Are people happy to pay for it? I think we know the answer,\" he said in a not optimistic tone.</p><p>There are no easy solutions to making any type of farming pay and regenerative agriculture is no different, Clare Hill, another regenerative farmer, said.</p><p>Her advice was to grab the government money while you can as it's probably not going to be around forever, but don't rely on it. She encouraged farmers to think of their long-term farm goals: \"Ask yourself: what do you want this farm to be like 50-100 years down the line?</p><p>\"Do we want it to be vibrant with life?</p><p>Do we really want healthy soils?

They had an array of animals including cows, pigs and chickens that they considered their pets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The commercial enterprise that their parents built closed down in 2008 but the sisters have brought it back to life in the last few years, using regenerative farming to sell organic beef and eggs in markets and shops around the country.</p><p>\"We closed everything down when my father died in 2008,\" says Ashling. \"Back then, my father would be travelling for the business while our mum ran the commercial beef enterprise. \"My sister and I moved away from the farm after that - I was living in France with my partner.</p><p>\"For a few years, the farm was forgotten - there were no animals on the land.</p><p>\"A few years before I moved back from France, my mum and sister did get a few animals back but on a very small scale. My mum loved her cows, she wanted to get them back again. So around five years ago, they got five calves and raised them up.</p><p>\"Around the same time, I started growing vegetables in our little garden. I guess you can take the girl out of the farm but not the farm out of the girl.</p><p>\"I always wanted to come back to Ireland, be with my mother and sister and come back to the farm, but we never really knew what we could do to make a living from it again.\"</p><p>The three Carolan women returned to their 60ac farm. After putting their minds together, they arrived at a business plan, and in 2019, they turned to regenerative agriculture. Today, SeanNua farm in Bailieborough has around 10 cows, and they use AI with their mix of breeding stock including Angus, Aubrac and Limousin.</p><p>\"We started working towards rebuilding the farm in 2017 - we buried ourselves in research, we did some online training in regenerative agriculture to make sure what we were building would never be forgotten again and that it could sustain itself,\" says Ashling.</p><p>\"I came back home during Covid in 2020 and I decided to stay. I was still working remotely for my job in France when we were in the thick of bringing the farm back to life.</p><p>\"We started to prepare things. In 2019, our plan was to start with transforming the beef into a direct sales model, where the animals would be 100pc grass-fed and you would manage everything, from sourcing the abattoir and the butcher to packaging the beef up.</p><p>\"We also wanted to set up a market garden enterprise and a pastured egg enterprise.\"</p><p>Once they had their business goals set, they trialled pastured beef around Christmas time for two years. In 2021, they started attending farmers markets and entered their first season of growing.</p><p>They learned from other farmers that they aspired to be like; over time they tailored it to their farm.</p><p>\"We had to do a lot of online research and we bought a lot of books,\" says Ashling. \"The market garden and the enterprise itself was modelled after farms we wanted to be more like.</p><p>\"After that first year, we made it our own and adapted because our context is very different. A lot of Cavan is very hilly, the fields are bumpy and the gaps are narrow.\"</p><p>The sisters built three small polytunnels and two garden areas, to use up all the spaces that had been forgotten before.</p><p>The first market garden area was repurposed from a place where their parents used to store silage in the winter. They filled the compact ground with organic matter and changed it up for the market.</p><p>\"A lot of what we were trying to do was on a shoestring budget - we didn't receive any funding from anywhere so it was all self-funded,\" says Ashling.</p><p>\"We wanted everything to be mobile so we built it that way. Then the installation of the market garden and the polytunnels were the main structural changes once we picked the farm back up.\"</p><p>One of the unusual elements is the 'egg-mobile' that Ashling's partner built himself using an old container that had been left on the farm for nearly 20 years.</p><p>\"The initial mobile unit that we built for the chickens just didn't work on our field, it was too bumpy and the unit was too close to the ground,\" says Ashling.</p><p>\"In that first year, it was too complicated to move around in that area - we would get stuck when all the birds came out of the flock. So we raised the coop a lot higher and realised that it gave us more space to work.</p><p>\"We built a second one when that worked. We used an old container from the farm and put it on a new chassis and changed the entire floor, so it's a lot higher and lot narrower, it's a lot easier to move from field to field.</p><p>\"It's all functioning a lot better and we've learnt a lot of things like this over the years that work specifically for us.\"</p><p>'I guess you can take the girl out of the farm but not the farm out of the girl'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Clockwise from above: Ashling Carolan (middle) with her partner Greg and daughters Lily and Luna and her sister Grace on their farm Sean Nua at Curkish, Co Cavan; the flock of hens; the mobile coop; and the family run an honesty box.

Luna is made with malts grown to principles of regenerative agriculture, and biodynamic means working with cycles of the moon for aging. The cuv\u00e9e method is the barrelling each years' whiskey (vintage) and blending to create a unique character year to year. As each vintage matures, no two Cuv\u00e9e releases are the same. An exciting addition to any at-home whiskey library.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ballyvolane House Spirits, Crab Apple Gin Liqueur</emphasis></p><p>Using a mix of crab apples from their own orchard and from Blackwater Valley neighbours in Cappoquin, fruits are aged in classic Bertha's Revenge Gin for several months then enmeshed with honey, jaggery cane sugar syrup and cloves to turn the gin infused apples into a gloriously winterish tipple. Sip slowly over ice or shake into cocktails.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Irish Fruit Wines</emphasis></p><p>I'm excited about exploring Ireland's growing enthusiasm for making exquisite wines from classic Irish fruits such as apples, pears and berries. Among my favourites are:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Killahora Orchard's Fine Perry</emphasis> made from perry pears grown in a 200-year-old orchard in Cork.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wicklow Way Wines Blackberry Wine</emphasis> is a medium-bodied red with rich complex fruit flavour.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nohoval Apple Wines Apple Oak Wine</emphasis> is made with Dabinett apples, fermented for four months, and aged in Muscadet oak barrels for a minimum two years. This wine will surprise you by delivering all you ever wanted in a full-bodied red wine, but from Irish grown apples instead.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Two Stacks Irish Whiskey, Double Irish Cream Liqueur</emphasis></p><p>Distilling and bonding whiskey in Newry since 2020, Two Stacks is the venture of three friends with an exciting take on modern Irish whiskey. Their Double Irish Cream Liqueur is a world's first using a blend of four different whiskey styles with way more whiskey per bottle than their nearest competitor. Perfect as a tipple on its own or pour over vanilla ice cream as a decadent dessert.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DKD-CC41-JC8V-44FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Last Saturday evening, a short message came through from a Green Party colleague who had given his all over the last five years. His three words,  l ve been eliminated , spoke volumes for how we all felt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, being in a democracy somehow helps you get over that feeling. You accept the majority opinion of your peers but draw strength from those who did vote for you. The privilege of being involved in the whole process allows you to look to come back again, with lessons learned from the school of hard knocks.</p><p>One worry from this election is that the environmental agenda we seek to represent might not be able to afford a five-year delay, or that the progress we made in recent years might slow down or come to a stop. The omens in several ways are not good. Many of the candidates who topped the polls were those who have been the most climate sceptical. Sinn F\u00e9in seems to have given up on climate ambition altogether. Several of the Independents define themselves by their opposition to the green transition.</p><h>Shelved two key memos Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael are very sensitive to losing votes to those groupings, and in recent months they too have been reading the public mood and scaling back on their own level of environmental ambition. In our last Cabinet meeting they shelved two key memos, one on sustainable transport and another on clean energy, that had been years in preparation. It was like sending a signal to the Civil Service: we re taking our foot off the pedal from here.</h><p>During the election campaign they also sent out clear messages that their preference would be to enter a coalition with the Labour Party. The only interpretation is that they think Labour might be slightly less demanding partners than we have been over the last four years. That impression of course puts the Labour Party in a real bind. Do they or the Social Democrats go into government now to deliver on the climate ambition they attest to, or do they wait for a more ideal coalition arrangement?</p><p>My advice would be that we can t really afford to delay on climate action. The actions required also bring real social justice in their wake. Promoting public transport and active travel delivers both social and health gains. The carbon tax delivers most benefit to those on the lowest incomes in the poorest homes. Regenerative agriculture will bring a better future for rural Ireland. Creating new housing in attractive environments with a strong sense of community is what the Left should be about, and can be delivered at scale in the next five years.</p><p>You are not going against the tide when you are fighting for climate action in government. The clean energy revolution is well under way and is not going to stop. Europe and Ireland are not going to regain competitiveness from burning imported fossil fuels. The only strategy that gives us real economic security and well-paid jobs is the  Green new deal  that has been legislated for in Europe and which the new Commission is now looking to deliver.</p><p>While the world is beset by populist politics, outrageous wars and economic injustice, there is a path to peace that a small island like ours can promote to real effect. The Paris Agreement should be our North Star. Many development agencies criticised the COP29 deal done in Baku as a betrayal   but delivering a  no deal  would have been a real defeat for the Paris Agreement. We did get 195 countries to commit to raising the $1.3 trillion a year for climate investment in developing countries. That investment is the best way to reduce conflict and forced migration. It means we spend less on weapons of war and more on the UN Sustainable Development goals. </p><p>Is it not better to take on that responsibility by making sure that the centre holds left, rather than letting it veer off to the right, which is the other option the electorate has delivered in the last few days?</p><p>The environmental agenda can still also hold, because despite the Green Party s electoral reverse, research tells us that the Irish people do want to play their part in addressing the biggest challenge of our time. </p><p>The tide of public thinking in this regard has, however, been out in recent years. Delivering change is hard and rarely immediately popular. It will in time turn, perhaps all the faster under a Trump presidency in the US or should the new Irish government turn their backs on what has been started here. </p><p>It continues to be our job to remind everyone of that and give our view on every legislative and executive act. We know the system inside out, from the bottom up, and we will put that experience to good use now. I am glad Roderic O Gorman will be doing so from within D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Eamon Ryan is Minister for  the Environment, Climate, Communications and Transport</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21493969</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJP-3KT1-JC8Y-80RB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"799\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 3, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

With robust targets to reduce emissions and through regenerative practices, we can reshape the food industry's impact on climate.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At Nestl\u00e9, we champion being a force for good by collaborating with suppliers to promote sustainability through income initiatives, fostering the resilience of the food chain via regenerative agriculture and establishing ambitious environmental goals throughout our global supply network.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Driving sustainable food industry change Our industry comes under as much scrutiny as any other, given it contributes a third of all humancaused greenhouse gas emissions . That's why the onus is on us to drive change. We've introduced robust targets to reduce emissions, and we're using 100% renewable energy across our sites in Ireland, as well as innovating with more sustainable packaging.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're incredibly proud of the progress we've made so far, but we know it's an ongoing journey. We're acutely aware that it's one we can't take alone. If we're going to make a real difference, it's imperative that businesses across the industry work together.</p><p>Responsible sourcing and regenerative agriculture Matt Ryan, Regeneration Lead at Nestl\u00e9 UK and Ireland, says: \"Scope 3 emissions are increasingly becoming part of conversations for businesses as we take greater responsibility for processes or actions that we don't necessarily carry out ourselves, like sourcing and transporting raw ingredients used in our products.\"</p><p>More than 70% of our carbon footprint comes from sourcing ingredients from farmers, so this is a focus area for us. That is why we are trying to do things differently through our work with farmers in Ireland. One way is by helping farmers implement regenerative agricultural practices.</p><p>We support and incentivise a holistic approach to farming that focuses on improving soil health, biodiversity and improving ecosystem functions - in harmony with high-quality food production. As a business, we have committed to sourcing 20% of ingredients through regenerative practices by 2025 and 50% by 2030.</p><p>Supporting farmers, improving livelihoods We aim not just to protect the natural world but help farmers build resilient livelihoods by ensuring their land is fit for the future. Furthermore, we're committed to supporting the next generation of farming communities, such as through initiatives to identify, nurture and develop new farming talent.</p><p>Our Income Accelerator Programme seeks to close the living income gap of cocoa-farming families and reduce child labour risk. To date, this programme is driving huge success. We have seen a 38% increase in net income by income accelerator communities, a 10% increase in child enrolment rates at school, a 55% increase in household investments and greater income diversification and improved financial access.</p><p>Over 10,000 families in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire have benefited from this programme so far. It will expand to Ghana this year, rising to 30,000 families. By 2030, the programme aims to reach an estimated 160,000 cocoa-farming families in Nestl\u00e9's global cocoa supply chain to create an impact at scale.</p><p>Engaging consumers in sustainability Moreover, we must ensure our consumers are engaged in our sustainability journey and can play their role. It's important to share positive stories about the work we're doing and highlight the choices shoppers can actively make to help drive progress.</p><p>We highlight our dairy farmer partnerships in videos showcasing milk origins, regenerative farming significance and farm-friendly practices. Plus, we enable consumers to take immediate action by highlighting whether packaging is recyclable and promoting our packaging changes across our beloved brands.</p><p>Empowering consumers for collective impact The challenges of addressing the climate crisis can feel daunting, leaving us disheartened and even powerless. That's why we must remind people that the simple steps we take can add up to make a significant difference. By choosing brands committed to sustainability, consumers drive meaningful progress at scale.</p><p>Business collaboration can encourage consumers to make sustainable choices - by offering them sustainable products to choose from and by reminding them that their decisions have an impact.</p><p>If we're going to make a real difference, it's imperative that businesses across the industry work together.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Matt Ryan Regeneration Lead, Nestl\u00e9 UK and Ireland</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-197446680</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CC0-F211-JCBW-N1NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"697\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 28, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924110GJ</classCode><className>AIR QUALITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSDM</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DPLG</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLLL</classCode><className>FOOD SALES &amp;

It comes to Blackbird Cultur Lab, Foulksmills, Wexford on May 4, beginning at 11 a.m., supported by Wexford Arts Centre.</p><p>After the screening, 'Farming for Nature' Ambassador Suzanna Crampton will respond to The Quickening in relation to regenerative farming, the importance of dung beetles and other soil creatures, and what makes a healthy soil ecology.</p><p>Presented for the first time in a major commissioned solo exhibition, The Quickening has now evolved into a must-see, must-hear multi-channel film and sound installation that explores the actions that must be taken around farming, food production and consumption in the face of present ecological and climate crises.</p><p>Blackbird Cultur-Lab is a creative cultural laboratory run by Karla S\u00e1nchez Zepeda O'Connell and Ois\u00edn O'Connell, based within a working farm that is transitioning towards regenerative agriculture practices. It aims to provide an environment for farmers, artists, academics and practitioners from various disciplines to experiment and work beyond traditional boundaries.</p><p>Both O'Connell and S\u00e1nchez have years of experience of working in the arts, education, social sciences and agriculture. They are working to transition their farm from traditional methods to regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Blackbird Cultur-Lab was also used as the location for the film and Karla S\u00e1nchez attended the Dublin feast contributing to the film libretto. The farm is a particular interest as it is a solar farm with the soil beneath the panels planted with multispecies swards, providing soil and biodiversity benefits as well as grazing for sheep.</p><p>Voices are central to creating engagement, renowned artist Deirdre O'Mahony, explained. \"The starting point has been multiple conversations between farmers, scientists and politicians at organised feasts that generated open and frank conversations about food production and current challenges.</p><p>\"These were transcribed for a libretto, developed with writer, Joanna Walsh, along with some of Ireland's most exciting singers and musicians, among them Siobh\u00e1n Kavanagh and Ultan O'Brien, each with a distinctive pitch, style, pace and vocabulary.\"</p><p>She continued: \"The sound we've created will communicate entangled human and non-human activities; sowing and harvesting, extreme weather and the hum of solar and wind farms, along with concerns about the reality of farming life; the volatile demands of the market, food regulation and policies.</p><p>\"Within the soundscape, other voices are also being heard; breathing animals, insect and soil creatures, the assembled, complex mix of voices, accents and sounds, collective roots that unsettle ideological positions of purity and righteousness.</p><p>\"The Quickening represents a polyvocal response to the most urgent questions affecting land and its inhabitants, giving voice to the invisible protagonists that shape our earth's future and an idea of being-in-common that encompasses all earthly inhabitants.\"</p><p>The Quickening will tour to six rural locations in the East and South East, among them barns, farms halls and community centres. The Walls &amp;amp; Halls Tour runs from April 18th to May 4th 2024 and visits Rathanna Community Hall, Carlow; Coolydoody Farm, Waterford; The Powerhouse, Callan, Kilkenny; STAC Chapel, Davis Road, Clonmel, Tipperary; Foresters Hall, Aughrim, Co.Wicklow; Blackbird Cultur-Lab, Foulksmills, Wexford.</p><p>Deirdre O'Mahony's The Quickening was co-produced by Georgina Jackson, \u00c9ilis Lavelle and Deirdre O'Mahony. Libretto developed by Deirdre O'Mahony and Joanna Walsh with singers/performers Branwen Kavanagh, Michelle Doyle, Siobh\u00e1n Kavanagh, Ultan O' Brien and Eoghan \u00d3 Ceannabh\u00e1in.

Nestl\u00e9's Income Accelerator Programme is helping to drive positive change for cocoa farming families</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When you nibble on a chocolate treat, how often do you think about where it has come from? If you go right down the supply chain, most of the world s cocoa comes from small, privately owned cocoa farms in Ghana, C\u00f4te d Ivoire, Cameroon and Nigeria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">West African cocoa farms are typically no larger than two to three hectares; the size of three to four soccer pitches. This can make it difficult for farmers to earn a living income. In recent times, ageing trees, crop disease and climate risks have increased the challenges they face.</p><p>Solutions to support the farmers and boost crop yields are needed. This requires investment, education and other practical support.</p><p>The Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan was launched in 2009. To date, it has engaged more than 150,000 cocoa-farming families, building on three pillars:?better farming, aiming to improve livelihoods in communities;?better lives, aiming to improve social conditions for families; and?better cocoa, aiming to improve product sustainability.</p><p>The innovative Income Accelerator Programme builds on more than a decade of experience within the Nestl\u00e9 Cocoa Plan and aims to improve the livelihoods of cocoa-farming families, while advancing regenerative agriculture practices. The ambition also includes transforming the global sourcing of cocoa to achieve full traceability and segregation of its cocoa products.</p><h>The importance of education Launched in 2022, the Income Accelerator Programme offers financial incentives and support mechanisms to encourage cocoa farming families to take action in four critical areas: enrolling children aged six to 16 in school; adopting good agricultural practices   in this case, pruning; planting additional forest and fruit trees on the farm; and diversifying income sources beyond cocoa. </h><p>Households receive a cash transfer of EUR 100 for taking action in each of these key areas. If they complete all four elements, they receive a bonus of EUR 100, meaning they can earn up to EUR 500 additional income per year in each of the first two years. The sum is paid regardless of farm size, meaning that farmers with the smallest plots are not disadvantaged.</p><p>The funds are paid in an innovative and efficient way as households receive payments via a mobile money cash transfer. The lead woman of the household is also registered and receives half of the cash transfers offered by the Income Accelerator Programme. She receives all the schooling incentive payments.</p><p>The timing of these transfers is important. Payments are staggered across the calendar year, which allows the farmer families to better budget for how the additional money is spent.</p><h>Pruning keeps the crop healthy Let s take a more detailed look at one of the main pillars of the programme: good agricultural practices. The action required to access the incentive is to prune one hectare of land. Pruning is key to keeping the trees healthy; effective pruning can dramatically increase the quality and quantity of cocoa produced versus unpruned trees. Crop disease and pests are reduced when there is better aeration around the trees. </h><p>However, it is hard, manual work for the farmer, and they may also be reluctant to undertake a harsh pruning, which can see half of the tree cut back. By establishing subsidised, professionally trained pruning groups, Nestl\u00e9 is providing farmers with the support and education to adopt these effective ways of farming, helping them understand how and when to prune their cocoa plants properly.</p><p>A report from the early stages of the 10,000 farmer test-at-scale, published this year by Kit Royal Tropical Institute, suggests the cocoa yield levels of households in the accelerator programme increased by almost one-third   32 per cent   in the 18-month period since the commencement of the programme, while school attendance rates also saw a noticeable spike among participants  families   from 79 per cent to 89 per cent.</p><p>Overall, families in the programme saw a 38 per cent rise in their income. In general, the report said the Income Accelerator Programme had significantly enhanced cocoa productivity, increased investments, and net income, mitigated diseases and pests on cocoa farms, promoted financial access and positively influenced female empowerment and child schooling rates.</p><p>The Income Accelerator Programme continues to expand, and more than 28,000 families in C\u00f4te d Ivoire and 2,000 in Ghana are already benefiting. The goal is to expand the programme to reach an estimated 160,000 cocoa farming households globally by 2030.</p><p>Alongside the Income Accelerator Programme, Nestl\u00e9 has been working with partners including the Rainforest Alliance and Cargill to create a traceable cocoa supply chain at scale.</p><p>Early 2024 saw the first KitKat bars made with cocoa mass traceable to farmers enrolled in the Income Accelerator Programme hit the shelves, arriving in Ireland from May with new  Breaks for Good  messaging on the packaging.</p><p>The cocoa from a group of income accelerator farms is segregated and kept separate all the way along the supply chain through to the European KitKat factories.</p><p>By choosing a KitKat the next time you decide to have a break, you re choosing to support a programme that is empowering farmers to build social, and economic and environmental resilience for themselves, their families and their communities.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21299116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D43-RMW1-JC8Y-8241-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"884\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 5, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001654</classCode><className>SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000047</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX000038</classCode><className>AGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DSDM</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEM CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

A reflection of innovation and emulation, they are societal signposts that draw us together. Trends tend to look to the future, but 2024's food trends show that we - the farmers, the chefs, the producers and diners - need to continue looking to the past, to tradition and heritage. Sustainability, ecology and community are the cornerstones of how and what we eat in the year ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1. Plant-based food (made with actual plants)</emphasis></p><p>Nothing annoys me more than fake meat products which seem to be full of everything except vegetables. The rise of ultra-processed vegan food is not a good sign. I don't believe the laboratory is the way forward for feeding the planet a healthy and nutritious diet. One trend that I'm looking forward to is the rise of more plant-based food that is actually made from plants and vegetables. Think beans and legumes as opposed to fake bleeding burgers. In Aniar, we offer both a 23-course tasting menu for vegetarians and vegans (only using Irish ingredients). It is certainly more popular than it was in the past and is becoming more popular as the years go by. Restaurants will have to accommodate more plant-based options on their menu, not only for customers but also for the planet. There are no two ways about it: meat consumption is far more onerous for carbon emissions than vegetables. Don't get me wrong: I love a nice Irish steak but we need to find a better balance.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Regenerative agriculture</emphasis></p><p>We need a better agricultural system and regenerative agriculture may be the way towards a more sustainable and greener future. While there is no absolute definition, regenerative agriculture includes practices that increase soil fertility and biodiversity. Less in opposition to natural forces, the regenerative movement attempts to work in harmony with its natural environment in a more holistic manner by preventing land degradation and deforestation, minimising soil disturbance (such as a no-dig philosophy) and integrating plants and animals on the same farm. As well as regenerative agriculture, regenerative tourism is going to play a part in how we eat and travel. Regenerative tourism seeks to ensure travel and tourism reinvest in people, places and nature and that it supports the long-term development of our social-ecological systems. Indeed, 'regeneration' itself might be the biggest trend in 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Seaweed</emphasis></p><p>Although buckwheat is tipped to trend in 2024, my money is still on seaweed becoming more a part of our own cuisine as well as other cuisines around the world. Seaweed is a superfood with high amounts of protein, vitamins, and minerals. Though it's gold for the Japanese, many of us treat it with scorn. Seaweed not only cleans the ocean water, it can also be farmed alongside other shellfish which makes it a truly sustainable practice going forward. We need more seaweed farms in Ireland to not only feed ourselves but also to produce a truly green export.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Mindful food and more visible nutrition</emphasis></p><p>While I don't think we're at the stage were we can offer yoga after your meal, being more mindful of the food that we cook and eat is rapidly changing our approach to restaurants, work place catering and dining at home. \"We are what we eat\", as Alice Waters observed in her recent book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We are What we Eat: A Slow Food Manifesto</emphasis> (2021). Being mindful includes being more conscious about the nutritional value of our food as opposed to simply how it tastes. Fast food may be tasty and convenient but its overconsumption is killing us in terms of its nutritional value and its effect on the planet. \"Fast food culture has become the dominant culture in the United States,\" Waters writes, \"and it is becoming the dominant culture in the world.\" Expect mindfulness and wellness (which ties in with more plant-based food) to be more present in both your food and its surroundings in 2024.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. More speciality restaurants and caf\u00e9s</emphasis></p><p>As our food culture becomes more sophisticated, the line between fine dining and a chip shop is becoming blurred. This blurring of the boundaries has already happened elsewhere, from London to New York. As chefs who once worked in fine dining spaces decide to open smaller, simpler restaurants, all of a sudden we have highly sophisticated establishments that might only serve one or two things, such as toasted sandwiches, burgers, and fried chicken. With the increased cost of food and everything that goes with it (from light and heat to rent and wages), restaurants and caf\u00e9s will have to adapt to provide a more cost-effective and financially sustainable model. Simpler, smaller and more specialist menus are one way of combatting increasing costs.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. More technology in/with our food</emphasis></p><p>As data driven systems become a bigger part of our lives, we should expect more smart technology entering into our food system, both in the way that we order food and the way that we consume it. Eating in the age of AI is going to be a big change, though I'm not sure exactly how this is going to happen. Augmented reality (AG) could become a feature of experiential dining. It already is in some select places where the design on both the walls and the table changes with each course for an immersive dining experience. Some take-away restaurants already hold data on your ordering preferences that helps create a bespoke experience. I'm not sure if 3D menus will take off but smart menus, where you scan the item to view an image, information, and providence are certainly on the way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7. Sustainability</emphasis></p><p>Despite the greenwashing around sustainability, many restaurants are attempting to become more efficient in relation to their environment. At this year's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Food on the Edge</emphasis>, Elena Reygadas, one of the world's leading Mexican chefs, spoke about the role of chefs as \"interpreters\" of the natural world. Creating a deeper connection between what we do as chefs and what happens in the natural world is becoming more and more important. It is no longer enough to cook and choose to order food from wherever one wants without considering the impact it has on the environment. The transportation of food around the world is one of the leading causes of climate change and we need to look closer to home and find alternatives for all the produce we unnecessarily import.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">8. Greater experiential dining</emphasis></p><p>Eating out is a cultural act and all eating is necessarily an experience. But some restaurants go beyond the usual format to offer customers a more holistic experience with the food playing just one part of the overall event. We're all used to our food coming with stories nowadays (often linked to the chef or the producers) but I think personal storytelling is going to expand beyond the world of fine dining into more casual spaces. With more people learning the Irish language, we should expect more engagement with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Gaeilge</emphasis>, from simply ordering to whole dining experiences that revolve around the language and its history.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9. Greater alternatives to alcohol</emphasis></p><p>We may still have issues with our attitude to alcohol consumption in Ireland but there is a growing change in the country towards better alternatives for nondrinkers or people simply wanting an alcohol-free night out. I have enjoyed great juice pairings in some of the best restaurants in the world (it's something we offer now in Aniar) and while I love my wine I really didn't notice the absence of alcohol. Better alternatives mean more mindful seasonal drinks with a touch of the local about them: think apple and dillisk juice or beetroot juice and woodruff. We need to put as much effort into our juice menu as we do into our wine menu (in the same way that we have to put more effort into our vegan and vegetarian dishes).</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">10. Sophisticated home dining and more online experiences</emphasis></p><p>Covid changed the way in which we eat and work. While many home dining options are not as available as they once were, I believe the increased cost of doing business in larger cities will see a return to more home dining and online experiences. Private online cooking classes as well group classes are making a come back. I don't believe they will replace the actual experience but rather supplement it, particularly if people cannot travel. Imagine a pasta class in Italy in the morning followed by a demonstration from Peru from one of the world's best chefs: online of course. Online experiences can help us cut down on our air miles while still tapping into a country's rich culture. Of course, it won't replace real travel but perhaps if we replaced one of our many trips abroad with an online experience or virtual cooking class the world may be a better place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From storytelling in our restaurants to seaweed and sustainability, JP McMahon highlights 10 food trends for 2024</emphasis>.

We lost a third of the winter planted crops due to the relentless wet weather over the past year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have persevered with some and managed to save a few. I planted spring oats in a field where winter wheat failed and it's looking very good considering.</p><p>I'm putting the T1 fungicide on my spring barley and oats as I write this article and it's looking good from the tractor seat. I've been focusing this year on minimising costs on the farm and chasing better margins and profit.</p><p>I've been trialling different establishment methods for myself along with more \"regenerative\" agriculture techniques. For example, this year I'm growing half my spring malting barley crop using \"conventional\" methods and the other half using \"regenerative\" methods.</p><p>The \"conventional\" spring malting barley field was ploughed, disced, one-passed and rolled, costing approx.  400/ha. The \"regenerative\" spring malting barley field was lightly cultivated, before disc drilling and rolling in, at a cost of approx.  180/ha - a significant difference. I'm growing the variety Planet in my \"conventional\" field and looks to have a fair bit of net-blotch at the moment.</p><p>The fertiliser programme was urea and a little farm yard manure. In my \"regenerative\" field I'm growing a variety called Mermaid, which is cleaner than the Planet. It received 3,000 gallons of slurry/ acre along with approximately 50 units of N from the bag, a little K and three applications of homemade foliar feed, which contains melted urea among other things.</p><p>I also decided not to use any aphicide on the crops this year. I try not to use it if at all possible now, and only in emergency situations.</p><p>I'm also trialling different establishment methods with a combi-crop of beans and peas, ie conventional plough/one pass vs direct drill (weaving drill), which has some interesting differences so far.</p><p>The pea variety is Carrington and the bean variety is Louhi, planted at a rate of 100 seeds/m2, in a ratio of 70 peas and 30 beans. The establishment in the conventionally planted crop was better this year at a rate of 90% compared to 77% establishment on average.</p><p>I'm also weighing up my options with regard to the final fungicide on the winter wheat. The weather around flowering time will dictate whether I apply one or not.</p><p>The gate is closed on the winter oilseed rape and winter rye.</p><p>We suffered heavy losses in these crops due to waterlogged soils and the slightly later than ideal sowing dates didn't help the situation either, but time will tell.</p><p>On the other side of the coin I'm dealing with the realities of the Ash Dieback disease which has decimated not only my commercial forestry but also the native ash trees that are widespread in our native woodlands and farm.</p><p>The costs are eyewatering when you consider the dying native ash trees, which will have to be removed for safety reasons along the roads and around the farm, all at the farmer's own cost.</p><p>I found it upsetting a few weeks ago to be have been offered the same price for my grain as we received all the way back in 2008, but to sign off on a happier note, I'm glad to see the grain markets improving at the moment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Using a quadrant to assess weed density.

In January 2014 I was in New Zealand on holidays. I had a hire car and it broke down and I rang the crowd and they told me to bring it to Timaru to a garage,\" Tom says.</p><p>\"In Timaru they told me it would be a two-hour wait, so I just went for a walk. I came across a factory that manufactures no-till drills and they had one sitting out front on the forecourt. \"I was looking at it and someone came out to sell me one so I told them I'm only a tourist and I told them my dilemma.</p><p>\"He then offered me a tour of the factory and it turned out he was the company's managing director and we ended up having a chat and a coffee in the conference room.</p><p>\"He told me he wouldn't mind exploring the possibilities of trying the drill in the northern hemisphere, with Ireland and New Zealand having a lot of similarities.</p><p>\"He asked would I be interested in a drill and I said 'sure leave it with me for the minute and I'll think about it'.</p><p>\"We got talking on email when I got back home and he ended up sending a drill across and I tried it and I ran it for 12 months and I bought it after that.</p><p>\"I sowed winter and spring crops and there was very little difference so it proved to me that it worked.</p><p>\"He rang me the following year asking would I bring my drill down to a show in Gurteen, so I gave him a hand to set up the stand and that, and at the end of that he asked me would I sell drills for him in Ireland and the UK.</p><p>\"I've sold between 50 and 60 drills in Ireland and the UK since 2016.\"</p><p>Tom sells a range of Duncan Ag no-till seed drills for all conditions and soil types, through his business, Ballinafagh Farm.</p><p>\"Since I've gone no-till, I've been very reluctant to go back to the plough. I don't want to think about it,\" he says.</p><p>\"When you talk about carbon, if you're ploughing every year, every bit of carbon you've taken in with the plant is released again the following year when you plough it, so what's the point? \"The best outcome with the plough system is that you could be standing still.</p><p>\"It's the one problem I have with the organics side of the house: they have to plough in Ireland, it's the only way they have to control weeds.</p><p>\"People will say organics is the way of the future, but it's not the answer.</p><p>\"The answer is conservation or regenerative agriculture. Any of those two farming methods would be way better for the country as a whole than organics.\"</p><p>Tom follows the main principles of conservation agriculture, which include cover cropping, increasing soil organic matter, crop rotations and direct drilling.</p><p>\"With conservation and regenerative agriculture, we both want to maintain the soil and plant health and use less synthetics. But the singular difference is that regenerative will use livestock in their farming operation.</p><p>\"Conservation ag is about good crop rotations and minimum soil disturbance. It's about green living plants in the soil all year round and getting out organic manures as much as possible on the field and replacing synthetics with organic manure as much as possible.\"</p><p>Tom has reduced the amount of synthetic inputs required on the farm and there has been no insecticide used on the land in six years.</p><p>He has two wormeries on the farm and he makes his own bio-stimulants from vermi-juice, seaweed, molasses and silica, which further build the soil biology.</p><p>\"I melt urea down into liquid form and overall I can put on 128 units of</p><p>N in total instead of 160-180 and still maintain yield,\" he says.</p><p>\"I apply that as a foliar feed. I only apply seven units of N/ac and it's probably as good as 14 units using other methods. Here's the problem, though: it needs to be straight urea and not protected. I'm trying to use less synthetics, so why would I want a urea with another enzyme, polymer, or inhibitor in it?\"</p><p>Animal manure is brought in from neighbouring farms and composted on site before being spread on the land.</p><p>There is about 30ac of mixed forestry on the farm - 60pc hardwood and 40pc softwood - and Tom operates a continuous cover forestry system since 2000.</p><p>There are also about 12ac of conservation areas on the farm. There is an acre of wetland with naturally regenerating woodland, plus 7ac of wildflowers and 4ac of permanent clover.</p><p>\"Back then in 2000, it was simple because we had set-aside and my forestry area now is my set-aside area. It just sickened me to see that land left fallow every year and not doing anything,\" he says.</p><p>\"At that time you could plant it in forestry and still qualify as set aside under the rules back then. Now 24 years later I'm taking my first thinnings from the forestry. On my farm I'm a one-man-band and that's another reason for the no till.</p><p>\"When it came to forestry and the thinning, it seemed like the only way was to get a contractor in because that's the way it's done in Ireland. That was another cheque going out the gate if I got the forester in.</p><p>\"I was getting mixed advice about which trees to take and leave. My forester gave me the best advice to try and do my own harvesting.</p><p>\"I got more involved with that idea because it's another project I could be doing myself instead of farming it out.</p><p>\"I saw a harvester head from Finland and I got it. It does exactly what the contractor's machine does - it's just slower.</p><p>\"I log the trees into three metre lengths and bring them into the farmyard. In Ireland you can sell forestry three ways; standing, out of your yard, or delivered to the user. In all cases people typically use a contractor\u2026 then they'll get paid and you'll get what's left. Straight away there's a chunk of money gone.</p><p>\"As a small farmer, I'm going to harvest it, bring it into the yard, and then in autumn I'm going to ask buyers to come look at it or I might firewood it.\"</p><p>Tom's daughter Erin is an intellectual disability nurse, and is becoming more involved in farming.</p><p>\"Erin is doing her Green Cert,\" says Tom.</p><p>\"The aim is for her to take over the farm and she is talking about social farming.

Arno is a former Alberta Parliamentarian and chairman of the Canada Beef Export Federation and chairman of the Alberta Beef Producers, a tenure which included the 2003 BSE outbreak.</p><p>He farms with his brother Tim and three sons Daniel, Lorin and Barry, who split the different divisions of the business between them and are using skills they have learned from their previous off-farm careers to forge a new path for the ranch.</p><p>As a result, the family are stepping away from the intensive, high-grain feed lot style finishing systems common in the area towards almost a more Irish-approach, promoting their grass-finished cattle to a premium niche market.</p><p>\"This grass-finishing project has only been going for around four or five years,\" Arno explained.</p><p>\"It started very slowly, but the guys are now up to marketing 15 head a week, so there's a lot of logistics; there aren't the same economies of scale.</p><p>\"There was an opportunity.

We </emphasis>know the climate denial playbook thanks to the work of journalists and NGOs such as Greenpeace. Among the worst offenders were fossil fuel brothers Charles and David Koch. The Koch brothers knew no one was going to believe billionaire oil barons who questioned climate science. So they funnelled millions into think tanks, community and trusted peer groups to tell people that climate change was more of a theory than a reality.</p><p>It worked like a charm. Journalists platformed the slickly-trained denial brigade while scientists warning us about the dangers struggled to be heard. The result has been a catastrophic delay in our response to an existential threat.</p><p>In 2019 EAT-Lancet Commission report brought 37 scientists together to answer the question of whether we can feed a future population of 10 billion people within planetary boundaries.  The answer is yes, but it will be impossible without transforming eating habits, improving food production and reducing food waste,  the report found. </p><p>Food production accounts for a third of global greenhouse gases. Livestock farming makes up 57 per cent of that. EAT-Lancet recommended a global diet that was low in meat and high in vegetables and fruits. It could be summed up with food writer Michael Pollan s pithy advice:  Eat food, mostly plants, not too much. </p><p>The meat industry swung into Koch mode. PR experts brought meat industry-funded scientists into media-training ready to rebut. The culture warriors went to war with a familiar set of talking points. Questioning a meat-heavy diet was an attack on individual freedom, the rights of struggling families and struggling farmers. The choice became binary between eating meat at every meal and becoming vegan. Big Meat vs Big Lentil. In all the noise it was easy to forget that the EAT-Lancet diet included meat, dairy, fish and eggs, just far smaller quantities of them.</p><p>We are encouraged to think of things as good or bad. A more useful question is to ask how something functions in the ecosystem. Factory farming is a wasteful and polluting way of producing protein. Regenerative agriculture can help to rebalance things. And food can be a fix. Recently the non-profit environmental group One Earth tried to cool the fiery debate. There were too many  specialised communities  with strident attitudes and stringent diets, they said. So they came up with the planetarian diet for the 95 per cent of people who are omnivores. With wise choices, we can eat ourselves and our planet healthier. And system change from the top down will mean we can continue to eat happily for generations to come. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20776008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BM8-TPX1-JC8Y-805N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 23, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>GREENPEACE INTERNATIONAL</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp;

The story started back when founder Nicola Connolly worked as a sustainability consultant for International Development Agencies and NGOs with traditional communities in the Amazon Rainforest, Galapagos Islands and Andes Mountains of Peru and Ecuador.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She spent over a decade helping these communities create sustainable business models in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals of alleviating poverty, gender equality, ecosystem protection and sustainable production.</p><p>\"Sustainability and community are so important to me because of these experiences and are now at the heart of what I do at Nuna\u00efa,\" says Nicola.</p><p>'Natural skincare' is a term heard often, and Nicola says it is important to be aware of what constitutes a 'natural' skincare product. \"Natural in skincare simply means ingredients found in nature. These could include plants - oils, butters and minerals (like pigments found in make-up) - and animal by-products, including beeswax and lanolin from sheep's wool.</p><p>\"Consumers need to look out for labelling and certifications like this when buying. Our Nourishing Radiance Serum is certified 100pc natural and 99.5pc organic by Ecocert COSMOS and our Superfood Cleansing Balm is certified 100pc natural and 82pc organic by Ecocert COSMOS.\"</p><p>Nicola says, \"We use fully biodegradable ingredients sourced from regenerative agriculture. Our products contain upcycled ingredients and our Ground and Glow Skin Ritual Set is packaged in a 100pc compostable and biodegradable box grown from mycelium technology.</p><p>\"Nuna\u00efa follows a 'Soil to Skin' philosophy, meaning our unique raw ingredient sourcing and manufacturing process can be traced back through three simple production points. Starting in Peru, these ingredients make their way to Lough Derg, Co Tipperary, for the final production process. I aspire that every part of my business is sustainable, from the regenerative agriculture practices to the supply chain and packaging.\"</p><p>For other beauty companies striving to be more sustainable, Nicola advises, \"Ask yourself if your business has an ethical and sustainable supply chain. Can you move to a regenerative business model and strive to create more sustainable business practices every day?</p><p>\"And look into certification. For Nuna\u00efa, certification was a no-brainer to enhance our 'sustainability credentials', but also to show that it's possible for small businesses to operate sustainable models and supply chains and to trailblaze in this space. If we can do it, all businesses can.\"</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nunaia.com\">www.nunaia.com</url> T The Canopy Sligo The Canopy shopping centre in Sligo (formerly Johnston Court) has been reimagined with a new focus on sustainability.</p><p>Jon Dunt, The Canopy Centre Manager, says, \"Sustainability is at the centre of every decision made in The Canopy. The owners of the centre are committed environmentalists and believe that The Canopy can ultimately be used to demonstrate the role shopping centres can have in promoting environmental causes in Ireland.\"</p><p>Recently, The Canopy announced it has partnered with not-for-profit organisation, Hometree Charity, to help the restoration of Ireland's native woodlands.</p><p>\"The owners of The Canopy identified a 90-acre site for sale in Easkey, Sligo, that they believed would suit Hometree's model for regeneration. The funds were provided for the purchase of the site in Hometree's name. Once Hometree's plans for the site are further developed, the land will play an important role in absorbing carbon, as well as providing an educational resource on-site for Sligo and the wider community.</p><p>\"The site primarily consists of peatland, blanket bog, pockets of ancient Hazelwood, and species-rich grassland. Key conservation objectives include peatland restoration and the natural expansion of the old Hazelwoods, with a comprehensive plan in place to restore species diversity.\"</p><p>Later this year, The Canopy will also be investing over (EURO)60k in the installation of solar PV panels on the roof to ensure that a large percentage of the centre's electricity use comes directly from the sun.</p><p>\"Separately, we also actively promote local and sustainable brands. We are very focused that any new brands coming into the centre should meet our sustainability ethos. We want to be a role model for sustainability in shopping centres in Ireland.\"</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thecanopy.ie\">www.thecanopy.ie</url> T Dingle Sea Salt Tom Leach and Moe McKeown moved to the Dingle Peninsula in 2015 and fell in love with the wildness and natural beauty of the land and seascape. \"We forged a friendship through our shared passion for surfing, which inspired our idea for making sea salt through solar evaporation,\" says Moe.</p><p>Through Dingle Sea Salt, they saw an opportunity to reimagine how a business can be created and managed with sustainability at the forefront. \"We made a conscious business decision to forgo the capacity to produce sea salt in large quantities and on demand. Instead, we developed a low-technology approach to sea salt production in colder climates that is low carbon and has minimal environmental impact,\" says Tom.</p><p>\"Our evaporation process is fully energy independent - we harness only the sun and West Kerry breeze to gently power our process between March to October each year. Specially designed evaporation tunnels capture the heat from the sun when it is shining, while the wind passively removes humidity within the tunnel to encourage optimal conditions for natural slow evaporation.</p><p>\"Our evaporation stage is entirely driven by and dependent on the local weather conditions. This means that we have a limited and defined harvesting season. Our decision to favour sustainability over scale commits us to a small batch process.\"</p><p>Compared to conventional seawater evaporation in colder climates (i.e. made by boiling the sea water under pressure), their passive solar evaporation process means they save significant amounts of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere each harvesting season.</p><p>Moe says, \"Our slow evaporation process gently creates a mineral-rich sea salt as nature intended, delivering a distinct taste of the Dingle Peninsula with a uniquely robust tang and a sweet finish.\"</p><p>Moe continues, \"The local Atlantic Ocean is our primary raw ingredient, and we want to protect this both for our business and future generations. We currently use just one single raw material in our process - locally-sourced seawater from the cold clear Atlantic Ocean. Our natural evaporation process is entirely offgrid and produces zero waste.</p><p>\"In addition, we are passionate about our commitment to 100pc plastic-free packaging. Our sea salt is presented in durable ceramic jars, which are robust and reusable.\"</p><p>Moe and Tom say, \"Sustainability is the future of food and all producers should make it their core business. We firmly believe that businesses will not progress and grow without sustainability enshrined into its culture and operations.\"</p><p>Visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dingleseasalt.ie\">www.dingleseasalt.ie</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Nuna\u00efaRay Foley and Jon Dunt, The Canopy.

Farming Editor Rachel Martin explores Regenerative Agriculture and meets the farmers leading the regen revival.</p><p>There's an old saying, that despite all of humanity's accomplishments, we owe our six inches of topsoil and the fact that it rains.But while we've all heard the warnings for decades that there are only 60 (or perhaps 100, depending on who you ask) harvests left, deteriorating soil fertility is a challenge for farmers across the island.</p><p>In the just over a century which has passed since Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch refined the Haber-Bosch nitrogen fixation process in their lab in Oppau, Germany, it's thought that half the world's growing population is fed thanks to chemical fertilisers.</p><p>But looking into the Farm Exam crystal ball, amid warnings that energy prices are set to remain high for the rest of the decade, it's hard to see an immediate future where chemical fertilisers are cheap.</p><p>Meanwhile, with Teagasc advisors warning that a staggering 90% of Irish soils are lacking in either phosphorus (P), potassium (K) or lime, equating to a loss of more than two tonnes of grass DM/ha/year or worth around  275 per hectare every year - it's clear that farmers are caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to soil fertility.</p><p>It's then not surprising that increasing numbers of business-minded, commercial farmers are turning to the principles at regenerative agriculture's core to drive forward their businesses into a new era of sustainable, yet productive farming.</p><p>Yet mention \"regenerative farming\", and chances are images of 'The Good Life' come to mind - perhaps a smallholding with two pigs, four chickens, a goat.</p><p>But the progressive, modern farmers at the forefront of the movement, are less Tom and Barbara and more the kind of business acumen you'd expect on The Apprentice, with creative ways of adding value and marketing their produce while also improving the land.</p><p>Regenerative Agriculture in its essence is an alternative method of producing food with low environmental and social impacts.</p><p>Its core intention is to improve the health of the soil, which enhances the quality of water, vegetation and land productivity.</p><p>Its principles include integrating livestock onto farms in a responsible and sustainable way to help improve soil health, sequester carbon and encourage biodiversity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farmer Sam Deane on his farm in Ballymague, Buttevant, Co Cork standing in a field set with beans.</emphasis> Picture Dan Linehan</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67V3-VS41-DYRW-V4Y2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Of particular note was some very fine fish cooking, fabulous flavours delivered with much precision and great empathy for the produce, all served up in one of the country's nicest dining rooms.</p><p>But to truly experience that Tannery magic, The Menu advises booking into the nearby and very gorgeous Tannery Townhouse, with cracking packages on offer for overnight stay, breakfast and dinner. But the ultimate Tannery experience is to also include one of Paul's very entertaining and highly informative cookery classes in The Tannery Cookery School, which always culminates in a most delicious lunch. Next class up is Easy Entertaining (March 9, morning demo).</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">tannery.ie</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Return to founding hands</emphasis></p><p>When all were heralding the brave new dawn of the Irish craft beer boom 3.0 that took off in the noughties, The Menu was ever conscious that we were merely repeating a cycle of just over a century ago, when Ireland similarly had over 100 small independent breweries, only for them to be gradually subsumed by larger entities. That was until the 1970s when just four conglomerates remained, so it gives him great joy to learn that Eight Degrees Brewing, taken over several years ago by Irish Distillers, has been bought back by original founders Scott Baigent and Cam Wallace, with a new beer in the pipeline to celebrate.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">eightdegrees.ie</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Waterford partnership</emphasis></p><p>There are many, many places, people and food-related enterprises that The Menu loves in Waterford, not least among them the very wonderful GIY and also the truly gorgeous Curraghmore Estate, in Portlaw, where the Menu gets to stage his Grub Circus every August as part of the most fabulous All Together Now music festival. Therefore, to learn of a new partnership between the two is most delightful news indeed as the multi-award-winning social enterprise GIY has signed a lease with Curraghmore Estate to create the GIY Market Garden, a mixed-use organic smallholding with traditional breed poultry, pigs, and field-scale veg and fruit following regenerative agriculture principles, based within the estate's 19thcentury 12-acre walled garden.</p><p>In other words, creating a highly significant regenerative food education campus that will be a model of a genuinely sustainable food system with a mixture of food production, education, enterprise, and tourism - The Menu will be watching this with especial interest.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">GIY.ie</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BFM-BKY1-JC8V-40W0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"469\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

This is manifesting itself on supermarket shelves where fresh fruits and vegetables previously available all year round are now in short supply at certain times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A recent report prepared for the European Parliament studied how phenomena such as heatwaves, cold spells, heavy rain, flooding, landslides, droughts, wildfires and storm surges are impacting growers. The picture that emerges is of a rise in extremely hot summer temperatures over all of Europe, progressively drier conditions in the south of the Continent, and an increase in heavy rainfall in northern and central European regions.</p><p> The magnitude of these increases is concerning,  the report states.  The number of climatological heatwave days will see at least a fivefold increase by the end of the century in the coolest climates, and up to 30 times more in warmer climates. Drought severity in southern Europe could triple by the end of the century. </p><p>Losses specific to the agriculture sector already account for more than 60 per cent of drought-linked losses, or around EUR 5 billion annually. This is projected to increase in the future.</p><p> Vulnerable sub-sectors include non-irrigated cereals, and specifically maize, fruit trees and perennials, tubers grown in regions with heavy precipitation extremes, and livestock for its dependence on green fodder,  the report warns.</p><p>Some of this has already come to pass. Farm associations here are warning of a potato shortage later this summer, a result of high rainfall and waterlogged fields. But the impact of climate change is felt across a range of crops, from late frosts freezing spring buds and curtailing harvests to extreme heat at flowering time preventing grain formation. All such shocks send shudders up the supply chain.</p><h>Impact </h><p> Recent changes in weather patterns globally and here on the island of Ireland are having a significant impact upon the fresh produce supply chain. The impact is manifesting itself through numerous ways including later planting, lower farm yields, product shortages and thus country-of-origin sourcing decisions,  says Neal Johnston, business consulting partner in supply chain and operations at EY.</p><p> For example, it is likely this year that we may see salad produce from US growers on our supermarket shelves. This is produce that would typically have been sourced from our own domestic Irish production along with some European countries. While widespread shortages are not foreseen at this time there may well be some isolated exceptions, such as potatoes or broccoli, as Irish farmers will have struggled to achieve their second planting of the year which may lead to availability challenges later in the year. </p><p>Despite these challenges, Johnston believes there are clear indications in the marketplace that the consumer is increasingly seeking out fresh produce.</p><p> Industry indicators from independent bodies point to double-digit growth in fresh produce sales across the Irish supermarket retailers. While inflation contributes to this growth, there is also volume growth within it,  he explains.</p><p> As fresh produce is typically a promoted category within the supermarket network, the end consumer is experiencing some degree of shielding from the cost inflation. </p><p>But that looks set to change, says Johnston, who cautions:  The macro trends of supply chain disruption and extreme weather indicate that further cost inflation will be seen in the category, which will likely be felt by the consumer in prices on the shelf. </p><h>Consolidation</h><p> At industry level, additional costs such as those imposed by new Brexit arrangements are encouraging consolidation among fruit and veg producers into  bigger and bigger businesses,  says Donna Marshall, professor of supply chain management at UCD.  Small players are being crowded out by these regressive costs,  she adds.</p><p>The resulting  industrial level  production of fruit and veg is in itself a real worry  for a country, for a community, and a micro trader,  she says.  Traditional artisanal and family companies are just getting pushed out. </p><h>Tension </h><p>But consumers are pushing back.  There is a real tension now between big agriculture and demand from consumers for artisanal local produce. There is also a real tension between how governments view food security   a volume-driven legacy of the second World War   and what consumers are demanding. Historically it is the education and understanding from consumers that pushes the industry to change,  she says.</p><p>That includes growing consumer demand for produce that is in season, local and with minimal or no use of pesticides and industrial chemicals.</p><p> I want my food to be as fresh and natural as possible. It is not volume that consumers value, it is health and nutrition, which is why we are seeing a backlash against volume production and industrial farming,  says Marshall.</p><p> It s about, how do we create regenerative agriculture? One that is much closer to the local communities who have the knowledge and the passion for it. </p><p>Navigating the twin forces of climate change and changing consumer demand requires nothing less than a  reimagination of the industry  she says,  because the current incentives that drive it are not working. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20946882</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1T-35D1-JC8Y-8038-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"888\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>May 16, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

Her latest, The New Ballymaloe Bread Book, is published by Gill and out now.</p><p>BOOK ULTRA-PROCESSED PEOPLE I'm loving Chris van Tulleken's expose of the world of ultraprocessed food that has such an impact on the health and well-being of so many. Required reading for all. I also find myself rereading Alice Waters's latest book, We Are What We Eat: A Slow Food Manifesto. It's an impassioned plea from the chef and food activist, and founder of the Edible Schoolyard Project in California, to consider the impact of our agriculture and food choices on farmers, food producers and the environment - and to sit around the kitchen table with family and friends.</p><p>FILM: MY SAILOR, MY LOVE I watch virtually no TV but keep meaning to so I can make intelligent conversation regarding the latest \"big thing\". I want to see the Barbie film so badly, somehow I couldn't seem to get to it when it was showing in the local cinemas. Desperate FOMO. I did love My Sailor, My Love an Irish production filmed on Achill Island, a poignant story of a curmudgeonly old gent who lives alone and reluctantly falls for the housekeeper, to the dismay and chagrin of his daughter who employs her to look after him. PODCAST CHERRY BOMBE I enjoy an eclectic mix of podcasts, from Weston A Price's Wise Traditions and David McWilliams to Radio Cherry Bombe, a celebration of women chefs, cooks and food writers. The BBC Food Programme keeps me up to date on movers and shakers on the food scene; People Fixing the World - on finding solutions to intractable problems; New Yorker Fiction - always fascinating; the Regenerative Agriculture podcast gives me hope for the future.</p><p>FESTIVAL VENICE BIENNALE I can't wait to visit the Venice Biennale in 2024, as I missed the last one. And who wouldn't love this and the opportunity to eat at the Osteria Da Fiore in the alcove overlooking the canal? I'm also super excited to be asked to participate in the Gourmet Galle Festival in February next year, as I love, love, love Sri Lanka.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-191999221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69M6-2V31-DYTY-C4R3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"349\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 12, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000394</classCode><className>COOKING &amp; ENTERTAINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UDR</classCode><className>NON FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0008X9J</classCode><className>FOOD CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N511130CC</classCode><className>BOOK PUBLISHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001482</classCode><className>RESTAURANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SWJ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001902</classCode><className>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009RO7</classCode><className>PODCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DH0B</classCode><className>ALICE WATERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>GC381</classCode><className>SRI LANKA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
