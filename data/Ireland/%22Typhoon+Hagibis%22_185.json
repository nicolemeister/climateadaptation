As PG Wodehouse once said: \"It is never difficult to distinguish between a Scotsman with a grievance and a ray of sunshine.\"</p><p>Tellingly, Beaumont promised in the same interview last month that: \"When we go to Australia $(in 2027$), we will be looking at how late we can make the pool draw.\"</p><p>This is as close as you'll get to an admission that World Rugby have made a right pig's ear of this year's event, having ended up in a situation where you have the first (Ireland), third (South Africa) and fifth (Scotland) ranked teams in the world in one pool, and the second (New Zealand) and fourth (France) ranked teams in another pool, with the winner and runners-up of each of those pools set to face each other in the first round of knock-out matches - meaning that at least three of the five top teams on the planet will be on their way home - no matter what - before the semi-final stage.</p><p>Furthermore, World Rugby's desire to give the tier one nations as much scope as possible to be at their absolute best for their biggest games means that almost all the big pool matches are being played on the opening weekend, with a few left over at the end of the pool schedule, and a barren spell of around a month in between.</p><p>The opening weekend bonanza of big games includes a mouth-watering curtain-raiser in Paris next Friday night between hosts France and bookies favourites New Zealand, struggling England (sixth in the world) against dangerous Argentina (seventh) in Marseilles on Saturday, and South Africa v Scotland to finish off the weekend, also in Marseilles, late on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>As if that wasn't enough to get any red-blooded rugby fan salivating in anticipation, there are two more matches offering bags of intrigue to fantasise about when Australia (ranked eighth) take on up-and-coming Georgia (11th) in Paris next Saturday evening and when Wales (ninth) face Fiji (10th) in Bordeaux on Sunday evening.</p><p>BUT thereafter the pickings are bare until the next tier one showdown a full fortnight later between Ireland and South Africa at Stade de France on September 23 and things don't really hot up again until France take on Italy in Lyon on Friday October 6, followed by Wales doing battle with Georgia in Nantes, England facing Samoa in Lille and, of course, Ireland tackling Scotland in Paris all on Saturday, October 7, with Japan-Argentina in Nantes on the Sunday.</p><p>What a shame it is that a lack of foresight and some shameless pandering to the traditional powerhouses means that there is a real feast-or-famine feel to this fixture schedule which really didn't need to be there at all in the first place.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6983-RYP1-JC8V-40DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

million people in Japan have been told to seek shelter before the arrival of Typhoon Nanmadol.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The national broadcaster NHK said the warning was issued as the country's weather agency issued a rare \"special warning\" about the powerful storm.</p><p>NHK, which compiles alerts issued by local authorities, said level four evacuation instructions - the second highest - were in place for people in Kagoshima, Kumamoto and Miyazaki in the southern Kyushu region.</p><p>The move came as the Japan Meteorological Agency issued its highest alert for the Kagoshima region, a warning that comes when it forecasts conditions only seen once in several decades.</p><p>It is the first typhoon-linked special warning issued outside of the Okinawa region since the current system began in 2013.</p><p>On Saturday evening, Typhoon Nanmadol was classed at the agency's top category of \"violent\", and was packing gusts of up to 270 kilometres as it hovered about 200 kilometres north-northeast of Minami Daito island, part of a string of remote isles that form the Okinawa region.</p><p>The storm is expected to approach or make landfall on Sunday in Kagoshima prefecture, then move north the following day before heading towards Japan's main island.</p><p>\"There are risks of unprecedented storms, high waves, storm surges, and record rainfall,\" Ryuta Kurora, the head of the Japan Meteorological Agency's forecast unit, told reporters.</p><p>\"Maximum caution is required,\" he said, urging residents to evacuate early.</p><p>\"It's a very dangerous typhoon.\"</p><p>\"The wind will be so fierce that some houses might collapse,\" Kurora told reporters, also warning of flooding and landslides.</p><p>The evacuation warnings call on people to move to shelter or alternative accommodation that can withstand extreme weather.</p><p>But they are not mandatory, and during past extreme weather events authorities have struggled to convince residents to take shelter quickly enough.</p><p>Kurora said even inside strong buildings, residents should take precautions.</p><p>\"Please move into sturdy buildings before violent winds start to blow and stay away from windows even inside sturdy buildings,\" he told a late-night press conference.</p><p>Japan is currently in typhoon season and faces around 20 such storms a year, routinely seeing heavy rains that cause landslides or flash floods.</p><p>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis smashed into Japan as it hosted the Rugby World Cup, claiming the lives of more than 100 people.</p><p>A year earlier, Typhoon Jebi shut down Kansai Airport in Osaka, killing 14 people.</p><p>And in 2018, floods and landslides killed more than 200 people in western Japan during the country's annual rainy season.</p><p>Ahead of Typhoon Nanmadol's arrival, flight cancellations began to affect regional airports including those in Kagoshima, Miyazaki and Kumamoto, according to the websites of Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways.</p><p>Scientists say climate change is increasing the severity of storms and causing extreme weather such as heat waves, droughts and flash floods to become more frequent and intense.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Rugby cold turkey. This is true for Irish fans in particular but also of Welsh and England followers. Some of the England assistant coaches have even returned to Blighty for a few days' break.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As for Scotland, we'd almost forgotten they were still at this World Cup so long was it between their first (South Africa) and second games (Tonga). Big tournaments need momentum to draw people in. An Olympics lasts just over a fortnight. The Ryder Cup is three days, for goodness sake! This Rugby World Cup lasts seven weeks, three more than its football equivalent in Qatar last winter. There are reasons why - pools of five rather than four is one of the principal ones. There is talk of change for 2027 with a tighter format of six pools of four, maybe. That would make scheduling more compact. Thank goodness.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2 Have a second-tier competition</emphasis></p><p>Every World Cup we discover new thrilling talent in seemingly the most unlikely of teams - in Cote d'Ivoire long ago, Japan more recently and now Portugal, all sides that have battled to establish themselves, to find cash first and foremost, then the drive and commitment to make it happen against the odds if there were to take a seat at top table with the big boys. We give them a patronising wave as we stumble across them, coo and gasp at the fact that they can actually weave and sidestep, cross fingers that they don't get annihilated (as sometimes they used to do more regularly), and then start roaring them on as they cause the elite problems.</p><p>It's happened just that way again. And even if there are one-sided encounters such as Namibia's 96-0 blowout against France or Romania's disappointing 76-0 effort against South Africa (doubly disappointing when you consider Romania's heritage with wins over the likes of France), these are offset by the way Uruguay, with flanker Manuel Ardao, to the fore, have been getting stuck into France and Italy while individuals such as Portugal full-back, Nuno Sousa Guedes, and his dancing feet have been a delight. Look how Fiji have prospered since being given decent investment. These teams need more competition even to the point of a knockout tournament perhaps to run parallel with those that do make it through to the quarter-finals.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3 2035 World Cup in a nailed-on rugby territory</emphasis></p><p>The locations for the next two World Cups have already been settled: Australia in 2027 and the USA four years later. As with Japan in 2019 and now France, it seemed sensible to pair a traditional rugby-playing nation as host with something more exploratory and experimental. Japan was a success on so many levels - sporting-wise, backdrop, culture, people - that it even managed to overcome major disruption when Typhoon Hagibis swept in.</p><p>In theory, then, there is little wrong with World Rugby's strategy. Or there wasn't until the Wallabies imploded. What state will Australian rugby be in in four years' time? How much interest will there be in that country when the hordes arrive? As for the USA, they have been the coming thing for 30 years yet have failed to really arrive and didn't even qualify for this tournament. You can only wish both countries well. But it's already time to start gauging where RWC 2035 might best be held. South Africa were denied at the death this time around and surely deserve what would only be their second ever crack. Or what about a Celtic World Cup in Ireland, Wales, and Scotland? It has a certain ring to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4 Free-to-air TV at all costs</emphasis></p><p>Rugby is such a niche sport globally that it needs every last drop of exposure it can get. Reports that administrators are considering the claims of streaming services such as Amazon Prime as candidates for future World Cup bidding would have sent tremors through the marketplace. Perhaps that is the intention - to shake up the stakeholders and raise the potential value of the rights on offer. It's hard to find fault in what the likes of Prime have produced in terms of quality of presentation, as was also the case with Sky or BT and now TNT as far as the UK market is concerned. Indeed, there have been plenty of complaints about aspects of ITV's coverage. But terrestrial gives reach. It is as simple as that. Rugby being beamed into living rooms at prime time is a massive boon. No matter what riches might be offered, rugby should not give that up.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5 Give security a crash course in happy clappy vibes. And get the trains and trams running</emphasis></p><p>It has usually been one of the most uplifting of images from major events, the cast of smiling volunteers that give of their time to make others welcome. While there have been fun and frolics across France with the volunteers at the centre of all that enjoyment, there have also been too many difficulties with high-end security protocols as well as transport issues getting to and from grounds. This perspective is all formed via social media which can be prone to a hysterical edge but, at the same time, nor can it be discounted as it does offer an insight into realities on the ground. There have been access and exit glitches reported in Marseille, Nice, and Bordeaux, teething issues in some regard but there have also been reports of water bottles being confiscated and over-the-top officiousness. Security is a constant presence in our lives and while we all have to recognise the need to protect arenas there is a fine balance to be struck.</p><p>The supporters want to feel appreciated. A rugby crowd does not need segregating and is not known for disturbances. That needs to be kept in mind.

The URC has, at least, made steps to avoid leaving what should be the competition's crown jewels so unpolished. This Saturday's fixture, after all, has been rescheduled for this date only after the original staging planned for Ne w Year's Day was postponed thanks to Covid-19 cases in the Ulster squad.</p><p>Those festive derbies have become known for featuring understrength squads due to the IRFU's Player Management Programme too of course but , if this seems like an odd way of promoting a product, spare a thought for Italian legend Sergio Parisse.</p><p>The greatest Azzurri player of his or any other generation has long been targeting a goodbye in the blue jersey he has worn with such pride f or almost 20 years.</p><p>Having made his debut as an 18-year-old against the All Blacks in the summer of 2002, the now 38-year-old has had numerous attempts at a farewell game scuppered, first by</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis at the 2019 World Cup and then by the pandemic.

Whatever the host continent - Europe, Australasia, Asia - geographical location hasn't made a jot of difference.</p><p>The Welwitschias, named after a plant known as 'the onion of the desert', have been nothing but consistent: Played 22, Lost 22. Points for: 248. Against: 1,523. Average defeat: 10-66.</p><p>Their losing sequence has already superseded the worst run in Premier League football; Sunderland's 20 consecutive defeats between January 2003 and September 2005. Unless they are very careful or very lucky, or both, it will be but a matter of time before the old German colony in southwest Africa takes losing to a depth yet to be plumbed in team sport.</p><p>The all-time record for consecutive defeats in American professional sport stands at 29 which is more than can be said for the National Football League club that compiled it, the Chicago Cardinals. It took them three years to build losses on an unprecedented scale, from 1942 to 1945.</p><p>In the Cardinals' defence, it has to be said that they had to endure the recurring absence of players required for duty overseas during the Second World War but then the same could also be said of every other NFL team.</p><p>A few months before JFK reached the White House, the Cardinals gave Chicago up as a bad job, relocating to St Louis then, more recently, to Phoenix.</p><p>Two factors set Namibia apart: One, their capacity for absorbing beatings on a fearful scale and two, their unfailing ability to recover and keep coming back for more. Who else could lose 142-0 in one World Cup, fight their way through the qualifying procedure and rock up for the next one four years later?</p><p>At the Adelaide Oval 20 years ago, they were on the receiving end of the fastest Test century seen there, some achievement considering that it used to be the personal fiefdom of the world's greatest batsman, Don Bradman.</p><p>The Wallabies took two minutes to score their first try and only nine more to claim the bonus point with their fourth. They scored 69 points in the first half, 73 more in the second, a mis-match which forced Namibia to spend more time behind their posts waiting for the holders to line up conversion attempts of 22 tries distributed among eleven players.</p><p>No historical burden, though, is too great to bear for van Lill, the veterans' veteran who won the first of more than 50 caps in 2006 at the outset of a long career in France.</p><p>He is still there, a long way below the Top 14 elite where he spent five seasons with Bayonne. Nowadays he can be found far from the madding crowd not far away on the same Atlantic coast, at Capbreton Hossegor, a club some eight divisions down from where he used to be.</p><p>For a country whose team has never failed to fall at every hurdle, the odds against Namibia winning a tournament are surprisingly generous, a mere 500-1.</p><p>They earned the right to be among the 20 finalists on merit, winning the Africa Cup with a resounding 36-0 win over Kenya.</p><p>And when the perennial chopping blocks finished their warm-up matches against the Blue Bulls in Pretoria, they did so under van Lill's captaincy.</p><p>\"He's a wonderful guy, PJ,\" says Phil Davies, the Welshman who coached Namibia through the two previous World Cups. \"Always reliable especially when the chips are down, always ready to give a seven-or-eight out of 10 performance. He never changes.\"</p><p>Namibia under Davies staunched the flow of blood. Instead of being torpedoed by 80-plus points as they had been by France, South Africa, and Wales in the two World Cups after the Adelaide annihilation, Namibia began cutting the deficit.</p><p>On an autumn night in Exeter eight years ago they couldn't have cut it any finer, losing to Georgia by a single point. \"They were devastated in the dressing-room afterwards,\" Davies says. \"They knew how close they'd gone to making history.</p><p>\"Some of the boys were in tears. We ordered beers for the entire squad and kept telling them they had made history because they'd won their country their first bonus point. We tried as hard as we could to make a positive out of that.\"</p><p>Now run by former Springbok coach Allister Coetzee whose coaches include the former Scotland and England forwards' specialist Matthew Proudfoot, Namibia start against Italy in St Etienne today (kick-off noon).</p><p>Davies, now director of rugby for the sport's governing body, World Rugby, clings to the hope that Namibia's 24-year losing run will end before the end of the month, not against France, nor New Zealand but Uruguay, ranked four places higher at 17th, in Lyon on September 27.</p><p>Until then, the supposed no-hopers will be stuck with another strange fact.</p><p>Officially, they have been credited with a World Cup draw from a match they never played, a 0-0 against Canada awarded after the fixture had been blown away in Japan four years ago by Typhoon Hagibis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pieter-Jan van Lill will line out for the great underdogs of Namibia</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:696F-7H21-DYRW-V3N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

And at the same time, it may be marked as a tournament the likes of which we will never see again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The competition in 2019 - how distant and different those pre-covid, pre-Ukraine War, pre-inflation days now seem - was introduced by the kind of extreme weather event with which we have become uncomfortably familiar. The super typhoon Hagibis wiped out three of the group stage matches.</p><p>Ultimately South Africa were crowned as champions, defeating England and matching the number of titles achieved by New Zealand.</p><p>Ireland reached their customary quarter-final, and it is a mark of our progress at the level of the global game that this was viewed as disappointing, particularly the defeat to Japan in the qualifying rounds. Few who were in Shizuoka Stadium on that September night four years ago will forget the chants of \"Nippon! Nippon!\" echoing around the ground.</p><p>This time Ireland start as one of the favourites and they face off against Romania in Bordeaux next Saturday afternoon in Pool B, which includes other heavyweight opposition in the Springboks and Scotland.</p><p>But it is the regulatory issues and, in particular, an increasingly difficult balance between player safety and automatic red cards for what could either be a reckless tackle or a split second mis-timing, which threatens to seed this world cup with controversy and ill-feeling.</p><p>We have had dry runs with the suspensions of England players Billy Vunipola and, in particular, Owen Farrell, whose initial ban was overturned and then reimposed after an intervention by the governing body, World Rugby. This provoked several shades of differing uproar, some of it hugely unpleasant, on social media even prompting his father, Ireland's coach Andy, to publicly condemn the \"absolutely disgusting\" circus surrounding his son.</p><p>All coaches and players heading to France want to know exactly where they stand in respect of high tackles and there is a clear and present danger that the new \"bunker review\" system, where a dedicated television match official who will adjudicate on incidents referred to them, will produce the type of infuriating inconsistencies that have undermined the credibility of football's VAR processes.</p><p>Rugby is a sport that has evolved into a high-speed contest where impressive human specimens collide with each other time and time again. If errors of judgement are automatically punished with match expulsion, then the game's credibility will diminish, and with it public support for it as a spectacle.</p><p>The fact is rugby is a collision sport, and it is the cumulative consequence of multiple impacts over the course of a sporting life that produces what is now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in certain individuals. Some pro rugby matches feature more than 500 tackles per game, and the number of games per year is increasing all the time. That is one source of trouble that is being stored up for the future. In February, a rugby player won  12m compensation in the English High Court after an opposing team member made a \"red mist\" challenge that fractured her spine and confined her to a wheelchair for the rest of her life.</p><p>That was in an amateur game. More than 200 former players have joined in a class action that accuses rugby governing bodies of failing to protect them against brain injuries. They include former British and Irish Lion and Wales captain Ryan Jones, England international and World Cup winner Steve Thompson, and former Wales international Alix Popham. The damages claim could exceed  350m. Rugby will not survive in its current form if they are successful.</p><p>It is likely more people than ever before will attend France 2023. The previous record is 2,477,805 in the UK in 2015. Many more will watch on TV. Net receipts will be the largest ever. Ireland has a fighting chance of getting past the quarter-final and could win it. The sport must not shoot itself in the foot by letting refereeing controversy and hidden officials poring over TVs and delivering inevitable red cards dominate the narrative. This is a penalty that will not do anything to resolve the underlying perils of a close-contact game.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scooted off</emphasis></h><p>On-trend Paris was the first city to open its streets to for-hire electric scooters, and yesterday it became the first leading European capital to ban them, with operators being given a hard deadline to withdraw 15,000 vehicles.</p><p>The action follows a vote in the spring where 90% of the 103,000 Parisians who voted said they opposed the rental scooters which had provided an uncomfortable new element to public spaces where they jostled with walkers, cyclists, and drivers for pole position. Opinions hardened after fatalities in Paris and other cities.</p><p>The mayor, Anne Hidalgo, can at least say that she gave escooters, or \"trottinettes\", five years to win major public affection and can point to the advice of the comedian WC Fields in such circumstances: \"If at first you don't succeed then try, try, and try again. Then quit. There's no point being a damn fool about it.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Up in the air</emphasis></h><p>In a list of popular companies, airlines rarely figure among anyone's favourite. However, it's difficult not to feel some sympathy for them, and the arguments put forward by industry leader Willie Walsh, over this week's travel fiasco which could cost them north of  110m.</p><p>While the operators should honour their compensation obligations for stranded travellers, it seems unconscionable that the \"world beating\" air traffic control company, which goes under the unlovely title of \"Nats\", should not contribute towards the disruption caused by their systems.</p><p>This week's chaos on one of the busiest days of the year is a reminder that, for most, flying is an ordeal to be endured. While France is about to lead the way in scrapping low-cost air fares and incrementally taxing air travel - another example of political and bureaucratic overreach - customers may start asking themselves whether any price is worth the aggravation and put more effort into alternative arrangements for leisure.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6983-RYP1-JC8V-427T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1031\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

tropical storm is barrelling towards northeastern Japan, forcing Tokyo Olympics organisers to reschedule rowing and archery that could be affected by high winds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tropical Storm Nepartak, packing gusts up to 108km per hour, is expected to make landfall tomorrow, Japan's meteorological agency said.</p><p>The storm is shifting its course from the Tokyo area to northeastern regions, including Fukushima.</p><p>But the agency warned of heavy rain, wind and high waves over a wide area including the capital.</p><p>\"In line with the current weather forecast, the schedule for the rowing and archery events due to take place on the 27th have already been changed,\" Tokyo 2020 said.</p><p>\"At this time, there are no plans to change the schedule for any of the other events due to be held on Tuesday.\"</p><p>The Games organisers said they would keep a close eye on the forecast and activate contingency plans for bad weather \"should the need arise\".</p><p>Meanwhile Olympic surfing chiefs decided to take advantage of big waves whipped up by the storm at Tsurigasaki Beach, 100 km east of Tokyo by scrapping the final day of competition.</p><p>Medal events will now be crammed into tomorrow's schedule.</p><p>Evacuation orders were issued in the area surrounding the resort town of Atami, which was hit by a devastating landslide earlier this month that killed 21 people, with six still missing.</p><p>Some train services, including bullet trains, will be suspended on tomorrow afternoon because of the storm.</p><p>The meterological agency also referred to Nepartak as a typhoon, while the US Navy called it a tropical storm.</p><p>Japan's typhoon season runs from around May to October, peaking in August and September.</p><p>In 2019, Typhoon Hagibis hit as Japan hosted the Rugby World Cup.</p><p>The powerful storm killed more than 100 people, and forced organisers to cancel three pool matches.</p><p>The Olympics opened on Friday after a year-long pandemic delay and will run until August 8.</p><p>Spectators are banned at most venues because of coronavirus risks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The former Benetton boss, who led his club to Rainbow Cup success last June, tasted defeat in his first two Tests at the helm last November, losing to his native New Zealand and Argentina but closing out 2021 with a victory over Uruguay that the former All Blacks wants his young squad to use as a foundation for success.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Point of difference</emphasis>: For a team that has clearly forgotten how to win, it is going to have to be Crowley himself.

Italy's greatest player Sergio Parisse could make a final throw of the dice for the Azzuri at the age of 38 having made his comeback from injury in the French Top 14 with Toulon. The No.8 had been due to call it quits at the 2019 World Cup but Italy's final pool game against New Zealand was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis. Parisse and Crowley have discussed a one-off comeback when the veteran has regained some match fitness and confidence after a long lay-off.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Squad</emphasis> (* denotes uncapped): <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Forwards</emphasis> (19): N Cannone (Benetton), P Ceccarelli (Brive), E Faiva (Benetton), D Fischetti (Zebre), M Fuser (Newcastle Falcons), T Halafihi (Benetton)*, M Lamaro (Benetton), G Lucchesi (Benetton), S Negri (Benetton), I Nemer (Benetton), G Nicotera (Benetton)*, T Pasquali (Benetton), G Pettinelli (Benetton), F Ruzza (Benetton), D Sisi (Zebre), A Steyn (Benetton), C Traore (Benetton), G Zilocchi (Zebre), M Zuliani (Benetton)*. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Backs</emphasis> (14): C Braley (Benetton), P Bruno (Zebre), J I Brex (Benetton), G Da Re (Benetton)*, A Fusco (Fiamme Oro), P Garbisi (Benetton), M Ioane (Benetton), L Marin (Benetton)*, T Menoncello (Benetton)*, F Mori (Kawasaki Robot Calvisano), L Morisi (Benetton), E Padovani (Benetton), S Varney (Gloucester), M Zanon (Benetton).</p><p>Odds: Outright: 500/1</p><p>Grand Slam: 500/1</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64T5-V311-DYRW-V088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"556\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The clubs - who purchase the majority of tickets for internationals at the Aviva Stadium and generate profit by reselling them in packages - have already paid for these tickets but they would be entitled to full refunds in the event of the game being permanently cancelled. </p><p>A Six Nations weekend in Dublin generates approximately EUR 30 million for the entire economy. </p><p>Tournament organisers will be guided by the governments of each country. </p><h>Under threat </h><p>Ireland's final Six Nations fixture against France - in Paris, on March 14th - is under real threat of not going ahead after French health minister Olivier Veran placed a \"temporary ban\" on \"all public gatherings of more than 5,000 people in a confined space\" across the entire country as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases continues to rise. </p><p>\"These measures are temporary and we will likely have to revise them,\" Veran added. \"They are restrictive and paradoxically we hope they don't last long because that means we will have contained the virus' spread.\" </p><p>England's trip to Rome, also on March 14th, looks certain to be cancelled as Italy struggles to contain outbreaks in three northern regions. </p><p>It remains unclear if contingency plans similar to the World Cup, when three 0-0 draws were declared due to Typhoon Hagibis, could be put in place by the Six Nations. </p><p>The Ireland versus Italy match cannot, it seems, be rescheduled until October. The IRFU are contractually obliged to hold internationals at the Aviva Stadium, and considering the congested fixture list - especially if Leinster follow up victory over Saracens on April 4th with a Champions Cup semi-final at the venue - and three games in soccer's Euro 2020 set for Dublin, the stadium is effectively unavailable until August. </p><p>Another topic potentially on the agenda in Paris is the \u00a3300 million deal for the Six Nations and new investors CVC to put broadcasting behind a Sky Sports pay wall, as reported by the Rugby Paper. </p><p>Seemingly, the current BBC and ITV sharing deal, which runs out next year, will be outbid by Sky, with BT and Amazon other potential bidders.

Perhaps the fortunes of the Italian team will have turned by then? Their underage sides - particularly their U20s - have been doing great things but Italy land in Dublin this weekend on the back of 34 consecutive losses in this tournament with their long-term viability in this competition under severe scrutiny.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Challenging times for the Azzurri, no question, but this is still a country with a proud rugby history and one that has produced its fair share of quality over the years, as selecting a Greatest XV of Italian players demonstrates\u2026</p><p>FULL-BACK: ANDREA MASI His infamous clothesline tackle on Rob Kearney in Rome aside, Masi was a classy operator. In a career which spanned 16 years and four World Cups, the fleetfooted full-back had some big days in the blue jersey. Played a starring role in Italy's shock victory against France in 2011 and was named Player of the Championship that season for good measure.</p><p>WING: MARCELLO CUTTITTA Part of Italy's golden generation in the late 1990s, Cuttitta was a deadly wing who represented his country at three World Cups in 1987, 1991 and 1995. He remains Italy's top try scorer with 26, three tries ahead of the talented Paolo Vaccari.</p><p>OUTSIDE CENTRE: MICHELE CAMPAGNARO Something of a nomadic career for such a talented midfielder. Burst onto the scene with Treviso before stints at Exeter, Wasps and Harlequins and then a move to France to play second division rugby with Colomiers. An elusive and powerful centre, he is best remembered for an audacious solo effort against England at Twickenham in the 2017 edition of the championship.</p><p>INSIDE CENTRE: CRISTIAN STOICA The Bucharest-born bruiser was a real handful in the Italian midfield, winning 71 caps across an impressive career. Spent a season with Gloucester before making his name at Castres and Montpellier. Punched plenty of holes in Irish defences in the early 2000s.</p><p>WING: MIRCO BERGAMASCO The fiery younger brother of Mauro, Bergasmasco was a hard-running wing and an ultrareliable goalkicker. A regular on a fine Stade Francais team from 2003 to 2010 and a stalwart for the Azzurri.</p><p>OUT-HALF: DIEGO DOMINGUEZ Italy have spent the best part of two decades trying to find a</p><p>No10 to fill the sizeable void left by Dominguez when the talented out-half retired from international rugby in 2003. Journeymen from across the globe and local talent have all been and gone, but none have come close to matching the class of the legendary Stade Francais playmaker. Paolo Garbisi is the new hope for Italian rugby and he doesn't have to look too far for inspiration. Cool, calm and nerveless from the kicking tee, Dominguez (left) was a generational talent.</p><p>SCRUM -HALF: ALESSANDRO TRONCON Irish fans may best remember Troncon for landing a right hook on Peter Stringer in 2001, but the abrasive scrum-half is a legend of the Italian game.</p><p>Right-hand man to Dominguez at half-back, Troncon won 101 caps for his country and carved out an impressive career with Clermont on the club scene.</p><p>LOOSEHEAD PROP: ANDREA LO CICERO A real handful, Lo Cicero was a world class frontrower and was still lining out for the Azzurri at age 37 in the 2013 Six Nations. Finished with 103 caps after a distinguished career at the coalface.</p><p>HOOKER: LEONARDO GHIRALDINI Yet another centurion in the Italian frontrow, Ghiraldini represented Italy at four World Cups across a 107-cap career. Denied a final farewell at the 2019 World Cup when Italy's pool game against New Zealand was cancelled due to Typhoon Hagibis. Won a Top14 title with</p><p>Toulouse in 2019.</p><p>TIGHTHEAD PROP: MARTIN CASTROGIOVANNI A legend among the Welford Road faithful, Castrogiovanni spent seven seasons locking down scrums with Leicester Tigers. A colourful character, on and off the pitch, Castrogiovanni (left) made 119 appearances for Italy and was widely regarded as a top-class tighthead.</p><p>SECOND ROW: CARLO CHECCHINATO A powerful second row forward with an eye for the try-line, scoring 21 tries in 83 appearances. Checchinato was a leader and an enforcer in the Azzurri pack before he retired in 2004.</p><p>SECOND ROW: MARCO BORTOLAMI A mobile forward and a brilliant lineout operator, Bortolami made his name at Gloucester before going to to win 112 international caps. He retired in 2015 and is now coaching Treviso in the United Rugby Championship.</p><p>BLINSIDE FLANKER: SEBASTIAN NEGRI The only current player to make the list, Negri has been consistently brilliant in a poor Italian team. Born in Zimbabwe, learned his trade at Hartpury College and flourished at Treviso. A big, physical blindside who continues to impress.</p><p>OPENSIDE FLANKER: MAURO BERGAMASCO All all-action customer who was the heartbeat of the Azzurri throughout a 17-year career. His one-game stint at scrumhalf will live in infamy but Bergamasco was a legend of the game. Fierce, determined and pacy, his standout moment was a brilliant solo try against Scotland in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.2001.NO\">www.2001.NO</url> 8: SERGIO PARISSE Arguably the greatest player to ever pull on the blue jersey, Parisse made his debut in Test rugby in 2002 and is still going strong at 38 this season. A skilful athlete and a born leader. Whether he will add to his 142 international caps remains to be seen before he hangs up his boots at the end of the season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Pure class: Italy's Sergio Parisse SPORTSFILE</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-176629343</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64VF-JY51-JCBW-N2CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 23, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A3NR</classCode><className>SOCCER TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D15W</classCode><className>THIS DAY IN HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRMK</classCode><className>MEN'S SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000093</classCode><className>ANNIVERSARIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Typhoon Hagibis was just about to hit the Japanese mainland and would be the most destructive typhoon to hit them in 60 years. This natural calamity, on the back of a 5.7 Richter scale earthquake, had sucked everyone in a frenzy of blame and counter-blame. Whose idea was it to play the World Cup in such a dangerous part of the world? The whole thing was a disaster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The England v France game, which was a dead rubber, was cancelled. The Canada v Namibia game, which was of no significance unless you were Canadian or Namibian, was also cancelled.</p><p>Italy were also due to play New Zealand and if they had beaten the All Blacks by 60 points they would have qualified for the knockout stages. The match was therefore of no consequence either despite the Italians complaining to the contrary that if the All Blacks had needed 60 points the match would have been played.</p><p>Typhoon The typhoon passed, there were, as you would expect, fatalities but the World Cup moved on into the quarter-final stage and nobody remembered the name of the typhoon until I reminded you just now.</p><p>There were three matches cancelled. Tickets had to be refunded and the TV people and their sponsors missed out on live sporting TV. Never mind the whole thing was insured.</p><p>Event insurance is a great little product. Nobody lost a penny and that World Cup went on to be a fantastic commercial and playing success.</p><p>The world media are in another tizzy as we speak. The Lions tour is a fiasco. It's a disaster.</p><p>Whose idea was it to tour here, right here, right now? The tour may be in the balance, but the key issue is whether they have event insurance.</p><p>I have not officially asked that question, but I would suspect no insurance company in their right mind would consider underwriting the risk of a cancelled tour in the middle of a Covid-19 pandemic - particularly one being held in South Africa.</p><p>And so, until the Lions and the Springboks are unable to field 23 fit and healthy players in a stadium somewhere in South Africa then the tour will go ahead because contracts have been signed, television companies have made commitments, sponsors have made commitments.</p><p>There is well over (EURO)30m in play here and I suspect none of it is recoverable if the tour is cancelled.</p><p>You may think there are more important factors at play here. If that figure was (EURO)3m that may have been the case, but for (EURO)30m, with the South African Rugby Union in dire financial straits, the tour will be going ahead.</p><p>If you also look at the company involved, the British and Irish Lions DAC, you will find that the firm running the Lions is also in dreadful financial straits. They must play this tour to remain financially viable.</p><p>I think most people with flesh in the game wanted this tour to happen and at the time that the decision was made to play in South Africa the virus levels were at relatively low numbers.</p><p>On the continent of Africa, you can never be sure of anything. There is barely a vaccination programme worthy of the name in any part of Africa and reportage levels would also be at the very best unreliable.</p><p>Two months after the decision was made to travel and play, South Africa's third wave has ramped up to become a major issue. It was always going to be a gamble but one that was worth taking.</p><p>If you consider the level of sporting activity around the world now - particularly the developed world - then it does not seem like it is that much of a gamble. All you must do is be ultra-professional about your precautions and observe all the protocols in relation to the bubble that both teams live in and God willing - and that is the rub - everything will be OK.</p><p>In May, I asked the Lions management if everybody being vaccinated, and the answer was an affirmative.</p><p>In a troubling admission yesterday, Lions management stated that everybody was not vaccinated, which I find unbelievable.</p><p>We all know that the vaccination won't stop you picking up the virus, but it can limit the damage that a fit and healthy athlete would suffer and maybe put that player in a position to play again relatively quickly after picking up the virus.</p><p>Nobody is likely to die or become gravely ill as a result but there are no guarantees.</p><p>The bottom line here is that the Lions have left themselves open for some serious criticism. How could they not travel without everybody being vaccinated? That is the foundation stone of travelling in the first place.</p><p>We are far enough away from the Test series to be reasonably certain both teams will field a healthy 23-man squad.</p><p>Quality Given the quality of the two sides that the Lions have played against - the Sigma Lions and the C Cell Sharks, who they are facing again tomorrow - is there any point in playing these matches given the risks of another virus outbreak?</p><p>What is the point in playing the Sharks again tomorrow, three days after the Lions - despite their chaotic preparations - put them away with ease?</p><p>Billy Idol had a hit with a song called Dancing with Myself: Dancing with myself, oh-oh Dancing with myself When there's nothing to lose and there's nothing to prove Well I'm dancing with myself</p><p>The Lions, if they are looking for a meaningful match this weekend, should just play themselves. England/ Scotland v Ireland/Wales - that match would give Warren Gatland a far better idea of who is playing well and which team he would need to pick to play against the Springboks in two weeks' time.</p><p>You could televise it and get a bigger audience than playing a meaningless game against a provincial side.</p><p>Either way, the tour will go ahead - even if the Lions have to dance with themselves.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Easy pickings: Duhan van der Merwe strolls in for a try against the Sharks on Wednesday - the Scotland wing bagged a hat-trick during the Lions' eight-try rout against the Durbanbased side, who they will face again tomorrow GETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-170836894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:633M-2P91-JCBW-N1XW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 9, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Except it's not.</p><p>Farrell's men will get a runout against the Ireland U-20s in an open session on Friday before they break again for the weekend.</p><p>Ordinarily, the squad would have met up again on Sunday evening with preparations for the Italy Test due to ramp up, but it remains to be seen what plans will now unfold.</p><p>The knock-on effect from last weekend's defeat in London threatens to linger even longer and how Farrell manages the next three weeks, without a game, will be a real test.</p><p>Regardless of what happened in London last Sunday, changes were inevitable for the clash with the Azzurri. Farrell (pictured) must now decide whether to stick or twist when it comes to his next team selection because taking on a France side going for a potential Grand Slam in their own backyard on a Saturday night, is extremely daunting.</p><p>In the immediate aftermath of the defeat to England, Farrell was keen to play down the idea that he would make wholesale changes to his team.</p><p>That said, after pointing to the impact that his bench made in finishing on the front foot and name checking several players, Farrell almost certainly would have introduced a few fresh faces to face Italy. Assuming they took their chance, those individuals would have been in the driving seat to start again in Paris.</p><p>Caelan Doris and Ronan Kelleher were at the top of that particular queue after a strong showing, while Keith Earls and John Cooney were also pushing hard.</p><p>Cian Healy's hip injury and the fact that Iain Henderson is available again - following the birth of his son - meant Farrell was looking at two enforced changes anyway, but without the chance to judge younger guys like Doris and Kelleher from the start, leaves the head coach with a tricky dilemma.</p><p>Now, more than ever, what happens in training will be hugely important for players to stake their claim, so Farrell must put an even greater onus on that and be fair in terms of how he goes about his team selection.</p><p>If there is a silver lining in all of this, it is that France face only a sixday turnaround leading into their clash with Ireland after travelling to Scotland next weekend.</p><p>During the World Cup - when England had their final pool game against France postponed due to Typhoon Hagibis - it really irked Joe Schmidt, who was keen to flag up that \"it's always an advantage to get a longer lead-in.\"</p><p>Given how well England performed in their subsequent quarter-final win over Australia, Schmidt had a point.</p><p>Farrell will be hoping something similar happens with Ireland over the coming weeks because one thing is for sure, major improvements are needed if they are to have any hope of beating France.</p><p>Although it didn't sit well with some supporters that Farrell has largely stuck with the tried and trusted throughout this campaign, if he did intend to make a couple of changes in personnel for the Italy game, many will be hoping he sticks to his guns and does so for France.</p><p>The scale of that challenge means we are highly unlikely to see the kind of sweeping changes that Farrell was keen to downplay last weekend, but there is no doubt that his team needs freshening up.</p><p>Having already rewarded form in his short time in the job, Farrell must now continue to do so, which means being committed to making some brave calls in Paris.</p><p>Without the chance to judge the younger guys, Farrell is now left with a dilemma  ;</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-157885692</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9D-K5M1-DYTY-C2TN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"754\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 27, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp;

It's the only constant in toplevel coaching. It was Farrell who faced the media storm in Fukuoka in the days leading up to Typhoon Hagibis hitting Japanese shores during the World Cup.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ireland's looming pool clash with Samoa - and the tournament as a whole - was under threat, but Farrell, Ireland's defence coach at the time, radiated calm as fears over the effects of the oncoming typhoon spread around the country.</p><p>'We just get on with our day job and try to best prepare every single day. We'll see what comes of that,' he said at the time.</p><p>The storm would veer away from Fukuoka and towards Tokyo the following weekend. Farrell knows all about turbulence in this job alright.</p><p>He was back in familiar territory at Ireland's base in Abbotstown on Monday.</p><p>After the Ireland head coach and his players arrived off the training paddock, they were informed that their trip to Paris to face France had been shelved as another fixture fell victim to the spread of the coronavirus.</p><p>Once again, Farrell was back in front of the press trying to inject some logic and reason into a worrying and uncertain situation. Having prepped for a Six Nations clash with France on their home turf, the majority of the squad and backroom team packed their bags and drove out the gates of Carton House yesterday afternoon.</p><p>When they will reassemble as a group again is anyone's guess at this stage.</p><p>Those postponed championship games against Italy and France are set to be rescheduled for late October, prior to the autumn international series which will take in meetings with Australia, South Africa and Japan. Playing five Tests in the space of 28 days would not seem ideal.</p><p>The rate of physicality and attrition in England's win over Wales was eye-watering at times last Saturday. That level of toil and output is simply not sustainable over five consecutive weekends. Farrell and the IRFU will look to find a compromise there, but that's for another day.</p><p>That two-Test tour of Australia in July is the next objective on Ireland's horizon. They're having their own issues with Covid-19 in that part of the world as well. Nothing is certain at the moment, yet Farrell, like he did in recent weeks, will have to prepare as if that assignment has been given the green light.</p><p>He has much to consider ahead of that brief visit to Oz in the summer.</p><p>It might be a prime opportunity to give the likes of Ronan Kelleher, Ryan Baird, Caelan Doris and John Cooney more exposure.</p><p>Farrell might even be tempted to take Dan Leavy and Jack Conan Down Under with both set to make their long-awaited returns from injury in the coming months.</p><p>He may even decide that some of the more seasoned campaigners like Tadhg Furlong, CJ Stander, Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton could do with the summer off. Next season is already looking like an absolute slog. Negotiating those five Tests in October and November is just the beginning.</p><p>The Six Nations will loom into view after Christmas and then there is a the small matter of the Lions tour of South Africa in the summer of 2021.Telling some of his top guns to stay at home in July might be a good shout.</p><p>Then again, many of the same players might be woefully short on game time if the Pro14 and European Champions Cup suffer the same fate as the final weekend of the Six Nations. Unsurprisingly, Munster's looming league meeting with Trviso is Cork has been postponed due to travel restrictions enforced by the Italian government.</p><p>The province will have had six weeks off by the time they face Cardiff Blues on April 11.</p><p>The IRFU have always prided themselves on their ability to carefully manage the workload of their players, but finding enough games for them in the coming months may be an ever greater challenge.</p><p>It has left Farrell with much to ponder in the months ahead.</p><p>'It's all in the pot, yeah, it's a good point,' he said.</p><p>'But we don't know when those games are going to be yet. Whether it is one hundred per cent possible yet I don't know. More things could change this weekend.' For now, most of Farrell's in-tray can be filed under chaos. After a Six Nations campaign that raised more question than answers, he faces more uncertain times ahead. He better get used to it.</p><p>@RORYPKEANE OZ TOUR UNDER THREAT? AS things stand, Ireland are set to tour Australia this summer, taking in Tests against the Wallabies in Brisbane on July 4 and Sydney on July 11.</p><p>The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has risen to almost 100 in the country, but no major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed yet.</p><p>'The Department of Health have not provided advice to cancel, scale back or postpone public events due coronavirus,' read a to government statement earlier this week. The Australian Grand Prix is set to go ahead as planned this weekend.</p><p>Should the virus continue to spread, however. all other events in the future - including's Ireland's looming summer tour - will come under scrutiny.</p><p>Key players may be told to take July off</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Preparations: Andy Farrell is seeing his plans disintegrate amid the global health crisis</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-158282962</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YD6-C151-DYTY-C2BJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"828\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 11, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

Last year provided a fascinating study in how everything can go wrong when a sports team is unequipped to handle the psychological rigours of life on the mountain top. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan's victory can be traced back to a February morning in leafy Surrey where Japan coaches Jamie Joseph and Tony Brown stood alongside Eddie Jones at Pennyhill Park, gratefully devouring the English game plan that would expose Joe Schmidt's Ireland. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">England's destructive display in Dublin a few days later was the beginning of a tortuous downward spiral that became the sixth and final year of Schmidt's ground breaking watch over Irish rugby. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Afterwards, amidst a transcendent night for the host nation, Joseph entered the media room to further twist the knife. </p><p>\"We've been preparing for this game for a hell of a lot longer than the Irish have,\" said the Kiwi. \"I said to the players: 'We've been focusing on today basically for the last year and probably subconsciously for the last three years, and Ireland have been thinking about us since Monday.'\" </p><p>Eventually the clich\u00e9 will catch you cold. The Ireland camp fed the press the same line ad nauseam. Everyone knows the 'one game at a time' mantra is a straight bat, a boring answer to avoid controversy, but Joseph allowed the platitude to get lost in translation and flipped it into a motivational tool. </p><p>\"When we got ahead the Irish tried to take us on physically and I think emotionally we were prepared for that,\" he added, telling no word of a lie. </p><p>The narrative cannot be rewritten; brittle Ireland came unstuck, unable to recover from a six-day turnaround after beating Scotland in typically attritional manner. Johnny Sexton and Joey Carbery were not fit enough to start with Carbery unleashed for the last 20 minutes but, one year later, his ankle has still not healed. </p><p>In the mixed zone the 23-year-old was asked about the shock ending when he kicked the ball dead from behind Ireland's try line: 'Not think the pack could march 100 metres down field and secure a draw?' </p><h>Flushed faces </h><p>\"I definitely thought we could have but when the ball came to me they were up in my face,\" Carbery replied. \"I didn't want to risk it with a short kick or anything like that and concede [possession]. I haven't looked back at it yet but at the time I thought it was the right option.\" </p><p>The subtext was Carlos Spencer - the legendary Auckland Blue once ran from his dead ball area before finishing an insane sequence 100 metres down field - but when Carbery glanced around he only saw flushed faces and dark green jerseys drenched by sweat inside a stadium up a steep hill overlooking the Shizuoka prefecture. </p><p>Ireland were camped on their own line ever since Jordan Larmour's loose pass was intercepted by Kenki Fukuoka - the giant killer himself - who hared off on a 60-metre dash for glory. The hounds gave chase. Larmour began tightening up as Fukuoka accelerated but a dramatic lunge by Keith Earls saw all three men tumble over each other, landing in a heap five metres out. </p><p>With 79.55 on the clock Tadhg Beirne grabbed back possession and Dave Kilcoyne charged into contact as the gong sounded. Conor Murray zipped a pass to Carbery but none of his options - a speculative right to left punt pass, a risky chip - would deliver victory. </p><p>That he saw no alternative to protecting a bonus point defeat to Japan reflected how far the pre-tournament number one team in the world had fallen. </p><p>Calamity reigned. On 57 minutes, with Ireland clinging to a 12-9 lead, CJ Stander spun off a scrum and popped a pass for Chris Farrell who turned into his Munster teammate. Angus Gardner signalled for accidental offside and a Japan put-in deep in the Irish 22. </p><p>Everyone could sense what was coming. This was their Italia '90 moment happening in real time. Fumiaki Tanaka arrived at scrumhalf to send Ryoto Nakamura barrelling into Garry Ringrose and Farrell, who did not recover. Another charge, by Lomano Lemeki, forced the green line of defenders onto their whitewash. </p><p>Tadhg Furlong, Iain Henderson and Rhys Ruddock were dragged into desperate resistance to halt Michael Leitch. The light footed Tanaka switched the point of attack once more as Kazuki Himeno was somehow stopped by Earls. The winger instantly hopped up and onside without touching or impeding anyone. </p><p>\"Advantage. Offside. Number 14,\" said Gardner somehow fingering Earls. </p><p>It did not matter but the advantage prompted Nakamura's skip pass, which took out Murray and Earls, forcing Rob Kearney into a man and ball tackle on Tim Lafaele, who offloaded for Fukuoka to scamper over. Yu Tamura's clean strike from the far left made it 16-12. There was 30 minutes remaining but Ireland were visibly shattered while the Brave Blossoms surged from the waves of energy rolling down from their delirious crowd. </p><h>Politely retreated </h><p>It was a scrum on 34 minutes that turned the usually reserved locals into a weapon. Inside the Ecopa you knew something magical was happening. Ireland led 12-6 when Murray fed the ball in and his pack got the initial surge but all the Australian referee saw was the Japanese frontrow emerging from beneath a disengaged Cian Healy. </p><p>\"Their loosehead prop steps out, so they try to attack from the side,\" the Japan camp had warned, planting a seed in Gardner's brain. </p><p>Penalty. The scene ended with Leitch and Lappies Labuschange, the Fijian and Afrikaner co-captains, wrestling the ball from an isolated CJ Stander. The rest of the Irish pack had politely retreated. The rout still seemed impossible but the mood had irrevocably changed as both Japanese props were embraced by turbocharged teammates. </p><p>Japan had found their mojo. Understandably, it took Jack Carty several months to rediscover his. The 27-year-old's first ever competitive Test start began as well as he could have hoped with flashes of his natural footballing ability creating tries for Ringrose and Kearney. </p><p>It was the great unknown that exposed him; Carty had never sat in the commander's chair for such a big game. He was not alone. Every weakness showed as desperation became a disease that spread like wildfire. With Rory Best and Peter O'Mahony focusing on survival in the trenches, the officer class went missing on a night that Japanese sport can cherish forever. </p><p>Being on the receiving end of a sporting upset that reverberated around the globe would make you want to hop on a bullet train to anywhere. Ireland ended up on Rokko Island, quickly rebranded Shutter Island by the travelling circus, while Japan charted a perilous route into Typhoon Hagibis' path of destruction. This became the only adventure worth reliving. It saved the World Cup. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4382433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:612W-4841-JC8Y-802W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1110\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 16, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Eddie Jones, coach of England's rugby team, used the word numerous times to explain the local attitude to the incoming typhoon.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shoganai, roughly translated, means 'it cannot be helped' and is a useful mindset to cultivate in a country built on fault lines and buffeted by frequent, deadly storms. It can also be turned towards nuclear disasters or bad governments.</p><p>Accept and move on. More than any loss of face, even a loss of money, when coronavirus threatened the 2020 Olympics, shoganai is what fuelled the hosts' defiance. They would get through it, they would endure. What is a philosophy in Japan, however, was beginning to look like pure recklessness beyond its shores.</p><p>Long before IOC president Thomas Bach received the call from Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe that brought the 2020 Games to an abrupt close, the Olympics were already done.</p><p>Australia had pulled out, Canada too. Major federations in the United States had signalled their displeasure and across the globe individual athletes were in revolt. Without competitors, Tokyo's race was run. It was not so much that Tokyo and the IOC cancelled the Games, more that the athletes cancelled it for them.</p><p>If Japan was concerned about public embarrassment the greatest would have been to push ahead and risk the drip-drip of humiliation as nations and individuals, one by one, withdrew. Japan was hosting a party, but inviting guests whose own houses were on fire. They had bought all the food and drinks, hired the disco, but positive RSVPs were in short supply.</p><p>Japan is used to the rage of the elements, but coronavirus is different. On the day Typhoon Hagibis hit Tokyo, an earthquake did too.</p><p>Watching the English language rolling news service for updates, this development so traumatised the presenter she became upset and had to be replaced.</p><p>Even shoganai only stretches so far, it seems, and it has now found its limitations faced with germ warfare.</p><p>Typhoons and earth tremors conform to the logic of acceptance because, truly, they cannot be helped. Natural disasters can be prepared for, and Japan has no equal in that field. Equally, the effects in the aftermath can be overcome with collective will and organisational expertise.</p><p>Coronavirus is not the same because its initial spread, its very existence, is most certainly within human control.</p><p>The fight against it can be helped with self-discipline, by forms of isolation.</p><p>The fight against can be helped by not creating a petri dish of humanity in Tokyo and taking a chance no harm will come of that. Although crowds in the open air are not considered the greatest risk, the transport to and from events, the social gatherings that are an inescapable part of any sporting event, present an enormous peril.</p><p>Already, those studying the spread of coronavirus in Europe are alighting on outbreaks they believe were sparked by a sporting fixture - Valencia's visit to Atalanta, a specific football match in England as yet unnamed - and the potential human cost of the Olympics cannot be calculated with any certainty from this distance.</p><p>For athletes to prepare, they would have to be training now, at a time when many governments are banning all but essential movement. It is hard to quantify any activity related to Olympic competition as essential, if the opportunity exists to reschedule it in the calendar.</p><p>The one note of disquiet in yesterday's postponement, then, came in the unnecessary deadline applied to when the Games will be held. 'A date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community,' read the statement from the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee. And yes, ideally, the Games will be held in roughly the same period of summer, one year on.</p><p>Yet they do not have to be. We do not know how the world will look then, what its priorities will be, or how best it will be able to safeguard the health of athletes or spectators.</p><p>So the IOC statement was something more than shoganai. It was arrogance and posturing by administrators who cannot comprehend that coronavirus does not care for their egos or best-laid plans, for the money they have spent, for the edifices they have constructed. It is they who must now accept and move on, they who must rationalise their new reality.</p><p>The Tokyo Games will take place when it is ready, when we are ready, when coronavirus is ready. To presume anything more is a word that, fittingly, has its roots in the country that gave birth to the Olympics: hubris.</p><p>UEFA postponed Euro 2020 for a year with the tournament set to take place in June 2021. The Champions League and Europa League finals are also on hold, and Premier league fixtures have been suspended until at least April 30.</p><p>The 43rd Ryder Cup at Whistling Straits in September is going ahead, although Paul Casey has backed calls to postpone it. The Masters has already been put back until autumn, and all golf courses in England and Wales have been shut.</p><p>The Heineken Champions Cup and Challenge Cup competitions were postponed indefinitely yesterday. Rescheduling is 'subject to advice from government and local authorities'. All domestic rugby has been cancelled.</p><p>Four matches of the tournament are still to be played - including Ireland's games against Italy and France - which have been postponed until October. England versus Italy and Wales versus Scotland are the others.</p><p>Officials have discussed holding a shortened version of the race, due to start in June, that would also restrict how close spectators can get to the riders. The Giro d'Italia has already been postponed.</p><p>The world-famous steeplechase was due to take place on April 4. All racing in Great Britain and Ireland has been suspended after yesterday's Clonmel meeting. The Irish Grand National is now not expected to be held this year.</p><p>With the Allianz Leagues almost certain to not be completed, the Championship is in severe doubt. The GAA hope to start in May, but there may be a return to the old knock-out tournament for one summer only.</p><p>Following Government directives yesterday, golf courses across Ireland and Northern Ireland are set to close until April 19. 'It is our responsibility to prioritise the health of communities,' said the Golf Union of Ireland yesterday.</p><p>International Olympic Committee confirmed that the Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo have been postponed until 'no later than summer 2021'.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Realistic: Ireland Olympic athlete Natalya Coyle</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ISHDLY-158670269</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ISHDLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YH7-7JW1-JCBW-N19J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">396797</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1100\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Irish Daily Mail - Associated Newspapers Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Daily Mail</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"18035\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, Ireland</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 25, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Ireland</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001246</classCode><className>OLYMPICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0G2</classCode><className>SUMMER OLYMPICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

France were playing Italy in Rome on the Sunday - why were they in Dublin? \"Le craic!\" A game with a little bit of bite, two Celtic teams going at each other, some real atmosphere (ahem) at the Aviva and then a shed load of beers with the natives afterwards. They needed four tickets to add to the eight they already had - maybe the IRFU or Ticketmaster had a few Row Z singles still floating around. When I got out of the IRFU offices, they had gone but there were five Italian men walking by. A left onto Shelbourne Road and a German couple decked out in rugby paraphernalia were handing their tickets to the guys at the turnstile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dublin gives up a lot to Paris, London and Rome but as a sports or blow-out destination, we are in a league of our own. People come here from all over Europe for whatever reason.</p><p>Of course, most of the 5,000 Italians who had tickets for this weekend's postponed match will still travel to Dublin from today on. And if you know your Italian rugby - the Italian game's heartland is in the north of the country where the coronavirus has taken hold. There is a good chance that several of them could have the coronavirus. That 5,000, though, is more or less the same amount of Irish people who came back from skiing in the Italian Alps over the last few weeks.</p><p>Did the Government jump the gun a bit? All other games are still going ahead at the time of writing, including the France-Ireland game. The French government's stipulation of a ban on 5,000 people in a confined space was peculiar.</p><p>A full soccer programme went ahead and Ireland will, it seems, play there next Saturday week.</p><p>I think that the general population realise the response to the coronavirus has been disproportionate to the risks involved. In a bad year, there could be as many as 650,000 who die worldwide from 'flu.</p><p>This current situation is unprecedented due to the speed and the rise in infection, particularly in China.</p><p>I, like many people in this country, have no real fear of catching the virus much less dying from it, but I do however have loved ones and people connected to me who would be vulnerable and at risk. On that basis, I accept the over-reaction and if that is what is required to stop it, well then so be it.</p><p>The reasoning behind the strict measures are obvious. The human toll is prime amongst all. The health services of every country could be thrown into the abyss if the situation escalates. Then there is industry, commerce and trade - nobody escapes here.</p><p>Gritted The IRFU stated that they were \"perfectly happy\" to comply with Government advice and postpone the Ireland-Italy game this Saturday. If they had said \"happy\" to comply that would have conveyed the message, \"perfectly happy\" and you get a sense of gritted teeth.</p><p>Even though there is a lot going on this year, the (EURO)20m cost to the Dublin economy due to the postponement is a big hit and even waiting until September might not fully recoup expenditure already paid out.</p><p>Despite the lowly nature of the Italian team, the match was a 51,700 sellout. Work the figures on an average of (EURO)100 per ticket and the gate stands at (EURO)5 million. Anyone suggesting that you play the match behind closed doors obviously comes from the Sinn F\u00e9in school of mathematics.</p><p>Handing back (EURO)5m in gate receipts is bad for business. Being unable to fulfil your broadcasting obligations is bad for business. Having to forego all the corporate hospitality and beer sales on site is bad for business.</p><p>The IRFU posted net income of (EURO)87.5m for their June 2019 accounts. Taking out exceptional items, the Union posted a surplus of (EURO)3.2m. It is hard to know what the IRFU will do with the gate receipts. How much will they refund to patrons? The hope is that the game will be played in September but, you can be guaranteed, the match will be played.</p><p>The IRFU could lose up to (EURO)5m if the match is played in September - twice that figure if it is not played at all. If the Union only posted a trading surplus of (EURO)3.2m last year and the Italy game is proposed for September it would leave them running a significant loss for year end June 2020. Let's look a little deeper at the Six Nations and the financial rewards. When South Africa won the last World Cup, they picked up the princely sum of \u00a3325,000 - what Paul Pogba earns every four days. It's the honour, and the glory though - isn't it? If you play in the Six Nations the dough is significant. The prize money goes sixth place - (EURO)1m, fifth - (EURO)1.5m, fourth - (EURO)2m, third - (EURO)2.5m, second - (EURO)3.5m and first - (EURO)5m and it's (EURO)6m if you win the Grand Slam.</p><p>Each side in the Six Nations, when the entire revenue pot is thrown together get (EURO)15.6m. No wonder the Saffers with the connivance of CVC are keen to join!</p><p>Anybody who thinks that the Ireland-Italy game should be played behind closed doors or given a 0-0 draw doesn't really understand what drives the game. When Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan in the middle of the Rugby World Cup last year three games were cancelled - Namibia -Canada, Italy-New Zealand and England-France. The latter two were huge draws and the fall-out could have been significant. In the end 0-0 draws were awarded. It didn't suit anyone, but there was no choice.</p><p>Meltdowns World Rugby had been prudent and took out a cancellation insurance policy. The premium was two per cent of the gross receipt of \u00a3250m. It was the best \u00a35m the organisation had ever spent. In a land of typhoons, volcanoes, earthquakes, tidal waves and nuclear reactor meltdowns, somebody had to protect their interests and the tournament.</p><p>The hosts had taken a \u00a37.5m (3 per cent) on the tournament as well. London wasn't covered in 2015 but New Zealand was in 2011 for one per cent and they collected after a massive earthquake hit Christchurch six months before the event.</p><p>The sponsors and broadcasters were compensated and an equitable reduction was put in place.</p><p>The IRFU do not have a cancellation policy in place due to the prohibitive costs and the low possibility of Force Majeure or Acts of God.</p><p>The Six Nations organisers do but it is a long way from full cover and in most instances they will only be able to claim when the government of one of the member unions decides to take strong measures.</p><p>I think the IRFU will get a degree of compensation but that could fall a long way short.</p><p>The rest of the matches in the Six Nations, I have a feeling, will take place come hell or high water.</p><p/><p>Anyone who thinks Ireland-Italy shouldbe played behind closed doors doesn't</p><p>really understand what drives the game</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>An empty Aviva stadium could see the IRFU miss out on (EURO)5million in gate receipts</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-158105599</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBX-C3X1-DYTY-C2N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 5, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00039C7</classCode><className>TICKETMASTER ENTERTAINMENT INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS561599 ALL OTHER TRAVEL ARRANGEMENT &amp;

A full soccer programme went ahead and Ireland will, it seems, play there next Saturday week.</p><p>I think that the general population realise that the response to the coronavirus has been disproportionate to the risks involved. In a bad year, there could be as many as 650,000 who die worldwide from flu.</p><p>This current situation is unprecedented due to the speed and the rise in infection, particularly in China.</p><p>I, like many people in this country, have no real fear of catching the virus, much less dying from it, but I do however have loved ones and people connected to me who would be vulnerable and at risk. On that basis, I accept the over-reaction and if that is what is required to stop it, well then so be it.</p><p>The reasoning behind the strict measures are obvious. The human toll is prime amongst all. The health services of every country could be thrown into the abyss if the situation escalates. Then there is industry, commerce and trade - nobody escapes here.</p><p>The IRFU stated that they were \"perfectly happy\" to comply with government advice and postpone the Ireland-Italy game this Saturday. If they had said \"happy\" to comply, that would have conveyed the message. \"Perfectly happy\" and you get a sense of gritted teeth.</p><p>Even though there is a lot going on this year, the (EURO)20m cost to the Dublin economy due to the postponement is a big hit, and even waiting until September might not fully recoup expenditure already paid out.</p><p>Despite the lowly nature of the Italian team, the match was a 51,700 sell-out. Work the figures on an average of (EURO)100 per ticket and the gate stands at (EURO)5m. Anyone suggesting that you play the match behind closed doors obviously comes from the Sinn Fein school of mathematics.</p><p>Handing back (EURO)5m in gate receipts is bad for business. Being unable to fulfil your broadcasting obligations is bad for business. Having to forego all the corporate hospitality and beer sales on site is bad for business.</p><p>The IRFU posted net income of (EURO)87.5m for their June 2019 accounts. Taking out exceptional items, the Union posted a surplus of (EURO)3.2m. It is hard to know what the IRFU will do with the gate receipts. How much will they refund to patrons? The hope is that the game will be played in September but, you can be guaranteed, the match will be played.</p><p>The IRFU could lose up to (EURO)5m if the match is played in September - twice that figure if it is not played at all. If the Union only posted a trading surplus of (EURO)3.2m last year and the Italy game is proposed for September, it would leave them running a significant loss for year end June 2020.</p><p>Let's look a little deeper at the Six Nations and the financial rewards. When South Africa won the last World Cup, they picked up the princely sum of \u00a3325,000 - what Paul Pogba earns every four days. It's the honour and the glory though - isn't it? If you play in the Six Nations the dough is significant. The prize money goes sixth place - (EURO)1m, fifth - (EURO)1.5m, fourth - (EURO)2m, third - (EURO)2.5m, second - (EURO)3.5m and first - (EURO)5m, and it's (EURO)6m if you win the Grand Slam. There is nothing for winning the Triple Crown, which probably explains the non-performance in Twickenham. Each side in the Six Nations, when the entire revenue pot is thrown together get (EURO)15.6m. No wonder the Saffers with the connivance of CVC are keen to join the Six Nations!</p><p>Anybody who thinks that the Ireland-Italy game should be played behind closed doors or given a 0-0 draw doesn't really understand what drives the game.</p><p>When Typhoon Hagibis hit Japan in the middle of the Rugby World Cup last year, three games were cancelled - Namibia -Canada, Italy-New Zealand and England-France. The latter two were huge draws and the fall-out could have been significant. In the end, 0-0 draws were awarded. It didn't suit anyone, but there was no choice.</p><p>World Rugby had been prudent and took out a cancellation insurance policy. The premium was two per cent of the gross receipt of \u00a3250m. It was the best \u00a35m the organisation had ever spent. In a land of typhoons, volcanoes, earthquakes, tidal waves and nuclear reactor meltdowns, somebody had to protect their interests and the tournament.</p><p>The hosts had taken out a \u00a37.5m (three per cent) policy on the tournament as well. London wasn't covered in 2015 but New Zealand was in 2011 for one per cent and they collected when there a massive earthquake hit Christchurch six months before the event.</p><p>The sponsors and broadcasters were compensated and an equitable reduction was put in place. The IRFU do not have a cancellation policy in place due to the prohibitive costs and the low possibility of Force Majeure or Acts of God. The Six Nations organisers do but it is a long way from full cover and, in most instances, they will only be able to claim when the government of one of the member unions decides to take strong measures.</p><p>I think the IRFU will get a degree of compensation, but that could fall a long way short. The rest of the matches in the Six Nations, I have a feeling, will take place come hell or high water.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Empty feeling: the Aviva Stadium will be closed this Saturday and (below) France's game with England is cancelled during the World Cup</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-158095037</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBX-J8K1-JCBW-N4BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

More than 200 people were injured.</p><p>The highest toll was in Fukushima prefecture north of Tokyo, where levees burst in at least 14 places along the Abukuma river. At least 25 people died in Fukushima, including a mother and child who were caught in flood waters, NHK said. Another child of the woman remains missing.</p><p>Residents in Koriyama, one of Fukushima's larger cities, said they were taken by surprise by the flooding. </p><p>\"The river has never flooded like this before, and some houses have been completely swept away. I think it might be time to redraw hazard maps or reconsider evacuation plans,\" said Masaharu Ishizawa, a 26-year-old teacher who was cleaning up at his family home in Koriyama.</p><p>He said there are a lot of elderly in his area and many of them were taken in by relatives. \"We have never seen damage like this before, and maybe global warming and environmental change has something to do with it.\"</p><p>Part of his family's back garden had been washed away, breaking water pipes and electricity lines. The family was using water carried from a local community centre to clean up.</p><p>About 133,000 households were without water while 22,000 lacked electricity, well down on the hundreds of thousands initially left without power but a cause for concern in northern areas where temperatures are falling.</p><p>Survivors described how water rose rapidly to chest height in about an hour and mainly at night, making it hard to escape to higher ground. Many of the dead in Fukushima were elderly, NHK said.</p><p>Fukushima is home to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant that was crippled by a 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Officials for Tokyo Electric Power Co, which owns the plant, said there was no leakage of contaminated water.</p><p>Around the nation, manufacturers took stock. Electronics maker Panasonic Corp said flooding had damaged its plant in a large industrial park in Koriyama. Car makers Nissan, Honda and Subaru said there was no major damage to their factories, while Toyota said all its plants were operating normally.</p><p>Prime minister Shinzo Abe warned that the economic impact could be prolonged. - Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4052110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X8W-3KW1-JC8Y-82JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"409\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 16, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>CC0002C6L</classCode><className>TOKYO ELECTRIC POWER CO INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0002LRG</classCode><className>PANASONIC CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS221122 ELECTRIC POWER DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS221112 FOSSIL FUEL ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>SIC4911 ELECTRIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>NAICS334310 AUDIO &amp;

When reality bit, and their physical limitations and tactical naivety brutally exposed by both Ireland and Japan, it had a devastating effect on morale.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since returning home from Japan with their tails tucked between their legs, Scotland have lost influential senior players Greig Laidlaw, John Barclay, and Tommy Seymour to retirement, which is perhaps part of the natural evolution of a team.</p><p>Similarly, the unavailability of in-form winger Darcy Graham and powerhouse back-rower Magnus Bradbury for this weekend's Six Nations game against Ireland [again!] is disappointing but unavoidable.</p><p>However, the abrupt departure of talismanic stand-off Finn Russell just under two weeks ago is an entirely different matter.</p><p>The 27-year-old walked out on the squad almost immediately after arriving in camp, having fallen out with a number of senior players and members of the management team over whether he could have a drink in the hotel bar as he tried to unwind following Racing 92's defeat to Saracens in the Champions Cup.</p><p>The details of what exactly happened are well-rehearsed but vague - and often contradictory.</p><p>It is not necessary to revisit all of that here, suffice to say this flashpoint is the outcome of a longer-standing and deeper-rooted deterioration in the relationship between Russell and Townsend than the headlines about late night drinking sessions have suggested.</p><p>It was a tension which needed to be addressed properly before it got to crisis level. The fact that it wasn't speaks volumes about the general dysfunctionality of Scottish rugby at the moment.</p><p>During the last two years, the Murrayfield machine has lurched from one humiliating calamity to the next, with trust in the people responsible for running the game being eroded by each and every misstep. This process has accelerated at an alarming rate during the last few months.</p><p>There was, of course, the Typhoon Hagibis fallout, when chief executive Mark Dodson decided to pressurise World Rugby through the media into rescheduling Scotland's all-important match against Japan if the storm hit Yokohama.</p><p>[readmore]978747[/readmore]</p><p>Opinions are split in Scotland over whether this was a good or bad move, but it didn't go down well elsewhere and resulted in the SRU picking up a \u00a370,000 fine as a consequence.</p><p>The SRU may have persuaded World Rugby to dress it up as a 'donation', but that was semantics. It was a fine. Nothing more and nothing less.</p><p>Then there was a governance review conducted by Bill Gammell - a former Scotland internationalist, millionaire oilman and long-standing associate of Dodson - who came to the conclusion that concerns about the conduct of the board and paid executives at the top of the Scottish game should be addressed by giving them more autonomy to do exactly as they please.</p><p>Their proposal was meant to be pushed through a special general meeting by the end of March but now appears to have been discreetly shelved after a furious backlash from member clubs, who have belatedly remembered that it is them and not the hired help who own the business and all its assets.</p><p>Perhaps most galling of all, there was the outrage earlier this month at the revelation that Dodson had collected \u00a3933k [ 1.1m] in salary and bonuses for the year up to the end of May 2019, more than doubling the \u00a3455k [ 538k] he had picked up the year before.</p><p>This is a figure that dwarves, by some considerable distance, the emoluments paid to the CEOs of the other home unions, with Philip Browne, chief executive of the IRFU, apparently taking home in the region of \u00a3175,000 [ 207k] during a similar period!</p><p>With Dodson's three fellow executive directors at Murrayfield also doubling their income from \u00a3535k [ 632k] between them to \u00a31.18m [ 1.39], those four suits at the top of the organisation accounted for 3.5% of the SRU's \u00a361m turnover last year, which is the equivalent of 73% of the total spent on grassroots 'club support and development'.</p><p>All of this is relevant because it feeds into a general feeling in Scotland that the sport is being run by a small cabal of people who have lost sight [if they ever had it] of the core purpose of the business.</p><p>And it relates specifically to the national team's current predicament because it looks like the focus has been so much on either empire-building or fire-fighting, and sometimes both those things at the same time, that they have not bothered themselves addressing potentially uncomfortable truths about the failed World Cup campaign.</p><p>The SRU were without a director of rugby from the end of the last Six Nations right through the World Cup and up until the start of January, when Jim Mallinder finally took on the role, meaning the relatively inexperienced Townsend - with only five years' experience as a head coach with Glasgow Warriors before getting the Scotland job - had no senior rugby figure to bounce ideas off, ask for advice and to ultimately be held accountable by.</p><p>Furthermore, unlike Ireland [who at least made the last eight], there has been no official review of the World Cup. Townsend explained a few weeks ago that there had been plenty of internal discussion by the coaching and management team, which had then been passed upstairs - a bit like leaving the school kids to mark their own homework.</p><p>Had there been a director of rugby in place and/or a proper review of the World Cup, then the ticking time-bomb of the Russell's rapidly deteriorating relationship with Townsend would surely have been identified and addressed before the almost inevitable explosion.</p><p>[readmore]978709[/readmore]</p><p>This lack of accountability has not helped Townsend, rather undermined him. Rumours are rife he has lost the dressing room and there is no way of proving otherwise.</p><p>It was Dodson who gave Townsend his big break at Glasgow Warriors in 2012 (which was a bold move at the time), and their careers have been aligned ever since.

It's more likely Laidlaw's ambition was to be a star first with Jed-Forest and then Scotland. And the fact that he saw service across 245 first class games with Edinburgh, Gloucester and Clermont in between the two was no harm. Pile on 75 caps for his country and that's more than the average man could manage in his wildest dreams. He deserves a spin in Japan. Laidlaw looked happy enough last week to be making the announcement. So did Beauden Barrett who will be squeezing Suntory Sungoliath into his match plan between finishing the Super Rugby season in Auckland and picking up his All Black career again next year. He will be able to catch up with Brodie Retallick, and a growing band of Europeans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A week may not pass these days without another kite being flown about the global season and how it will be financed, but the one near certainty is that yet another high profile player will be packing his bags for Japan.</p><p>It is remarkable that while the rest of the world is busy tightening belts, straitened by Covid, Japan is stuffing its face and expanding its waistline. Wondering about what draws players to that country is a throwback to asking the then 59-year-old former supermodel Jerry Hall what first attracted her to the 86-year-old billionaire Rupert Murdoch. So how can Japan keep reeling off fat salaries for short term contracts? Is this a glamourous little sideshow or does it have any merit? And how is it that Ireland - a country that spews out a decent number of high quality players into rugby's stratosphere - hardly features? Japan is unique in the world game, a sport driven essentially by big business for which the team becomes part of the brand. So it's the company employees who support the team, not the folks who happen to live in the neighbourhood. And the players are employees as well. In times of economic strife the company can cut wages or jobs or whatever they want, without the influence of the outside forces that affect the rest of the professional sports world. And clearly they are slow to chop off the hand that feeds their ego: the success of the company team.</p><p>So what happens when the game genuinely moves onto a professional footing in two years' time? As it stands the shape of that new pro game is shifting. Originally it was supposed to be 12 new franchises based in the World Cup cities. Each is expected to have a stadium with a minimum 15,000 capacity. But by the time it's actually up and running we might find that the companies have not given up their control of the product, and instead it looks like a different shade of what they have now.</p><p>\"I was chatting to my Japanese teacher about this,\" says Cashel man Paddy Butler, who swapped Pau in France for Yamaha Jubilo in Japan earlier this year. \"For the average Japanese person the focus is to get into one of those companies, to work for one of those big outfits in the Top League because they know that's a job for life. That's the way their mindset is. And if you leave you have no chance of ever getting back in - that's the way the loyalty thing is with them.</p><p>\"So I wonder what's going to happen with that move to professionalise it (the game)? Will players be turning down the company job in favour of becoming a professional player and how that will correlate? It's a completely different culture between the two.\"</p><p>Not for the first time, World Rugby needs Japan to deliver. In summer 2017 when Ireland toured there, we were struck not just by the lack of readiness on the ground for the 2019 World Cup but the mindset that went with it. Rugby in Japan is so hierarchical and set in its ways it makes the IRFU of the mid-1990s - the lads faced with the overnight advent of a professional game - look like wild things with revolution on their minds and adventure in their hearts.</p><p>So when World Rugby were recently busy telling us of the surge in interest in the game in Asia on the back of the World Cup, we were a little dubious. Not about the numbers tuning in to the event itself, rather the numbers who will have a 'rashers' what's going on in the game within a couple of seasons of the show leaving town.</p><p>The Rugby World Cup last autumn created a false picture of the game in Japan. Even World Cups in long established countries will do that. This time around however everyone was struck by the stoicism of a nation whose observance of 'the show must go on' motto was unique. World Rugby went from sweating buckets over the carnage caused by Typhoon Hagibis to singing and dancing over the quality of the run-in to the finish - which was first class. Now they need some follow-on. They need the game in that country to look like it can catch on.</p><p>The flow of talent from the Northern Hemisphere might help. Hadleigh Parkes from Wales, England's Freddie Burns and George Kruis, are all joining Laidlaw. Previously the fact that Japan's financial year kicked off on April 1 was a problem in contracting players from the Northern Hemisphere. The company teams needed players on site by then but contracts on this side of the equator ran beyond that date. Japan seemingly is loosening up on that. Now they need the locals to get on board.</p><p>\"With our team there's only seven or eight professional Japanese players, but the club asked a few more and a lot turned them down because they felt that if they left (the company) they wouldn't get back in,\" Butler says. \"It could be a weird dynamic with that. Soccer here is professional and they don't work in companies so maybe it will be ok, but I know the rugby players have a very strong relationship with the company. Your main objective from university is to get into one of these companies. And that's it, sorted.\"</p><p>But is the playing experience useful for those who are stopping a while before moving back to bigger leagues? Like Munster's new boys Damian de Allende and RG Snyman? Dave Dillon, coach at champion club KobelcoSteelers, sounds like he could be Irish, played a bit of club rugby for Armagh and Blackrock and taught PE in St Michael's in Dublin. Like a great big chunk of the world's rugby coaching and playing fraternity, he's a Kiwi. He maintains the J League is not a sleepover.</p><p>\"Both of those boys made a big impact here and I'd say they'll be the better for it going to Munster,\" he says. \"I think it depends on the individual. I'd like to think we play a fast brand of rugby but it's physical in Japan. And it's a good standard. A lot of people seem to think rugby here is a pretty new sport but in Kobe they've been playing it for 95 years. It was an outlet for the steel workers and the guys have a very strong bond with the company.\"</p><p>Dillon's vision for the future of the new professional regime sounds like it won't move too far away from the existing base of the business and the team being joined at the hip. And you'd expect that will have an influence on the influx of players who might not be marquee names.</p><p>\"That will be interesting,\" Dillon says. \"On the back of the World Cup the players that are coming over are well established internationals and it just happens that they are from the Northern Hemisphere but how does that look moving forward? Normally there's a big Southern Hemisphere influence in Japan.</p><p>\"I guess with Covid-19 and how the global calendar looks, and what competitions are in what spaces - that will have an influence.</p><p>\"But if you look at Greig Laidlaw, he's not just a quality player but, knowing him, he's a good man and he'll have a real ability to lead. Recruitment is above my pay scale but we have a good set up here and in any organisation it's about many heads getting together and making the right decision.\"</p><p>The reality is that largely you stick to what you know. So if Japan has been dominated by coaches from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa then the imports will be coming from there as well.</p><p>\"I think as a coaching group you want to have affiliation or you want to really know the person that's coming in. Having worked with them previously is a bonus. You've got to be able to play footy or there's no point coming in, but then it's about: 'Are you a good man and will you add value off the field as well?' And will they buy into the idea that it's a company team and there's a strong history. We're really big on those sort of things. So would we look at someone from the Northern Hemisphere? Yes we'd look at it, but you'd want some affiliation with who's coming in.\"</p><p>If World Rugby are going to see a vibrant pro game take off in Japan then it looks like being resourced closer to home.</p><p>The trickle from this end of the world, being led by Laidlaw, might not be a flood.</p><p/><p>A sport driven</p><p>by big business</p><p>for which the</p><p>team is part</p><p>of the brand</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Cashel man Paddy Butler swapped Pau in France for Yamaha Jubilo in Japan earlier this yearRG Snyman enjoyed his time in Japan both at club level and at last year's World Cup with South Africa before moving to Munster</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-161496059</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60BF-DM91-JCBW-N498-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 12, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Business &amp;

New Zealand's Pool B game with Italy in the city of Toyota, and the Pool C showdown between France and England, have both been cancelled, while a decision is expected on Sunday morning for the crucial Pool A clash between Japan and Scotland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Typhoon Hagibis is expected to be the biggest typhoon of the 2019 season, but is now not expected to affect Ireland's match against Samoa in Fukuoka after fears earlier in the week that that game could also be cancelled.</p><p>Fans will be refunded for their tickets, but what does it mean for each pool?</p><p>Inarguably, Pool A looks set to be most affected by any cancellations. A bonus-point victory over Samoa will ensure Ireland's progression to the last eight regardless of the outcome of Japan's match with Scotland, but whether Joe Schmidt's side will face South Africa or New Zealand still depends on Sunday's game.</p><p>Gregor Townsend's Scotland can join Ireland in the quarter-finals with victory over Japan, paving the way for Ireland to top the group, while a win for the hosts would consign Ireland to second spot.</p><p>A loss against Samoa could still see Ireland through if Scotland lose to Japan, although losing bonus points in this weekend's games would be a factor with Ireland sitting just one point ahead of Scotland as it stands. In the unlikely event that Scotland pick up two losing bonus points and Ireland lose to Samoa without a bonus point then Ireland would be eliminated.</p><p>To complicate things further, if Ireland beat Samoa without a bonus point (thus finishing on 15 points), both Japan and Scotland can match that tally - if Scotland claim a bonus-point win and Japan secure a losing bonus point.</p><p>In this unlikely event, Scotland would top the group on points difference, while Japan would progress at Ireland's expense on head-to-head. If Japan were to claim two losing bonus points (by scoring four tries and finishing within seven points of Scotland) then Japan would top the group with 16 points, and Ireland would progress on head-to-head over Scotland.</p><p>The above illustrates just how crucial the tie between Japan and Scotland would be in deciding who progresses from Pool A. However, if the game is cancelled, then the only way Scotland could progress is if Ireland lose to Samoa without picking up a bonus point. In short, an Ireland win on Saturday and the cancellation of Scotland's game with Japan would see Scotland eliminated without taking to the field.</p><p>The confirmed cancellation of Italy's game with New Zealand also denies Conor O'Shea's side the chance to progress, regardless of how slim those chances were. A bonus-point victory over New Zealand, while denying the All Blacks a losing bonus point, could have seen Italy progress to the last eight at the expense of Steve Hansen's side.</p><p>Unlikely as it may have been, the cancellation of the game between the sides is a sour end to Italy's World Cup campaign.</p><p>The other game to be cancelled was a relatively easier decision, with France and England both already ensured progression from Pool C. A French victory could have seen them top the group at England's expense, but with the Pool C winners likely to face Australia and the runners-up set to face Wales, there is no clear advantage to winning Pool C.</p><p>[readmore]956184[/readmore]</p><p>The other main repercussion - as mentioned by Donal Lenihan in today's Daily Donal vlog - is that New Zealand, England and France all now have an extra week to prepare for their quarter-final games, and an extra weekend of recovery.</p><p>This gives those sides an advantage over their likely opponents at the quarter-final stage, with Australia, Wales, Ireland, and we can only assume Japan and Scotland all to play over the coming days.</p><p>Could the match cancellations become even more significant beyond the pool stages?</p><p>&lt;strong&gt;Rugby World Cup Podcast: 'It's beginning to look like Scotland was the blip'&lt;/strong&gt;</p><p>[marketing=iesportpodcast]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRKNEW-956212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRKNEW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7R-F8V1-F0BB-S3BD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315462</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"704\"/><timeReceived>11:18 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

There's been off-field controversy, player unrest, brilliant skills and brain fades... and that's just Scotland!</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was so much uncertainty about how this Six Nations would play out. There were four new coaches in Andy Farrell, Wayne Pivac, Fabien Galthie and Franco Smith and plenty of new captains and players as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the first fortnight of action done and dusted, however, things are starting to take shape.</p><p>Here, Sportsmail runs through the mid-term report on all six participants.</p><p>IRELAND B+ Terms such as 'recovery' and 'resurgence' have been doing the rounds in recent days. Ireland have not quite returned to the boom times of 2018, but Saturday's four-try trouncing of Wales was a massive step in the right direction.</p><p>There was a genuine fear that this squad - the majority of which were on duty throughout the worrying campaign of 2019 and subsequent World Cup implosion - were in an irreversible slide and Farrell's new coaching ticket, for all the positive noises about change and new routines etc, were not equipped to halt it.</p><p>There was also criticism, a lot of it warranted, that Ireland's new head coach was repeating the mistakes of the past and putting his trust in a clutch of experienced campaigners who had failed to fire consistently in a green jersey for the best part of 18 months.</p><p>Farrell and his under-fire squad have responded with an unbeaten start to this campaign. They sit joint-top with France and travel to Twickenham in two weeks with a Triple Crown, Championship and Grand Slam all still on offer. The likes of Conor Murray, Johnny Sexton, Peter O'Mahony and CJ Stander have stepped up while Farrell has infused the squad with exciting young talent such as Ronan Kelleher, Caelan Doris and Max Deegan. The form of Jordan Larmour and Andrew Conway has been rewarded while Ulster's inform full-back Will Addison is primed to make an impact later in the tournament.</p><p>A big win can do wonders for morale and Ireland have some much-needed momentum as well. England on their home turf won't be easy, but Ireland will fancy it. Remaining fixtures: England (away) Feb 23, Italy (home) March 7, France (away), March 14</p><p>FRANCE After a barren decade, there was a sense that Les Bleus, for so long a sleeping giant in this tournament, were about to wake from their slumber. Fabien Galthie, an icon of the French game, had been appointed as head coach and the former scrumhalf set out his stall by placing his faith in a youthful squad with a new captain in 26-yearold Toulon flanker Charles Ollivon, who had only 11 caps to his name prior to this championship.</p><p>That sense of excitement could be felt in the Stade de France in the hours before kick-off on that opening weekend. England, the World Cup finalists, were subsequently blown off the park by the rampant hosts during a furious first half.</p><p>An early try from Vincent Rattez and a brace from Ollivon saw France surge into a 24-0 lead.</p><p>England wing Jonny May almost single-handedly sparked a late revival but France held on for a huge win and a major statement.</p><p>Galthie's authority, a defensive system engineered by Shaun Edwards, the calm leadership of Ollivon and the sheer bril-liance of Antoine Dupont at scrum-half were the highlights of that first-round win.</p><p>The only worry was a fall-off in the final 20 minutes and it would prove the case again last weekend against Italy. Having built a 28-10 lead on the hour mark, this France side once again went off the boil, conceding two late tries as the Azzurri mounted a late fightback.</p><p>France have looked awesome at times but they have also looked vulnerable and there is a nagging suspicion that for all the talents of Bernard le Roux, Gregory Alldritt, Dupont, Romain Ntamack, Virimi Vakatawa and Teddy Thomas, they still don't look fit enough to go the distance. They have two weeks to solve that issue.</p><p>Remaining fixtures: v Wales (away) Feb 22, v Scotland (away) March 8, v Ireland (home) March 14</p><p>WALES C Going into their first Six Nations in 12 years without Warren Gatland at the helm was always going to be a steep learning curve for this Wales team and so it has proved.</p><p>A facile 42-0 win over Italy in Cardiff on the opening weekend was followed by a reality check in Dublin, Wayne Pivac's side going down 24-14 in Dublin.</p><p>Depth has always been an issue with Wales. The creative spark and leadership of Liam Williams and Jonathan Davies is already being felt after just two rounds. Still, there is a sense that Pivac and assistant coach Stephen Jones are in the early stages of evolving Wales from the hardnosed outfit under Gatland into a more free-flowing, attack-minded team in the mould of Pivac's allaction Scarlets that took the Pro14 by storm a few years ago.</p><p>They could have a major say in this tournament yet, with France arriving in Cardiff in two weeks' time.</p><p>Remaining fixtures: v France (home) Feb 22, v England (away) March 7, v Scotland (home) March 14</p><p>DENGLAND There's just never a dull moment when Eddie Jones is around is there? The wily Australian promised 'absolute brutality' when England rolled into Paris in round one. Eddie's men, who had stormed to the World Cup final just three months previously, were subsequently beaten out the gate.</p><p>Saturday's 13-6 in Murrayfield, an absolute slugfest in the driving wind and rain, has steadied the ship somewhat.</p><p>The main issue for England at present is their power deficit. Simply put, when the brothers Vunipola and Manu Tuilagi are on the field then this England squad are a different proposition. Without that trio of Pacific Island powerhouses, they are nowhere near as threatening.</p><p>All three were fit last season, a very rare occurrence, and England looked like world beaters. Now, Billy Vunipola is absent due to another broken arm, his fourth such injury in two years, but Mako Vunipola and Tuilagi are poised to feature against Ireland in Twickenham.</p><p>After two away trips, England will relish running out on Twickenham for the first time since their loss to the Springboks in that ill-fated World Cup final in Japan.</p><p>And they are still loaded with quality operators in Jamie George, Maro Itoje, Sam Underhill, Tom Curry and Owen Farrell.</p><p>But they lack the gain-line busting power of last year. Jones (above) should make up for that with a few well-placed soundbites next week.</p><p>Remaining fixtures: v Ireland (home) Feb 23, v Wales (home) March 7, v Italy (away) March 14</p><p>ESCOTLAND Scotland fans may have thought that things couldn't possibly get any worse after that utter shambles of a World Cup. Crashing out at the pool stages after losses to Ireland and Japan was only the beginning.

Irish rugby's financial model has collapsed but the sport is hardly alone in playing Oliver Twist to Miche\u00e1l's Mr Bumble. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I know Philip Browne has said in the past that the current financial model, being so dependent on crowds, will have to change to something more sustainable,\" says Simon Keogh, the chief executive of Rugby Players Ireland. </p><p>What that is nobody knows. We imagine Rassie Erasmus and Jeff Bezos selling a new global vision to CVC's faceless executives from a boardroom in the clouds. </p><p>Crowds are the lifeblood of the game. Especially in Ireland. Combating this \"existential\" threat - as Browne has labelled rugby's plight - is not just hardball lobbying of an accident prone Government. It is a fast approaching reality. </p><p>Bean counters, from amateur clubs to professional dynasties, are humming the same funeral march. </p><p>The \"no shower on site\" rule cannot hold either. Not in schools. Not in clubs. Hypothermia beckons as we enter the winter of our discontent. </p><p>The new season finds itself seven months into a pandemic, with no end in sight, but the demise of professional rugby's current iteration is coming into focus. Damian Hopley, chief executive of the English players association, speaks of a \"typhoon sweeping through the sport\". </p><h>Foundations 'rocked' </h><p>We witnessed the aftermath of Typhoon Hagibis in Japan last year and Hopley is on the money - not that there is any - when stating: \"The foundations of sport have been completely rocked.\" </p><p>Cracks in concrete pillars propping up Yokohama train station needed mending while water levels had risen so high that Japanese players were forced to wade into the stadium 24 hours before their do or die encounter with Scotland. </p><p>The game went ahead. Fast forward 12 months and Japan have declined an invitation to tour Europe for the autumn series (Georgia snatched their place). </p><p>\"The right decision has been made,\" said Japan coach Jamie Joseph. \"We still have plenty of time to prepare ourselves for the next World Cup.\" </p><p>Meanwhile in France, an outbreak of the virus at Racing 92 cancelled today's trip to Ronan O'Gara's La Rochelle while casting a dark cloud over the Champions Cup final on October 17th. </p><p>You listen to Hopley and Browne delivering stark warnings about pro rugby's potential collapse, and realise the underlying message to their respective governments is to provide a bailout that pales into insignificance when compared to the Irish banks in 2008 (EUR 41.7 million, rather than billion, should keep the show on the road). </p><p>\"I'd be confident that we can get through it,\" said Browne in September before extinguishing fresh hope by adding the \"V\" word. \"There may be a little bit of pain along the way, but I think that we will get to the point where there's a vaccine and things will turn.\" </p><p>Neither coronavirus-killing-jabs nor Government funds will save the IRFU. Having contacted all the king's horses and all the king's men this week, we write with complete confidence that the only people who can put rugby back together again are driven demented by the constant channel surfing to find a game. </p><p>The worm will only turn on gate receipts. Browne knows the truest remedy is to prove how fans can safely enter and exit the Aviva without overly mixing households. </p><p>\"It is looking a bit bleak at the moment from all unions and that unfortunately is our reality,\" says Stephen McNamara, the IRFU's director of communications. \"So far, we have cut all non-essential spending and suppliers costs and only phased them back in when they are essential again [at reduced rates]. We have reduced player and staff salaries across all of Irish Rugby [the largest overhead] and we are now looking at how to further cut our spend across all programmes and elements of the game that we support. </p><p>\"No decisions have yet been made, but as Philip said, everything is under review. Our aim will be to cut costs rather than discontinue any programme, but some tough decisions may need to be taken.\" </p><p>Browne has also stated that no organisation this reliant on clicking turnstiles will survive another six months performing to an empty gallery. </p><p>Player salaries are in for a second hefty dent after Christmas. The IRFU and Keogh - a rapid Harlequins winger in between two stints with Leinster - ironed out a fair deal during the summer, certainly in comparison to what players in other nations had to swallow (see panel). </p><p>\"We operate a lot differently from England,\" says Keogh. \"We rely on the international game to support the provinces and the community game whereas the English clubs almost compete against the international game.\" </p><h>Full houses </h><p>Different models are equally reliant on full houses. Hopley states \"irrevocable damage\" has already been inflicted upon the English clubs while Mick Dawson, the Leinster chief executive, revealed losses of EUR 9 million. </p><p>\"At the moment our income streams are slashed, cut in half,\" Dawson told the Inside Business podcast. \"We normally have about 12,500 season tickets so we decided not to do that [this season] for the simple reason that we don't know when people will get through the turnstiles again. So we formed a Leinster club and about 6,000 people signed up for that. Those people are buying the right to get first crack at any tickets that do become available. But there's no light at the end of the tunnel at the moment.\" </p><p>On a dreary Wednesday, Keogh refused to strike the same despondent chord. </p><p>\"I do think we can get out of this. I don't know when that will be and that's the problem for everybody; no one can forecast or budget for the next while. </p><p>\"The message [Hopley and Browne are sending to the Irish and UK governments] is real. It is not a ploy. We went through a process with the IRFU in July and when you go through everything you see the stark reality of where we are going. We just need to tread very carefully.\" </p><p>Strong, sensible leadership has never felt so important. </p><p>Without supporters at the Aviva, and Thomond Park in particular, the next round of salary negotiations between Keogh and Browne will be short and sour. </p><p>\"It is going to be a harder conversation because, without doubt, there is going to be less money in the game,\" Keogh states matter of factly. \"But there are grounds to be optimistic. We are seven months into a pandemic, of which we know a lot more about, and rugby is actually being played now. </p><p>\"Crowds are being seen in other parts of the world so hopefully this season we will see them come back because the survival of professional rugby - without any additional funding - is dependent on it.\" </p><p>Six hundred northern souls marched on Ravenhill last night, 200 Connacht fans can return to The Sportsground today and on Monday New Zealand's prime minister Jacinda Ardern will reveal whether Auckland can return to \"alert level 1\". If that happens, 37,000 supporters in Wellington will be joined by 50,000 at Eden Park when the Wallabies face the All Blacks over the next two Sundays. </p><p>If Auckland's mini cluster remains a problem - a city of 1.7 million was severely restricted due to 179 cases that were fully tracked and traced - the second Bledisloe Test match will switch to Forsyth Barr stadium in Dunedin. The Kiwis might have the advantage of geographical isolation but they have a firm handle on this generational crisis. Their All Blacks took a 50 per cent pay freeze back in April.</p><p>The Rugby Championship brings New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa to Australia for 12 games between November 7th and December 12th. The 75 per cent capacity in stadiums should have a green light by then. </p><h>Perilous tightrope</h><p> Elsewhere, the game walks a perilous tightrope. The Springboks might pull the plug on travelling and French club's 5,000 capacity at Top 14 games is expected to be reduced or even erased as Covid swarms Europe once again. </p><p>\"It's estimated that the home unions could lose more than \u00a3100 million if closed doors rugby continues,\" said World Rugby chief executive Brett Gosper. </p><p>The crowds are inevitably being linked to salaries. Some unions are looking at percentage deductions based on the numbers allowed into stadiums. </p><p>Considering the South African franchises are moving north, you would think the collective minds would zero in on streamlining the global calendar. </p><p>\"Most of the administrations at both ends of the world are heavily focused on issues in relation to 2020 and Covid,\" says Omar Hassanein, chief executive of the International Rugby Players' Association, \"I guess that is clouding everyone's mind from focusing on the longer term issues. </p><p>\"It is keep your head above water stuff at the moment. That means the timeline for meaningful talks on a global calendar are starting to get pushed out but at some point we are going to have to get all the stakeholders focused because it is a complex piece of work.\" </p><p>Surely - right here, right now - we live in the ideal moment to form a new deal. </p><p>\"The noose is tightening,\" says Hopley. \"Can clubs survive until Christmas or into next year? Can some unions survive? It's a very stark situation.\" </p><p>Roll on the rugby season from the edge of oblivion. </p><h>Around the world How countries are dealing with the Covid-19 effect </h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ireland</emphasis> Supporters: Ulster trialled 600 people at Kingspan stadium last night. Without at least 18,000 fans inside the Aviva stadium, the IRFU cannot invoice for EUR 32.5 million worth of premium tickets. Salaries: Players accepted a 10 per cent pay cut and another 10 per cent salary deferral until January 1st 2021 but IRFU CEO Philip Browne has indicated that, due to the professional game costing EUR 5 million per month, more cuts are probable. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">New Zealand </emphasis> Supporters: Wellington's Sky Stadium (pictured, right) is expected to sell 37,000 tickets for the first Bledisloe Cup match against the Wallabies next Sunday. Salaries: The All Blacks accepted a 50 per cent pay freeze to protect players earning less than $50,000 (EUR 28,000). Match fees have never been so valuable. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Australia </emphasis> Supporters: 40,000 Rugby League fans will attend the Grand Final in Sydney's 82,000 capacity Olympic stadium on October 25th with 75 per cent capacity hoped to be accommodated for The Rugby Championship in November. Salaries: The Wallabies backed away from strike action or a mass exodus after Rugby Australia brought their salaries back to 100 per cent. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">England</emphasis> Supporters: The planned 20,000 at Twickenham has been abandoned due to a second wave of the virus. Salaries: A 25 per cent pay cut across all clubs prompted Manu Tuilagi to leave Leicester for the Sale Sharks. The England centre just tore his Achilles' tendon. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">France</emphasis> Supporters: 5,000 attending matches is under review as France, especially Racing 92 and Stade Francais, are severely impacted by the second wave. Salaries: A 20 per cent cut in club budgets is expected to increase unless the billionaire owners pump more cash into a failing financial model. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wales</emphasis> Supporters: No crowds presently allowed at any sporting events. Upcoming games against Scotland and Georgia will be hosted by Parc y Scarlets in Llanelli. Salaries: 25 per cent cut across the board. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Scotland</emphasis> Supporters: 700 supporters and 300 staff at Murrayfield was the initial plan but the Pro 14 fixtures begin behind closed doors. Salaries: SRU CEO Mark Dobson's 30 per cent pay cut, with players taking a 25 per cent hit, has come in for severe criticism after it was revealed that last year he banked \u00a3933,000 (EUR 1 million) in pay and bonuses. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">South Africa</emphasis> Supporters: Rugby returns to South Africa this weekend with 174 people - including players and staff - allowed inside the 51,762 capacity Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria as the new Pro 16 sides, Bulls v Sharks and Lions v Stormers, square off. Salaries: 25 per cent cut until the end of 2020. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Japan</emphasis> Supporters: 5,000 have been allowed into baseball and soccer stadiums with this number expected to increase. Salaries: The lucrative club scene is largely unaffected as player salaries are underwritten by corporations, but the JRFU cancelled the Brave Blossoms groundbreaking European tour. </p><p>GAVIN CUMMISKEY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-1.4370884</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6103-GXY1-DYS1-00TC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2085\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 3, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001407</classCode><className>PROFESSIONAL SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

People will say, 'Oh it's all about the integrity of the tournament that Japan against Scotland has to be played'. Well, what about our game? We were still in there with a sporting chance. That cannot be denied. England, France, New Zealand, it's okay for them to be considered as certain to go through. Why is it okay for them and not us?</p><p>\"That's where the anger comes from.

That anger wouldn't be directed at Scotland if there were any legal challenge to get it played but against the principle of it all.</p><p>\"We would be fired up ourselves.

Italy matter.</p><p>\"It has been an unbelievably anti-climactic way for us to finish. Even though we understand the reasons it doesn't take away the downbeat feeling. We're empty. It's hard to take.

However, from the moment the game's governing body scheduled the tournament for Japan in September and October there was always a strong chance it would be affected by the weather. This is typhoon season after all.</p><p>Hagibis is something of a freak and its rates of expansion have left meteorologists in awe, but it is typhoon No 19 of 2019. Climate scientists have found that typhoons are reaching their maximum intensities further north than they used to and that puts Japan right in the firing line.</p><p>Even before the tournament, organisers were speaking about having contingency plans in place to deal with extreme weather events. They told us they were prepared.</p><p>When the time came, the curtain was pulled back and revealed nothing.</p><p>France v England and New Zealand v Italy were cancelled, Scotland v Japan might follow next.</p><p>One team has been eliminated as a result of the decision, another could follow. Italy might have had a slim chance of making the quarter-finals, but they were entitled to the on-pitch opportunity to qualify.</p><p>The odds on Scotland progressing were much shorter, but Gregor Townsend and his players could be heading home without ever getting a chance to progress.</p><p>In the context of a storm that will cost the Japanese economy tens of billions and probably lead to death and destruction, the World Cup is small beer. But for those involved it is the culmination of at least four years' work, for many it is a once-in-a-lifetime shot.</p><p>For Leonardo Ghiraldini, it was a chance to sign off with his 105th cap against the world's best. The Italian hooker had worked slavishly to return from injury in time, but yesterday the rug was pulled from under him.</p><p>Sergio Parisse will never play at a World Cup again. It was he, perhaps, who voiced the frustration of the players best yesterday when he opined that the game would have gone ahead if it was the All Blacks who needed four or five points to progress. More importantly, he pointed his finger at the organisers and their lack of a contingency plan.</p><p>\"It is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn't like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no plan B, because it isn't news that typhoons hit Japan.</p><p>\"Sure everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team. We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team.</p><p>\"The alternative is plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.\"</p><p>World Rugby said all four unions were on board with the decision, but it's clear there is some discord in the dressing-rooms. Supporters, who have shelled out thousands to be here, will be reimbursed but the players can never get the blood, sweat and tears expended to get here back.</p><p>And the Rugby World Cup's integrity will be on the floor if the Scots are eliminated without getting a chance to face the hosts. Despite the social media theories, there is no grand conspiracy at work to get Japan into the last eight or give New Zealand a break. This just looks like grand incompetence.</p><p>World Rugby says the game will be on Sunday or not at all, Scotland coach Townsend is citing force majeure in calling for it to be moved to Monday if it can't be played in Yokohama on Sunday.</p><p>There are alternative venues being lined up within the city and the likelihood is it will be played behind closed doors if it's played at all. A call will be made on Sunday morning.</p><p>If it doesn't go ahead, it will be a scandal. The World Cup is already under pressure from outside forces, it could struggle to recover from this one. Already, the quarter-finals are imbalanced. Joe Schmidt has conceded that Ireland will be at a disadvantage to New Zealand if they play next Saturday or Sunday, given the opposition will have a weekend off. England have gone for a mini-camp while Australia are taking on Georgia, France can recharge the batteries before they meet Wales.</p><p>Like life, sport is not fair and it's about how you adapt. But while public safety is paramount, World Rugby should have done more to ensure the tournament is beyond reproach.</p><p>\"We looked pretty exhaustively at all the options. What is important to note is that where we are is in accordance with what we said we would do before the tournament,\" said tournament director Alan Gilpin.</p><p>\"Doing that on this scale, with so many teams to move around, and to be able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams after the pool stage, we couldn't guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can't do it for all, we can't do it for any.</p><p>\"We have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly.</p><p>\"Italy are in the same position as Scotland are in. It is a huge match and we would love to play that game. But we won't treat that match any differently.\"</p><p>The Italians are right to feel hard done by. If they are eliminated, the Scots are correct to kick up a fuss. World Rugby scheduled this tournament for this time of year, and should have been ready for anything.</p><p>It is patently clear that it was not.

Scotland felt those regulations were open to challenge due to \"force majeure\" measures, with Dodson repeatedly demanding a \"common sense approach\".</p><p>Gilpin insisted on Tuesday that all appropriate tournament rules had been followed during the typhoon.</p><p>\"Our sympathies are with the families of those who lost loved ones and the millions affected by Typhoon Hagibis,\" said Gilpin.</p><p>\"We were very clear with everyone before the tournament about the detailed contingency plans in place but also tournament rules about how contingency plans could be implemented.</p><p>[quote]Tournament rules for Rugby World Cup specify that for the pool phase any match not completed on the day scheduled will be not moved to a different day.

Yes. Scotland's clash with Japan is at risk of being cancelled if conditions are deemed unsafe to stage the match, even though Typhoon Hagibis will have passed through Yokohama by that point.</p><p>The match between Namibia and Canada lso appears to be in danger, even though Kamaishi is not directly on the expected path of the typhoon.</p><p>What happens when games are cancelled? The match is ruled a 0-0 draw, with two points awarded to both teams.</p><p>That means England and France remain first and second in Pool C, with England progressing at pool-winners and France as runners-up.</p><p>New Zealand are also guaranteed top spot in Pool D, but Italy lose out heavily as they needed to beat the All Blacks to have any chance of progressing to the knockout stage. Ironically, it is the first time Italy have drawn with the All Blacks, standing as their best result against the side even though it ends their World Cup campaign.</p><p>What happens if Japan vs Scotland is cancelled? Both teams are awarded two points, which would be enough to secure Japan first place in Pool A and eliminate Scotland in the process.</p><p>Currently, Japan lead the group on 14 points, with Ireland in second on 11 points and Scotland third with 10 points, meaning Scotland need to beat Japan and prevent them from claiming two bonus points, or hope Samoa beat Ireland on Saturday.</p><p>What have Scotland said? They are understandably furious, given that there has already been the suggestion for matches to be relocated or rescheduled. A spokesman for the Scottish Rugby Union said: \"We are in regular dialogue with World Rugby at all levels to work to ensure our fixture against Japan on Sunday can be played as planned. Public safety is the clear priority.</p><p>\"With potential impact on our last Pool A fixture, Scottish Rugby fully expects contingency plans to be put in place to enable Scotland to contest for a place in the quarter-finals on the pitch, and will be flexible to accommodate this.\"</p><p>What have World Rugby said? Rugby World Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin said: \"We looked pretty exhaustively at all the options. What is important to note is that where we are is in accordance with what we said we would do before the tournament.</p><p>\"Doing that on this scale, with so many teams to move around, and to be able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams after the pool stage, we couldn't guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can't do it for all, we can't do it for any.</p><p>\"We have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly. Italy are in the same position as Scotland are in. It is a huge match and we would love to play that game. But we won't treat that match any differently.\"</p><p>How bad will the typhoon be? Hagibis is already predicted to be the worst typhoon of the year, with the current tropical cyclone measured at 1,400km wide - 1,000km more than Typhoon Faxai that devastated Tokyo and the Kanto region last month.</p><p>Winds have been recorded at peaks of 160mph, with sustained winds of 150mph moving the typhoon at around nine miles per hour.</p><p>The expectation is that the tropical cyclone will weaken on its approach to the Tokyo Bay area, but it has been described by Jeff Masters, a meteorologist with the magazine Scientific American, as one of the most damaging typhoons in Japanese history.</p><p>\"If it hits Tokyo Bay like some of the current forecasts are saying, then it's going to be a multibillion dollar disaster,\" Dr Masters said.</p><p>Last year, Typhoon Jebi proved the worst tropical cyclone for 25 years, killing 11 people, injuring hundreds and costing an estimated $12.6bn in damage, while Faxai killed three people last month.</p><p>Closing in: Typhoon Hagibis has already cancelled two World Cup games</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Closing in: Typhoon Hagibis has already cancelled two World Cup games</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-153749928</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-MBK1-JCBW-N3KN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

But the state of the pitch at the Hakatanomori Stadium has provided a huge talking point.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">After the surface cut up badly during previous games at the venue, the turf has been relayed ahead of today's key clash but still looked in a sorry state.</p><p>At the team's captain's run yesterday, Fivemiletown man Chris Farrell was able to lift an entire patch of grass and place a full-size rugby ball underneath as a laughing Jacob Stockdale watched on.</p><p>Ireland scrum coach Greg Feek, whose own area of expertise threatens to be most affected, told media in attendance: \"You've seen the pitch for yourselves. Obviously the organisers told us and both teams know about it, we know they had to relay the pitch. We went out there and just had an inspection and we have been given all the assurances by World Rugby that it's safe to play on and that's all we can ask for.\"</p><p>CONTINUED ON PAGE 54 Tony Ward: Time for Schmidt's men to trample the fear and play from the heart P52-53 FROM BACK PAGE Coach Feek added: \"Obviously I don't want to predict anything or cause any more controversy at this stage. We will just try to back the players, trust that the pitch will do its job.</p><p>\"We are trying to alleviate any concerns while we are out there but then it's just a matter of wait and see.</p><p>\"The referee (Nic Berry) will be aware of it, so that's the key. All the communication is there.\"</p><p>Winger Keith Earls was diplomatic, suggesting that the pitch would likely play better than it looked.</p><p>\"It doesn't look great, to be honest with you but actually out there, it's flat and it's quite firm,\" said the Munsterman.</p><p>\"It doesn't feel too bad to run on. Like what Feeky said, it has been inspected and it has been deemed playable. That's the way it felt out there.</p><p>\"I suppose it's going to be the same for both teams. We just have to get on with the job.\"</p><p>Another controversy in a chaotic week, the pictures of Ireland examining the surface were shared widely online and prompted a statement from World Rugby.</p><p>\"We are confident in the integrity of the new Fukuoka pitch for Ireland v Samoa,\" it read. \"With the stability and performance the key considerations, World Rugby and JR 2019 took the decision to re-turf the playing surface following significant wear caused by the France versus USA match after heavy rainfall as a consequence of Typhoon 17. The primary driver was player welfare. \"The tournament has dedicated nurseries where back-up turf is meticulously prepared in line with Rugby World Cup standards. While the look of the turf may not be perfect, as would be expected with a very recent installation, we are confident that the pitch will perform superbly.\"</p><p>Meanwhile a war of words broke out between World Rugby and the Scottish Rugby Union after Murrayfield chief executive Mark Dodson urged the global governing body to see sense and push their win-or-bust showdown with Japan out of Super Typhoon Hagibis' path of destruction.</p><p>Dodson made his call as he refused to rule out taking legal action to make sure the climax to Pool A at Yokohama's International Stadium goes ahead. But that sparked an angry response from World Rugby, who said they were \"disappointed\" with Dodson's comments, insisting the Scots were happy to sign up to the rules which prohibit pool matches being rescheduled before the tournament.</p><p>Scotland could be knocked out of the competition without kicking another ball if the \"explosive\" super storm forces tomorrow's quarter-final decider to be cancelled. Dodson wants the game pushed back 24 hours, claiming World Rugby would be risking the \"sporting integrity\" of the competition if they stick to their decision that the game must be played tomorrow or not at all.</p><p>Typhoon Hagibis has already forced the cancellation of England v France and New Zealand v Italy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Fever pitch: Joe Schmidt inspects surface (left) and (above) with his skipper Rory Best while (inset) Chris Farrell is able to lift the turfFocused: Keith Earls</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-153779135</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X80-KJV1-DYTY-C023-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"700\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

While Ireland will approach the game as if they need the bonus point despite the looming decision on Scotland v Japan and Typhoon Hagibis, the best way to achieve that outcome remains to maintain their own style and not get caught chasing too early.</p><p>Kicks in behind and, presuming a return to form from the pack, a forward dominated 1 Ireland have played Samoa only six times, suffering only a solitary reverse. The shock 40-25 loss saw Ireland selectors wield the axe, soon-to-be Ulster hero Simon Mason among those culled after.</p><p>approach will still be the order of the day.</p><p>On a terrible pitch and against a physical Samoan side, it'll be far from easy. It's worth remembering that it took Scotland 75 minutes and Japan 84 to get their fourth tries against the same opposition.</p><p>THE MAIN THREATS With all the chaos at the World Cup this week, from Typhoon Hagibis to the pitch at the Hakatanomori Stadium, today's opposition have been one of the less talked about storylines of the week.</p><p>Not so for Joe Schmidt obviously who as usual rhymed off a long list of Samoan players which have been causing him concern.</p><p>With Ireland keen to stay out of the trenches, the back-row trio of Chris Vui, TJ Ioane (left) and captain Jack Lam all got a special mention while securing the services of Crusaders tighthead Michael Alaalatoa was seen as something of a coup for a side that all too often lose such talents to the likes of Australia and New Zealand.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-153779168</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X80-KJV1-DYTY-C02D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

World Rugby has been in touch with us and they're as keen as we are, as you are, to get this game played.</p><p>\"I believe there is a contingency plan in place with updates every 24 hours. We just get on with our day job and try to best prepare every single day. We'll see what comes of that.\"</p><p>Players, too, seem unconcerned at present. Prop Andrew Porter said: \"I only heard about that (yesterday).</p><p>\"I don't think World Rugby really care if there's a bit of wind or rain. They want it going ahead so, yeah, we'll have to be ready for all conditions.</p><p>\"It was the same for the week leading up to the Scotland game really and I think we dealt with the conditions well that week, so we're versatile like that.</p><p>a \"We can handle changeable weather conditions the way we do back home.\"</p><p>The picture can change rapidly with, on average, only three of the 11 typhoons that threaten the Japanese mainland each year actually making landfall, and latest reports suggest that it could be Tokyo that will now be most affected.</p><p>CONTINUED ON PAGE 47 CONTINUED FROM BACK PAGE Typhoon Mitag was at one point thought to be putting France v USA in danger last week but it did not materialise. As such, it is thought no decision on Ireland v Samoa would be taken until 48 hours before the game.</p><p>\"We are monitoring Typhoon Hagibis, which is developing off the south coast of Japan,\" said a World Rugby statement.</p><p>\"The latest modelling from our weather information experts and the Japan Meteorological Agency indicates that the typhoon is tracking in a north-westerly direction and could bring high winds and heavy rain to southern Japan on October 12 and 13.</p><p>\"While it is too early to determine the exact trajectory and impact, if any, of the typhoon, as per previous typhoon warnings, we have a robust contingency programme in place in the event adverse weather looks likely to impact fixtures.</p><p>\"We will continue to closely monitor this developing situation in partnership with our weather information experts, local authorities, transport providers and teams, and will provide a further update tomorrow. Fans are advised to monitor Rugby World Cup channels for any updates.\"</p><p>The next update on the trajectory is due this morning.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-153647023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X74-PR01-JCBW-N3B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"540\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

Earlier in the week, it seemed as if they could be the team pondering whether their tournament was over without a tackle being made in anger but, thanks to the changing course of Typhoon Hagibis, instead it's Scotland anxiously waiting to find out if their deciding fixture is to be cancelled and they've seen the back of this competition after only three games played. Sat at a top table trying to keep the conversation on their clash with Samoa, skipper Rory Best could have been forgiven for thinking 'there but by the grace of God'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given the uncertainty surrounding the state of Pool A at present, talk of focusing on the task at hand was understandable for a side who have spent years preaching the importance of controlling the controllables, but outside of the bubble there was only one story in town.</p><p>In what was one of the most incredible 24 hours in the 32-year history of this tournament, chaos reigned from the moment it emerged on Wednesday night in Japan that it had not been possible to move Saturday's two endangered contests to Oita and continued through impromptu press-conferences and seemingly conflicting statements from organisers and the understandably irate Scots.</p><p>By the time yesterday evening came and Ireland's team announcement for Samoa had concluded, everyone had said their piece yet nobody felt any the wiser as to what was the likeliest outcome for the final game of the pool stages.</p><p>Declarations of war, acts of terrorism, injury... there's a litany of reasons that we've witnessed significant sporting events cancelled over the years but, after what felt an unprecedented decision to cancel rather than postpone games with a significant bearing on the competition, the record books of this World Cup will now always contain a weather-inflicted asterisk.</p><p>And while there were reports that France's approach to the clash with England would be that of a side keener to avoid the All Blacks in a potential semi-final than Wales in the quarters, and it would have been close to unimaginable for Italy to topple New Zealand, the further threat to Japan's game against Scotland represents something of a doomsday scenario.</p><p>Nobody can blame Best for his refusal to be drawn on just what it all means for the legacy of 2019 but, for the rest of us, we are in danger of having the enduring memory of Asia's first Rugby World Cup being that of yesterday's chaos.</p><p>Three people died when Typhoon Faxai hit these shores only a month ago so there is little reminder required that this is much bigger than rugby but, in solely sporting terms, the integrity of what has been a hugely well-received tournament so far is now in danger. Both the sense of occasion and storied run of the host nation has to date by and large compensated for a humidity that has damaged the quality of some pool stage games, but to have what would always be viewed as a back-door quarter-finalist would be a step too far for many to take.</p><p>Assuming Ireland take themselves out of the muddled equation by beating Samoa on the thankfully unaffected island of Kyushu, it would be fair on neither Scotland to go out in such a manner, nor on Japan who would now have what looked set to be a piece of rugby history forever tarnished.</p><p>Imagine if Ireland's first ever semi-final were to come in such a fashion.</p><p>Yet it would likely pale in significance to the emotional let-down of the Brave Blossoms seeing a maiden last eight spot remembered for reasons other than their early pool heroics.</p><p>Hindsight is undoubtedly 20/20, but was there no way to follow FIFA's lead - a rare sentence if ever there was one - who brought forward the football World Cup by some two weeks in 2002 to avoid the start of typhoon season? Failing that, even if safety must come first, it seems like a tournament ten years in the making should have had greater contingency in place that protected both fans and the integrity of the tournament. While we're all guilty of not pressing further, the 0-0 draw never felt like a satisfactory outcome when first flagged and so it has now proved.</p><p>\"We looked pretty exhaustively at all the options,\" said Rugby World Cup tournament director Alan Gilpin in a statement that will have caused sinking hearts from Yokohama to Edinburgh and back again.</p><p>\"It is important to note that where we are is in accordance with what we said we would do before the tournament.</p><p>\"Doing that on this scale, with so many teams to move around, and to be able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams after the pool stage, we couldn't guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can't do it for all, we can't do it for any.</p><p>\"We have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly. Italy are in the same position as Scotland. It is a huge match and we would love to play that game. But we won't treat that match any differently.\"</p><p>On that basis, things like Scottish murmurs of playing behind closed doors in a different stadium or a 24-hour delay all feel a little like pressure and crossed <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fingers.No\">www.fingers.No</url> World Cup has ever been remembered for its pool stages, especially so in rugby when so often they provide a lengthy pre-amble to the serious business of the knock-outs. Should Japan and Scotland have to be cancelled some six hours before it's due to kick-off , 2019 is in danger of being the exception.</p><p>Should it come to pass, it seems unlikely those affected will be satisfied to simply blame it on the weatherman.</p><p>IrelandSamoa World Cup Pool A Fukuoka, Saturday, 11.45am POOL A PW D L F A Pts Japan 33008741 14 Ireland 3 20 17422 11 Scotland 3 20 19827 10 Samoa 3 10 25381 5 Russia 4004 19160 0 Fixtures to come Oct 12: Ireland v Samoa (Fukuoka, 11.45am) Oct 13: Japan v Scotland (Yokohama, 11.45am) RUGBY WORLD CUP Storm incoming: Rugby World Cup officials speak to the press ahead of Typhoon Hagibis</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BELTEL-153749927</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BELTEL2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X7S-MBK1-JCBW-N3KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163795</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1031\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Belfast Telegraph Newspapers Ltd.

While Owen Farrell steered the ship, Itoje was the engine. He was a man who produced big moment after big moment, winning key battles and establishing himself as the class act in a historically strong field of second-rows. Even when the final was going against his team, Itoje kept fighting the good fight until the bitter end.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PERFORMANCE OF THE TOURNAMENT New Zealand were outstanding against Ireland, England were even better against the All Blacks and then Rassie Erasmus's South Africa had the last laugh with a sensational final performance rooted in Springbok power but finished with a couple of outrageously good tries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COACH (AND ASSISTANT) OF THE TOURNAMENT Erasmus deserves huge credit, but Jamie Joseph (below left) and Tony Brown's (below right) achievement in topping the pool with Japan cannot be underrated. Skilful, smart and dogged, they won hearts and minds.</p><p>BEST MATCH It nearly didn't take place, but Japan's final pool match against Scotland delivered in every way. After Typhoon Hagibis passed, Yokohama welcomed a big crowd and the Brave Blossoms played with substance and style to blow Scotland away and book a first quarter-final spot.</p><p>BEST TRY There is an argument for both final tries, but in terms of aesthetics TJ Perenara's sensational effort against Namibia stands alone. It may have been against one of the tournament's minnows and the score was 66-9 at the time, but to make the initial break and then get up and finish was sensational.</p><p>BIGGEST LET-DOWN Top of the world when the tournament began, Ireland never delivered on their potential in Japan. It started well against Scotland, but their form and confidence fell apart. They weren't alone, as Scotland, Australia, Fiji and New Zealand are among those who will leave disappointed, but Ireland's fall was the hardest.</p><p>BEST IRISH PLAYER It's tough to call after such a disappointing campaign, but James Ryan can leave with his head held high despite the team's performances. Garry Ringrose, CJ Stander, Jordan Larmour, Andrew Porter, Rhys Ruddock, and Dave Kilcoyne all had decent campaigns.</p><p>LEAST GRAND FINALE Sergio Parisse and Leonardo Ghiraldini were all set for one last hurrah against the All Blacks in what was to be Conor O'Shea's final game in charge, but despite Italy's chance of making the last eight, the match was cancelled due to the typhoon.</p><p>WORST CONTINGENCY PLAN World Rugby said the contingency plans in place for a weather event were robust, but it turned out they couldn't move the three matches affected by Typhoon Hagibis and declared them 0-0 <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.draws.No\">www.draws.No</url> doubt they made the decision for the right reasons, but it compromised the tournament's integrity and imbalanced the knockouts.</p><p>COMMUNITY SPIRIT After their game against Namibia was claimed by Typhoon Hagibis, the Canadian team helped with the clean-up.</p><p>COMMUNITY SERVICE A win over Fiji in Kamaishi meant Uruguay were the darlings of the pool stages. When the rugby finished, the South Americans allegedly went on the rampage in a Kumamoto night club.</p><p>BEST VENUE The Kamaishi Recovery Memorial Stadium witnessed history when the Uruguayans beat Fiji and, given everything the locals had been through and the stunning backdrop, it ticked a lot of boxes. Your correspondent didn't make it there, so we'd have to settle for the City of Toyota Stadium which has echoes of Thomond Park, but is a lot more impressive.</p><p>BEST MOUSTACHE We haven't got to the bottom of the reasons why, but the humble ronnie made a big return in 2019 with Russia's Vaz Artemyev and New Zealand coach Scott McLeod strong contenders for the award. Australia's Nic White (below), however, wins the day with his sublime effort.</p><p>BEST NEWCOMER Russia openside Tagir Gadzhiev announced himself as a serious player with strong displays across his side's pool games.</p><p>BEST REFEREE England's Wayne Barnes probably would have got the final had his nation not been in it, a steady hand throughout. Australia's Nic Berry deserves a mention, while Nigel Owens was good in the knockouts.</p><p>WHAT WE'LL MISS Ramen, sushi, the welcoming Japanese people, the vibrancy of the cities, the incredible public transport network and the singing toilets.</p><p>WHAT WE WON'T Pillows stuffed with ball bearings, incessant noise, menus full of offal.</p><p>BEST CITY Tokyo is a hub of energy and excitement, Kyoto is a cultural gem but there's something about the southern city of Fukuoka that ticked just about every box. Not as busy as the capital, but with plenty of life and lots to do.</p><p>TEAM OF THE TOURNAMENT The back-three: Beauden Barrett (New Zealand), Anthony Watson (England), Josh Adams (Wales) One of the toughest areas of the field to pick, there is a lot of quality left out but this trio of players all delivered for their teams across the tournament.</p><p>Barrett shifted from out-half to full-back seamlessly and even in the defeat to England he was one of the few who kept carrying the All Black fight.</p><p>Watson's return from a post-Lions injury has quietly been a major turning point in England's renaissance, while Wales' Adams was dangerous throughout and scored a tournament high seven tries.</p><p>The midfield: Timothy Lafaele (Japan), Damian de Allende (South Africa) Owen Farrell and Manu Tuilagi can count themselves unlucky, as can Jack Goodhue and Anton Lienert-Brown, but De Allende was consistently excellent and added a layer of menace to the Bok backline, while Japan's Lafaele was sensational throughout; throwing impossible offloads to unlock defences.</p><p>Half-backs: Handr\u00e9 Pollard, Faf de Klerk (both South Africa) It helps that they were operating behind the most powerful pack in the tournament, but the pairing ran Rassie Erasmus's game-plan to perfection. They knew it wouldn't be popular, but they kicked when it was necessary, opened up when it was dangerous and Pollard finished as the tournament's top points-scorer.</p><p>Front-row: Tendai Mtawarira (South Africa), Shota Horie (Japan), Kyle Sinckler (England) The 'Beast' rolled back the years in the final, destroying England's scrum in Sinckler's absence.</p><p>The Harlequins prop was brilliant until concussion ended his final early.</p><p>Japan's Horie, meanwhile, was one of the stars of the pool stages.</p><p>Second-row: Maro Itoje (England), Pieter-Steph du Toit (South Africa) Forgive the All Star-esque meddling, but in any other team Du Toit would be lining up in the second-row and starring. He was the Springboks' talisman in much the same way Itoje set the tone for England.</p><p>Back-row: Tom Curry (England), Justin Tipuric (Wales), Duane Vermeulen (South Africa) Although Sam Underhill struggled, Curry turned up in the final with a strong performance. Tipuric was effervescent in the Welsh run to the semi-finals and just edges Sam Cane who was a big loss in the first half against England. Vermeulen edges Kieran Read and Billy Vunipola.</p><p>The bench: Jamie George (England), Mako Vunipola (England), Kiril Gotovtsev (Russia), Alun Wyn Jones (Wales), Kazuki Himeno (Japan), Antoine Dupont (France), Owen Farrell (England), Semi Radradra (Fiji)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-154460842</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XDW-XFC1-JCBW-N3B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1190\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 4, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U2J</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001735</classCode><className>TOURNAMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QUD</classCode><className>TYPHOONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001423</classCode><className>POOL &amp; BILLIARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001509</classCode><className>RUGBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC351</classCode><className>NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC306</classCode><className>JAPAN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GR156</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA &amp; NEW ZEALAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GC377</classCode><className>NAMIBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>GC321</classCode><className>ITALY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
