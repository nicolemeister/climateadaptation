Brendan himself is Ireland's first biological agroforest farmer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the second time he's done this trek, having cycled 1,200km from Malin to Mizen Head last year for the same cause. His team of five cyclists visited 10 different farms along the way, to showcase the growth of regenerative farming around the country.</p><p>\"We highlighted each farm that we went to, showing the work that they were doing,\" says Brendan. The aim was to bring farmers together and show the viability of regenerative farming.</p><p>Over seven days, Brendan organised 10 different events - where each farmer cooked their own produce - and sold tickets to the general public.</p><p>\"They were like little mini weddings. Good craic, great fun and lots of networking,\" he says. \"It showed that you can produce food without degrading the soil and harming the environment. It really highlighted that farming can be a solution to a lot of problems.\"</p><p>The endeavour was so popular that the group are doing it again this year.</p><p>From September 8, they plan to cycle the east coast from the Giant's Causeway to Waterford, highlighting similar farms.</p><p>Brendan is a graduate of the MSc in AgInnovation (Agricultural Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship) at the University of Galway, which he completed in 2023. He credits the course with opening his mind to new ways of solving problems and says it gave him the tools to undertake such endeavours as this long-distance cycle. It also inspired him to work with others.</p><p>\"It taught me you can't do everything on your own. You need a team around you.\"</p><p>The course was designed by Professor John Breslin, author of Old Ireland in Colour and founder of Galway startup accelerator PorterShed. John has a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation, and saw a gap in rural Ireland.</p><p>\"He saw that Ireland needed to be helped. And basically it starts with the farmer in the field,\" says Martina O'Grady. A farmer's daughter from Roscommon, Martina did the course herself four years ago and now teaches on the programme.</p><p>The master's aims to foster entrepreneurship in rural Ireland and addresses the challenges faced by farmers in the modern era.</p><p>\"If you keep doing what you've always done, you're always going to get the same result. You have to be the change yourself. We can give them the confidence to pivot on their farms. Essentially, we need to give farmers courage,\" says Martina.</p><p>\"Encouraging them to look at agriculture in a difa ferentw y, and changing the way we do it so that it can survive - that's really what the programme is about.\"</p><p>Martina is keen to stress that \"you don't necessarily need any great qualifications coming into the course. It's the passion we're after - if you can show us that there's something that you want to do for rural Ireland to help farmers through innovation, we really want you to succeed.\"</p><p>The Level 9 master's has been running for seven years, with 30-35 participants each year. The course is designed to fit into busy schedules with one two-hour Zoom class per week in the evening and 10 in-person Saturdays at the university over one year.</p><p>Prospective students wary about going back to college can take heart from the course diversity, with ages ranging from 22 to 70 years old. As well as farmers, previous course participants have varied backgrounds including a veterinary nurse, a solicitor, a wine shop owner, and tech experts looking to reshape agriculture through technology. A broad range of business ideas that have sprung forth from the course include wool promotion, beekeeping, willow coffin-making and a nature-walk company.</p><p>At the end of the course, Martina says that \"people felt they had come on this journey with each other, even though they had only met 10 times\".</p><p>For Brendan, the course has given him the structure and confidence to diversify his farming business. He now cooks at Electric Picnic, has spoken at the Web Summit and gives tours at his farm.</p><p>The course offers 90pc funding by Springboard for those in employment, and is 100pc funded for job seekers. The course is still open for applications and the closing date has been extended until August 13. Martina urges people to apply, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>\"We have farmers saying, 'I'm going to have calving or lambing season in the middle of March; I won't be able to make that Saturday.' I say, 'You're going to find a way between now and then.'\" If you want to get those wheels turning and embark on your own AgInnovate adventure, apply on: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.universityofgalway.ie/courses/taught-postgraduate-courses/aginnovation.html\">www.universityofgalway.ie/courses/taught-postgraduate-courses/aginnovation.html</url></p><p>\"Essentially, we need to give farmers courage\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Brendan Guinan growing his veg at Fiorbhia Farm, Portlaoise.

William and Ashton McKean, who own a small farm in the area, have received the trees including birch, oak, hawthorn, rowan, hazel, and crab apple, through a partnership between the convenience retail brands SuperValu and Centra - part of Musgrave NI - and Trees on the Land, a not-for-profit project from the Green Economy Foundation. The project which launched in 2022, saw 15,000 native trees planted across 50 locations across Northern Ireland in three years, while this year a further 5,000 have been planted in another 20 locations. Colleagues from SuperValu and Centra stores across Northern Ireland have also supported the initiative by pulling on their wellies and visiting many of the tree planting locations. Tree recipient Ashton said: \"I would like to thank Centra and Trees on the Land for supporting this project. \"There were many conifer trees nearby which blew down due to old age, so these trees will enable us to create hedgerows which will create a new natural habitat for wildlife, shelterbelts for livestock and many more environmental benefits.\" Paul Kayne, manager of Centra Ballymagorry, visited the site and added: \"Centra is committed to supporting local communities and we're delighted that through this project, we can enable more tree coverage at this local farm. \"Agroforestry can help make farms more resilient to climate change, with trees helping to prevent flooding, increasing biodiversity and making soils more stable, and we look forward to hearing how the trees mature over the years.\"</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRBNW-centrasponsorstreeplantinginballymagorry58226</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRBNW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G58-W083-RRRR-51DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">482558</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"282\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Tontine Rooms Holding Company  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Strabane Weekly</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"39123\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 28, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United Kingdom</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Europe, Northern Europe</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.state\"><classificationItem><className>Derry City and Strabane</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008X5O</classCode><className>ECOSYSTEMS &amp;

I knew then that he was a man who was used to hard work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With his cousin Dylan van Leeuwen, Brummelman built a medieval roundhouse in a beautiful woodland setting in Co Galway during the Covid pandemic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Surrounded by oak trees and bluebells and next to a bubbling stream, it looks exactly like the sort of place an ancient Irish family might have chosen to settle in. </p><p>Brummelman was born in the Netherlands but has lived in Ireland for many years, having followed his aunt and his cousins here.  I was three years old when my parents moved to a house within a woodland in Friesland in the north of the Netherlands,  he says. </p><p> As a child, I was out in the woods every day. This gave me a strong connection with nature, and later combined with the environmental interests that my parents gave me.  </p><p>Brummelman has been interested in bushcraft since he was a child. He has taken on a range of challenges, living in the woodlands with only basic tools such as a knife and an axe. </p><p>I watch him lighting a campfire with just a flint to ignite the kindling that he has collected in the woods. He has also become a self-taught film-maker and his YouTube channel, Smooth Gefixt, has an international audience. </p><p> Over the years I have tried to teach myself a variety of woodworking skills,  he says. </p><p> Wood is such a beautiful and easy material to work with. Trees are so useful for everything from making fires to building houses. I am not against cutting trees at all but we should try to do it in a sustainable, balanced way.  </p><p>In his practical approach to life, Brummelman says he is  always happy  to use firewood to heat his house. If demand was higher for timber, he believes that could be a driver for creating more forest cover. </p><p>With his family, Brummelman has recently bought an area of woodland near Lough Rainey, Co Clare. This is a conventional conifer plantation, but it is beside an ancient woodland with mostly native tree species.</p><p> I saw this as an ideal place to start a conversion from a monoculture plantation to a more mixed woodland,  he says. </p><p>He will do this conversion in gradual stages, first thinning out the spruce trees and planting native trees in their place. </p><p> The existing conifers will provide cover for the native trees to mature and eventually replace them. With this type of continuous cover forestry, both economic and biodiversity values of the forest grow hand in hand. </p><p> Brummelman s late father was a vet and he grew up visiting many farms with him. </p><p> In Ireland I have been talking to many farmers about woodland,  he says.  I want to encourage farmers to incorporate trees into their farming enterprises. </p><p> Because we don t really have a forest culture any more, most farmers don t think of trees as a useful part of their farming. However, with continuous-cover forestry, the focus can be on individual trees. </p><p> Farmers could go into a forest, manage it carefully and add value to individual trees. In that way they would connect more to their woodland. It feels very satisfying to walk through your own forest which is maturing around you.  </p><p>At the Slieve Aughty Centre, he has been planting an agroforestry plot with a variety of native and non-native trees such as sweet chestnut. </p><p>He has a few favourite tree species. He planted a lime tree in memory of his father, who clearly had a big influence on his son s life. </p><p> I like eating lime leaves as a salad,  he says.  For forest development in Ireland, I think oak is the most interesting as it can grow rapidly in good soils with very specific management. </p><p>Although he is passionate about trees, he is also a practical person who knows the benefits that trees and woodland offer. </p><p>He is very familiar with a variety of European woodlands as he studied Forest and Nature Conservation at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. </p><p>Now Brummelman has qualified as a registered forester and is training in the methods of continuous-cover forestry. Learning new skills and methods keeps him fresh and inspires him to achieve more in reforesting Ireland. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Richard Nairn is an ecologist and author </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-22082984</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GFR-YPN3-RSS0-X431-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"695\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 9, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DNKD</classCode><className>SELF IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009RO6</classCode><className>STREAMING MEDIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC322</classCode><className>NETHERLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MkJDMzEzRDkxMDVBNDA3N0FDRjNDODI2NUIzMzZDMDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjI3QUU4NUZEQzZFNEYzRThENkZBRTA1MkUyQTAwQTA</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Forest Management</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkRGMjQxNzgzQ0RFNEQ4QkEwQ0U0MUEzOUVBREI3Nzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Incorporated into that is the 'Forest for Water'. That would be a native forest beside water, and there's a little extra incentive there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Another popular one then would be agroforestry, which is quite a different forest. It's relatively new, and a lot of people love the idea of that kind of intimate combination of trees, and being allowed or being facilitated to farm as well, on the same piece of ground. Instead of planting around 2,500 trees per hectare, you're maybe planting around 400 trees per hectare. Because of that, you can protect those trees individually and allow either grass to grow, or there's actually a silvoarable scheme where you can put an arable crop in there. That has become a lot more popular, and there's an agroforestry forum now, an organisation that is working hard to get people that are interested in agroforestry together to compare their successes.</p><p>\"It certainly ties in, agroforestry in particular, with the organics scheme, where one can still claim the organic payment on agroforestry land, so essentially you may be getting your BISS payment, your agroforestry premium, and also the organic payment as well. That's a really positive broadincentive there, and a real example of how different schemes can work together,\" Frances said.</p><p>\"Then, of course, not forgetting the high forest, the mixed commercial forest, which we certainly need as well. We need timber to feed into our sawmilling industry and to capture carbon. There are fast-growing conifers, they're absolutely amazing at grabbing carbon out of the atmosphere, and they do that really, really well. If we store timber in buildings, that's a really positive thing for the environment,\" Frances said.</p><p>There has to be 20% broad-incentive leaf in predominantly conifer forest. There are currently 12 different National Forestry Programme schemes available.</p><p>Anyone over 18, with a Personal Public Service (PPS) number, can apply for a grant under the National Forestry Programme, as can a company. The applicant needs to either own, lease or be in joint management of the piece of ground proposed for forestry or agroforestry, said Frances. \"You have to be able to demonstrate to the Department that you have the right to make a decision on this pretty major change of land use. You don't have to be a farmer per se.</p><p>\"There is an incentive there for farmers. The premium is the same rate for everybody, but it's 20 years for farmers and 15 years for non-farmers,\" she said.</p><p>A farmer is defined in this instance as an approved participant in the Basic Income Support for Sustainability (BISS) scheme in the year of application, who has also participated in the previous four years. \"It shows that you've been an established farmer for that time,\" Frances said.</p><p>If the applicant is a new entrant to farming, and can establish that fact, allowances can be made.</p><p>\"There is a licencing process in relation to getting approval for a forest. That's something that a landowner undertakes with a registered forester. There is a requirement to engage a forester that has been registered with the Department, to come out to chat to them, work through what might suit the land, what sort of environmental issues may need to be taken into account, and to plan that forest accordingly.</p><p>\"That application goes into the Department of Agriculture. If it needs to be referred to outside bodies, that happens, maybe to Fisheries or Archaeology, or different processes like that. That's done within the Department. The applicant doesn't have to go running with a piece of paper to those bodies\", Frances explained.</p><p>A period will elapse before the licence is issued. \"That system has improved over the years,\" she said.</p><p>\"To give you an idea of the grant to cover the cost of planting and fencing and everything really to be done on the site, the grant would be  6,744 per hectare.

It is a four-year project, but there may be preliminary results within two years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Responding to D\u00e1il questions, the minister said: \"The subject of planting forests on peat soils is not black and white. Forests planted on peat soils can contribute to climate, biodiversity, and timber production.\"</p><p>The subject has been controversial since Michael Healy-Rae, minister of state with responsibility for forestry, said in April that Ireland will not have enough timber if forest planting is restricted to shallower peat soils, less than 30cm deep.</p><p>Green Party leader Roderic O'Gorman hit back, saying planting on peatlands would be \"environmental madness\".</p><p>Minister Heydon said last week, \"I am not in favour of planting on deep peat sites, where there is a net carbon emission, or planting important peat habitats, blanket bogs, raised bogs, and other important habitats on peat soils. These will remain unplanted\".</p><p>He confirmed that the EU state aid approval for Ireland's forestry programme prohibits planting on deep peat soils.</p><p>\"On the other hand, it permits planting of commercial forest and native woodlands on shallower peat soils, less than 30cm deep, and some midland fen peats planted with native woodlands\".</p><p>Minister Heydon said any changes to forestry programmes must be informed by science.</p><p>\"Growing forests on peat, and the consequences in relation to carbon, is complex. All trees, as they grow, store an increasing amount of carbon, but peat that is drained emits carbon. There has been a lot of research into this area, but more needs to be done,\" he said.</p><p>\"In relation to any future forestry programmes, these will have to be agreed with the EU Commission, and it will be important that whatever we propose as part of that programme, we will be able to back it up with science and common sense\".</p><p>In April, minister of state Healy-Rae said farmers want to plant peatland.</p><p>\"Farmers do not want to plant their green ground, because they have worked so hard to get the bit they have. They broke their backs and bones to make the land green, and they do not want to plant trees on it, but instead use it for grazing,\" he said.</p><p>He said things have not been as bad with regard to planting since 1946.</p><p>He revealed he hopes to improve the agroforestry scheme. \"To be blunt, I do not agree with the terms of the scheme at present. They are not good enough.</p><p>\"The first bit of advice I would give to a farmer who wants to plant agroforestry at the moment is to wait until we improve the scheme\".</p><p>He also revealed there will be a reconstitution scheme. Landowners can take out the 25,000 hectares damaged by Storm Eowyn and can retrospectively apply for the reconstitution scheme.</p><p>\"I just hope we will be able to put together the money to make it strong enough to take the harm out of having to replant\".</p><p>He said some of the damaged timber might not be heavy enough, resulting in a smaller than expected payment from sawmills, and landowners would not want to overspend on replanting to get back to where they started.</p><p>He also revealed an ambition that every privately owned forest in Ireland will be certified.</p><p>\"Certifying a forest will give people an interest in their forest again. I am not looking to put an imposition of money on them. My aim is that the department will be paying for it\".</p><p>Minister of state Healy-Rae said every farmer in the country, whether they have forestry or not, should be entitled to carbon credits.</p><p>\"In my infinite wisdom, many years ago, I automatically assumed that carbon credits were going to be a big thing of the future. I thought we would own them, could trade them, and that they would be a valuable commodity. Unfortunately, we have not got there yet. It is something we all aspire to,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Minister Heydon said any changes to forestry programmes must be informed by science</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYY-BXP3-RRJY-F1JC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"675\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

The financial incentives of afforestation have been substantially improved. The forest premium for farmers has been extended to 20 years and the rate of payment has increased to (EURO)863/ha ((EURO)349/ac) for mixed conifers and up to (EURO)1,142/ha ((EURO)462/ac) for certain forest types.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These changes should encourage more planting. Given the ever-increasing value of timber, forestry is among the best investments any farmer could consider.</p><p>However, the obligation to re-plant with no supports after clear-fell is a major disincentive. This issue badly needs to be addressed if planting targets - and indeed carbon emission targets - are to be met.</p><p>I know many farmers who are reluctant to go down the afforestation route because they view the obligation to replant as something of a poisoned chalice for those that will come after them.</p><p>Despite the financial benefit from clear-felling - generally (EURO)25,000-28,000/ha - the cost of re-planting at (EURO)3,500/ha, coupled with no financial return from the replanted forest for many years into the future, does not make for a very attractive inheritance.</p><p>However, the income tax-free status of timber sales, and the inheritance tax benefits of forestry are significant factors to be borne in mind.</p><p>Agroforestry A booklet titled Agroforestry with Organics that was recently published by the Agricultural Consultants Association (ACA) recently dropped through my virtual letterbox. I would never have associated organics with forestry.</p><p>Agroforestry is a combination of trees and grassland or crops on the same piece of land, which enables more sustainable farming, improved animal welfare, increased biodiversity, mitigation of the effects of climate change, water protection, production of renewable energy, localised shelter and production of quality timber.</p><p>The booklet emphasises the strong compatibility between the Organic Farming Scheme (OFS) and forestry. OFS parcels can be converted to forestry during the OFS contract without penalty.</p><p>The agroforestry scheme is one of the few schemes to seamlessly integrate with the OFS.</p><p>The use of trees in an organic system has been seen to be extremely beneficial on many farms throughout Ireland. A more diverse range of habitats improves biodiversity in local and larger ecosystems.</p><p>Land declared as agroforestry can be eligible for agroforestry grants and premiums, BISS, CRISS and Organic Payments at the dry stock rate on the same land parcel.</p><p>The agroforestry option is now also of real interest to owners of ash dieback-infected plantations - you can convert from dead and dying ash to agroforestry. The area could then be allowable for nitrogen and phosphorus and grassland stocking rate calculations for farmers not in derogation.</p><p>The recent announcement of (EURO)5,000/ha available to owners of infected plantations who clear and replant the area under a climate action performance payment is a significant step in the right direction for forestry.</p><p>Combining this with the agroforestry option on the replanting should be of real interest to many owners.</p><p>Options An agroforestry plot will comprise rows of trees in a grass or tillage field. There are different options within the scheme such as the silvo-pastoral option for drystock farmers and the silvo-arable option for tillage farmers.</p><p>There is also a forest gardening option, where fruit and nut trees can occupy up to 40pc of the species planted. This may be of interest to free-range organic poultry producers. Agroforestry payments There is an initial establishment grant of (EURO)8,555/ha for the silvo-pastoral system or (EURO)6,000/ha for the silvo-arable and forest gardening options.</p><p>There is an annual premium payable for 10 years that amounts to (EURO)975 for the silvo-pastoral option and (EURO)825 for the other options. These payments are income tax free.</p><p>Table 1 sets out an example of a typical farm attracting BISS, CRISS and Eco-Scheme payment of (EURO)250/ha along with the Agroforestry and Organics Farming Scheme payment. Organics Don't forget, farmers can get very attractive payments under the Organic Farming Scheme. In addition to the payment rates as set out in Table 2, there is an administration payment in year one of (EURO)2,000 and an annual payment of (EURO)1,400 thereafter.</p><p>For example, a drystock farmer owning 50ha will receive a total annual payment when fully converted of (EURO)14,400.</p><p>Further information Contact the Agricultural Consultants Association head office at 051 645705 or at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.aca.ie\">www.aca.ie</url> Martin O'Sullivan is the author of the ACA Farmers' Handbook and is a farm succession consultant with IFAC;

Five years ago, they purchased a separate 20ac block of land, where 7ac is now going into agroforestry and 13ac of old woodland is being grazed by their cattle to encourage regeneration.</p><p>The 7ac fruit-and-vegetable enterprise is based on land Joe got from his father and grew from an original 3ac. He trained as a carpenter and worked in Australia for several years before returning home during the economic downturn, when he began growing vegetables for his own use.</p><p>Aoife and Joe met through an organic horticulture course and went on to establish Glasra\u00ed Organic Farm in 2016.</p><p>\"We decided to grow our own produce because, first of all, we were drawn to the lifestyle. We wanted to make a living off the land while looking after it at the same time. We feel like we are giving something back to the land by looking after soil health and fertility, and it's giving us produce,\" Aoife explains.</p><p>\"For Joe, it was the actual vegetables themselves. Ask anyone who has grown their own food and they will swear it tastes so much better. Having kids grow up on a farm is important to us as parents. We value working outside and good food.\"</p><p>Direct selling their veggie-box scheme, farmers' markets two days a day in Westport and Castlebar and their online shop accounts for 80pc of their sales.</p><p>The remaining 20pc of business involves supplying other growers, restaurants, local shops and a supermarket in Westport.</p><p>About 70pc of what they sell comes directly from their farm. \"We buy fruit from other organic farms in Ireland, but there's still very little organic fruit in Ireland, so we often import from Europe. There are certain things, like sweet potatoes, that people are used to, that we can't grow here.\"</p><p>Aoife says salad leaves, strawberries and potatoes are the three most popular items, while some people come to the farmers' markets for their hen eggs alone.</p><p>\"I grew up on packet eggs, and ever since we got our own hens, I haven't tried shop-bought eggs.\"</p><p>The family eats what they produce, from vegetables to eggs and beef.</p><p>\"I'm really happy that our kids are eating our own beef and I know where it's coming from. I've become more interested in and conscious about food over the years.\"</p><p>She says their customers are people who care about where their food comes from, whether they're passionate about organics, climate, local economies or simply good taste.</p><p>She says sales have been \"consistent\" in recent years, and they try to keep prices consistent year-round, for simplicity.</p><p>\"For some people, food isn't always high on the priority list when you can buy vegetables cheaply. All we can do is to be there and represent the true cost of producing the food.</p><p>\"And that's what I'd like to stand for: the real cost of food, and not subsidising food and not using low-cost strategies to undermine the value or the cost of food.\"</p><p>She says pricing is a balancing act. \"You must keep an eye on the market and factor in your production costs too. I like to think that people pay what they feel is reasonable to them, and it feels fair to us. I don't think of us charging a premium. A bunch of carrots from us costs (EURO)3.\"</p><p>The Reillys are members of the Organic Trust and went into organics for transparency.</p><p>\"We can see value in being organic. It gives confidence to consumers that these are the standards our produce has been grown within,\" she says.</p><p>Aoife adds that being certified organic involves more paperwork, more soil testing and other ways, such as crop rotations, netting and minimal tillage, to boost soil health.</p><p>When the couple first started, the site was a blank canvas, but the land itself was of good quality.</p><p>\"It pays to have good land to start off with, rather than having to build it up over the years, because it takes so long.\"</p><p>Over the years, they have fenced the land, thickened hedgerows to create wildlife corridors, and planted thousands of native trees as hedgerows and shelterbelts to protect their polytunnels.</p><p>They have dug three ponds to attract frogs and have worked on naturally building up soil fertility slowly using seaweed and green manures. Aoife says they wouldn't drive machinery on their land \"without exercising caution\".</p><p>They do not use pesticides, herbicides or chemical fertilisers. \"We learned how to grow vegetables without chemicals, so it was never a thing of how to replace them.\"</p><p>Most of the work on the farm, including harvesting and weeding, is done by hand, with some tractor-drawn implements used for cultivation, but labour remains largely manual.</p><p>\"When you're doing three-quarters of an acre of carrots, it doesn't come high on the priority list to purchase a carrot harvester.</p><p>\"There are a lot of times you wouldn't be able to harvest carrots with a machine because of the weather. We leave most things in the field and dig as needed. This ensures we keep everyone employed over the winter, so we don't have to hire seasonally.</p><p>\"Because we're not entirely dependent on machinery, we're resilient when we face weather challenges. At the same time, you're looking for a break in the weather to get jobs, such as weeding, done.\"</p><p>The end of the week is the busiest time for the team, from harvesting to farmers' markets, wholesalers and veggie boxes. Two days a week, they distribute to markets and do deliveries.</p><p>Aoife says they started the business \"the same way a lot of people do, with minimal resources, without massive amounts of capital to invest\".</p><p>\"As we grew over the years, we built up to a place where things have become more sustainable, buying second-hand machinery from growers.</p><p>\"If there's a job that can be done easier with a machine, we'd like to be able to invest, not to replace people, but rather to make the job easier for employees.</p><p>\"We don't have a massive budget to buy the exact machines that we often want, but we're still being opportunistic.\"</p><p>Aoife says it is viable to make a living from a 7ac farm, but she says earning a living from a small business can be difficult because \"things are changing from year to year, making it hard to keep up\".</p><p>\"We have to be able to keep pace with wages. We value our employees, and we want people to get a fair wage for their labour. The work can be quite intense. A lot of our staff would be harvesting, attending markets, and someone is doing deliveries. But it's not a lonely job - we work together.</p><p>\"We're fortunate to have a brilliant team that helps us make it work. Some people have been with us for years.\"</p><p>\"We leave most things in the field and dig as needed\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Joe and Aoife have transformed Glasra\u00ed over the past decadeJoe and Aoife Reilly grow a wide variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables and keep free-range hens for fresh eggs.

Animals can be grazed during the spring and summer for the first six to eight years (the grazing period depends on the rate of tree growth). Thereafter, when tree shelters are replaced with plastic mesh, larger animals may be introduced. Silage or hay production is permitted, using appropriate machinery so that the trees are not inadvertently damaged.</p><p>Agroforestry grants increased significantly in the new Forestry Programme. The planting grant is  8,555/ha, and an annual premium of 6975 is payable for ten years. The rates are the same for farmers and non-farmers.</p><p>Silvoarable agroforestry combines growing cereals, or fruit and vegetables, with trees. Fruit and nut trees can account for 20% of the species planted. A planting grant of  6,000, and a premium of  829 per year for 10 years, are payable.</p><p>The DAFM says silvoarable agroforestry should initially be set up on a pilot basis, with a maximum of 30ha per year for four projects of up to 7.5ha each.</p><p>The third and final agroforestry category is forest gardening. The objective is to provide robust, small-scale forests that provide a source of organic forest food (for poultry, for example). Fruit and nut trees can account for up to 40% of the species planted.</p><p>Forest gardening applications are limited to one hectare per landowner. A grant of  6,000 is available, as well as a premium of  829 per year, for ten years, with no difference in rates between farmers and non-farmers.</p><p>A fencing grant is also available, to ensure that newly established trees are fully protected from browsing animals.</p><p>The DAFM says there is a one-hectare limit per landowner, with a national ceiling of 6ha annually.</p><p>To be eligible for payments, any agroforestry plot must be at least 0.5ha; at least 20m wide (measured from tree to tree). The required stocking rate is at least 400 trees per ha at equal planting spacing, with up to 10m between rows, and at least three metres between trees in a row. All trees must have two stakes and a shelter to protect them from browsing, rubbing, or fraying. Acceptable tree species include oak, sycamore and cherry.</p><p>Other species (including conifers) may be considered on a site-by-site basis. An afforestation licence will be needed to participate in agroforesty. Farmers can approach a registered forester to assess the site and to assist in the application. Registered foresters are professional foresters, working either as consultant foresters or employed by forestry companies. They are registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM) and authorised to submit forestry grant scheme applications.</p><p>\"All applications undergo a rigorous environment assessment procedure,\" Seppi Hona explained. If the application is successful and if one decides to go ahead, then the same registered forester will continue to be involved, by co-ordinating some or all of the work. Farmers can also seek advice from Teagasc forestry advisors, who are available to support landowners and to provide free, independent and objective advice on all forestryrelated issues.</p><p>The Native Tree Area (NTA) scheme supports the creation of small native forests up to one hectare. NTA 1 is for the creation of small native forests on farmed land, while NTA 2 is for the creation of small native forests for water protection. For both, a total planting grant of  6,744 is available.

No synthetic fertilisers, no pesticides, and only nature-based methods guiding how we grow our food. The air is cleaner. Pollinators are thriving. Soil is healthy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now imagine a very different scene. Industrial-scale farms using precision technology to push yields to their limits, automated, efficient, and engineered to feed billions from tightly managed plots. The rest of the land? Given back to forests, wetlands, or wildlife.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Which of these futures is better for the planet?</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This question sits at the heart of a global dilemma: Should we make all farming organic or focus on intensifying production in specific areas and rewild the rest? It's a trade-off that pits land sparing against land sharing, and the answer isn't as straightforward as many might hope.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Organic everywhere: better for biodiversity, worse for space?</emphasis></h><p>Organic farming has earned its eco-friendly image. It avoids synthetic inputs, supports biodiversity, and often improves soil health. But it also comes with a major challenge: lower yields. On average, organic farms produce less food per hectare than conventional ones - on average 10-25% lower yields, although this varies by farming type and region. Meaning we'd need much more land to grow the same amount of food organically.</p><p>Globally, this raises an uncomfortable truth, if we go fully organic, we may have to convert more land to agriculture. Land that might otherwise be forests, peatlands, natural grasslands, for example. That extra land demand could accelerate biodiversity loss, increase greenhouse gas emissions, and threaten the very ecosystems organic farming seeks to protect.</p><p>A 2019 study published in the journal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature Communications</emphasis>, and led by Britain's Cranfield University, found that going fully organic in Britain could increase the carbon footprint of food production by up to 70%, mostly due to land-use change overseas to compensate for lower yields. In other words, what we gain in pesticide reduction, we may lose in deforestation and carbon debt elsewhere.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Land sparing: high-yield farming, but at what cost?</emphasis></h><p>The alternative? Intensify production on the most suitable land using highy-ield methods, synthetic fertilisers, irrigation, and even genetically modified crops, while sparing other land entirely for nature. Known as the land sparing model, this approach banks on efficiency. The idea is simple: grow more on less land, so that we can set aside more of the planet for conservation and rewilding.</p><p>In theory, it's sound. Modelling studies suggest that intensifying production on existing farmland could allow for up to 40% of agricultural land to be restored to natural habitats, if done right. But there are huge caveats.</p><p>First, intensive farming often depletes soil, pollutes water, and erodes local biodiversity. It's also a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions, especially from livestock and fertiliser use. Without strict environmental regulations, intensification can do more harm than good. Second, land sparing relies on strong policy enforcement. Just because one area produces more doesn't mean another area will automatically be rewilded. Too often, both areas are exploited: intensify here and expand there, chasing economic returns over ecological balance.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A third way? Smarter hybrids</emphasis></h><p>What if the real solution lies between these extremes? Rather than choosing organic everywhere or intensification somewhere, many scientists now advocate for a sustainable intensification approach: combining ecological practices with modern science and technology. Think precision fertiliser use, cover crops, integrated pest management, agroforestry, and drought-resistant crop varieties, which are applied strategically in different contexts.</p><p>In some areas, especially in regions with high population density or poor soils, organic or agroecological methods may work best. In others, especially where yields are already high, efficiency gains through innovation may free up land for nature.</p><p>This nuanced approach supports land-use triage, where prioritising land for farming, conservation, and multi-use based on local environmental, social, and economic conditions.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Feeding 10 billion people without breaking the planet</emphasis></h><p>By 2050, the world will need to feed nearly 10 billion people. That means producing more food while using less land, water, and carbon. The global food system already accounts for over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, and agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation and biodiversity decline.</p><p>To meet this challenge, we can't rely solely on ideology, whether it's techdriven maximalism or organic purity. Instead, we need evidence-based, regionally adapted food systems that recognise trade-offs for win-wins.</p><p>This includes:</p><p>(1) shifting diets, especially reducing high-emission foods like beef in favour of more plant-based proteins</p><p>(2) cutting food waste, which currently squanders up to 30% of global food production</p><p>(3) supporting smallholder farmers, particularly in the less developed countries, where yield gaps are large but often due to lack of access to tools, credit, or knowledge, and not poor practice, and finally</p><p>(4) investing in agroecological transitions that don't just mimic nature, but restore its functions in food production.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What can Ireland do?</emphasis></h><p>Ireland, with more than 68% of land used for agriculture, mostly for beef and dairy, is deeply tied to these global debates. Should we expand organic? Intensifly grazing more efficiently? Rewet peatlands and reduce cattle numbers? The answer likely lies in doing all of the above, strategically.</p><p>That means, protecting carbon-rich landscapes like peatlands from expansion, and supporting organic and regenerative methods on marginal land, using precision technology and nutrient budgeting on high-output farms, and designing fair transition schemes that support farmers in making evidence-informed choices.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">It's not either/or</emphasis></h><p>There is no silver bullet. But the wrong question is 'which system is best?'</p><p>A better question is 'how can we design farming systems that meet human needs without destroying the ecosystems that make life possible?'</p><p>Sometimes that will mean going organic. Sometimes it will mean going high-tech. But always, it will mean going smarter.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Is the future of agriculture organic or intense industrial farming, or a hybrid?</emphasis></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G4M-S233-RYVF-Y4PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

High time for some nature broadcasting.</p><p>Obviously there's no better tonic than being outside in nature itself, breathing in its myriad scents and feeling the wind in your hair while keeping the body moving. But, nonetheless, it's scientifically proven that even looking at images of natural landscapes releases happy hormones. Similarly, the sound of birdsong - whether in real life or recorded - is known to bring down stress levels. So in the absence of a green space right on your doorstep, tune into Hide FM, the latest site-specific project of Fingal multimedia artist Garrett Phelan. It's a 24- hour radio station documenting birdlife around the old Balleally landfill site that between Lusk and Rush is now a burgeoning nature reserve of sorts as it bleeds into the salt marshes, wet meadows and riverine creeks of Rogerstown estuary. From March 24 to April 20, Phelan will whisper observational and conceptual dispatches, each day dedicated to a specific bird and their feeding, migratory and breeding behaviours, while weaving in associated folklore. Catherine Cleary was best known as a journalist until she co-founded Pocket Forests in 2020, a tree-planting social enterprise inspired by the techniques of Akira Miyawaki, the Japanese botanist who pioneered a system of planting native fauna to help support and restore biodiversity in echo of our ancient forests. She's on a mission to spread the good word, which includes Conversation Beneath the Trees. It assembles scientists, farmers, conservationists, foragers and innovators to share experiences of farming with trees. The likes of regenerative farming, agroforestry policies, permaculture and catchment science are all up for lively discussion among those on the front lines of climate change, industrial waste, habit loss and often divisive legislation.</p><p>Just as Knepp rewilding guru Isabella Tree's name always inspires delight, there's no better man than actor, environmentalist and Woodland Trust ambassador David Oakes for hosting Trees a Crowd. Here, he has informal chats with fellow artists and enthusiasts (from Chris Packham to our very own Katie Holten), discussing how nature inspires and shapes our lives. Butterflies, boars, bogs, bison and other things not beginning with B are all exuberantly examined and championed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-203496897</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FD5-DMY3-S1H3-801X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"423\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 23, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000187</classCode><className>BIRDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

There is freshly roasted coffee from Priory Coffee Roasters and the freshest of beer from Priory Brewing's onsite brewery, taproom and tank bar. The project supports 130 local jobs, fosters start-ups and artisans, and brings new life into the old Tallaght village with The Apex theatre and spaces for live gigs, seminars and more.

The first weekend in October is a major date for food and drink lovers and producers across Ireland, thanks to the Dingle Food Festival and Blas na h\u00c9ireann awards.</p><p>F\u00e9ile an Phr\u00e1ta is different, says organiser Rochie Holohan, and not just because it celebrates the very local potato growers of West Kerry. This celebration of local community, the humble spud and the Irish language brings neighbours together for some old-fashioned craic, banter and bragging as they battle to be crowned Laoch an Phr\u00e1ta (the Potato Champion).</p><p>\"Unlike most other festivals,\" Holohan explains, \"we're not trying to attract visitors.\" That said, visitors and their c\u00fapla focal are most welcome to join the fun in Tigh U\u00ed Beag Laoigh (Begley's pub) for the Sunday final of the week-long 'spud-off', conducted across eight local areas to find the tastiest potato. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">facebook.com/FeileanPhrata </emphasis></p><p>The John Hewitt</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, Co Antrim</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Belfast is blessed with distinctive pubs but this might be its most unusual. John Hewitt was a poet, socialist and Freeman of Belfast who in 1983 established the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre. They went on in 1999 to open this social-enterprise pub in his name.</p><p>Having built a loyal fanbase for its warm hospitality and diverse arts and music programme (depending on when you land, you might join a hushed trad session, live local gig or hopping dance floor), in 2022 the running of the pub was handed over to Boundary Brewing.</p><p>They couldn't have picked a better partner. Boundary Brewing is a members-owned, co-operative-run brewery. Established in 2015, the brewery and later its taproom were funded through a series of Community Share Offers. Like the Newtownards Road taproom, the Cathedral Quarter pub offers 16 taps as well as fridges crammed with cans from Boundary Brewing and international friends, plus food from Franky's Lasagneria.  <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">boundarybrewing.coop/pages/the-john-hewitt </emphasis></p><p>Cloughjordan Ecovillage </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cloughjordan, Co Tipperary</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Community is everything at Cloughjordan Ecovillage, which was dreamt up by environmental sustainability pioneers in the late 1990s. The first residents moved into their eco-homes in 2009, and there are plans for more to come. The ecovillage is also home to Django's Hostel (with private en suite rooms from \u20ac45) and Riot Rye bakery and bread school (with excellent one-day courses from beginner to pro levels).</p><p>At the heart of the fertile 67-acre site is a members-owned biodynamic and organic community farm. Visitors are very welcome, whether for formal tours, informal workshops in the research, education and development garden that hosts 'Eats and Beats' DJ nights with a multi-course farm-to-fork meal, or any of the many events the village hosts year-round.</p><p>In the main village itself, you'll find eclectic reads and proper coffee at Sheelagh na Gig Bookshop, and wholesome fare at Middle Country Cafe. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">thevillage.ie</emphasis></p><p>One Plate for Palestine</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">July 22-27, various locations (see Instagram for participating businesses)</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>There is community to be found in solidarity. If you're feeling helpless about the sorry state of the world, it can bring hope to come together with like-minded souls to raise funds that will make a small but important difference.</p><p>One Plate for Palestine is a new campaign raising funds for those people starving in Palestine. Over a week in late July, many Irish restaurants, cafes, bars, food trucks and market stalls will add a special dish or drink to their menu featuring Palestinian ingredients, such as za'atar, sumac, labneh, hummus, dates, olives or olive oil, with all funds raised going to charities working on the ground to bring fresh water and meals to the people of Gaza living in extremely challenging conditions.?</p><p>Look out too for The Wine Shed's 'Vino with a View' fundraiser (July 20) at West Cork's Moss &amp;amp; Sand yoga studio for Acla\u00ed Palestine gym in the West Bank. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@oneplateforpalestine</emphasis></p><p>Airfield Estate</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dundrum, Dublin 14</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>A 38-acre working farm where you can watch Jersey cows being milked and Rhode Island Red hens laying eggs, and stroll lush gardens with views of the Dublin Mountains.

An educational kitchen sharing cooking skills and inspiration, and family-friendly events that ramp up in the summer. There are many reasons to visit Airfield Estate - and every visit gives back to the wider community.</p><p>As a social enterprise, profits from ticket sales and Overends Kitchen support the estate's educational and research programmes. Airfield welcomes 12,000 educational visitors every year - from pre-school through primary, secondary and third-level to adults with special needs - to learn about the cycle of food from soil to society, and how our food choices can benefit people, planet and pocket. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">airfield.ie </emphasis></p><p>Hi Spirits 'Wine Down' Summer Series</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Row Wines, Coppinger Row, Dublin 2</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Ngozi Elobuike?has been busy.

Surplus produce is sold through their onsite and online shops to conserve these varieties and spread them countrywide through private gardens, smallholdings and farms.</p><p>The onsite cafe, art gallery and gift shop, plus bookable guided group tours and free self-guided tours of their 20-acre organic gardens, orchards and woodlands, make for an excellent day-trip. Be sure to sample their Irish heritage apple juice, which won a recent Community Food Award?from the Irish Food Writers' Guild and is produced from organically grown apples in their National Collection of Heritage Apples - or catch their 'Taste the Orchards' apple-tasting tours on September 27. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">irishseedsavers.ie</emphasis></p><p>Polish Fizz @ Phibs!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">July 26, F\u00edon Eile, Phibsborough, Dublin 7</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Independent wine stores are more than simple retail spaces: they also offer access to a community who are passionate and knowledgeable about the wines they sell and the dedicated producers who make them.</p><p>Since opening their doors this spring, neighbourhood wine shop F\u00edon Eile's owners, Paul Gartland and Sin\u00e9ad McCarthy, have collaborated with some of our most interesting wine importers on a series of tastings for local wine lovers.</p><p>This month, they team up with Maggie Domaradzka and Maja Ignaczewska behind the dynamic Polish Wine Fest for a celebration of bubbles from above 50 degrees north of the equator.

Marrying her cooking skills and his art-criticism background, their flat's walls exhibited the artworks that inspired each meal. Their aim? To build bridges between cultures through food shared and knowledge exchanged.</p><p>It has recently morphed into larger pop-ups in public spaces like Temple Bar Galleries. With the help of friend Joatam Guevara, the menus and art installations explore crossover elements of Mexican and Irish culture, such as our street markets and seafood scenes. The Marisqueria Pop-Up (July 26, Hen's Teeth) celebrates Mexico's casual marisqueria seafood restaurants, and will feature live music and curated drinks pairings alongside food and art, followed by an August pop-up featuring Turkish artist Merve Sagit. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">fonditamestiza.com </emphasis></p><p>Brookfield Farm</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coolbawn, Nenagh, Co Tipperary</emphasis></emphasis></p><p>Ailbhe Gerrard's regenerative farm produces raw Irish honey, potatoes, rapeseed oil and organic lamb, plus handcrafted candles, beeswax furniture polish and gardener's hand salve.

Food festivals are where those folk get to meet and chat -?with themselves and with the broader community who enjoy their food - and have become an important part of driving that growing culture.</p><p>Besides its action-packed programme of trails, tours and tastings, demos and workshops, dinners and markets, Cork on a Fork has an impressive and varied line-up of free events that include lots of juicy conversations between some of the key movers and shakers in Irish food and drink today. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">corkcity.ie/en/cork-on-a-fork-fest</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SLIGO-https://www.independent.ie/life/fooddrink/letsbreakbread15tastycommunityboostingfoodanddrinkhubstovisitthissummer/a2082518483.html</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SLIGO2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G6B-69V3-RRTV-D44H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399002</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2678\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sligo Champion</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"11451\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 5, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Business &amp;

Here are 15 community-focused food and drink venues and events around Ireland to satiate your appetite for human connection this summer</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Food and drink are powerful tools for building community and forging connections. Coming together with others to grow or source food, to plan a meal, to break bread, to raise a toast: these are some of the most basic human instincts that remind us that we're stronger and better together. At a time when the world feels increasingly fractured and polarised, it can be nourishing for both body and soul to seek community and connection through shared food and drink experiences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kudos then to the creative entrepreneurs and hospitality professionals who are tapping into this basic human need to connect and find our folk, and harnessing that in positive ways. From grassroots community festivals and social-enterprise markets to co-op-owned breweries and collective fundraisers, here are 15 unique community-focused food and drink hubs and happenings to seek out this summer.</p><p>Priory Market Main Road, Tallaght, Co Dublin We flagged John Kearns of the Partas social enterprise as 'One to Watch' for 2025. Now his ambitious vision for the indoor food-and-drink Priory Market has taken root and he has opened the doors to Tallaght's new social, cultural and gastronomic destination.</p><p>Open 11am to 11pm daily, this multi-faceted hub hosts 16 curated food and drink spaces serving cuisines from Afro-Caribbean and Latin American to Indian and Italian, each small independent business benefiting from the collective model's reduced running costs of rent and rates. There is freshly roasted coffee from Priory Coffee Roasters and the freshest of beer from Priory Brewing's onsite brewery, taproom and tank bar. The project supports 130 local jobs, fosters start-ups and artisans, and brings new life into the old Tallaght village with The Apex theatre and spaces for live gigs, seminars and more. All profits go back into the community through projects like The Edge incubation hub. priorymarketie</p><p>F\u00e9ile an Phr\u00e1ta July 13</p><p>Tigh U\u00ed Beag Laoigh, Ballydavid, Co Kerry Dingle excels at drawing visitors to its town and peninsula through a diverse calendar of festivals. The first weekend in October is a major date for food and drink lovers and producers across Ireland, thanks to the Dingle Food Festival and Blas na h\u00c9ireann awards.</p><p>F\u00e9ile an Phr\u00e1ta is different, says organiser Rochie Holohan, and not just because it celebrates the very local potato growers of West Kerry. This celebration of local community, the humble spud and the Irish language brings neighbours together for some old-fashioned craic, banter and bragging as they battle to be crowned Laoch an Phr\u00e1ta (the Potato Champion).</p><p>\"Unlike most other festivals,\" Holohan explains, \"we're not trying to attract visitors.\" That said, visitors and their c\u00fapla focal are most welcome to join the fun in Tigh U\u00ed Beag Laoigh (Begley's pub) for the Sunday final of the week-long 'spud-off', conducted across eight local areas to find the tastiest potato. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/FeileanPhrata\">www.facebook.com/FeileanPhrata</url></p><p>The John Hewitt</p><p>Cathedral Quarter, Belfast, Co Antrim Belfast is blessed with distinctive pubs but this might be its most unusual. John Hewitt was a poet, socialist and Freeman of Belfast who in 1983 established the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre. They went on in 1999 to open this social-enterprise pub in his name.</p><p>Having built a loyal fanbase for its warm hospitality and diverse arts and music programme (depending on when you land, you might join a hushed trad session, live local gig or hopping dance floor), in 2022 the running of the pub was handed over to Boundary Brewing.</p><p>They couldn't have picked a better partner. Boundary Brewing is a members-owned, co-operative-run brewery. Established in 2015, the brewery and later its taproom were funded through a series of Community Share Offers. Like the Newtownards Road taproom, the Cathedral Quarter pub offers 16 taps as well as fridges crammed with cans from Boundary Brewing and international friends, plus food from Franky's Lasagneria. boundarybrewing.coop/pages/the-john-hewitt</p><p>Cloughjordan Ecovillage</p><p>Cloughjordan, Co Tipperary Community is everything at Cloughjordan Ecovillage, which was dreamt up by environmental sustainability pioneers in the late 1990s. The first residents moved into their eco-homes in 2009, and there are plans for more to come. The ecovillage is also home to Django's Hostel (with private en suite rooms from (EURO)45) and Riot Rye bakery and bread school (with excellent one-day courses from beginner to pro levels).</p><p>At the heart of the fertile 67-acre site is a membersowned biodynamic and organic community farm. Visitors are very welcome, whether for formal tours, informal workshops in the research, education and development garden that hosts 'Eats and Beats' DJ nights with a multi-course farm-to-fork meal, or any of the many events the village hosts year-round.</p><p>In the main village itself, you'll find eclectic reads and proper coffee at Sheelagh na Gig Bookshop, and wholesome fare at Middle Country Cafe. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thevillage.ie\">www.thevillage.ie</url> One Plate for Palestine</p><p>July 22-27</p><p>Various locations (see Instagram for participating businesses) There is community to be found in solidarity. If you're feeling helpless about the sorry state of the world, it can bring hope to come together with like-minded souls to raise funds that will make a small but important difference.</p><p>One Plate for Palestine is a new campaign raising funds for those people starving in Palestine. Over a week in late July, many Irish restaurants, cafes, bars, food trucks and market stalls will add a special dish or drink to their menu featuring Palestinian ingredients, such as za'atar, sumac, labneh, hummus, dates, olives or olive oil, with all funds raised going to charities working on the ground to bring fresh water and meals to the people of Gaza living in extremely challenging conditions.</p><p>Look out too for The Wine Shed's 'Vino with a View' fundraiser (July 20) at West Cork's Moss &amp; Sand yoga studio for Acla\u00ed Palestine gym in the West Bank. @oneplateforpalestine</p><p>Airfield Estate</p><p>Dundrum, Dublin 14 A 38-acre working farm where you can watch Jersey cows being milked and Rhode Island Red hens laying eggs, and stroll lush gardens with views of the Dublin Mountains.

Importantly, Brian was able to convert part of the farm to organics. He has the option of converting the remainder down the line once he has gotten used to the system, and depending on the market for organic meat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He currently has 550-600 ewes and 100 head of cattle. He grows tillage on the farm for two reasons: Firstly, it provides a high protein, high energy winter feed (combi crop of wheat and peas); and secondly, it breaks up the sod before reseeding and so works well in the rotation.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil fertility focus</emphasis></h><p>There has been a significant emphasis on optimising soil fertility on the farm. Soil analysis and the use of a nutrient management plan has allowed Brian to focus on where to target lime to raise soil pH, and where to target slurry and compound fertilisers for optimising phos phorus (P) and potassium (K) indices.</p><p>There are 41% of his soils optimum for pH, P and K, with 77%, 74%, and 77% optimum for pH, P and K, respectively. This has been a great foundation for Brian to successfully incorporate clover into the swards and reduce reliance on chemical nitrogen.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Converting to organics</emphasis></h><p>Brian started the conversion to organic production in the last 12 months. Brian chose to convert 70% of the agricultural land to organic farming.</p><p>Partial conversion of the farm to organic farming is allowed, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>* If both organic and conventional crops are to be produced, different species of plant, or different varieties that can be easily differentiated at all stages of growth and production, must be used.</p><p>* If both organic and conventional livestock are to be produced, different species must be involved.</p><p>He converted for a number of reasons. Firstly, the value of the Organic Farming Scheme payment to the farm.</p><p>An annual participation payment is be paid to all scheme participants to cover administrative costs, which is in addition to the per hectare payment. Both payments will be incorporated into the annual scheme payment. An amount of  2,000 will be paid to scheme participants in the first year of conversion and  1,400 for every subsequent year of the contract.</p><p>Another key reason was the potential markets for organic lamb. Brian is hopeful of premium markets for organic lamb.</p><p>Brian was operating a 1,000 ewe unit. Sourcing labour was becoming a major issue on the farm. It made sense to reduce ewe numbers to reduce labour requirement and operate at a more sustainable level and to improve work-life balance.</p><p>Switching to organic production also helps Brian meet his emissions targets.</p><p>But, of course, he had several key considerations before he switched to organics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Incorporating clover</emphasis></h><p>Brian has been using clover for the last few years to reduce his reliance on chemical nitrogen. He has also made progress to increase soil fertility to ensure productivity is maintained.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sourcing farmyard manure</emphasis></h><p>Brian has 100 head of cattle, which are housed for five months of the year. These provide Brian with a source of farmyard manure for targeting low P and K fields.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocking rate</emphasis></h><p>For organic production, the stocking rate needs to be less than two livestock units per hectare. Brian had 1,000 ewes and 300 ewe lamb replacements before conversion. He has reduced ewe numbers to 550-600. This was a choice that suited him from a labour perspective.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bedding areas</emphasis></h><p>Brian needed to consider if animal housing could be modified to incorporate a bedded lying area.</p><p>All sheds are straw bedded for the sheep enterprise. Cattle sheds have a slatted feeding area with a straw laying area - so if in the future he decides to convert the cattle to organic, there are no major financial requirements.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other schemes</emphasis></h><p>Other environmental schemes may not be eligible for Or ganic Farming Scheme payment.</p><p>Brian is also in Acres and the options chosen for Acres means his organic payment is not affected. Brian is maximising payments for Acres and organics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Animal health</emphasis></h><p>The routine prevention of health problems in animals is key for organic livestock production. Brian has operated with a robust flock health plan, which has helped to reduce animal health risks. He also regularly uses faecal egg sampling to identify fluke and worm challenges rather than using routine preventative treatment.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will it be profitable</emphasis></h><p>This farm is already operating at a high level of output, coupled with low production costs. Brian has also been an early adopter of key technologies to improve efficiency, reduce costs and maximise profitability.</p><p>Brian is optimistic that the organic payments, coupled with premium markets as well as other diversification strategies on the farm, will maintain or increase profitability on the farm. It is important to say that Brian is also diversifying into other areas, including the incorporation of agroforestry on the farm. More about this in another article.</p><p>Brian is one year into conversion and doesn't find a huge change in the switch to organics. There is additional paperwork but otherwise little change.</p><p>His system had moved more towards organic farming in recent years, making the change easier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brian Nicholson began the change to organic production 12 months ago.

Continued engagement will be needed with Carbon Removals and Carbon Farming (CRCF) regulation developments at EU level, to ensure the Irish framework aligns with the EU's certification systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Pilot projects will be needed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the Irish framework. Carbon farming methods will have to be developed specific to activity types (carbon removal, emissions reduction, and biodiversity preserva-tion/restoration).</p><p>Oireachtas members were recently told that rewarding farmers to practice carbon farming solutions could help address climate change. TDs and senators will have a role in scrutinising future carbon farming schemes, to ensure they are certified, flexible and robustly monitored, according to an Oireachtas briefing by Mike Brennan, senior parliamentary researcher (environmental science).</p><p>Meanwhile, agriculture minister Martin Heydon said: \"There may be some potential in the development of carbon farming to provide an additional policy approach to supporting carbon sequestration\".</p><p>Answering a D\u00e1il question from Erin McGreehan TD, the minister said the Government already supports farmers in carbon sequestration, for example in maintenance of carbon in hedgerows and grassland.</p><p>There is carbon sequestration in the National Agri-Climate Rural Environment Scheme (ACRES). The Afforestation Scheme provides financial support for planting trees on land not previously under forest. Other initiatives, such as the national liming scheme and National Soil Sampling Programme, also support carbon sequestration while supporting farmers, added the Minister.</p><p>He said he is committed to developing a National Framework for Carbon Farming, as promised in the Programme for Government and Climate Action Plan. \"My goal is to provide guidance to farmers and landowners in Ireland in the development of policy to guide Carbon Farming. This aligns with similar work underway at EU level.\"</p><p>Carbon farming means managing farmland to enhance its ability to take up and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, as well as reducing greenhouse gas emissions from soils and farm practices, according to the recent briefing for Oireachtas members.</p><p>It said many practices can be classed as carbon farming, including rewetting peaty soils; planting trees (agroforestry); soil protection measures (cover crops, no-till farming, hedgerows, restoring ecosystems, making space for nature]; and improving fertiliser efficiency.</p><p>Carbon farming can protect farms by building in resilience to climate impacts, and providing farm diversification opportunities. Carbon farming can drive down emissions, increase farm biodiversity, and improve water quality, without impacting production.</p><p>Some carbon farming measures are already in the Common Agricultural Policy, such as the standards for keeping land in \"good agricultural and environmental condition\", peatland protection, and protecting environmentally sensitive grassland.</p><p>Additional measures include planting hedgerows, planting and improving forestry and treelines, using tree-belts to capture ammonia, and nature-sensitive soil management on protected lands.</p><p>The Suckler Carbon Efficiency Programme aims to improve suckler herd genetics for carbon efficiency, and the Straw Incorporation Measure increases soil carbon.</p><p>\"However, there is no regulated, certified system to pay farmers for the carbon they remove from the atmosphere and store on their lands\", Oireachtas members were told.</p><p>Meanwhile, European carbon farming policy is developing quickly. The European Parliament recently provisionally agreed on the CRCF Regulation to establish an EU-level certification framework for permanent carbon removals, carbon farming, and carbon storage in products. It sets out rules for public and private certification schemes, ensuring the quality of carbon removals and the transparency and credibility of the certification process.</p><p>However, some environmental groups have said the CRCF Regulation will not lead to lasting carbon removals and should not be used for carbon offsets. TDs and senators were also told the Irish Farmers Association (IFA) are concerned that the EU framework would reward only new measures and does not value the carbon already stored in farms' soils, trees and hedgerows.

My key message is that farmers have to be participants in that.\"</p><p>Mr Callanan said it is crucial that any regulation around carbon farming is not be seen as another rule for farming but a financial opportunity.</p><p>\"There's opportunities here for agriculture whatever way you look at it,\" he said. \"There's multiple demands now in terms of what land is used for and the economic opportunities which arise from that.</p><p>\"Food has to be a core - we cannot in any way suggest that it diminishes. The Commission identifies that in Europe we have an adequacy of food but the affordability is sometimes a challenge for citizens.</p><p>\"Thereafter you have to reflect in a low -arbon economy, there will be demands on land for energy, the bioeconomy, alternatives to plastics and building materials.</p><p>\"There's inherently going to be a tension over time in relation to the multiple demands.</p><p>\"How do we create opportunities for farmers in how they use privately owned land to generate an economic return in the context of these multiple demands which society will have of farmers?</p><p>\"Carbon farming is a potential tool to that objective and but it's built around a couple of things. Government can grease the wheel in terms of policy but it cannot run it.</p><p>\"Ultimatelyyou have to have economic models that are logical for the marketplace but also for the farmer.</p><p>\"Farmers are used to being sold ideas: 'you spread this you're going to get 10pc more production', 'you use this product and it's a little bit like an elixir that will solve all ailments, it adds cost but it's going to generate more money'.</p><p>\"Farmers are financially astute in terms of understanding examples in front of them of what has worked and what makes sense on their farm.\"</p><p>Mr Callanan highlighted investment by Ireland in a soil carbon observatory, resulting in the highest observation intensity in Europe implemented by Teagasc.</p><p>\"We have over a million hectares where farmers have been supported in soil sampling to get a baseline of what carbon is in our soils,\" he said.</p><p>\"Thereafter you look at what are the building blocks in terms of confidence so the market understands what's being traded or sold and generates an economic value in that confidence.</p><p>\"That may be around certifying the process - generating the data and ensuring that confidence isn't undermined by poor practices or undefendable claims.</p><p>\"Concepts don't sell with farmers because ultimately everybody is selling something to them.</p><p>\"It has to be something understandable, piloted and with good examples which financially make sense on their own merit rather than public money driving this.</p><p>\"That's how I see carbon farming evolving.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Agroforestry is a cited example of a farming practice that removes CO2 from the atmosphere.

Buzzards have been breeding and a heron can usually be found fishing in the river.</p><p>Before going into organics and agroforestry, Stephen ran a large flock of sheep, struggling to find a good worklife balance.</p><p>\"I was doing everything that Teagasc was telling me to do and we probably peaked out at 220 ewes and 80 suckler cows and I was bringing everything through to beef,\" he said.</p><p>\"There was a lot of stock on the farm. My life was a bit of a merry-go-round, I didn't have time for the kids or anything, and one day I had a neighbour out shooting on the farm and he was having more leisure time on the farm than I ever had.</p><p>\"I was starting to think that this is not the work-life balance the way I wanted it. Long story short, my back gave up and I decided the sheep were going to go. I always had it in my head that I'd keep the sheep until all of the kids were through college.</p><p>\"I didn't quite get there, I had the sheep for 20 years, and I have three out of col- lege this year and one to go. Where the sheep were, I put that into native forestry more or less, 25ac.\"</p><p>Stephen, a 2020 Farming for Nature ambassador, manages the 300-acre farm with his wife Heidi, which is also home to Soearth Projects, a mental health wellbeing service through the use of the arts and eco activity.</p><p>\"We got a LEADER for a building and we take people for wellness walks around the farm.</p><p>\"I talk about nature and how we run the farm and Irish beef.</p><p>\"A lot of the people we get are from Dublin and I don't get this big urban-rural divide,\" Stephen said.</p><p>\"I get a lot of people who are very interested in what we're doing on the farm and there's a lot of sympathy towards farming.</p><p>\"What I'm doing here with the native forestry is bringing people out for walks around that, talking about the different trees. I've no intention of ever cutting that down, I'll thin it out.</p><p>\"Part of my reason for native forestry is that I'm one of these eco warriors.</p><p>\"I'm very passionate about Irish beef.</p><p>I think we've got a fantastic product in Ireland and I'm passionate about nature. I'm letting the hedges grow out. REPS hedge we planted 11 years ago, lots of swallows are flying around and there's a buzzard roaring there at the moment.</p><p>\"The farm now, the sheep are gone and native forestry in, the suckler herd is back to about 55 cows.</p><p>\"I used to have a Charolais and Limousin bull, they are gone, and we now have a Hereford and Aubrac.</p><p>\"The funny thing is my grandad back in the 60s and 70s was very passionate about Hereford and Angus. So we're back to where we started.</p><p>\"I had some very heavy cows. I was in the SCEP scheme and weighed them and some of them were like 850kg. I started buying stabilisers and they're doing well.</p><p>\"I used to always buy Limousin out of</p><p>British Friesian, but they are very hard to find these days.</p><p>\"I also tried the French breed, Salers, but there wasn't enough milk in them as far as I could see. The only good thing about them is that they are so lively they don't bend the gates. I used to calve in the autumn and spring, but I've got rid of all of the autumn calvers now.\"</p><p>The farm's bullocks are all slaughtered under 30 months while the heifers are sent at 24 months.</p><p>Mistake Stephen buys a combi feed mix at (EURO)720/t in 1t bags from a supplier in Co Tipperary.</p><p>\"I used to kill them around 18 months.</p><p>We made the decision last winter not to kill them out of the shed because of the cost of organic meal at over (EURO)700/t so they went back to grass again,\" Stephen added.</p><p>\"The mistake I made last year was that I decided I was going to stop feeding all of the bullocks and the heifers and just let them finish off grass. Turns out we had a very wet July and the thrive really went out of the cattle and I had the worst of all worlds with a lot of them back in the shed in September.</p><p>\"Not only was I having to go out to buy them meal, they were eating into my fodder for the winter.\"</p><p>Stephen advises anyone considering getting into the organics scheme to trial running the farm under organic principles for a year.</p><p>\"I had the panic stations when I started ploughing up fields and putting in red clover and that should have been done the year previously going into organics,\" he said.</p><p>\"This year, I'm trying to work out what the farm can have stock wise, and making enough feed for the winter.</p><p>\"I put in 18ac two years ago when I first went into organics and last summer I put in another 30ac of the red and white clover and the two species of ryegrass mix.</p><p>\"I find that it's absolutely brilliant silage, my only thing is now the first field</p><p>I put into red clover, the red clover is starting to go out of it already, I don't know why. I took three cuts off it there last year and I got 21 bales to the acre. I put out slurry after each cut and farmyard manure in September.</p><p>\"This year has been pretty tough trying to get grass to grow, with a terrible spring.</p><p>\"I've noticed the clover really starting to kick in now with a bit of heat.</p><p>\"I need to put in more paddocks around the farm, I think that's probably the key to getting grass to grow for the organics scheme.\"</p><p>'I get a lot of people who are interested in what we're doing on farm and there's a lot of sympathy towards farming' 'I'm very passionate about Irish beef. I think we've got a fantastic product in Ireland'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Stephen Morrison farms 300 acres in Kill, Co KildareStephen says the suckler herd is down to about 55 cows</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-198810809</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CTS-H001-DYTY-C05P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1116\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 27, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

About one third were approved, but many have not yet progressed to planting. And 22 agroforestry applications are cur rently being processed, comprising an area of 122ha.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The best year for agroforestry has been 2020, with the establishment of 24.95 ha.</p><p>Agriculture Minister Charlie McConalogue has suggested that the reduced number of annual premiums available is the main barrier preventing increased takeup. Only five premiums are on offer, compared to 15 in the other 11 categories of the national Afforestation Grant and Premium Scheme. The restriction of premiums for agroforestry is in accordance with EU state aid guidelines.</p><p>Agroforestry' is a combination of trees and pasture. Silage and hay production is also permitted.</p><p>The current forestry programme (extended to the end of 2022) is the first to include agroforestry, with a target of establishing 195ha of agroforestry between 2015 and 2020. But planted and grantaided areas were under 6.84ha per year, except for 2020.</p><p>Agroforestry is promoted as positive for animal welfare, biodiversity, drainage, off-setting emissions from other farming practices, enhanced landscapes, and preventing nutrient runoff when planted in strategic locations. In addition, it is possible to grow veneer quality timber with little impact on existing agricultural production.</p><p>McConalogue said increasing options and incentives for agroforestry on farms will be an important consideration in the design of the next forestry programme, when he answered a D\u00e1il question from Cavan-Monaghan Sinn F\u00e9in TD Matt Carthy last week.</p><p>Grant-aided agroforestry allows planting of 400 to 1,000 trees per hectare, but the plot must be at least half a hectare, and at least 20 meters wide. The trees are thinned later, to reduce them to between 160 and 250 per hectare, to allow enough light for continued grass growth.</p><p>Trees must be protected against browsing animals with tree shelters, fencing or both.</p><p>Along with being offered only five premiums, those interested in agroforestry may have held back from applying for grants for the same reasons behind the overall decline in afforestation grant applications in recent years.</p><p>The applications fell from 17,594 hectares in 2014 to 4,606 hectares in 2021. McConalogue has said: \"There are a variety of reasons why there has been a decline in the number of afforestation applications in recent years.\"</p><p>Answering a D\u00e1il question from Wexford Fine Gael TD Paul Kehoe, he said: \"Interest in afforestation has been impacted by the complexity of the legal and administrative system, judicial decisions, the efficiency of the forestry licensing system, the appetite among landowners to convert land to afforestation usage and, in some areas, complex societal attitudes and responses to afforestation.\"</p><p>He said the licensing situation is improving, with 4,050 licences issued in 2021, and a target of 5,250 in 2022, including more than doubling the number of afforestation licences, to 1,040.</p><p>Meanwhile, Ireland lags well behind other EU countries for agroforestry. It is estimated at around 20m hectares in the EU, equivalent to almost 12% of the utilised agricultural area, which compares to the organic area which is 8.5%. But nearly 90% of the European grassland area, and more than 99% of the arable land, has potential for agroforestry.</p><p>It could be said that the pastureland featuring a network of hedgerows in Ireland is an old form of agroforestry that was abandoned in much of the EU with the modernisation and intensification of agricultural production and forestry since the 1960s. Now the more prominent EU examples of agroforestry are sheep grazing beneath cork oaks in Portugal and Spain, or tall fruit trees under which crops are grown or livestock grazed, in Central Europe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Agroforestry is a combination of trees and pasture.

I'm very much in favour of sustainable livestock farming,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is my recommendation for the next CAP - to introduce redistributive payment for sustainable mixed farms, having crop production and livestock. The future CAP should support extensive sustainable livestock farming.\"</p><p>The Polish politician has said a renewed focus on animal welfare has been good for the promotion of EU products overseas.</p><p>\"In the current Common Agricultural Policy, we introduced important instruments supporting livestock farmers, which are animal welfare and eco schemes. I'm happy that the majority of member states used this opportunity because it's voluntary for member states and farmers,\" he said.</p><p>\"Payment rates increased for farmers who voluntarily introduced higher standards over the minimum level. In the previous CAP 2014-2020, it was only (EURO)1.5bn, and in the current CAP 2021-2027, it is (EURO)6.1bn. For example, it is summer grazing, more space for animals in buildings, free range farming etc.</p><p>\"This is also very good for the promotion of our products, the highest standards for animal welfare in the world.\"</p><p>The Agriculture boss also wants to see agroforestry become commonplace in EU livestock systems.</p><p>\"Farming [in Belgium] is very close to my heart and to my vision of the future of agriculture - extensive farming, with the animals free grazing and forestry of course. Agroforestry is sustainable agriculture,\" he said. Future \"Absolutely, this is the model which should be supported in the future.\"</p><p>The Commissioner also welcomed recent protests by European farmers contesting low food prices, environmental regulations, nitrogen cuts, among other issues.</p><p>\"We are doing everything possible to support you and to simplify CAP rules,\" he said.</p><p>\"Thank you for your protests and demonstrations because it was helpful to find the solution and to give a positive answer.\"</p><p>Commissioner Wojciechowski is now in the final months of his term, but he will have key influence on the foundations for the next CAP.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-198330918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CN9-47J1-DYTY-C092-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"401\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 6, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>EUROPEAN COMMISSION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Business &amp;

This is the annual gettogether of organic, biodynamic, chemical free and an increasing number of regenerative farmers who are transitioning to more sustainable production methods. This year the numbers increased by almost 50% reflecting the growing acreage of land in Ireland being farmed on organic principles to 5% in 2024 from a mere 2% in 2022. Organic production is increasing worldwide with Australia, India and Argentina leading the way. In Europe, Liechtenstein has the highest organic area at 43% followed by Austria, the leading EU country at 27.5%. Sales of organic food continue to rise exponentially particularly in the US and Australia. Here in Ireland, despite the cost of living crisis, an increasing number of people are connecting the food they eat to the health of the family.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is a growing realisation that it's more cost-effective to invest in chemical free foods rather than expensive and not always effective supplements. Once again I repeat our food should and can indeed be our medicine. There's also a significant increase in the number of families who have started to grow some of their own food at home, in veggie patches, allotments and even on window sills and balconies.</p><p>This not only enhances our lives, reminds us of what food should taste like but it excites the kids and teaches them some really important life skills. It also shows them (and us) how much work actually goes into producing nourishing wholesome food, it doesn't just appear on the supermarket shelf. John Hogan, an agronomist and horticultural consultant with 40 years' experience spelled out the challenges but also the growing market for Irish organic food and opportunity for export substitution. Most would have a gut feeling (as do I) that organic, chemical-free food, grown in rich fertile soil has got to be altogether better for our wellbeing but why, one might ask, in the midst of this cost of living crisis, would the consumer reckon that it's worth the extra money unless there is scientific evidence to prove it. We urgently need targeted stats, anecdotal evidence is not enough.</p><p>Poor diets are also linked to 20% of deaths worldwide, eleven billion annually and cost health authorities countless millions globally. Engaging and inspirational speaker Neil Fuller, a soil scientist and climate-smart farming expert, talked about how we could make 'food the weapon' in climate change and the real cost of cheap food on people's health.</p><p>Despite the perception, farming is a significant part of the solution to climate change. In the words of Patrick Holden of the Sustainable Food Trust, 'if we paid farmers to be carbon stewards, then farming could move from being part of the problem to part of the solution'.</p><p>There was much to learn about heritage wheat trials, increased demand for organic oats, and homeopathy for animals. BioFarm encourages and supports farmers and growers to consider agroforestry, silvopasture (a way of combining trees, livestock, and forage crops on the same land for multiple benefits), the importance of dung beetles, all play their part in enriching fertile soil and producing healthy food to nourish rather than damage our health which is what farming should be all about in the end.</p><p>We stayed at Fitzgeralds Woodlands hotel in Adare, the conference venue. A wonderfully convivial, family run hotel with exceptionally kind and helpful staff. Chef Mark Darcy shared several of the recipes that the conference attendees enjoyed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHW-M081-DYRW-V1C9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"602\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

So Cork's 14 awards, more than any other county, was some feat and included the accolade of Supreme Champion which went to Hegarty's Templegall, a comte-style cheese created by Dan Hegarty and his cheesemakers Jean-Baptiste Enjelvin and Quentin Dubois. It also picked up gold in the Raw Milk Cheese category.</p><p>Decades ago, The Menu made regular pilgrimages to Coolea to pick up whole wheels of Coolea Farmhouse Cheese, so was delighted that two of CAIS's founding members, Dickie and Helene Willems, were presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award. Their divine Matured Coolea won gold in the Mature Hard Cheese Aged Over 6 Months category. Other golds included wonderful newcomers Leitrim Hill creamery, Velvet Cloud's Clonbrook, Cork's Durrus Cheese, and Toons Bridge Dairy's Smoked Scamorza.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The full list of winners can be found at irishcheese.ie</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dine in the Dark</emphasis></h><p>The K Club's new executive head chef, Gary O'Hanlon, is already making his presence felt as he and The Barton restaurant's head chef Marek Zboril, turn down the lights for a Dine in the Dark dinner with a conscience. Creating a special sustainable candlelit dinner (May 17) featuring a swathe of local produce, paired with planet-friendly wines, including Kromeski of wild Kildare rabbit confit, gin-cured line-caught trout and roast rack of Kildare lamb. The hotel is also to be commended for other eco-friendly initiatives including the addition of beehives, an upgraded boiler system and restoration of the estate's historic weir, which will soon supply a huge percentage of the resort's renewable energy.</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">kclub.ie</emphasis></p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Biodiversity Week</emphasis></h><p>One of the last public gatherings The Menu attended before the first lockdown was a brilliant agroforestry conference organised by Kinsale College's Sustainable Horticulture/ Permaculture department, that was well received by all who attended but any subsequent momentum was utterly derailed by the pandemic. A real shame indeed as agroforestry offers some of the most progressive measures around to address the impact of climate change and biodiversity loss.</p><p>While it won't have the range of speakers as was to be found in Kinsale, The Menu highly recommends 'An Introduction to Agroforestry' on May 17, guided by Phil Wheal at The Organic Centre, just one of a host of events being held in the centre to mark National Biodiversity Week (see biodiversityweek.ie for other events around the country).</p><p>* <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">biodiversityweek.ie</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C2P-FYV1-JC8V-44HB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"478\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

Everybody from the United Nations, the EU, our government and various NGOs right down to faceless keyboard warriors are telling farmers to rewild, re-gen, become more sustainable and save the planet. If only it was as easy as that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's time these people listened to what farmers actually want, if they are going to be part of this plan to rescue Earth.</p><p>These (in order of importance) are essential ingredients to bring farmers on board: \u00a6 Farmers must be financially well rewarded for the effort involved. \u00a6 Actions must require low demands on labour and time.</p><p>\u00a6 No financial devaluation of land when planted with trees or habitats. \u00a6 Public acknowledgement and respect for the work done.</p><p>\u00a6 Low level of bureaucracy in the administration of schemes.</p><p>\u00a6 Schemes which are complementary to all existing farm enterprises. \u00a6 Fair and reasonable monitoring / inspection / penalty protocols.</p><p>We hear a lot about carbon farming, but plenty of farmers don't know what it actually is.</p><p>The European Commission defines carbon farming as: \"A green business model that rewards land managers (farmers) for taking up improved land management practices, resulting in the increase of carbon sequestration in living biomass, dead organic matter, and soils by enhancing carbon capture and/or reducing the release of carbon into the atmosphere, in respect of ecological principles.\" In simple terms this means any farming practice that reduces the level of greenhouse gases (GHGs). There are three main actions in carbon farming: \u00a6 Removal: sequestration and storage of carbon in soils and harvested products, eg rewet bogs.</p><p>\u00a6 Avoidance: preventing the loss of already stored carbon - avoiding emissions, eg min-till, no ploughing. \u00a6 Reduction: limit the emissions created by work on farms, eg reduce methane from ruminants.</p><p>By adopting specific practices, farmers can mitigate climate change while also improving soil health, increasing biodiversity - and hopefully maintaining or boosting farm productivity. The concept is simple: through various on-farm management practices farmers can enhance the natural ability of soils and plants to absorb and store more carbon.</p><p>Irish agricultural/forestry practices that come within the scope of carbon farming include: \u00a6 Agroforestry system establishment (this is the integration of trees with either crops or livestock on the same land).</p><p>\u00a6 Maintenance of soil organic carbon. \u00a6 Livestock and manure management. \u00a6 Nutrient management on grasslands and croplands.</p><p>\u00a6 Organic soil/peatland management. We know our agricultural sector is a significant contributor to Ireland's GHG emissions, accounting for around 40pc. The majority of these emissions come from methane produced by ruminant livestock, and nitrous oxide from fertilised soils.</p><p>Actions to reduce emissions has already started with the CAP 2023-2027 strategic plan for Ireland. EU and national premia and subsidies are now all heavily linked to carrying out various climate and environmentally measures.</p><p>Yes, there is a long way to go meet our emissions target of a 25pc reduction by 2030 and 50pc by 2050.</p><p>On a positive note, Ireland's GHG emissions are at their lowest in 30 years, according to the latest figures from the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p>Almost every sector showed a fall in 2023, contributing to an overall reduction of 6.8pc; agriculture decreased by 4.6pc.</p><p>We have not yet come up with a carbon farming enterprise to consider as an alternative way of farming.</p><p>Agro-forestry, commercial on-farm forestry and wetting of bogs are spoken of as good possibilities, but why are they not developed into viable enterprises for framers to consider right now?</p><p>We need to fast-track and promote viable enterprises that meet the needs of all farmers in this area.</p><p>EU subsidies and premia are requiring more and more time and effort from farmers before the payments arrive in the bank account.</p><p>This is causing many to question the viability of their traditional beef and sheep enterprises.</p><p>This is the opportunity for our researchers to develop specific carbon farming enterprises that are profitable, tax-efficient and low on labour and time requirement.</p><p>In the meantime, carbon farming is limping along by coexisting within the traditional farming enterprises, until we agree on a clear vision for our countryside between 2050 and 2100.</p><p>Despite its potential, the widespread adoption of carbon farming in Ireland faces several challenges.</p><p>One of the main obstacles is the lack of standardised methods for measuring, reporting, and verifying (MRV) carbon sequestration on farms. Without reliable MRV systems, it is difficult to quantify the benefits of carbon farming and reward farmers for their efforts.</p><p>The LIFE Carbon Farming project, led by Teagasc, is working on developing a robust MRV process. It aims to establish reference levels for GHG emissions from livestock farms and determine baseline rates for carbon sequestration.</p><p>The project hopes to facilitate greater participation in carbon markets and attract funding for climate actions on farms.</p><p>The need for education and training is another challenge; farmers in general are unfamiliar with carbon farming practices and are hesitant to adopt new techniques.</p><p>Private consultants and Teagasc advisors are at breaking point with an overload of work from the plethora of existing schemes. We need more advisors.</p><p>Carbon farming as a stand-alone farm enterprise or embedded/coexisting with existing farm enterprises is here to stay.</p><p>The sooner all organisations understand the needs and wants of farmers who own and farm the land in this country, the sooner the planet will be saved.</p><p>Mike Brady is an agricultural consultant and managing director at Brady Group, Cork</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Agroforestry is the integration of trees with either crops or livestock on the same land.

Read the terms of the scheme to see the limited exemptions to this rule.</p><p>Stocking rate Agroforestry can involve pasture, grazing, silage and hay.</p><p>Other systems may be considered on a site-by-site basis, as long as the tree stocking rate is between 400-1000 trees per hectare, it is at least 0.5ha and at least 20m wide.</p><p>The trees will be thinned out in time, reducing numbers to 160-250 trees per hectare. This will allow enough light to filter through the canopy, enabling continued grass growth.</p><p>Trees must be protected against browsing animals with tree shelters or fencing.</p><p>When silage and hay are being produced, farmers must ensure that appropriate machinery is used to avoid damage to the trees. Tree species Acceptable species include oak, sycamore and cherry, including 15pc fruit and nut trees.</p><p>Other species can also be considered on a site-by-site basis. Soil type Ideally, sites should contain free-draining mineral soils and should have no requirement for additional drainage or additional fertiliser for tree growth.</p><p>However, additional nitrogen (up to 100kg/ha) may be required to promote grass growth for spring/ summer grazing. This can be assessed on a site-by-site basis.</p><p>Grant aid 80pc of eligible costs can be funded. Grant rates and payment structure are paid on a fixed grant basis.</p><p>The afforestation grant is a fixed grant to cover the costs incurred in the establishment of a forest and paid exclusive of VAT. It is paid in two instalments.</p><p>The total grant available is (EURO)6,220.</p><p>Premiums will be paid for five years and will cover the cost of maintenance only and range from (EURO)645-660.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-178911824</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65HM-JX01-DYTY-C362-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 24, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"/><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DSGR</classCode><className>GRAZING LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009FAV</classCode><className>FERTILIZERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I m hoping to get a glimpse of the future look and feel for our forest project in Roscommon. The walks are part of the International Agroforestry conference, held over two days in Bantry starting on November 16th. There is solid evidence from Europe s oldest agroforestry study showing its potential for productive farming. The study site in Loughall in Co Armagh has produced decades of research thanks in large part to Prof Jim McAdam, who was involved in setting it up and minding it as a resource for the future despite years of indifference from the agricultural mainstream.</p><p>Agroforestry s time has come. Trees can help farmers, livestock and land and create more climate-resilient farming systems. All of these supports feel more urgent as we wade through what looks set to be one of the wettest years on record. Agroforestry lends itself to mixed farming, not putting all the eggs into one basket. The monoculture farm that only produces one thing, whether it s broccoli or baby formula, is a model that suits food businesses, not farming ones. It s increasingly not fit for purpose. Commodity food conglomerates thrive while farmers are vulnerable to shocks, whether from a volatile market or an increasingly volatile climate.</p><p>The conference will also hear from Kathleen Conroy, lead researcher with the TCD and UCD ForES Project, which is looking at valuing what trees can do, and working out a system to pay farmers to safeguard that value. International agroforestry expert Patrick Worms will explain how agroforestry dominates 40 per cent of the world s agricultural land. Farmers should be encouraged to add trees to their fields, he argues  and foresters to add agricultural production to their forests .</p><p>Day two will be the field trips to three farms around Skibbereen. On Rossa Gibbons s farm, he is building a pedigree Shropshire sheep flock on an agroforestry plot, which also incorporates fruit and nut trees. Alan Kingston will walk us through his horticulture, agroforestry and aronia berry farm where he is also rearing Shropshire sheep and a small herd of Kune Kune pigs which fertilise the forest floor, and clear briars without harming the trees, thanks to their shorter snouts. </p><p>Then we will visit Caherbeg, where Avril and William Allshire planted mixed agroforestry five years ago and are managing a mature spruce plantation. They produce free range pork and have a firewood business.</p><p>Learning while walking in wellies, my favourite kind of schooling, will be a big part of the conference. There are still some tickets left. Prices start from EUR 50 for students, see irishagroforestry.ie. l</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20450610</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69JD-WWN1-DYS1-0237-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 4, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Field Trips</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzA1OEE0MjNCMjgyNEEwNTkwNkYwMDAwOUQ4QzMyQ0Q7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTNDOTREN0QwMTQwNDJCMkJGODMxOUY2QUIyNzI2QTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009P1D</classCode><className>SCHOOL FIELD TRIPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DPRX</classCode><className>CONGLOMERATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSFN</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000049</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00097FF</classCode><className>PORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001902</classCode><className>FOOD &amp; BEVERAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009SWJ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC662</classCode><className>NORTHERN IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The dangers of working the extremely steep hills have always been on his and his wife Aoife's mind.</p><p>\"When I started driving a tractor down here - I was in my 30s and competent,\" he says.</p><p>\"Our boy is more passionate about farming than probably I ever was. When he gets to 16 and is able to drive a tractor, there's a danger he's going to be in parts of the farm where he shouldn't be.</p><p>\"From a security point of view at his age. I don't want him thinking the tractor needs to go down here. So that was a big part of it.\"</p><p>The sense of remaining 'connected' with the land was another important motivator for Miche\u00e1l and was among the reasons he decided against a more commercial forest.</p><p>\"If I just put commercial sitka spruce down here, you're sort of drawing a line under it and it will kill off underneath, like giving nothing but a dead forest and that wasn't for me,\" he says. \"I don't like the idea of the dead forest. Whereas the native deciduous trees are something we're passionate about.\"</p><p>Having secured access to the Department of Agriculture's agroforestry scheme and planning permission, Miche\u00e1l planted the trees over the past winter.</p><p>Having initially thought about engaging a forestry company to carry out this work, he decided to take on the project himself with the help of friends and family. It was a major job.</p><p>The task sounds simple: drive a stake, drill a hole, plant your tree, cover with a tree protector and drive another stake. However, it had to be repeated a 1,000 times on an inclined site where there were areas a digger couldn't access.</p><p>    Andrew Bergin: Tax-free agroforestry timber sales could make a nice pension for an arable farmer</p><p>\"I was never afraid of hard work, and it became a nearly became like a personal challenge,\" Miche\u00e1l says, adding, however, that there were times at the start where he felt \"this is going to take years\".</p><p>As time went on, though, he says his technique improved.</p><p>\"It's a very steep site, and the digger wasn't able to drive all the poles, so many had to be put in by hand,\" he says.</p><p>\"I took holidays during January because the weather was good and then evenings after work I was down with head torches digging holes into dark night.</p><p>\"I had great help from friends and family that gave up weekends to help. It was almost like it was a neighbourhood effort.\"</p><p>In the end, 600 oak, 200 downy birch and 200 white cherry trees were planted over the course of three months of hard work.</p><p>In terms of the financial reward for the effort, Miche\u00e1l says that for him, the payback from the scheme versus his material costs were just like for like.</p><p>\"I didn't know it was going to cost me so much, but as I went through it, the fact that the grant money was there meant I was able to continue,\" he says.</p><p>\"I put in 1,000 trees at \u20ac1.50/tree that's \u20ac1,500; then put the covers around them at \u20ac2.20 per cover, that's \u20ac2,200. Then I had to put a stake in behind them, which cost \u20ac2.95 each, so that was another \u20ac3,000.</p><p>\"Then just as I started, a new guideline came in that said there needed to be another stake at the front to protect the cover from an animal; that was another \u20ac2.</p><p>\"By the time I had each unit had put together, it cost \u20ac9 so it was \u20ac9000 for my project.

Read the terms of the scheme to see the limited exemptions to this rule.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocking rate</emphasis></p><p>Agroforestry can involve pasture, grazing, silage and hay.</p><p>Other systems may be considered on a site-by-site basis, as long as the tree stocking rate is between 400-1000 trees per hectare, it is at least 0.5ha and at least 20m wide.</p><p>The trees will be thinned out in time, reducing numbers to 160-250 trees per hectare. This will allow enough light to filter through the canopy, enabling continued grass growth.</p><p>Trees must be protected against browsing animals with tree shelters or fencing.</p><p>When silage and hay are being produced, farmers must ensure that appropriate machinery is used to avoid damage to the trees.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tree species</emphasis></p><p>Acceptable species include oak, sycamore and cherry, including 15pc fruit and nut trees.</p><p>Other species can also be considered on a site-by-site basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil type</emphasis></p><p>Ideally, sites should contain free-draining mineral soils and should have no requirement for additional drainage or additional fertiliser for tree growth.</p><p>However, additional nitrogen (up to 100kg/ha) may be required to promote grass growth for spring/summer grazing. This can be assessed on a site-by-site basis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Grant aid</emphasis></p><p>80pc of eligible costs can be funded. Grant rates and payment structure are paid on a fixed grant basis.</p><p>The afforestation grant is a fixed grant to cover the costs incurred in the establishment of a forest and paid exclusive of VAT. It is paid in two instalments.</p><p>The total grant available is \u20ac6,220.</p><p>Premiums will be paid for five years and will cover the cost of maintenance only and range from \u20ac645-660.</p><p>    Meet the farmers behind some of Northern Ireland's tastiest farm businesses</p><p>    Why relentless price rises might not be good news for all farmers</p><p>    See inside the stylish \u20ac2.75m retro-period mansion on 46ac on the shores of Lough Swilly</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CORKAN-41680570</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CORKAN2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65HN-CC51-JCRS-G1XR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304299</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1309\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 INM plc All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Corkman (Ireland)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40452\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 24, 2022</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001000</classCode><className>LAND USE PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001000</classCode><className>LAND USE PLANNING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00097CA</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

This is supposed to benefit both enterprises and improve the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are examples in Ireland of silvopasture, which combines livestock and trees, but I am not aware of any silvoarable, where rows of trees are planted in fields growing combinable crops.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a silvoarable field, the trees provide wildlife corridors for birds, insects and mammals, food and shelter for pollinators and add huge diversity to monocropped fields.</p><p>They can mop up surplus nutrients, which could otherwise end up in rivers, and they build up lots of carbon. The arable crop benefits from this diversity through natural control of damaging insects, availability of pollinators, more diverse soil biology, shelter from the trees and possibly better water regulation.</p><p>On the other hand, shading, drought, bird damage and control of grass weeds could be problems. Trees in agroforestry benefit from wider spacing and, with proper management, should perform as well as, or better than, in a conventional plantation.</p><p>Like most arable farmers, I know a bit about growing crops, but little or nothing about growing trees so it's not easy for me to assess the merits of agroforestry. Combine this with no local knowledge of the combination and some thorny regulatory issues and it's not an easy sell.</p><p>For instance, I use 24m tramlines and if I plant a 2.5m wide row of trees between each one, they stretch out to 26.5m, so 9pc of the body of the field is not growing an annual crop.</p><p>On my average field size of 8ha, my 24m headland tramline occupies about 25pc of the field and this reduces the uncropped area to 7pc of the field. If I want to maintain my gross margin from the field, the two enterprises together must take up that slack.</p><p>Ignoring direct payments for the moment, this income has to come from improved margin on the annual crop, margin from the trees or a combination of the two.</p><p>It is hard to accurately predict the margin from the annual crop in agroforestry, but if I assume that it can be maintained at the level of my other fields, then I need to achieve the same per-hectare margin on the area under trees.</p><p>The trees may produce income from timber, biomass and fruit and nuts, but sales will not start for a number of years, or even decades, and there are high once-off establishment costs to consider. As a crop farmer, I will need expert help to calculate these costs and returns.</p><p>Coming back to the direct payments, an agroforestry grant is available to help with establishment, but maintenance payments run out after five years, rather than the 15 years available for conventional forestry. It's not really clear to me whether the agroforestry land is permanently reclassified as 'forest land'.</p><p>Reclassification would protect the trees, but could limit eligibility for agri-environmental schemes, although recent signals are that Basic Payment Scheme payments would not be affected. Importantly, permanent forest reclassification could significantly reduce the value of arable land and a farmer's capacity to borrow.</p><p>It's also not clear whether the eventual sale of timber from agroforestry is subject to income tax or enjoys the same exemptions as conventional forestry.</p><p>Tax-free income from the sale of mature timber from agroforestry could make an attractive pension for an arable farmer. Earlier sales of biomass or other produce could provide an extra stream of income on the farm.</p><p>As well as diversifying income, agroforestry has the capacity to fulfil many of our environmental and carbon commitments in arable farming.</p><p>A lot needs to be done to see if and how it works here. Without clarity around regulations and taxation, we may never find out as nobody is going to try it.</p><p>We pride ourselves on growing great trees and great crops, so it would be a pity to miss the opportunity to see if we can do the two together.</p><p>Andrew Bergin is a tillage farmer based near Athy, Co Kildare</p><p>'As well as diversifying income, agroforestry has the capacity to fulfil many of our environmental and carbon commitments in arable farming'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Extra stream of income: There are examples of silvopasture in Ireland, which combines livestock and trees</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-171450065</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:638Y-85S1-JCBW-N2JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 3, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DO3V</classCode><className>POLLINATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRED</classCode><className>REGENERATIVE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp;

Offaly and Laois have just five and six respectively. Clare (50) and Cork (47) lead the way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The NTAS offers farmers a grant of (EURO)6,744/ ha to encourage the creation of small native forests and forests for water protection. The scheme was introduced in October last year to encourage long-term forest creation for farmers with over 3.1 million ha of land but is not suited to native forest establishments.</p><p>At the time, Minister Pippa Hackett said: \"Key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is to build confidence among farmers of the benefits of forestry as a viable option to complement their existing farm enterprises.</p><p>\"This scheme has been designed to have a straightforward approval process, which means that it is now open for new native forests to be planted before the end of 2023 under this scheme.\"</p><p>According to research published in 2022 by Teagasc and UCD, forestry cover in Ireland is 25 pc lower than the European average, with a critically low rate of afforestation.</p><p>\"It has reached a point where farmers are saying, 'if I plant trees, I'm devaluing the land'. Now that land is extremely expensive and farmers are making a lot more money at dairying and other types of farming, forestry just isn't a great option,\" explains farmer and forester Joe Barry.</p><p>\"If planted, the trees have to be there for ever - according to the new schemes, once you plant them and avail of the grants, you can't take your land out of forestry - that's one of the biggest reasons why farmers are against it.</p><p>\"Farmers basically want money from their land, it's as simple as that.\"</p><p>According to Teagasc's forestry development officer John Casey, Ireland's Forest Strategy Implementation Plan identified a number of barriers to achieving the 8,000ha annual target last year for a number of reasons.</p><p>These included competing land uses, the permanent land use change, difficulties in the administration of forestry licences and negative perceptions of forestry as a whole.</p><p>However, he finds more interest in the newly introduced scheme. Out of the 446 applications received by the Department, 311 applied for the creation of small native forests (NTA1), 34 applied for creating small native forests for water protection (NTA2) and 101 applied to plant under both.</p><p>\"At Teagasc one-to-one clinics earlier this year, there was significant interest in the NTAS,\" he says.</p><p>\"Their attraction to farmers may in part be attributed to the fact that native tree applications have historically tended to consist of relatively small areas in comparison to commercial private forests, while agroforestry is seen as a potential bridge between agriculture and forestry, which could yield both economic and environmental rewards from the farm enterprise.\"</p><p>This year, the annual budget of the Government's forestry programme was slashed from (EURO)110m to (EURO)91m. The nearly (EURO)20m fall has led to disappointment among farmers.</p><p>\"We've had historic problems going back a number of years now,\" says Padraig Stapleton, the IFA's Forestry Committee chair.</p><p>\"The backlog has been largely rectified but there's a very heavy bureaucratic burden to get licensing, road grants, and on the other side of the things, we have the ash dieback scheme and the way that has been handled.\"</p><p>\"When you look at the new scheme as a purely business decision and what a farmer has to give up\u2026 first of all, 15pc of your land goes to biodiversity, and 20pc of the remaining portion has to go to broadleaves, which are a non-commercial crop.</p><p>\"Yes, you will get a 20-year premium on them but in the lifetime of a family farm, 20 years is a very short time. After that, no more income can be derived from that land.</p><p>\"Our land is all we have - no matter what we do with it, every acre is what we need to generate an income from. If you take 35pc of that away from us, you will never reach our planting targets.\"</p><p>Mr Stapleton points out that people's confidence in forestry and the industry as a whole has fallen over the last few years, with the way successive schemes were managed and how diseases affected forests.</p><p>\"It's very unfair to ask the farmers to take on that burden in the name of biodiversity,\" he says. \"If a farmer decides in the morning to plant his land, the problem with forestry is that once you sign the dotted line, it is in forestry now and forever more.</p><p>\"When you sign up to that 20-year premium, you're dictating to future generations that you decided to go into forestry and you will have to live with the consequences of my decision and no income.</p><p>\"The way the programmes are constructed will never fulfil what the government set out to do.\"</p><p>Joe Barry believes that the best solution for farmers such as himself would be to encourage people in the industry to plant commercial timber.</p><p>\"All the new schemes are stressing on planting broadleaves, and that takes us back to the old money problem again,\" he says.</p><p>\"Yes, farmers are getting money through these schemes but that's not enough incentive. I myself have loads and loads of broadleaves.</p><p>\"I love them, but I'm not stupid enough to think that I'm going to make money out of them.</p><p>\"We need to be planting more broadleaves. Oak seems to be the only one left - everything else seems to be dying of diseases.</p><p>\"Farmers should be allowed and encouraged to plant commercial timber that can be used in building. Take the Sitka spruce or the Norway spruce - these are trees that the industry needs and wants, and they all go into our housing estates, helping lock up carbon.</p><p>\"Whereas, if I plant an oak in the morning, it will be ready for harvest in about 150 years' time. So the State should plant the broadleaves and farmers should be allowed to plant commercial timber that they can make money out of - otherwise you're never benefiting off that hard work.</p><p>\"If I plant 20ac of Sitka spruce and I start off when I'm 50, in 30 years' time when I'm 80, I can harvest the fields and I can get back a couple of thousand euro at least. That's attractive.</p><p>\"Whereas, with broadleaves, even my grandchildren might not see the returns.\"</p><p>Manus Crowley, director of Enfor, an organisation that supports the sustainable management of forests, says Forest Type 10 (FT10) - an afforestation grant which aims to create continuous cover forestry (CCF) has found great interand est among farmers. \"I think there's huge interest in agro-forestry and native woodlands among foresters,\" he says. \"The FT10, which is a mixed commercial CCF-type woodland, has people really interested. \"But I think it's too early to tell what people's interest in forestry will look like since many of these schemes are so new.</p><p>\"I wouldn't use the NTAS scheme as a barometer for people's interest in forestry because it's more of an environmental scheme for planting tiny woodlands.</p><p>\"That said, the incentives for it are brilliant it's really easy to get approval under it. I think it should be bigger - people will be more interested in planting then.\"</p><p>Mr Crowley, who is a forester himself based in Kilkenny, has been busy with afforestation work covering a number of counties from Leitrim to Waterford and Clare.</p><p>\"We are out the door with work,\" he says. \"I think farmers are definitely interested in planting. \"I'm not sure why that idea (that they are not interested) is being perpetuated. Maybe relative to 25 years ago when we were planting 15,000ha a year, we are way behind that.</p><p>\"But you have to give it a little bit more of time, the programme is only one year old.</p><p>\"The problem with forestry is not any of that - it's the fact that it lost any credibility between the time of 2018 to 2021 when all the licensing difficulties arose with landowners.</p><p>\"The amount of money offered to farmers in the name of afforestation is massive now, so it's not just about money.</p><p>\"The only glaring difficulty from my perspective is that the bureaucratic process is still relatively slow, and there's a lot of third party intervention and slow ecological tests. Approval can take anywhere from two months to 14 months.\"</p><p>'Farmers are saying, 'if I plant trees, I'm devaluing the land'. Now that farmers are making a lot more money at dairying and other types of farming, forestry just isn't a great option'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>'Despite a series of measures aimed at changing Ireland's forestry cover being introduced over the years, farmers have been reluctant to plant more trees' Photo: Roger JonesAfforestation work has been successful in some parts of Ireland.

So I find myself smack bang in the middle of that oh-so-familiar forecast: southerly winds reaching gale force 8 on Irish coastal waters from Carnsore Point to Mizen Head to Erris Head. The clouds hang low and threaten to bring the curtain down on the sea view. Too forceful for surfing but too grim to stay indoors, with the sound of the wind as it whistles around the house, we turn our backs on the Atlantic Ocean and head inland, hoping lakes and trees can offer a bit of respite from the storm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And so we find ourselves in Glanteenassig, from Gleann T\u00ed an Easaigh, the valley of the waterfalls, an expansive 450-hectare wood nestled in the Slieve Mish mountains. It feels remote and out of this world, but it is just a few kilometres from Castlegregory, with views of Brandon Bay, Tralee Bay and the Maharees.</p><p>We take the wooden boardwalk loop around Lough Caum, a deep glacial lake with wild brown trout and European eel, and down the side of the mountain, waterfalls cascade like streams of liquid mercury. The pathway developed by Coillte is unobtrusive; the wooden railings melt into the surroundings. </p><p>All around us is colour: from the boulders of red sandstone to the trumpet-shaped honeysuckle, flushed orange, at the water s edge; rowan trees adorned with vermilion berries; and the creamy green colour of the insect-devouring butterwort, a hairy little plant whose pointed leaves unite to form a star shape.</p><p>From the 1950s onwards, swathes of lodgepole pine and Sitka spruce were planted here for timber production. But in recent years, Coillte has felled trees and left some spaces to nature. Nestled in these patches are birch, alder and holly. Although completely outnumbered, it s striking how they give shape and diversity to the broader landscape.</p><p>This is what Imogen Rabone speaks about when she emphasises the value of including native trees in these in-between, easily forgotten areas, be it the wilds of Kerry, schools in inner-city Cork, or urban parks in Dublin. Since 2013, Rabone has founded the Trees on the Land initiative, which has planted three million young trees across the island of Ireland.</p><p>From a farm in Hertfordshire in the UK, Rabone first noticed that the  big old trees  were missing from the Irish countryside during her years studying and working in Dublin. </p><p> She felt an urgency to find a way to help people include trees in the landscape. It culminated in a decision one wild winter night as she was driving from Dublin to Coleraine when she lost her way and decided to pull into a gateway at the side of a road to look at a map. As she looked up, she noticed two enormous oak trees on either side of the gateposts   the very thing she felt was rapidly disappearing. It was there she decided to set up a tree-planting project.</p><p>And so, Trees on the Land was born. Free native trees are available to schools, colleges, community projects, farms and smallholdings, with a small charge   starting at EUR 1 per tree   for anyone with a private garden. Rabone doesn t buy or rent land but works with people who already own land or are part of a community that cares for space. The funding comes almost entirely from business sponsorship and donations, which gives her team flexibility to create a variety of schemes to suit nearly everyone   from those who can plant one tree to a farmer who needs 10,000 native saplings.</p><p>In the last few years, she s seen a massive increase in businesses wanting to do something for nature in their local area   from small enterprises such as Foley s  Plumbing, who have planted 100 trees every year near their area  in Cork, to major multinationals such as Microsoft, which funded 20,000 trees to be planted in local schools, sports clubs, Peamount Hospital and community centres in southwest Dublin.</p><p>From her base in Herefordshire, on the Welsh border, together with a team of seven, she works with several Irish nurseries to source the trees. For the main planting projects, the trees are grown in Ireland from Irish seed; the exception is for a small number of agroforestry and specialist orchard projects that use non-native or naturalised trees. </p><p>She recently worked with arable farmers in Tipperary, Carlow and Kildare as part of an EU-funded project to design flagship sites for farmers to show how trees can be grown with crops to provide an income while helping nature and carbon sequestration.</p><p>Back in Glanteenassig, I search in vain for the handsome Kerry Slug, a juicy dark mollusc with splashes of cream on its back, which only likes this part of the country. A perfectly formed young frog appears on the path and jumps into a damp patch. Between the white stumps of the felled coniferous trees, I spot a small birch, ready to make the  open ground its new home.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21220973</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CT4-58W1-DYS1-0059-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"802\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 24, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZJS</classCode><className>FISHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001021</classCode><className>GLACIERS &amp; ICEBERGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009P2M</classCode><className>URBAN SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>N113110CC</classCode><className>TIMBER TRACT OPERATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009P2M</classCode><className>URBAN SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2L6</classCode><className>ATLANTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The compensation was to support site care with a variety of options such as agroforestry, which is trees that are spaced out so that livestock could move through them.</p><p>When asked about the low levels of participation in previous compensation schemes, the Minister said it was important for farmers to engage with the system.</p><p>\"The first stage for any farmer interested in this, if they haven't already engaged with the reconstitution schemes that have been available and currently are available, is to engage with that first stage.Advertisement</p><p>\"They need to have completed the reconstitution part of the scheme, and then they can avail of this.

Ancillary works including parking, access, rain harvesting barrels, fencing, and a small bridge were all proposed too.</p><p>However, planners at Cork City Hall have blocked the scheme.</p><p>In the decision order, it is noted that the site forms part of an ecological corridor along the Glen River and includes habitats that support protected species.</p><p>Planners say they are not satisfied that the proposed development would not have a negative impact on these species, which include otters.</p><p>* Plans by the HSE to fully convert a former Cork hotel and golf resort into a community nursing unit have been approved.</p><p>Planners at Cork City Council have greenlit the application, which focused on the former Blarney Hotel and Golf Resort.</p><p>It comes after a lengthy planning process, including a request for further information amid concerns over the location of the development. The plan involves the retention of extensions and alterations to the former hotel, and the change of use of the former hotel into a community nursing unit.</p><p>The development made provisions for connections to public water mains and public sewers.</p><p>* A developer is seeking permission to build 16 new apartments in Grange, Cork City.</p><p>Authentic Homes Ltd has lodged an application for works at the former Grange Stores site in Grange. If approved, it would see an existing single-storey detached building, formerly part off-licence and part dwelling, demolished.</p><p>In its place, a four-storey residential building including some 16 apartments would be built.</p><p>* West Cork Distillers has applied for permission for a series of works at its Skibbereen operation.</p><p>Located at the Fastnet Industrial Estate, the proposals include the addition of 28 parking spaces, the change of use of one structure from visitor centre to distiller, and the retention of first-floor offices and staff welfare areas in the distillery building.</p><p>It is also seeking permission to construct a new 60 tonne gas tank to replace an existing 30 tonne tank, two 40-foot containers for water treatment, and a new workshop building.</p><p>* Planning has been granted for the construction of a new 10-storey office building in Little Island, Cork.

BUT THEY NEED HELP</nitf:hl1><nitf:hl2>Comment: This week's alarming statistics demonstrate that climate denial is out of the question for leaders, big business and consumers alike</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest climate change predictions for Ireland   with temperatures no higher than 10 degrees in summer, and as low as -15 in winter   would have a disastrous impact on agriculture. A climate similar to Iceland s would make it impossible to grow vegetables such as potatoes and carrots, which means that food prices will soar.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest research from Irish and international climate experts shows that Europe is warming twice as fast as the global average. The melting Arctic ice is causing sea levels to rise and this disrupts the main Atlantic current that makes Ireland s climate temperate. Coastal communities are already feeling the impact of extreme weather patterns. Our vulnerability to climate disruption was evident in 2023, the warmest year on record, when a severe marine heatwave caused damaging flash floods.</p><p>Last week s landslide in Papua New Guinea   caused by extraordinary rainfall   killed 2,000 people. Could such a catastrophe happen in Ireland? In February, Dublin was named as one of 36 major cities most at risk from rising sea levels and flooding.</p><p>Then there is worsening air turbulence. One person died and more than 70 people were injured recently on a Singapore Airlines flight because of severe air turbulence and just days later eight people were taken to hospital here after a flight from Doha to Dublin experienced turbulence. Studies have found that this problem increased by 55 per cent over the North Atlantic between 1979 and 2020.</p><p>Our decarbonisation efforts need to be scaled up, and, with the predicted changes to our weather conditions, our adaptation plans. We must stop burning fossil fuels and make the transition to renewable energy sources. But there is one big problem: planning laws.</p><p>Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan believes that Ireland can address climate challenges, but emphasises the need for significant changes in planning legislation to expedite wind energy development   the timelines for planning and delivering offshore and land-based wind farms are too long.</p><p>The State of the Climate in Europe report for 2023 highlights rising temperatures, unprecedented glacier melt, low precipitation and more wildfires. However, the report also stresses the potential for renewable energy development. Ireland s Climate Action Plan 2021 outlines a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51 per cent by 2030, with a goal of generating five gigawatts of offshore wind power by that year. Achieving this target would significantly enhance our renewable energy supply, powering millions of homes and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. In May 2023, four projects were awarded contracts and are expected to provide three gigawatts once operational. However, this will not be enough to meet the target.</p><p>Farming and agriculture play a significant role in climate change, both by contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and being affected by climate shifts. Our beef and dairy herds release greenhouse gases, leading to global warming, which in turn alters weather patterns, growing seasons and crop productivity. Climate change impacts precipitation, causing water shortages, droughts and flooding, while unsustainable farming practices degrade soil health and diminish carbon storage. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns threaten crop yields and food security. Additionally, climate change extends the range of pests and increases extreme weather events, damaging crops and infrastructure.</p><p>Implementing sustainable practices such as crop rotation, conservation tillage, agroforestry and organic farming can help mitigate these impacts. Government support through incentives and research is essential for building a sustainable and resilient food system. Farmers have the power to drive the necessary changes to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensuring a sustainable agricultural future in Ireland.</p><p> But is not just farmers that must prioritise climate change. A major challenge in tackling this crisis is persuading everyone that there is a direct link between their daily activities and climate change. We don t have to be passive, or fatalistic   we can tackle the problem. But we need to believe what the scientists tell us. Climate denial is now out of the question   for leaders in politics, business and agriculture. And people at home. Better communication is a matter of urgency.</p><p>As citizens we need to recognise that our daily actions, consumption, behaviour have an impact not only on us, but on Ireland and the world. We can make small changes like choosing to buy local, use public transport, recycle, consume less and reduce food waste   which will have a massive impact if achieved at scale. Almost everything we do on a daily basis consumes precious energy. But we can lower energy use at home by taking shorter showers, reducing heat settings on boilers and using less water.</p><p>Climate innovation stimulates the economy. We need entrepreneurs with innovative technologies and business models to accelerate climate adaptation. Replacing fossil fuels and creating new sources   renewables   will revolutionise the economy. We must incentivise innovative smaller companies to develop solutions to transform how we provide energy, water, food and clothing to meet or even exceed climate targets. There are companies waiting to demonstrate their technologies to support climate adaptation and mitigation. However, there are few opportunities for demonstration and scaling, and planning difficulties can be a huge barrier.</p><p>This week s alarming climate statistics are also bad news for big businesses. They too need to adapt to the accelerating problem, with 80 per cent globally seeing physical climate risks to their business. However, only 27 per cent rated adaptation as a  very high priority , compared with more than double (60 per cent) for mitigation. Adaptation for the future is as important now as mitigating extreme weather in the present. Climate change will change everybody s life, everywhere, sooner or later, and we are in this together, whether we like it or not. Remember the Covid pandemic? We worked together remarkably then. We must do the same now. But we need to get our act together. Fast.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Prof Fiona Regan is Director  of the DCU Water Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21012745</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C56-KY11-DYS1-0404-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1041\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 1, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00025ZB</classCode><className>SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>C6L (SGX)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000629</classCode><className>ENTREPRENEURSHIP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

If the prices are not good, then we have to change to other crops.</p><p>\"If after harvesting, you sell everything and you're still in the same place, it's very hard for you to continue in the business.\"</p><p>Farmers also say young people are moving away to find easier work, meaning the future of their way of life is even more uncertain.</p><p>On the emotional impact of these challenges, farmer Fernando Gutierrez, 48, said: \"You feel like something is dying and you can't avoid it.\"</p><p>Jorge Marino, a 63-yearold farmer in the Siberia township, said: \"If there is a day that we don't produce any more coffee, we will suffer in our spirits because that is what we know how to do, what we learned from our parents, our grandparents and it's our way of living.</p><p>\"I will be heartbroken if we can't do that anymore.\"</p><p>The farmers are part of the Red Ecolsierra association, a Fairtrade organic co-operative that unites more than 400 farming families.</p><p>The organisation has been using Fairtrade Premium payments to help farmers invest in \"agroforestry\" systems, which involves planting a variety of trees among the crops to provide shade, bolster biodiversity and improve the soil as a way to save future production.</p><p>Red Ecolsierra is introducing soil-friendly bioproducts, conservation projects, selling carbon credits, carrying out a wastewater decontamination project, providing member training and funding children's education.</p><p>More widely, Red Ecolsierra has invested in infrastructure to improve farmers' access to international markets, building an administrative headquarters in the port city of Santa Marta, setting up convenient coffee drop-off centres and launching a roasting business.</p><p>The organisation now exports its own coffee directly, meaning it shortens the supply chain and retains more value for the farmers.</p><p>Fairtrade campaigners are calling on consumers and retailers to buy products that better support farmers and workers on the front lines of the climate crisis as it marks its 30th birthday on Monday.</p><p>Fairtrade Foundation chief executive Mike Gidney said: \"Of course, there is still so much to be done.</p><p>\"Our world is perhaps more dangerous now than it was 30 years ago: the climate crisis, global insecurity, rising costs and long-term low pricing continue to threaten farmers' futures.

In contrast to any of the crops we actually grow here, prices for cocoa and sugar are both rising. Sugar price has increased by about 20pc in the last year, largely down to weather in Brazil, but cocoa's rise is more dramatic and complicated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sugar is an annual crop and the old saying that the cure for high prices is high prices applies to it, as this year's prices will increase the area planted next year and prices will fall again. Cocoa beans are harvested from a tree that lives for 100 years so the crop cannot respond easily to market prices.</p><p>The cocoa bean is the source of cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, and it comes from equatorial regions. Ghana and Ivory Coast in west Africa account for 70pc of global cocoa production, and Indonesia for another 15pc. Most of the rest is grown in Latin America where the plant originated.</p><p>Most cocoa farmers only have a couple of hectares, often rented, and have very little scope to invest. Trees take five years after planting to produce their first crop and output declines from 30 years of age. The kind of planned replacement programme this requires is difficult for small farmers, and the Ghanaian and Ivorian governments have programmes to fund replanting, but there are still challenges.</p><p>Swollen root virus, spread by mealybugs, is rampant in cocoa trees, and infected ground cannot be replanted for five years. Environmental restrictions on deforestation limit options for planting in fresh ground so farmers often switch to alternative crops such as cassava.</p><p>El Nino has affected west Africa severely in the last year and the higher rainfall has driven fungal diseases, further reducing output.</p><p>Less fertiliser is being used due to high prices, and overall cocoa production is expected to drop by more than 10pc this year.</p><p>Lower production has coincided with a post-Covid rise in demand for chocolate and this, along with billions of hedge-fund dollars, has driven prices up by 60pc since January and 150pc in the last 12 months. If this sounds like a great time to be a cocoa farmer, the reality is more bitter.</p><p>In 2019, Ghana and Ivory Coast formed a cocoa-exporting cartel based on oil's OPEC. At the start of each harvest, a price based on the average of the previous 12 months is fixed for growers. This should allow high prices to eventually trickle down to growers, but in practice there seem to be a lot of noses in the trough and farmers are currently getting about one-quarter of the internationally traded price.</p><p>Various initiatives from buyers, environmental organisations and the European Union aim to support sustainable cocoa production but most of these are likely to further constrain production in the short term. Deforestation bans limit African production and, while there is suitable land available in Latin America, the political stability needed to promote such a longterm crop is absent in many countries. Moves to agroforestry and regenerative farming are encouraged but these can also be expected to constrain production while they are being established, and the better education being encouraged often sees fewer people going back to the grind of subsistence farming.</p><p>Cocoa prices will come back a bit when speculators have a meltdown but supply will be hard to increase. If my Easter egg costs the same as last year's, it probably contains less cocoa. It may have been replaced with cheaper ingredients like palm oil, or the egg maybe part of a fivefor-(EURO)10 supermarket deal that has nothing to do with the cost of production. Personally, I am hoping that it will simply be a lighter egg and I can enjoy a second one without any extra guilt.</p><p>Andrew Bergin is a tillage farmer based near Athy, Co Kildare</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Cocoa beans are harvested from a tree that lives for 100 years so the crop cannot respond easily to market prices.

'I was a project manager, which weirdly has very similar skills that I have carried across which are about building teams and putting the right resources in place to get the job done.</p><p>'My first degree was philosophy and English and I retrained in project management at nightm doing one year in Trinity College and three years of an MBA in what was DIT.</p><p>'But I grew up on a smallholding here in Tipperary - we had horses, we grew most of our own vegetables, we had hens and when I was very young we had cattle.'</p><p>Working for big firms with clients and design teams, Ailbhe was at the heart of the building business.</p><p>'People like Treasury Holdings would come in and say: \"We have a site we want to develop,\" so you would be helping them put together the financial applications for the banks for doing the initial development.'</p><p>But around 2007, Ailbhe started to notice a change. 'Banks had started refusing the smaller funds for getting planning done,' she says. 'I was working in a big firm with about 50 project managers and a couple of hundred quantity surveyors and I can remember saying, \"There's a crash coming\". People thought I was crazy because we were busier than ever but that was my strong feeling so I decided to re-train.'</p><p>There was something else about the industry that had been bothering Ailbhe too. 'I was becoming very uneasy about the lack of sustainability in construction,' she says. 'At that time there was no proper attention given to the careful use of resources that are non-renewable - the huge amounts of carbon in concrete and huge amounts of timber use that wasn't coming from sustainable sources. But also there was very little reuse of buildings there was a lot of knock down and rebuild.'</p><p>That wasn't the world she wanted to be in so she went to London to re-train in sustainable development, which accidentally led to her real epiphany.</p><p>'I had an opportunity to go to a climate conference in 2009 when I was studying and that absolutely opened my eyes to what was coming towards us in terms of climate. I thought then, do you know what? I need to go home and buy a farm.'</p><p>Her parents, she says, were simultaneously horrified and delighted but her knowledge of the area meant she approached someone about half a mile from her parents' home and proceeded to buy Brookfield Farm.</p><p>At 40, Ailbhe started to study organic farming, thanks to the help of a neighbour.</p><p>'I bought a conventional tillage farm, which had 15 acres of broad leaf trees which were 12 years old at that stage,' Ailbhe says. 'It runs down to Lough Derg and is a really beautiful farm and I was lucky to be able to buy it. It had been leased for decades and probably had 40 years of unbroken barley growing in the conventional system and it needed thought and a reconfiguration of what the land was going to do.</p><p>'I worked with a tillage contractor who was a very good friend of the family and gave me great advice - he said, \"Until you have done your studies, carry on with the farm the way it is for the next couple of years, I will do the contracting the ploughing and the harvesting and the making bales and you take it slowly.\" It is a completely different farm now but it was good to have that time to work it out.'</p><p>After three years of study, Brookfield Farm began to transform into grasslands and organic barley fields whose harvest is used for making beer and it has just won a contract to supply Waterford Distillery for an organic whiskey. It's a place where organic sheep graze on land that has been brought back to grass. Ailbhe learned beekeeping and has native Irish black bees who make honey for her hives. She makes candles, polishes and balms from their beeswax that she sells via the farm website.</p><p>There are experiments of growing Jerusalem artichokes and different kinds of potatoes.</p><p>But all the while Ailbhe has continued to study and learn, now teaching agriculture in Tipperary and Gurteen agricultural colleges while farming what is now 84 acres of diverse and organic land.</p><p>As someone who came into farming with a blank canvas, Ailbhe has always seen the isolation that farmers might feel and has always opened up her farm to others.</p><p>'Right from the start, because I was teaching agriculture, I felt people who are farming have a responsibility to bring society with them, to invite people in,' she says. 'From the very first year I had the farm open for walks and open days so it has always been part of educating people about what agriculture is and where we are going.'</p><p>It was through this that she started Field Exchange, a festival at which farming meets art, where artists, farmers and members of the public can meet and exchange skills and ideas, and also discuss where farming is headed or needs to go.</p><p>'I came up with the idea of applying for funding to help farmers shift their attitudes around changing farming practices. It's very scary for individual farmers to change their practices in farm- ing,' she says. 'Because I was teaching agriculture too, I am aware that farmers get very little additional education and opportunities to meet up and learn new stuff.</p><p>'When I started, I was a new entrant to farming and to me the land was a wide open thing. A lot of people who inherit farms feel it's very much closed and you do what your dad did. There's very little sense that you can do anything and that's the kind of sense that I want to bring with Field Exchange, that you can look at your land more creatively.</p><p>'The teaching has taught me an awful lot about how the agricultural system works, what farmers need and what they are not getting. The idea of Field Exchange came up as a way to bring people together as we have so few opportunities in farming to actually meet up and have discussions - not just about the price of cattle but where people are going.'</p><p>Ailbhe doesn't think farming is dying out but feels there is a lot of pressure on the type of family farming we are used to seeing.</p><p>There are issues surrounding climate change with emissions, the loss of habitat for animals, water quality and so on but she also believes there is a lot of fingerwagging and apportioning blame to individual farmers from quarters that don't actually understand what it is to work on the land.</p><p>'My feeling is that it is not individual farmers but the system they have been walked into over decades now,' she says. 'It worked very well for a few decades but it isn't working any more. That is leading to a huge amount of frustration among individual farmers and with people who live in cities and towns who are not connected with farming.</p><p>'They are frustrated because they can see what the problems are - with the water quality in Lough Neagh for instance it is really obvious there is a huge problem. Individually you are getting blamed for a systemic problem.</p><p>'I do think it is absolutely solvable but we all do have to have a different kind of conversation with each other, a different kind of discourse and a different kind of collaboration. That is what Field Exchange is designed to do.'</p><p>This year's Field Exchange has 11 farmers who are all working together for change, culminating in the festival next weekend.</p><p>It will be held on Brookfield Farm on August 31 and September 1 from 12pm to 5pm each day. It is partnering with the Irish Agroforestry Ireland Forum and the Dry Stone Wall Association of Ireland as well as internationally renowned artists Ackroyd &amp; Harvey along with designers Elements of Action. The festival will also feature a debut performance from The Company of Trees - a new music and spoken word performance by Michael James Ford and Philip Dodd and performed by Susannah De Wrixon, Michael James Ford, Kyle Hixon and the Delamaine String Quartet.</p><p>It's an intertwining of art and agriculture with renowned artists Ackroyd &amp; Harvey featuring portraits of Tipperary farmers and a tree made from a living grass canvas and will be followed by a celebratory dinner with a suckling pig from one of the farmers.</p><p>Another farmer will be flipping burgers during the day for an organic lunch, and there will be dry stone wall workshops, crafts, forestry and many discussions where everyone can come together and share knowledge on organic and sustainable agriculture practices, convened by RT\u00c9's Ella McSweeney.</p><p>For Ailbhe, the only way to move forward is together.</p><p>'I'm a very practical person, I want to present things that work and I want to change the system in a way that works and the farmers really respond to that,' she says. 'It's not someone in the city saying you need to do something differently.</p><p>'There has been an aggressiveness that has come into the discussion around environment, climate, agriculture and the rights of farmers, the rights of consumers, the rights of citizens and the rights of wildlife. We need to remove the aggression from the discussion and things need to be approached from a different angle.</p><p>'It is only when you do that work and put people in that safe space that you can have those conversations and the next step of that is, how are we going to change our practices?'</p><p>'That's where Field Exchange helps too because we have a network of extremely good sustainable farming experts in different areas and the farmers have access to these people.'</p><p>Bringing creativity back to agriculture is the tagline for the Field Exchange festival, where novices will learn how to make a dry stone wall, create leather from fish skins, and learn about how to preserve woodlands for animals. But you would have to wonder with all her work going on, why is Ailbhe so passionate about getting others onboard?</p><p>'We are all richer when we collaborate,' she says. 'We are more joyful when we can work out ways of collaborating. Coming in as a new entrant I can see agriculture with new eyes.</p><p>'I can see the problems and the potential of Irish land to grow huge amounts of food is enormous and we are not doing that. We are importing probably 90 per cent of our fruit and vegetables and our water quality is only going in the wrong direction.</p><p>'We have a biodiversity crisis and the state acknowledged this - two years ago it announced a climate biodiversity crisis. We are one of the most nature-depleted countries in the world - you wouldn't think it but we are. We have had an 80 per cent drop in butterflies this year and across Europe we have a 75 per cent drop in insects overall. We can't keep on doing that.'</p><p>What needs to happen, she says, is the putting together of a sensible plan that can fix each piece.</p><p>'Part of my farmhouse is 200 years old and it looks out onto Lough Derg where I go swimming every day,' she says. 'I was at a water quality meeting a month or so ago and a water ecologist who said to me, \"Oh yeah, Lough Derg is eutrophic. It's heavily polluted.\"</p><p>'But we can fix this. I'm looking at it every day. I love it. I swim in it every day of the year, my land runs down to it. I see this as being an easy fix with a bit of collaboration and a bit of cooperation and I've seen it working.</p><p>'For instance the Farming For Nature Network, which I'm part of, does absolutely brilliant work with farmers in different areas from the Burren to the Blackwater. And they have been able to demonstrate improvements in environment and habitat and species richness and bird life,' Ailbhe says.</p><p>'It's definitely doable.' ?

During this festive month, those of us lucky enough to be able to afford it will be splurging more on the food shop. But good luck finding an Irish organic butter. We are so proud of our dairy heritage, yet organic butter is either flown from Germany or shipped in small batches from the Ballymaloe jersey herd. It doesn t get more niche.</p><p>Mainstreaming organic dairy production can help profitable farms fix our biggest challenges in the years ahead. A transition to organic dairy can reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of the average farm by 40 per cent. These are rough figures, Teagasc organic dairy expert Joe Kelleher said in a brilliant webinar recently.</p><p>He gave clear and compelling answers to the most common questions from dairy farmers. Less than 1 per cent of Irish dairy farmers are organic producers. The reasons are both cultural and financial. Big herds have big status and big milk cheques. Changing to an organic farm system means a dairy farmer stocks fewer animals per hectare of land compared to what s called  conventional  farming.</p><p>Yet Bord Bia has found that nearly six in 10 consumers aged 18-44 are willing to pay a 15 per cent premium for organic food. The market has been growing by 9 per cent a year across Europe.</p><p>And those greenhouse gas reductions of 40 per cent? Half of them come from cutting out synthetic nitrogen fertiliser, the other half from the reduction in stock numbers. Organic dairy is a less polluting system. Animal welfare is higher. Soil life thrives, biodiversity is enhanced and our waterways run cleaner. Add in agroforestry, planting wide-spaced trees into good dairy fields, and you have a system with a potential to be carbon neutral to negative. Now that will take the shine off those fancy plant  milks .</p><p>But why should farmers be philanthropists and take a drop in their income to go organic? Here s where organic farming keeps on giving. Kelleher has run the numbers on the average farm, and found that a farmer can earn EUR 18,000 more a year by farming fewer cows organically. The milk cheque is smaller, but it is more than offset by the organic farm payment and the reduction in costs, not to mention the reduction in stress of the intensive dairy person s lifestyle. </p><p>Organic dairy is a system where taxpayers and consumers can subsidise a solution. It is the epitome of the  less but better  idea. </p><p>Like Andr\u00e9 in the old butter ad, there is something we can do to help, if more of us could put a bit of organic butter on the spuds. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20534572</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69TW-WFK1-JC8Y-80TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 9, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001265</classCode><className>ORGANIC FOODS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp;

As the climate crisis engulfs the planet, the Government has to reduce carbon emissions from every sector, and agriculture is a big one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Many farmers feel they are being targeted unfairly. The fight seems inevitable and intractable, with big industry and lobbyists all vying for power. Understanding the undeniable fact that something has to give, you would be forgiven for thinking that all farmers are stressed out and fighting for their livelihoods, but you'd be wrong.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are farmers in Ireland today peaceably going about their daily business of stewarding the land and feeding the people, and enjoying themselves while they are at it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They are not emitting greenhouse gases at a rate that will wreck our environment, so they don't have to worry about meeting targets being fought over this week in Dublin. In fact, their farms capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it in the land.</p><p>These farms don't dominate the headlines, and, curious as to why that is, I spent the day on one.</p><p>Hazel and Davi's Wicklow Farm is run by Hazel Nairn and Davi Leon on part of the Nairn family's 20-acre farm and woodlands in Ashford, Co Wicklow. Their goal is to regenerate the landscape through farming, and they produce vegetable boxes through a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme. In early 2020, they planted Ireland's first syntropic agro-forestry system: An apple, plum, hazelnut, and walnut forest.</p><p>Syntropic agroforestry is a system of farming that works with nature; syntropy means the accumulation of energy and life, and agroforestry means growing trees and shrubs amongst whatever you're farming, be that animals or crops or both. At the farm in Wicklow, they are pioneering trials for commercial syntropic agroforestry systems that will work with the Irish temperate climate and landscape. From what I saw, it's going brilliantly.</p><p>I saw the trees, already fruiting but not ready to harvest. All around them grew various fruit and vegetables, including radishes, carrots, spinach, kale, onions, potatoes, broad beans, strawberries, raspberries, currants, and rhubarb. Hazel and Davi had also planted \"service species\" including alder, poplar, and willow trees, as well as shrubs called tree lupins. Those species provide cover and, when pruned and chipped, make potent biomass to add to the soil. This keeps the fertility cycle going, and indeed the abundance of berries, fruit, and vegetables in amongst the leafy trees on a July day was stunning.</p><p>I grew up in rural Cork, and generations of my family have farmed beef, dairy, and potatoes. Hazel and Davi's Wicklow Farm looks different from what I'm used to - there is no slurry tank, no tonnes of fertiliser in huge plastic bags, no massive and costly machinery. While the fields were laid out in orderly rows, instead of one crop of a uniform height, the fields looked more like densely packed orchards. Syntropic agroforestry is new to Ireland, but it is an ancient practice developed by early farmers in the Amazon. Indigenous people grew their food in a clearing, sowing their annual plants and future tree crops together. Those dynamics - a diverse landscape with many layers of plants all taking turns in harvesting the sunlight - inspired the system thriving today. Farmers love this system because within a few years it is p ossible to make a closed loop of productivity, eventually not needing to add anything from the outside.</p><p>Ernst G\u00f6tsch is a Swiss farmer who moved to Bahia, Brazil, in the early 1980s and developed syntropic agroforestry on 400 hectares of land there. G\u00f6tsch restored the composition of highly acidic soil (initially with a pH of 3) to one of the most productive cocoa farms in the country. His farm is one of the most biodiverse stretches of Atlantic Forest, and he did this without using chemicals like fertilizers or pesticides. He is recognised as a leader in the field (sorry!) by scientists, researchers, and farmers who have studied and implemented his techniques. Syntropic agriculture systems can produce an estimated 60 to 80 tonnes of food per hectare. Now, as you'd expect, these would be intensively managed systems, but isn't that fantastic? Not only could they achieve such high food production levels, but they would do it while sustaining biodiversity and sequestering carbon. At a dark time for many farmers, with increasing pressure from all sides, syntropic agroforestry is a bright spot that offers a potential paradigm shift. Researchers from the International Institute for Sustainability report, \"Overall, it is widely recognized that agroforestry systems increase resource use efficiency, contribute to biodiversity conservation and enhance ecosystem services provision. Agroforestry is also recognized as an alternative for improving food security and nutrition, as it increases agrobiodiversity and food production, contributing to poverty alleviation and enhancing human well-being.\"</p><p>That last part, about human well-being, is huge. As the beef and dairy farmers duke it out with the government over emissions, it's vital to remember that traditional farming is a tough job, often unpredictable and lonely. David Christian Rose is an expert on mental health and well-being in agriculture who works at Reading University. In May this year, he spoke at a conference organised by Teagasc, the Agriculture and Food Development Authority, noting, \"Farmers face a unique set of acute and chronic stressors including farm bureaucracy, climatic conditions, animal and crop disease outbreaks, time pressures, workplace hazards, rural crime, finance, isolation, machinery breakdowns, and media criticism.\"</p><p>It's just as vital to remember that farming does not need to stay this way. A just transition from carbon-intensive farming to new systems is essential for the environment and also for farmers. Here too, is where community-supported agriculture and syntropic agroforestry shine because this is not something you can do on your own. The typical model of a lone farmer in a tractor for hours on end is not in play at Hazel and Davi's farm. The farm has a busy, sociable feel, with neighbours volunteering to help plant woodlands, and people dropping by to pick up food and see how the trees are coming along. Having a more abundant landscape will depend on more people joining in, and not leaving it to a tiny percentage of the population to manage most of the land.</p><p>When I visited, Davi and Hazel were hosting a weeklong syntropic agroforestry workshop with Brazilian farmer and consultant Felipe Amato.</p><p>There were around 15 people from all over Ireland, learning the principles of the system and practising it too, planting new rows of plum, apple, and pear trees alongside strawberries, potatoes, kale, and all the support species too. The workshop was part-funded by National Organic Training Skillnet, and the participants were keen to implement the system on their own land, whether that was a garden in Cabra or a farm in Cavan. As the fight about emissions continues, bear in mind that farming isn't the problem when it's done right. And when farming is done really right? It can be the solution.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hazel Nairn and Davi Leon's goal is to regenerate the landscape through farming.

The dangers of working the extremely steep hills have always been on his and his wife Aoife's mind.</p><p>\"When I started driving a tractor down here - I was in my 30s and competent,\" he says.</p><p>\"Our boy is more passionate about farming than probably I ever was.</p><p>When he gets to 16 and is able to drive a tractor, there's a danger he's going to be in parts of the farm where he shouldn't be.</p><p>Security \"From a security point of view at his age. I don't want him thinking the tractor needs to go down here. So that was a big part of it.\"</p><p>The sense of remaining 'connected' with the land was another important motivator for Miche\u00e1l and was among the reasons he decided against a more commercial forest.</p><p>\"If I just put commercial sitka spruce down here, you're sort of drawing a line under it and it will kill off underneath, like giving nothing but a dead forest and that wasn't for me,\" he says. \"I don't like the idea of the dead forest. Whereas the native deciduous trees are something we're passionate about.\"</p><p>Having secured access to the Department of Agriculture's agroforestry scheme and planning permission, Miche\u00e1l planted the trees over the past winter.</p><p>Having initially thought about engaging a forestry company to carry out this work, he decided to take on the project himself with the help of friends and family. It was a major job.</p><p>The task sounds simple: drive a stake, drill a hole, plant your tree, cover with a tree protector and drive another stake. However, it had to be repeated a 1,000 times on an inclined site where there were areas a digger couldn't access.</p><p>\"I was never afraid of hard work, and it became a nearly became like a personal challenge,\" Miche\u00e1l says, adding, however, that there were times at the start where he felt \"this is going to take years\".</p><p>As time went on, though, he says his technique improved.</p><p>\"It's a very steep site, and the digger wasn't able to drive all the poles, so many had to be put in by hand,\" he says.</p><p>\"I took holidays during January because the weather was good and then evenings after work I was down with head torches digging holes into dark night.</p><p>\"I had great help from friends and family that gave up weekends to help. It was almost like it was a neighbourhood effort.\"</p><p>In the end, 600 oak, 200 downy birch and 200 white cherry trees were planted over the course of three months of hard work.</p><p>In terms of the financial reward for the effort, Miche\u00e1l says that for him, the payback from the scheme versus his material costs were just like for like.</p><p>\"I didn't know it was going to cost me so much, but as I went through it, the fact that the grant money was there meant I was able to continue,\" he says.</p><p>\"I put in 1,000 trees at (EURO)1.50/tree that's (EURO)1,500; then put the covers around them at (EURO)2.20 per cover, that's (EURO)2,200. Then I had to put a stake in behind them, which cost (EURO)2.95 each, so that was another (EURO)3,000.</p><p>Protect \"Then just as I started, a new guideline came in that said there needed to be another stake at the front to protect the cover from an animal; that was another (EURO)2.</p><p>\"By the time I had each unit had put together, it cost (EURO)9 so it was (EURO)9000 for my project. That's just to buy the materials.\"</p><p>Asked if he would recommend agroforestry to another farmer, Miche\u00e1l says he would but adds that if they were doing it themselves, they would need to be \"100pc committed to it\".</p><p>\"If you're any way half-hearted, you wouldn't get through it,\" he says. \"You need to love what you do. You need to like planting trees and you'd want to want to do it. If it's a purely financial decision, you won't do it.\"</p><p>The O'Donovans have since invested in a small flock of sheep that will graze that land under the trees, and so far Miche\u00e1l has reported no damage to the plants.</p><p>\"For me, this is reforestation. This is staying as a forest,\" he says.</p><p>\"I want the kids to be involved because I don't want them to think in 20 years' time, the right thing to do would be to take all these trees out.</p><p>\"I want them to stay involved and see the trees stay and mature and be something long term. For me, I think my work is finished down here.\"</p><p>'If you're any way halfhearted, you wouldn't get through it. You need to love what you do. You need to like planting trees.

When sourced from properly managed woodland, wood is fully sustainable, and growing it is hugely beneficial for the broader environment.</p><p>Ireland is noted as having one of the best climates in the world for growing fast-maturing conifers - the species that our sawmills require.</p><p>Why are we not planting them?</p><p>Instead, we are muddling around with a multitude of schemes, most of which are non-commercial and therefore not viable for a farmer trying to survive and support a family.</p><p>Our broadleaf species such as oak take a century or more to mature and are difficult to sell after a wait of perhaps two lifetimes.</p><p>They should of course be grown but primarily by the state and not be forced on farmers, who must make what they grow pay.</p><p>Agroforestry is also touted as an attractive option for farmers but what happens when the canopy closes and the grass beneath dies off?</p><p>Ash is a species that could have worked within an agroforestry system but we have seen to our cost what happened to it, and we have seen the lack of support being given to farmers stuck with large tracts of diseased and dying ash trees.</p><p>We are also importing huge quantities of timber from Scotland to keep our sawmills and thereby the building industry supplied, while Irish farmers are abandoning any thought of ever planting meaningful acreages of the same conifer species.</p><p>Volumes of print have been wasted in trying to explain the reasons for this but the answers are simple.</p><p>Government and Forest Service regulations are making the various schemes both inaccessible and unworkable and what is even worse, the people in charge appear to be doing little to fix the problem.</p><p>Having spent the past 20 years engaging with our planning authorities in gaining permission for various business projects, I found the entire process reasonable and workable, and the people responsible for making such decisions helpful and efficient. The same could also be said for the earlier afforestation programmes which in 1995 delivered 25,000ha of new woodland, most of it planted by farmers.</p><p>What went wrong? At that time, you could actually talk to a forestry inspector, receive assistance and encouragement, and by following straightforward and sensible requirements, you could get planting permission and receive excellent support while carrying out the work.</p><p>The environmental guidelines were strict and sensible, as they should be, but you weren't faced with endless objections, the sole purpose of which seems to be to obstruct afforestation where ever possible.</p><p>On a brighter note, I enjoyed a tour recently of the National Botanic Gardens in Kilmacurragh, Co Wicklow, which is a satellite or perhaps a sort of out-farm of our wonderful Botanic gardens in Dublin's Glasnevin.</p><p>Over the years I have visited both frequently to learn more about silviculture and enjoy the results of the labours of past plant hunters who often risked their lives to bring many now common and valuable species to Ireland from all corners of the globe.</p><p>This outing was organised by the Irish Timber Growers Association, and it is particularly interesting to visit such places in the company of people who actually grow trees.</p><p>Joining the ITGA means you can enjoy similar outings and help with the furtherance of forestry.</p><p>That is while we still have a forest industry of sorts. The way things are going, it might not be there in the future.</p><p>Joe Barry is a farmer and forester on the Meath-Kildare border</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ireland is noted as having one of the best climates in the world for growing fast-maturing conifers - the species that our sawmills require.

It s the same habitat that wild animals need,  he said.  Trying to make a diverse and complex landscape enhances animal welfare, and everything gets easier without a doubt; my farm has become more profitable since farming this way. </p><p>Others in the farm community are more fearful of the impact the law will have, particularly in regard to peatland rewetting.</p><p>Countries will be required to have restoration measures for drained peatlands on at least 30 per cent of peatlands with a quarter of this to be rewetted by 2030, 40 per cent by 2040 (one-third to be rewetted) and 50 per cent by 2050 (also one-third to be rewetted).</p><h>Our Amazon forest  Ireland s peatlands have often been described as our Amazon forest, with a unique ability to sequester huge amounts of carbon. For example, the Irish Peatland Council has previously outlined that the relatively small 75-acre Lodge Bog, in Co Kildare, would emit the equivalent of 66,000 cars a year if it was drained.</h><p>The Green Party has stressed that rewetting would be voluntary for farmers and landowners and an  emergency brake  was written into the text to suspend temporarily targets where they would severely impact food production.</p><p>While Mr Bright acknowledges the Nature Restoration Law is a  blunt tool , he feels that the threat farmers feel is probably less than they perceive it might be. He feels there are hundreds of acres of peatland or poor land that are not being used or abandoned that would benefit from the Nature Restoration Law.</p><p>His optimism is not shared by dairy farmer Pat O Brien, who milks 70 cows and farms 60 acres in the peat heartland of Offaly. He rents an additional 60 acres that back on to a Bord na M\u00f3na bog and fears the impact that current and future rewetting projects will have on land in the area.</p><p> Bord na M\u00f3na are starting to rewet the land at the back of the land I rent at the moment and we ve looked for reassurances we won t be impacted but they re not very forthcoming. We ve contacted the Minister for Agriculture as well,  he said. He says both are confident there won t be any issues  but they seem reluctant to put it in writing .</p><p> Some 80-odd years ago when they started draining these bogs, the lands around them would have had springs or wet patches. When they were drained, all those springs dried up,  Mr O Brien said.  If rewetting happens, the bogs will swell and rise up, and when they become saturated in 10 and 20 years  time, it will act like a water tower and all those underground springs and streams will rise up again.</p><p> What we want is a guarantee that if that does happen then Bord na M\u00f3na would come as speedily as possible to fix it so that it can be farmed. We re not looking for compensation. </p><p>However, compensation or a new farmer-friendly scheme could be on the cards.</p><p>More than EUR 3 billion was earmarked for nature restoration in the most recent budget but nothing specific has been outlined in terms of how farmers or the rural community will be compensated or incentivised to meet targets.</p><p>The Green Party Minister with responsibility for nature, Malcolm Noonan, has said this will be used to help fund plans to restore nature but no specifics have been provided to farmers yet.</p><p>When it comes to bog rewetting, Bord na M\u00f3na already has a project to rewet 33,000 hectares of peatland. However, overall the semi- State company owns just 1 per cent of peatland in the country with 69 per cent in private ownership.</p><p>If 50 per cent of peatlands in the country are to have restoration measures in place by 2050, then private landowners and farmers will have to be persuaded to come on board with the Government s plans.</p><h>Meet the targets  The Government has just two years to draft a plan to meet the targets of the Nature Restoration Law, satisfy national stakeholders  concerns and gain approval from the European Commission. However, the current Government may not be in place to execute that plan. Dairy farmer Pat O Brien pointed out that all five of Fine Gael s MEPs voted in favour of the law.</h><p> The traditional farmer s parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, just abandoned farmers since we dug them out of a hole in the 1990s. We were pushed to increase output and we did,  he said.  Now we re being blamed for all the wrongs in the world in terms of nature. If there was a corner of my field with nettles and briars in it 10 years ago, I would have been penalised and had payments deducted.</p><p> Farmers will have noted that only two MEPs voted against the law and rethink who they can rely on. </p><p>But while the farm community might carefully weigh up who they vote for in the upcoming local and European elections, not all the votes will necessarily be cast according to expectations.</p><p>For beef farmer Clive Bright, the new law remains a positive step.  We re never going to win if we keep battling against nature,  he said.  Nature will always find a balance and if we can find a way to farm within that balance, then it all becomes a lot easier and the food becomes a lot better. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-20769342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BFT-DS51-DYS1-018T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1000\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 2, 2024 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000092</classCode><className>ANIMAL WELFARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001020</classCode><className>LEGISLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000697</classCode><className>FARMERS &amp; RANCHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STLL000CPD2</classCode><className>LIVESTOCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N112111MM</classCode><className>BEEF CATTLE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N112100CC</classCode><className>CATTLE RANCHING &amp; FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N112120MM</classCode><className>DAIRY FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000049</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
