Years of advocacy led to an advisory opinion from the world's highest court that states must take urgent action to prevent harm to the climate system, including by tackling fossil fuels, or face real legal consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The campaign to bring climate justice before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) began with law students from the University of the South Pacific and grew to a worldwide movement, called World's Youth for Climate Justice.</p><p>In campaigning for climate change to be brought to the world's highest court, young people called attention to the obligations that states have not to destroy the future of people and planet, and highlighted the day-to-day reality of frontline communities dealing with the existential threat posed by climate change.</p><p>Working closely with Global South states, the movement successfully achieved a vote by the UN General Assembly in 2023 (which Ireland supported) to ask the ICJ for its views of what obligations states have under international law to address climate change, and, importantly, what consequences they may face for breaching these obligations.</p><p>In a decisive victory for the youth movement, the court confirmed what young people have known all along. States' obligations to address climate change are not just confined to their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement, but encompass a broad range of international law principles, treaties, and norms that must be taken into account to address the urgent threat posed by climate change.</p><p>In particular, the court set out that states must take climate measures which reflect their \"highest possible ambition\", in accordance with the best available climate science and other considerations like intergenerational equity. This places the interests of young people - those who will inherit the consequences of today's inaction - at the very core of climate governance.</p><p>The court's opinion also affirmed the interdependence of environmental protection and human rights, stating that the right to a healthy environment is foundational to the enjoyment of all other rights. This reflects what young climate activists have long insisted: That climate inaction violates fundamental rights, deepens global inequalities, and exposes vulnerable communities to escalating hardship, displacement, and injustice.</p><p>Moreover, the court's treatment of the international environmental law principle that states should refrain from acts of transboundary harm to the environment has profound implications for climate action. The court made clear that a state's failure to fulfil its climate-related legal obligations may amount to an \"internationally wrongful act,\" triggering international responsibility and potential consequences for that state. Crucially, it affirmed that inadequate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including continued fossil fuel production, consumption, licensing, and subsidies, may all contribute to such violations. This conclusion resonates strongly with the demands of youth activists, who have persistently highlighted that fossil fuel dependence is not just an environmental hazard, but a violation of international law, and that a fair transition is a legal and ethical imperative to prevent further harm to vulnerable communities.</p><p>As the court itself noted, law is only one part of the response needed to address the climate crisis. The advisory opinion is non-binding, but, importantly, we now have clear confirmation of states' obligations to address the \"existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet\".</p><p>These obligations are not just words, they are an expression of the moral, political, and legal imperative to protect the only home we have. They add to the global call to deliver justice for communities harmed by activities which have polluted our air, endangered our health, and destroyed lives across the globe, particularly in the Global South and in vulnerable and marginalised communities.</p><p>Just as young people drove the effort to clarify states' obligations, young people can now create further change in their communities and hold states accountable to these obligations. States and decision-makers at every level must implement calls for justice from marginalised communities, particularly those in the Global South who achieved this success. This moment must mark a turning point from legal clarification to real, enforceable action. The law is clear. Youth made it clear. Now, action must be too.</p><p>* Beth Doherty is Ireland's youth climate delegate for COP29.

This was back when the public were able to call the forecasting desk directly. It had been a long, wet winter and it was still raining as we headed into summer. Across the country, the fodder was all but gone and the cows were still in the sheds, the ground untrafficable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A man from Mayo called in desperation, looking for any hope of a settling down of the weather. I wasn't able to give it to him, but I was able to listen to him.</p><p>He had a small farm. His cows were about to start calving in the sheds, and he cried as he described the distress this caused his herd.</p><p>As I write, close to 20 years on, I can feel the tears welling in my eyes as I remember his grief. Ever since that day, my feet have been firmly planted on the side of farmers.</p><p>On the Claire Byrne Show last week, Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland's former first minister, drew parallels between Margaret Thatcher's deindustrialisation of the UK and the current approaches to combat the climate change crisis on a global level.</p><p>Thatcher's closing of mines and factories paid no regard to the devastation to communities caused by the unemployment that resulted. There was no plan for retraining or alternative work. It was just a sword through the workforce.</p><p>This interview came on the same day as climate scientists criticised a proposal for taking a \"temperature neutrality\" approach to climate change. This is favoured by the Department of Agriculture here, and in other countries that export livestock, such as New Zealand.</p><p>\"Temperature neutrality\" in effect means that each country would keep their contribution to global warming stable, rather than aiming for the more onerous target of \"net zero\" emissions. In Ireland, this would allow us to offset methane emissions from our strong agricultural sector with a reduction in CO2 from burning fossil fuels, for example.</p><p>This is why countries with large livestock exports might favour this idea - but also why climate justice activists might oppose it. Developing countries would be at a disadvantage trying to get into the food production business to feed their own people.</p><p>In our house, this started a conversation about blame and deflection.</p><p>Deflection has really come into the public arena in recent times, mostly because we are seeing it being done so badly that it would be almost comical - if it weren't so unfunny.</p><p>The magician's call to \"look over here\" while they deceive you right under your nose has become the tradecraft of almost every politician operating today.</p><p>My husband stated with clear, calm fact that farmers were the biggest polluters in the Netherlands. Certainly they are vilified there for protests such as closing the motorways with their tractors.</p><p>In fairness, the Netherlands is doing well on the energy front, with up to half the country powered by renewable energy, and they have one nuclear reactor, too. But they are home to the busiest port in Europe at Rotterdam, to one of the biggest airports at Schiphol in Amsterdam, and let's not forget those eight-lane motorways that the farmers blocked with their tractors. The Netherlands is home to some of the biggest names in oil and gas - but if we're busy hating the farmers, we're not paying as much attention to what the fossil fuel industry is up to. Certainly not as much attention as we should.</p><p>When you try to find the dollar amount spent globally on subsidies to \"Big Oil\", along with the benefits from tax exemptions, the figures are mind-boggling. Tracking down the sums is nearly impossible: $10bn here, $52bn there, $760bn in \"total externalities\", whatever that is... Whatever it amounts to, we're seeing companies with so much profit it's hard to remember how many zeros are involved in taking money from taxpayers for the privilege of finding more ways to release more carbon from beneath the earth and send it into the atmosphere.</p><p>These same companies can then do their greenwashing, reporting on the millions they have invested in renewable alternatives. Billions for oil, millions for renewables.</p><p>It is true that intensive farming is a huge polluter in the Netherlands, staining the local environment with waste while using up vast amounts of power and water. But if you follow the money, it's quickly evident most of the profits from these industries go to multinational companies, not to the guys getting their hands dirty. Food production only accounts for 11pc of the overall take, with post-production - such as processing, transport and retail - hoovering up the rest.</p><p>The industrialisation of farming in this country has the potential to be an increasing blot on our landscape, too. It will cause repercussions on the climate and then the weather. Even so, I still side with the guy in the field, doing the work needed to be done to feed me.</p><p>Food prices do not reflect the cost of food production. After World War II, many populations across Europe faced starvation while countries struggled to get back on their feet. The introduction of subsidies for farmers lowered the price of food on the table and worked at the time to get countries back on their feet. The consequence today is that those same people and their descendants now demand and expect food to be cheap.</p><p>Then profits of food production are siphoned off by the corporations and processing factories, meaning that the actual people out there walking their fields 365 days a year are barely scraping a living. Small farmers are squeezed out of the sector, making room for more industrialisation, and so the wheel turns on.</p><p>Seeking a solution to climate change and emissions is not a onesize-fits-all endeavour. There must be climate justice; developing countries must be allowed to try to feed themselves - and our agricultural sector can't be turned off like a switch.</p><p>We must strongly resist creeping industrialisation of the food industry, which only benefits the rich, by supporting the farmers on the ground.</p><p>When it comes to our climate priorities, we need to produce food; we don't need to burn the limited resources that are oil and gas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SINDIR-206231209</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SINDIR2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GHH-6SW3-S7T0-F1FD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">333993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1019\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"58258\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 17, 2025</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0008WWJ</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL COMMODITY REGULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp;

It has brought consolation to states that are most vulnerable to human-induced global warming, particularly Africa and low-lying Pacific island states instrumental in having the case heard at the UN court. It is a key decision that should guide delivery of climate justice across the planet.</p><p>It is considered the clearest legal affirmation to date that cooperation among states to address climate change is not optional, but rather is a binding obligation. Governments must tackle fossil fuels, the single biggest contributor to the climate crisis. Critically, failing to prevent harm to the climate could result in them being ordered to pay reparations or other forms of restitution.</p><p>While this is an advisory opinion, it provides unprecedented legal clarity on how existing international norms apply to addressing climate change, with significant implications for fossil fuel production and transitioning to a clean energy future. Moreover, the court also found states were legally liable for the actions of the private sector and must regulate corporate activities.</p><p>According to environmental law specialists, the ruling could open the door for more litigation against corporate carbon polluters and allow for states to return to the ICJ to hold each other to account. The world s largest emitters are most liable. Within that cohort, major economies   notably the US, China, India and Russia as well as petrostates   will not be deterred by this outcome. Their attempts to justify continued fossil fuel extraction, however, have been rejected by the world s highest court. The spectre of reparations lurk around every corner for decades to come.</p><p>Fossil fuel companies, especially those recently reverting to the core activities of generating oil and gas and divesting from renewables, should take heed of this judgment as such activity will be regarded as reckless   and aggravated damages will be justified. This decision will embolden progressive countries increasingly aware that swift emissions reductions are needed to ensure a safe future for humanity.</p><p>The Irish Government, in line with its wish to be a global leader in addressing the climate crisis, should be proactive and consider enshrining the right to a healthy environment in the Constitution. And it must join others in taking concerted global action by reducing emissions, removing carbon, restoring ecosystems and building resilience for what is to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-22070539</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GCD-8NR3-RSDM-B0FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"470\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 29, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DZIF</classCode><className>REPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">Italy's highest court has ruled that a lawsuit brought by climate activists against Italian energy company Eni and its government shareholders can go ahead, in what Greenpeace said was a victory for efforts to pursue climate justice in Italy.</p><p>In an ordinance released on Monday, the Court of Cassation rejected the company's motions to dismiss the lawsuit on jurisdictional grounds and ordered the case to be heard on its merits by a Rome tribunal.</p><p>Eni said that it was greatly satisfied with the decision, and said it expected the Rome court would ultimately \"dismantle\" the climate activists' claims of responsibility.</p><p>In 2023, Greenpeace, environmental group ReCommon and a dozen Italian citizens had sued Eni and its two main government shareholders - the Italian finance ministry and development bank - seeking damages for what they said were the effects of climate change.</p><p>The plaintiffs cited their fundamental rights enshrined in the European Convention of Human Rights, as well as Italy's ratification of various international climate accords and Eni's stated commitment to reaching climate reduction targets.</p><p>The energy company and the government sought to dismiss the suit on jurisdictional and other grounds, but the Cassation court ruled that the case could go ahead.</p><p>Around the world in recent years, individuals, climate activist groups and local governments have sued energy companies and governments to try to force them to take concrete action to curb greenhouse gas emissions and compensate for losses associated with climate change.</p><p>Greenpeace and ReCommon described the ruling \"a landmark decision,\" saying it would impact current and future climate-related litigation in Italy.</p><p>They say it brings Italian courts in line with other European countries that have recognised the rights of people to try to hold fossil fuel companies accountable for global warming through lawsuits, and called the ruling itself one of the most significant in climate change litigation internationally.</p><p>\"No one, not even a colossus like Eni, can escape its responsibilities anymore,\" the groups said in a joint statement. \"Judges will finally be able to examine the merits of our case: those who pollute and contribute to the climate crisis must answer for their actions.\"</p><p>Eni said that it welcomed the ruling.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The non-binding opinion runs to more than 500 pages and is seen as a potential turning point in international climate law. </p><p>Breaching climate obligations is a wrongful act under international law, it found, while industrialised countries, notably in the western world, have an obligation to take the lead in combating climate change. </p><p>Enshrining a sustainable environment as a human right paves the way for other legal actions, including states returning to the ICJ to hold each other to account, as well as domestic lawsuits. </p><p> The consequences of climate change are severe and far-reaching: they affect both natural ecosystems and human populations. These consequences underscore the urgent and existential threat posed by climate change,  said ICJ president Yuji Iwasawa. The ICJ was instructed to rule on the issue by the United Nations in 2023, after years of campaigning by a law students in the Pacific islands and diplomacy led by Vanuatu. </p><p>During two weeks of hearings last December, representatives of vulnerable states told 15 judges a handful of countries   the world s largest greenhouse gas emitters   should be held legally responsible for the continuing impacts of climate change. </p><p>Major carbon emitters denied any legal responsibility beyond the 2015 Paris agreement on climate change.   </p><h> New era of accountability </h><p/><h>  This is the start of a new era of climate accountability at a global level,  said Danilo Garrido, legal counsel at Greenpeace International. </h><p> The ICJ advisory opinion marks a turning point for climate justice, as it has clarified, once and for all, the international climate obligations of states, and most importantly, the consequences for breaches of these obligations,  he added. </p><p> The message of the court is clear: the production, consumption and granting of licences and subsidies for fossil fuels could be breaches of international law.  </p><p>The decision also clarifies that breaches of climate obligations give rise to full reparations: including stopping harmful actions and giving financial compensation for related losses and damages. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Additional reporting: Reuters</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-22061048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBB-DMK3-RRSM-M4MF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 24, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMX</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DZIF</classCode><className>REPARATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008XMR</classCode><className>LAW &amp;

Specifically, they were asked to determine the legal obligations of states to protect the climate system and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, and the legal consequences for states that, by act or omission, caused harm to the climate system or environment.</p><p>They were assigned the task by 105 countries that backed a call at the UN General Assembly to seek legal opinion on these issues from the world's highest court.</p><p>Many cases have been taken in regional, national and transnational courts by citizens and campaign groups seeking to hold companies and countries to account for acts and omissions leading to climate harms.</p><p>Some have succeeded in getting legal rulings in their favour, if not the practical follow-up actions required. Many, however, have hit obstacles from confusion over laws, conventions and treaties untested on the issue of climate and open to conflicting interpretations.</p><p>The ICJ was asked to provide certainty on the matter for all.</p><p>After days of public hearings, submissions from dozens of countries, organisations and alliances, and months of deliberation, the judges published their advisory opinion.</p><p>It found that states have clear legal obligations beyond the sometimes limited scope of climate treaties such as the Paris Agreement and UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and that failure to deliver on them makes those states liable for reparation.</p><p>It found a healthy environment and functioning climate system were fundamental human rights.</p><p>It found that states must individually pursue climate mitigation to the highest ambitions, and collectively work to avoid harm to each other by their neglect of - or damage to - the climate system.</p><p>Ireland backed the move to seek clarity from the ICJ, but did not make a submission to the proceedings, unlike in cases before the European Court of Human Rights where lawyers for the State argued that national laws trumped international agreements and limited the obligations of countries to other nations or their people.</p><p>The Government's response to the ICJ conclusion was cautious.</p><p>\"The Government is closely reviewing and considering the ICJ's advisory opinion,\" the Department of Climate, Energy and Environment said.</p><p>\"The Government supports the clarification of the relevant principles of international law, in promoting individual and collective action of states to prevent climate change.</p><p>\"Ireland remains committed to reaching the goals of the Paris Agreement, and championing progressive global action.</p><p>\"Equity, rights-based approaches and just transition underpin our actions.\"</p><p>If the \"rights\" referred to are those strengthened by the ICJ opinion, this may signal a change in approach, but it will probably take a court case to tease out.</p><p>That could happen sooner rather than later, as there are a small number of cases coming through the Irish courts.</p><p>One is an appeal by Friends of the Irish Environment - represented by Community Law and Mediation (CLM) - against the High Court's rejection of their claim that the 2023 Climate Action Plan was insufficient to meet Ireland's emission reduction obligations.</p><p>Clodagh Daly manages CLM's centre for environmental justice. She was centrally involved in the pioneering Climate Case Ireland, which secured a Supreme Court victory on similar grounds in 2020.</p><p>She takes encouragement from the ICJ's opinion, in particular its statement that countries' emission reduction targets are not entirely at their discretion.</p><p>\"Instead, emission reduction targets must reflect the \"highest possible ambition\" and must make an \"adequate contribution\" to the achievement of the Paris Agreement temperature limit,\" she said.</p><p>\"Ireland's framework climate law [the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021] expressly refers to international law and to the Paris Agreement temperature threshold.</p><p>\"The Irish courts should be guided by this landmark opinion in assessing whether the State has complied with its legal obligations.\"</p><p>Barrister Cl\u00edona Kimber, who chairs the Climate Bar Association - a group of barristers working to better understand climate law and the role of their profession in upholding it - said the ICJ opinion was \"very significant\".</p><p>\"It's not legally binding, but it is a norm-setter.

We have built a national network of more than 140 groups and individuals to highlight climate policies that put people and planet first: that can be transformative in creating a fairer, cleaner, more sustainable future in which all women, communities, workers and countries are lifted by climate action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To date, we have collaborated with Maynooth University to develop a certificate in Community Work for a Changing Ireland for community workers and activists, and published a baseline report into Feminist Climate Justice covering six thematic areas covering care, housing, transport, food, health and a just transition. We have four active working groups and in the next phase of the project we will be rolling out a new campaign to broaden out the public discussion of what climate action looks like, and how healthy communities need to be central to the climate policies of government.</p><p>Our research has found that women and marginalised communities in Ireland are more vulnerable to climate change impacts. And that poorly-designed climate policies that fail to correct underlying inequalities only continue to exclude and marginalise these communities further.</p><p>For example, low-income communities in both urban and rural areas often experience a higher pollution burden due to the prohibitive cost of replacing fossil fuel-based heating systems like peat, coal, oil and gas with insulation and heat pumps. Petrol and diesel cars are often the only option in rural areas that are not served well by public transport and for people with disabilities or caring roles. If clean technologies are prohibitively expensive and grants are targeted at those with higher incomes, the people who often need them the most cannot benefit from them.</p><p>Socially just climate action also means delivering energy policies that support those who struggle the most with rising energy costs. This should ideally mean locally-owned renewable energy resources that deliver tangible benefits directly to the communities that host them.</p><p>In Ireland, the idea that women will be affected more than men by the climate crisis may not be obvious at first. We live in a country that claims to support equality for women. However, the reality is that women are, on average, poorer than men. They therefore have fewer resources to counter the impact of the crisis and invest in alternative, more sustainable products and solutions. Almost half of lone parents - mostly women - live in deprivation and private rented accommodation, struggling to pay rising energy costs and without access to retrofitting schemes.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unequal impacts</emphasis></h><p>Sunshine is always welcome, however highest temperature records for April were broken at 17 weather stations across Ireland - a further sign that Ireland is not immune to the phenomenon of global heating. In fact, 2024 was the first year that the Earth crossed the 1.5\u00b0C global warming threshold. Storm \u00c9owyn and recent foods are a stark reminder of Ireland's vulnerabilities. Across Europe, heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and fooding are putting a strain on people's health, livelihoods and public infrastructure.</p><p>While Ireland's average temperatures have increased in line with climate models, we don't particularly notice the slow creep of global heating ourselves, especially during summers when it seems like the sun barely shines at all. Yet subtle changes in the climate system will likely lead to more dramatic consequences over time: more extreme rainfall, more drought, more fooding. The 2023 synthesis report of the Irish Climate Change Assessment notes that, for Ireland, the consequences of global heating are likely to be profound, with more extreme weather events likely to become more frequent and more intense.</p><p>But what we often fail to recognise is the way that climate change - along with policies designed to manage and prevent climate change - often has unequal impacts. While extreme weather and policy measures will affect everyone, whether directly or indirectly, some people and communities are much more vulnerable than others.</p><p>Many other social groups are challenged by climate action policies because of their identities, for example the Traveller community, migrants or people who are dependent on jobs and sectors that are carbon intensive. We need to carefully design climate policies and investments to ensure we are responding to the needs of communities on the ground, and not to just seek the least-cost emission reductions. As a first step, the Government should collect detailed data on gender, disability and ethnicity to aid in gender, poverty and equality-proofing climate policies. It is also vital that the voices of marginalised communities are heard in climate policy decision-making.</p><p>Care work is another example of how climate and gender intersect. Most care work is carried out by women and this changes the way energy and transport services are used. A 2020 Transport Infrastructure Ireland study called 'Travelling in a Woman's Shoes' found that women rely heavily on cars to carry out caring journeys, with 95% of women outside of Dublin and 79% of women inside Dublin seeing cars as necessities. Sustainable mobility for all means putting the needs of people with disabilities and children first in the planning process and ensuring that public transport is both safe and accessible, with timetables that cater to a variety of needs beyond the typical work-home commute.</p><p>By failing to consider the lived reality of women, current climate policies are making the lives of many harder. Climate action that is only available to those who own their own homes, or who can afford to purchase an electric vehicle is more like business-as-usual than the transformation towards sustainability and equality we need. If the Government is serious about climate action it will seek to align Ireland's economic and taxation policies with those that are compatible with planetary boundaries and a safe and equal future for a l l.</p><p>* Sadhbh O'Neill is the project lead for the National Women's Council of Ireland and Community Work Ireland project.

I am not sure that the outcomes of the intersessional meetings validate this theory - I suspect closing plenary outputs will be just as dismal as those of Cops gone by - but at least here, in this venue, one is less disconnected from the world outside. The lawn that I write from is a little sterile. One can be certain here that, unlike other parts of the city, no dog has marked its territory on the grass, and though the stench of cigarette smoke is as dense as anywhere else, it lacks the distinctive scent of German beer.</p><p>In this place, the full spectrum of attendees, from negotiators in their pressed suits and lapel pins to radical youth activists, those who have fled death to their would-be murderers, sit alike in the grass, and the shade of the trees holds the weight of history. The outcome of every Cop is shaped here.</p><p>Every November, all of us pack up and head out to the Cop to negotiate on humanity's collective future, and every June, like a salmon returning to the river that spawned it, we return to the Rhine. In 20, 30 years, maybe there will be some kind of memorial here, maybe we will say, this was a place where we all came together, a kind of no man's land, where the elders of our climate justice movements held council with their cigarettes and the party delegates argued in urgent, hushed tones over overpriced filter coffee. I imagine the future will refer to this lawn in the same way that historians refer to the Christmas Truce of 1914: This is a place where we were all human together, and it changed nothing.</p><p>The topic of rivers has been a source of contention in these conferences for some time now.</p><p>Since the Dubai Cop in 2023, civil society groups have been banned from using the phrase \"from the river to the sea\" during protests inside the conference. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the only UN agency that allows protest inside the venue during the negotiations, a fact which the agency's secretariat is extremely proud of. However, in recent years, censorship of civil society during these protests has made organising and partaking in these actions feel relatively pointless. This June at the SB 62 climate meetings, the secretariat informed us that we would also not be allowed to use the phrase \"end the siege\" during these actions, an action which has been echoed by human rights organisations and other UN agencies alike, the absolute bare minimum demand of humanity.</p><p>As we sit here in our talking shop, no food or water enters Gaza. Israel kidnaps humanitarians from aid ships and Egypt has stopped activist convoys on its borders. Their contraband consists of food and water, medicine, crutches, a prosthetic arm for a child. The fist of empire closes around itself and the light of conscience grows dim. Millions of Gazans continue to starve, and within the halls of the UN we are not allowed to condemn this.</p><p>Maybe for those who have not walked these halls this comes as a surprise, though the last few years of ongoing genocide, with little intervention from the multilateral system, will have relieved many of notions they may have had about the supreme benevolence of the UN. This same distance, this discussion and negotiation and condemnation in the abstract, where human rights and justice exist only in the realms of lapel pins and sustainable development goals-themed merchandising, is another common thread that binds the Palestinian struggle and the struggle for climate justice together.</p><p>To return to my original hypothetical, I don't know that the outcomes of this conference would be improved if they were held in a nature reserve, or a forest, or on the coast of my home in West Cork, but I know that they are defined by what we see out the window. If it was not the Rhine on the other side of this fence, but the Jordan, if we stood in Congo where children are forced to mine lithium for our promised \"just transition\" (a phrase that has its roots in the climate justice movement, but has been misappropriated in this space), or in the Pacific islands where already the ocean begins to creep up to people's doors, if we stood in the midst of fire or flood or airstrike, I know that this conversation would be different.</p><p>Many of my peers here will return home to these places, many of them on flight paths that have been disrupted, because due to US and Israeli aggression, it is currently precarious to transit through Qatar, and they, like me, will try to explain what they have seen. To explain what it is to press your face up to the glass and see the individuals responsible for our global suffering - for the radical, irreversible damage to life on this planet, which will define humanity's future until we as a species cease to walk upon the earth - to feel the weight of history and the grief of knowing you can do nothing, nothing, about it.</p><p>This place where I sit now is not in Germany, it is not in Europe, it is not even truly on Earth, I write to you from another place. Abstracted, isolated from context, this wire mesh fence between us and the world, it protects us from realities that might interfere with our nitpicking over documents that nobody anywhere else in the world will ever read.</p><p>I have been attending these climate negotiations since I was 17 years old, I'm now 22, and as myself and many others have been remarking this week, the biggest change that we have seen in that time is that the coffee machine in this building now offers oat milk. We do not gather here because we believe that the UN or the neoliberal world order can save us, has any intention of saving us. We do this because it is a gathering place in which we exchange notes about how we are saving ourselves. Beneath my feet in this lawn the seeds of a new world are already planted.</p><p>As the eyes of the world turn to Cop30 this November, a conference which will undoubtedly be the most critical climate negotiation since Paris, remember that we were already here, that we have been here before. That the preparatory session for Cop30 was defined by the twin injustices of the banning of a phrase which called for humanitarian aid to enter Gaza, and the EU blocking the discussion of finance for the Global South, for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change.</p><p>We are six months into 2025, and so far the theme from the UN is that whether you deserve to live, to eat, to drink clean water, depends on where you were born.</p><p>When history comes to take down this fence and walk upon the lawn of the UN, we will not forgive, and we will not forget.</p><p>* Saoi O'Connor is a climate campaigner who has been attending these climate negotiations since they were 17 years old. They continue to be active on climate all over Europe; travelling most recently to S\u00e1pmi to protest logging with the S\u00e1mi people.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">If these climate talks took place in West Cork or Congo, would their outcome be any different, asks Saoi O'Connor</emphasis>.

Now!\"</p><p>In 2015, at the conclusion of UN talks in Paris, more than 190 countries committed to pursue efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C.</p><p>The agreement has failed to curb the growth of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Late last year, in the most recent \"Emissions Gap Report,\" which takes stock of countries' promises to tackle climate change compared with what is needed, the UN said that current climate policies will result in global warming of more than 3C above pre-industrial levels by 2100.</p><p>As campaigners seek to hold companies and governments to account, climate\u2011related litigation has intensified, with nearly 3,000 cases filed across almost 60 countries, according to June figures from London's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment.</p><p>So far, the results have been mixed.</p><p>A German court in May threw out a case between a Peruvian farmer and German energy giant, but his lawyers and environmentalists said the case, which dragged on for a decade, was still a victory for climate cases that could spur similar lawsuits.</p><p>Earlier this month, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which holds jurisdiction over 20 Latin American and Caribbean countries, said in another advisory opinion that its members must cooperate to tackle climate change.</p><p>Campaigners say the court opinion should be a turning point, even if the ruling itself is advisory.</p><p>The ruling could also make it easier for states to hold other states to account over climate issues.</p><p>Although it is theoretically possible to ignore an ICJ ruling, lawyers say countries are typically reluctant to do so.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RTENEW-1524963</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RTENEW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB6-V2G3-RTKS-0095-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">352662</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"701\"/><timeReceived>3:30 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 RTE Commercial Enterprises Ltd / Radio Telef\u00eds \u00c9ireann All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>RTE News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62422\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH </className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008ZBX</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001883</classCode><className>DECISIONS &amp;

We re talking about her work/life imbalance, the juggling of domestic and professional responsibilities that has her absurdly multitasking, barely pulling it off, always failing someone or something, always guilty. (In case you were wondering, no, the answer is not that she should stay at home in a frilly apron baking cupcakes instead of practising medicine. The answer is that adequate childcare should be available and affordable.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Something sustainable is literally something that can be held up, from the Latin  tenere  as in  tenacious . If a course of action is depleting resources faster than they are generated, causing a net loss, it s unsustainable because sooner or later there will be nothing left. Harvesting peat is the obvious local example but others would include losing weight, overwork and lack of rest.</p><p>We re used to sustainability as a buzzword around care for the environment, and often such terms feel reproachful, as if we re being told off for using too much, taking more than our share. We should buy less, throw away less, drive less, fly less. It feels as if what s sustainable for the planet is unsustainable for individuals trying to survive capitalism, as if living sustainably is another demand to do more with less. It doesn t have to be that way.</p><p>I ve always thought it s deeply unfair to position new parents like my friend at the sharp end of green scolding. Especially when space and money are tight, disposable nappies are a godsend to a household and also horrible for the environment. You can transport babies on bicycles   people do it all the time in places with safe cycling infrastructure   and you can get pushchairs on buses and trains, but in Dublin it s not easy, pleasant or reliable. Maybe let s inconvenience some oligarchs before we come for the exhausted mothers, and while we re at it provide a subsidised laundering service for cloth nappies.</p><p>Human energies also need care, which is not in opposition to but part of care for human environments. Much of our excessive consumption comes from various kinds of scarcity: time, affordable fresh food, active transport infrastructure and reliable public transport. Some people are obviously making active choices to prioritise their own egos and individual power over everyone else s health and safety (SUV drivers, I mean you), but most of us are muddling through in environments engineered to create scarcity and to direct us to solve this engineered scarcity by unsustainable consumption.</p><p> For most of us, the necessary changes must be collective and corporate. Only the well-resourced can consistently resist powerful systems as individuals. I can cycle everywhere because I live within 10km of most of the places I need or want to go, because I have a high degree of control over my own time and the immeasurable blessing of physical health. In this situation, the choice to cycle enhances and does not deplete my life. It is (most days) more of a joy than a sacrifice. It would make no sense to try to insist that people in more difficult circumstances make the same choices; better to change the circumstances.</p><p>My household s diet is based on organic and mostly Irish fruit and vegetables, delivered weekly. If everyone could eat as we do, more people would be in better health, Irish organic farming would be more sustainable and there would be shorter supply chains and less food waste. But this is possible for us because we can afford the additional cost, I have the time and knowledge to cook and none of us has allergies or intolerances. It s stupid to say that everyone should do what we do unless we also say that everyone should have what we have, which is the truly sustainable position.</p><p>And so my point is that social justice and climate justice are not in opposition. Some of the reasons for our unsustainable habits are moral failure (SUV drivers, I still mean you), but most are systemic failure, or rather the success of a system engineered to maximise profit and economic growth at the expense of humanity as well as the rest of the natural world. Sustainable behaviour involves rest, companionship and pleasure as well as separating your recycling (but protest the wanton stupidity of most food packaging) and taking the bus (protest the fact that it s late and crowded).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-22033481</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G98-JST3-RT0D-V1V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"724\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 19, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001859</classCode><className>WORK-LIFE BALANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009SFF</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N624400CC</classCode><className>CHILD CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DL5W</classCode><className>BICYCLE SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DKUD</classCode><className>BICYCLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>STX000440</classCode><className>CYCLING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DS8Y</classCode><className>DIAPERS &amp; INCONTINENCE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009SFF</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DL5W</classCode><className>BICYCLE SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DKUD</classCode><className>BICYCLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DQ6Q</classCode><className>MICROMOBILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001378</classCode><className>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001914</classCode><className>TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0008X0O</classCode><className>SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000CA1V</classCode><className>TRAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Climate catastrophe is no longer a distant threat, it is our present reality. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is manifesting as a litany of disasters from destructive wildfires reducing homes and forests to ash, to devastating storms and floods washing away livelihoods and claiming lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It s easy to understand the desperation for quick-fix solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carbon market mechanisms have long been the favourite climate  solution  among parts of the private sector in the Global North, and some governments. This is where countries or companies buy  carbon credits  from countries or communities in the Global South to offset their emissions. It sounds appealing, and those in favour argue countries or companies unable to cut their emissions in the short term can fund climate action for those bearing the brunt of the crisis.</p><p>However, the reality of carbon markets falls short of this rosy picture.</p><p>Carbon market projects almost always fail to provide any real climate benefit. Worse, they have a long history of subjecting host communities to various abuses and human rights violations. They simply do not work. And even if they could provide some relief, the idea that the benefit would somehow make ongoing emissions elsewhere acceptable as the world careers towards nearly 3 degrees of warming is indefensible.</p><p>Multiple investigations have shown most carbon markets do not represent real emission reductions. A study into Verra, a leading crediting programme, found more than 90 per cent of its rainforest offsets were  phantom credits    in other words, worthless for the climate. </p><p>Another review by Corporate Accountability and the Guardian found 39 of the top 50 projects were probably  junk . A 2024 Nature Communications study, covering about a fifth of all issued credits, found that less than 16 per cent of those credits represented real reductions in emissions.</p><p>Even when carbon markets deliver the promised climate action, most of the time the buyer uses the credit for an offset. For example, a major oil company or petrostate might claim  net zero  progress by funding a tree-planting initiative in Kenya. But while a few thousand trees are planted in the Global South, oil drilling and fossil fuel expansion continue in the Global North. The emissions aren t reduced, they re just offset on paper. The climate still loses, but the polluter gets to look green.</p><h>Abuse and displacement</h><p/><h> Some climate action may be happening, but it is in the context of emissions being allowed elsewhere   just greenwashed to look acceptable.</h><p>While many projects claim they will bring benefits to a region, including jobs or other investments, they not only have a history of failing to deliver for communities, but also have a record of violence, displacement, abuse and other injustices.</p><p>A Carbon Brief investigation has found more than 100 documented cases of harm to host communities over the past five years. Communities are displaced from their land or lose access to forest in the name of stopping deforestation, though the local community is almost never the cause of the deforestation.</p><p>Recently published ActionAid USA research, Caution Required: Protecting Communities from Carbon Markets, focuses on Kenya, which has the largest and oldest carbon projects in Africa. Many of these illustrate the problems with exaggeration of emissions avoided, carbon sequestered and uncertainty of carbon credit value as well as risks to communities.</p><p>Of the 317 carbon projects registered with voluntary carbon markets in Kenya, most are small cookstoves or water-filtration projects. While they may offer health benefits, studies show these projects often exaggerate climate impact by overstating the uptake of cookstoves and water filters   and firewood saved. Private companies and organisations that implement these projects and purchase the credits typically benefit far more than the communities.</p><p>Most of Kenya s largest carbon projects involve attempts to alter land use and control. The largest carbon credit project is the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor Project, run by Wildlife Works, a company originating in the United States. The project claims to avoid carbon emissions by protecting against deforestation, but there are serious concerns over inflated emissions baselines, unfair revenue distribution and community marginalisation. </p><p>An investigation by the Kenyan Human Rights Commission and the Dutch organisation SOMO found there was a significant pattern of sexual harassment and abuse by senior Wildlife Works employees and rangers of local women, female employees and the wives of junior male workers.</p><p>Another big project, the Northern Kenya Grasslands Carbon Project, which covers nearly two million hectares, has been praised internationally despite serious human rights concerns.</p><p>The overall experience of projects in Kenya was that they lacked legitimate, informed and prior consultation with affected communities. They were not consistently established with regard to community land rights laws and UN land tenure guidelines. Additionally,  middlemen  and technical consultants took much of the economic benefit before it reached communities.</p><p>Unfortunately, this dismal record in the Global South has not deterred interest in carbon markets or carbon credits. Buyers   typically corporations or governments under pressure to reduce emissions   are generally looking to purchase credits for carbon offsets. On the other hand, sellers   often poorer Global South governments or local communities   are generally not motivated by supposed climate benefits, but rather by the need for revenue.</p><p>Most experts agree the world will cross the 1.5-degree threshold. There is no longer enough time to decarbonise and reduce emissions before crossing the line. Every fraction of a degree of warming worsens impacts, increases devastation, and risks tipping points that collapse ecosystems and drive more climate change. Current policies put the world on track for a near three-degree rise, which would be catastrophic. Yet instead of urgent systemic change, carbon offsets offer a false solution, letting polluters claim progress without cutting emissions at source. </p><h>Calling for an end to off-sets</h><p/><h> Carbon markets persist due to the failure to date to provide adequate and quality climate finance, a key pillar of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Far too little money is flowing.</h><p>Developed countries promised $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 as a good-faith downpayment on what everyone acknowledged was a far greater need. That money was not only late, but what was provided was overwhelmingly in the form of loans, further ratcheting up debt, and double-counted development assistance.</p><p>When setting the new climate finance target at Cop29 in Baku, developed countries refused to engage in a real discussion of the scale of the need for climate finance or have a conversation about the quality of that finance. The resulting goal was a profound disappointment, with vague references to blended finance and more ambition through the private sector. This has deeply strained climate negotiations.</p><p>ActionAid is calling for an end to offsets as a climate strategy. Carbon markets are not climate finance and do not lessen the climate finance obligations of rich countries, responsible for 92 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. </p><p>Instead of false promises, we need real solutions: direct emissions cut at source, progressive taxation on polluters, public climate finance that supports just transitions, and investments in renewable energy and adaptation. Climate justice means putting people and the planet before profit.</p><p>Communities are being led towards carbon markets to make up for the lack of real climate finance, all while climate impacts are increasing and climate action is becoming more urgent. Therefore, carbon markets represent a policy failure and a moral failure. They present a profound risk to communities that require extreme caution. Communities deserve real support, and governments need the resources to provide public services, not false promises built on continued pollution.</p><p>For those engaged in carbon markets, governments must ensure land rights and land tenure are protected and not given away as part of any carbon market project. Legal safeguards need to ensure communities are not left holding the bag for failed credits. </p><p>In the midst of a climate crisis that is wreaking havoc on the planet, the science is clear: there is no room for offsets in a 1.5-degree world. No amount of wishing or hoping for an imaginary carbon unicorn will make it true. </p><p>Rapid decarbonisation and zero deforestation is the only way to not overshoot the carbon budget. And a world in overshoot is not one we want to see.</p><p>Karol Balfe is chief executive of ActionAid Ireland</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-22077000</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GGT-TKK3-RSF1-2073-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1485\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>August 14, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DRN1</classCode><className>NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0008ZBZ</classCode><className>HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A3R8</classCode><className>CARBON OFFSETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X12</classCode><className>POLLUTION MONITORING, PREVENTION &amp;

A great party with a purpose. The Great Oven Disco Cantina is a new event at this year s All Together Now festival from July 31st to August 3rd at the Curraghmore Estate, Co Waterford, bringing together big names in food, music and art with a brilliant objective   to send a community oven to Palestine. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This new stage and tent will feature food from Tang restaurants, the sounds of Palestinian radio station Radio Alhara, sets from the global electronic music platform Mixmag and surprise Irish artists. Everyone is coming together to raise funds to support an initiative by the Great Oven to set up their first base in Palestine. </p><p>Founded by chef and TV producer James Gomez Thompson, the Great Oven is an organisation that builds giant, decorated community ovens in refugee camps, conflict zones and informal settlements. He first heard stories of community ovens as a child from his Spanish mother and grandmother. While filming a BBC series in Lebanon with Nigel Slater, he discovered similar ovens being used there. </p><p>Lebanese producer Nour Matraji shared stories of her grandmother baking bread in a community oven during the civil war, and the pair joined forces to create a community oven in Tripoli with peace-building in mind. It led to an epiphany, Gomez Thompson says,  that it shouldn t just be a thing for television, it should be an organisation that really exists . The Great Oven was born in 2019, starting in Lebanon.</p><p> It was the peak of the Syrian migrant crisis and then the Beirut port explosion. But we realised we could put ovens in refugee camps and use them for emergency disaster relief.  They wanted to offer an alternative to traditional food aid and handouts, which can be temporary and impersonal. </p><p> People need a place to cook for themselves, there s a simple dignity in the ritual of preparing your own food or sharing food,  says Gomez Thompson. </p><p>The ovens are built from steel and refractory bricks; they are generally made in the style of the country in which they are built; they have made a number of Lebanese-style Manakish ovens. They can weigh up to two tonnes, and run on gas.</p><p> A lot of people look at them and think you can just do bread, but we do everything in there. We tend to do lots of big shared tray bakes, we work with the food available. </p><p>Local artists are invited to decorate them.  The ovens become safe spaces around which culture starts flourishing too,  says Gomez Thompson.  People care more if they feel ownership.  The ovens become hubs for cooking, teaching, sharing and bringing people together. </p><p>So far, Great Oven has set up nine ovens in Lebanon and South Africa and is now expanding to Palestine, which is where one of the ovens from the Great Oven Disco Cantina at All Together Now will end up. The festival event is acting as a springboard and fundraiser for the Palestinian project, which aims to build a cultural bridge between Palestine and Ireland. </p><p>Gomez Thompson has been based in Ireland in recent years, where he says he has found a strong connection between his work and the country s outlook. He also has family connections here.  I m half Spanish, half Irish. I spent a considerable amount of my childhood here, so it s great that Ireland has become such a sanctuary for this project.  </p><p>The two decorated ovens, which are central to the Great Oven Disco Cantina event at All Together Now, have been decorated at the Irish Museum of Modern Art by Irish artists Maser and Aches. The food cooked in them at All Together Now will be from Tang, who are closing their Dublin restaurants for the weekend and sending their team to Waterford to run daily five-course banquets and an all-day barbecue. The menu has been created by Gomez Thompson and Tang chef Keith Coleman, featuring recipes from Great Oven refugee cooks. </p><p>And there will be plenty of dancing. Music has played a big role in the Great Oven s story   early on, they turned a damaged Beirut venue into a community kitchen with a dance floor, connecting with an online Palestinian station Radio Alhara. DJs from the station will play at Great Oven Disco Cantina across the weekend, and Mixmag (the UK online dance music magazine) will host Ireland s first Mixmag Lab set, which will be streamed globally.</p><p>Once the festival ends, the real journey begins and the ovens will be taken to their new homes. One will go to the Wonder Cabinet creative hub in the West Bank. The other will live at Bohemian Football Club in north Dublin where it will be central to a new programme of community events   a collaboration between Gomez Thompson and Se\u00e1n McCabe, Bohs  head of climate justice and sustainability   including dinners, pop-ups and possibly match day food, and involving local migrants and economically vulnerable people. </p><p> We want to bring everything we ve learnt in some of the hardest places in the world, and see how they can be applied here,  says Gomez Thompson.  We want to make it a safe space for people from different backgrounds to start cooking and dining together. We want to do community-building banquets, very much like what we are doing at the festival. Food is the great equaliser between people.  l </p><p>Ali Dunworth</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-22028373</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GBS-C2F3-RT3R-C4FH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 26, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp;

The momentous case opens the door for countries impacted by climate disasters to sue major emitting countries for reparations. Citizens could seek to hold governments to account for a failure to safeguard their human rights if their own or other countries fail to take adequate action to ensure a safe climate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is what the court ruled - and the global ramifications likely to flow from it:</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change breaches human rights</emphasis></h><p>The ICJ case was instigated by law students at the University of the South Pacific in Vanuatu in 2019.</p><p>They successfully launched a campaign for the court to examine two key issues: the obligations of countries to protect the climate from greenhouse gases, and the legal consequences for failing to do so.</p><p>The court found a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is essential for the enjoyment of many other human rights. As such, it found, the full enjoyment of human rights cannot be ensured without the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment.</p><p>The ruling confirms climate change is much more than a legal problem. Rather, the justices concluded, it is an \"existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet\".</p><p>Most nations have signed up to global human rights agreements such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The ICJ ruling means parties to those agreements must take measures to protect the climate system and other parts of the environment.</p><p>An advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is not legally binding. But it is an authoritative description of the state of the law and the rights of countries to seek reparations if the law is breached. As such, it carries great legal weight.</p><p>Just as climate science assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have become the gold standard for understanding the causes and impacts of climate change, the court's ruling provides a clear baseline against which to assess countries' action, or inaction, on climate change.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keep 1.5C alive</emphasis></h><p>In recent years, many states' emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement have seemed to \"settle\" at levels which would hold global temperature increases to 2C at best. But the ICJ ruled the much more ambitious 1.5C goal had become the scientifically-based consensus target under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Some countries argued that formal emissions targets should be left to the discretion of each government. However, the court found against this. Rather, each nation's targets had to be in line with - and make an adequate contribution to - the global goal of holding heating to 1.5C.</p><p>The court found each state's emissions-reduction pledges should be judged against a stringent \"due diligence\" standard. The standard takes into account each country's historical contributions to emissions, level of development, and national circumstances, among other factors.</p><p>The ruling means rich countries will be required under international law to make more ambitious emission-reduction pledges under the Paris Agreement, such as for the 2035 target under consideration by the Australian government.</p><p>The court decision also provides a measure of climate justice for small island states which have historically low emissions but face a higher risk of damage from climate change.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hold states accountable for inaction</emphasis></h><p>Because climate change is global, it is difficult, but not impossible, to attribute damage from extreme weather to the actions of any one nation or group of nations. On this question, the court said that while climate change is caused by the cumulative impact of many human activities, it is scientifically possible to determine each nation's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions.</p><p>If a nation experiences damage due to another nation, or group of nations failing to fulfil international climate obligations, the ruling means legal proceedings may be launched against the nations causing the harm. It may result in compensation or other remedies.</p><p>For small, climate-vulnerable nations such as those in the Alliance of Small Island States, this opens more legal options in their efforts to encourage high-emitting nations to properly address climate change.</p><p>Importantly, the court made clear that nations can be legally liable even if damage from climate change comes from many causes, including from the activities of private actors such as companies. That means nations cannot seek an exemption because others have contributed to the problem. They must also act to regulate companies and other entities under their jurisdiction whose activities contribute to climate change.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris Agreement quitters aren't safe</emphasis></h><p>One line of argument put to the court by Australia and other states was that climate treaties represented the only obligations to tackle climate change under international law. The court found this was not the case and that other international laws applied.</p><p>The US pulled out of the Paris Agreement earlier this year. The court's opinion means the US and other nations are still accountable for climate harms under other international laws, by which all countries are bound.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Could this lead to greater climate action</emphasis></h><p>The ICJ has produced a truly historic ruling. It will set a new baseline in terms of what countries need to do to address climate change and opens up new avenues of recourse against high-emitting states not doing enough on climate change.</p><p>* Jacqueline Peel is Professor of Law and director of the Melbourne Climate Futures at the University of Melbourne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The ICJ's ruling sets a new baseline for what countries must do to address climate change and opens new avenues of recourse against high-emitting states</emphasis>.

The presidency is not, and should not be, a political appointment. This is a post in which the incumbent is obliged to represent the views of the majority and the government of the day. The person elected must be able to represent us all at all levels, nationally and internationally, with dignity, impartiality and intelligence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">President Michael D Higgins can get away with expressing his heartfelt views at times because he has been in the post for nearly 14 years. He has earned that right. Catherine Connolly would need to trim her vocals to suit the role and I somehow doubt if she is able to do that, having already  shot her bolt  so forcefully at this stage.

Whether it was the wonderful weather or high jinks before the Oasis gig in Croke Park on Sunday, I certainly turned left in anger (on to Whitworth Road) on seeing the amount of rubbish left around the Royal Canal.</p><p>If citizens fail in their duty, litter wardens could clean up on such a day. Or event organisers should be required to have rubbish collectors on the main routes and known litter black spots before and during the gig as seen recently at Zach Bryan. There is no excuse.

Many people would turn over the first paper of the pile and have a quick look at the notices without having to buy the paper.   Yours, etc, </p><p>SEAMUS STEPHENSON,</p><p>Clontarf,</p><p>Dublin 3.</p><p>Sir,   Guilty as charged, I must confess that I am one of those unscrupulous Irish Times readers berated by Tony Corcoran ( Discerning taste , Letters, August 19th).</p><p>I regularly take a sneak preview of the paper on the shelves, but I always fold it back neatly and replace it in the second or third position in the bundle.   Yours, etc,</p><p>JOHN LEAHY,</p><p>Wilton Road, </p><p>Cork.</p><p>A break for the health service </p><p>Sir,   I recently spent my summer holiday in Ireland, and was unlucky to have an accident which resulted in a double fracture in my right arm.</p><p>Because of the injury, I was treated in five different public hospitals   Ennis, small injury clinic; Limerick, fracture clinic; Croom, surgery; Castlebar, ED; Kilkenny ED   and I would like to express my thanks for the absolutely excellent level of treatment and service that I received everywhere. An extremely high level of efficiency, and, most importantly, I was greeted and treated with kindness and empathy by everyone I met, from receptionists to porters, nurses to surgeons. </p><p>As I regularly read reports of the failings of the Irish health service, I feel it is very important to share my extremely positive experience.   Yours, etc, </p><p>SARAH IRONSIDE, </p><p>Brussels,</p><p>Belgium</p><p>Race for  the \u00c1ras</p><p>Sir,   Reading Kathy Sheridan s column ( Tony Holohan s reluctance to admit mistakes sits badly with the national mood,  Opinion, August 19th), I worry as to the idea that one man, an accomplished doctor who helped lead the country through a difficult and unprecedented crisis, might be considered unelectable given a loud minority of conspiracy theorists and nutcases, whereas another man who recklessly and unapologetically mismanaged the State, allowing the boom to become even boomer until the economy collapsed leaving scars still palpable up and down the country, should see no impediment to election.</p><p>I occasionally wonder at the leaders of certain major nations, thinking: of all the millions of people they have to choose from, is this the best they have?</p><p>An exception was Ireland over the last two presidential mandates. I fear the exception may be about to end.   Yours, etc,</p><p>JOHN F McELHONE,</p><p>Eden Road, </p><p>Rosbeg,</p><p>Co Donegal.</p><p>What s in a Norman name?</p><p>Sir,   Fintan O Toole has, in a single article ( Sinn F\u00e9in may reject commemorating the Normans, but there are some suspiciously Saxon names in its ranks,  Opinion, August 19th) successfully demolished this mythical concept of  We Irish  as being descendants of the inhabitants of an ideal world in ancient times   a world of pure Gaelic Irishness.</p><p>After waves of invasions (including that of the Vikings), we find the Normans arriving. While they directly came from Wales, they were in essence representing the French King Henry II, who ruled over most of France at the time.</p><p>After each of these invasions, we learn that the invaders  became more Irish than the Irish themselves .</p><p>Fast forward to the 20th century, and we see in our history books  unusual  names of key figures who featured centrally in the struggle for Irish freedom   Hobson, Hyde, Griffith, Spring-Rice, Childers, Lemass, de Valera, Casement, Gonne, Gore-Booth etc.</p><p>Now, we would not find such names among the Irish chieftains who were forced to submit to the Norman invaders. Rather, the families of these people came to Ireland in the centuries that followed, which demonstrates that as a people we have evolved over time to be the  Irish  we are right now.</p><p>The Normans form part of that evolution and, to borrow a familiar expression, they are  part of what we are , whether some like it or not.   Yours, etc. </p><p>EAMON O FLYNN,</p><p>Merrion Road,</p><p>Dublin 4</p><p>Sir,   Fintan O Toole ( Sinn F\u00e9in may reject commemorating the Normans, but there are some suspiciously Saxon names in its ranks,  Opinion, August 19th) makes a common mistake as regards Irish surnames. </p><p>In the 18th century in Ireland, many ordinary people did not have a surname, and, in order to give themselves a lift socially, they adopted the surname of the local landlord. </p><p>In other words, there are many people in Ireland today, sporting particular surnames, who have no genetic connection whatsoever to those surnames.   Yours, etc.</p><p>S\u00c9AMAS de BARRA,</p><p>Rathfarnham,</p><p>Dublin 14. </p><p>Sir,   Fintan O Toole s recent article ( Sinn F\u00e9in may reject commemorating the Normans, but there are some suspiciously Saxon names in its ranks,  Opinion, August 19th) reminded me of another piece in your paper a decade ago by John Grenham in the Irish Roots column on how our surnames were Anglicised. </p><p>As that article concluded:  As guides to ethnic origins, surnames in Ireland can be very treacherous indeed. </p><p>I suspect few supporters of Sinn F\u00e9in would deny the Anglo (Norman) roots of Wolfe Tone, Parnell or Pearse. Reasonable people cannot deny Mr O Toole s conclusion that the Irish, like every nation, are  a product of multiple invasions and migrations, colonisations and resistances, settlement and unsettlement .</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr O Toole should be far more hesitant to take English-sounding names like Clarke, Sands and Hughes at face value.   Yours, etc, </p><p>E\u00d3GAN \u00d3 h\u00cdCIDHE,</p><p>Brussels, </p><p>Belgium.</p><p>Carbon credits and promises </p><p>Sir,   The recent exchange between ActionAid Ireland and Verra s CEO in your newspaper ( A wolf in sheep s clothing, the false promise of carbon credits,  Science &amp; Climate, August 14th; Letters, August 20th) exposes the peculiar logic of carbon offsets: the more they fail, the louder their defenders claim they re indispensable. </p><p>Karol Balfe rightly argues that carbon markets  almost always fail to provide any real climate benefit  and amount to both a  policy failure and a moral failure . </p><p>And the evidence is damning. Independent investigations   including by the Guardian and Die Zeit   found that over 90 per cent of rainforest offsets certified by Verra were essentially worthless. </p><p>The reductions existed principally on paper. Meanwhile, offset schemes have been connected to land grabs, weakened community rights, and displacement in the Global South   hardly the marks of  climate justice .</p><p>Even the projects described as success stories do not alter the basic arithmetic. A tonne of CO2 released today is not retroactively cancelled by a promise that another tonne might, some day, be absorbed elsewhere. It is the climate policy equivalent of running up a credit-card bill and insisting one is solvent because next month s wages might cover it. Climate action cannot be reduced to accounting tricks.</p><p>Offsets provide cover for delay   allowing companies and governments to declare progress while emissions keep climbing. </p><p>This is similar to another sleight of hand recently under discussion: the  temperature neutrality target , effectively freezing Ireland s emissions at current levels rather than driving them down.</p><p>As Dr Colm Duffy of the University of Galway has warned, such an approach  seriously jeopardises the Paris Agreement s goal of limiting warming to 1.5 \u00b0C . It is not climate leadership; it is climate bookkeeping.</p><p>Every euro and ounce of political will invested in sustaining this offsets bubble is one not directed toward genuine decarbonisation: phasing out fossil fuels, enabling renewables, or supporting communities on the front line of climate change. </p><p>Until we admit that offsets   and clever new accounting targets   are part of the problem, not the solution, we will continue congratulating ourselves for what is only creative bookkeeping as the climate unravels around us.   Yours, etc,</p><p>PAUL O SHEA,</p><p>Planet before Profit CLG,</p><p>Ballycorus Road,</p><p>Shankill,</p><p>Co Dublin.</p><p>Ryanair and global warming</p><p>Sir,   Celestine O Reilly writes of her disbelief that Ryanair is set to increase the number of seats out of Ireland by 15.5 per cent this winter (Letters, August 20th) despite evidence of the impact of global warming. </p><p>Ryanair, like all businesses, responds to customer demand which clearly favours travel over climate impact, especially at such low prices (I too am guilty). Therein lies the issue. People pay lip service to the concept of dealing with climate change as long as it doesn t impact them    somebody else should do something about it .</p><p>I don t profess to have a solution to the problem, but blaming companies is an overly simplistic argument. Ultimately, people drive demand and therefore change   and solutions must start there.   Yours, etc, </p><p>SE\u00c1N DOWLING,</p><p>Timoleague,</p><p>Co Cork.</p><p>Sir,   Based on our ongoing enthusiasm for air travel, even in the face of catastrophic climate change, Ryanair are very confident that most of their extra winter seats will be booked and paid for ( Ryanair adds 600,000 seats to Irish winter schedule,  Business, August 16th). </p><p>Maximising profits is their primary aim. Why should we expect them to care about climate change, unless and until it affects their bottom line? </p><p>Michael O Leary has ample evidence that Ryanair does not need to  keep passengers happy , or to act responsibly in the face of climate change. Why bother, as long as they operate within the law and the money keeps rolling in, in ever-increasing quantities? </p><p>Celestine O Reilly (Letters, August 20th) refers to the  insanity  of pumping out increasing amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. </p><p>I agree with her, but we must accept that whenever we choose to fly with Ryanair, or any other airline for that matter, we are among the many millions who are putting their hands to that pump.   Yours, etc,</p><p>KATHERINE QUIRKE,</p><p>D\u00fan Laoghaire</p><p>Co Dublin.</p><p>Shannon pipeline and MetroLink</p><p>Sir,   Is there any chance that Michael O Leary has a twin brother? A brother who has access to a white horse, who realises that Uisce \u00c9ireann s proposed Shannon pipeline project needs to be scrapped?</p><p>The similarities between the MetroLink and Shannon pipeline projects are interesting to say the least.</p><p>The Greater Dublin Water Supply study was started by Dublin City Council in 1996, nearly 30 years ago. A feasibility study was commissioned in 2004 and the results was the  silver bullet  that was to be the Shannon pipeline.</p><p>The initial estimate for the project was EUR 700 million. This increased to EUR 1.6 billion by 2016, and in June 2024, the major projects advisory group recommended that an estimated cost of EUR 10.4 billion would be needed   EUR 10.4 billion no less, and no one has batted an eyelid. </p><p>Some EUR 67.6 million has been spent on the project between 2014 and 2024, and not a pipe laid. Serious consideration was not given to alternative solutions.</p><p>For instance, the rivers in the East   the Liffey, Slaney, Boyne and Barrow   have a combined flow three-quarters that of the Shannon and the incremental development of these, together with the proper utilisation of the Poulaphouca reservoir (Blessington Lakes), would provide the same solution at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Existing investment is being ignored and existing resources are being underutilised. The Irish taxpayer has already paid for the construction of a 22kmsq reservoir (Poulaphouca) at the Blessington Lakes for this specific purpose, to store water for summer supply when the rivers are low. So why is Poulaphouca not being used as a long-term solution? </p><p>Poulaphouca holds 190 billion litres of water and is one of the biggest reservoirs in these islands. Poulaphouca was originally intended for water supply primarily. </p><p>The greater amount of the reservoir is devoted to electricity generation, a minuscule amount of electricity in the context of the overall electricity generation of the country. This must change and water supply be given priority. Cost would be almost zero.</p><p>Thames Water in England are proposing to build a facility smaller than Poulaphouca (150 billion litres) and say it is needed to secure the supply for 15 million Londoners. Fifteen million no less!</p><p>Poulaphouca is the centre of any possible solution in any instance, so why build a pipeline? Just optimise beneficial use of the reservoir together with the rivers of the east and save the country several billion euro.

While we may not drill for oil, mine coal, or produce gas, Ireland has become a tax-friendly financial gateway for some of the most destructive industries on the planet, making us complicit in fuelling the global climate emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new report released today, titled The Hidden Truth: Ireland's Role in the Global Fossil Fuel Industry and based on research by ActionAid Ireland and Tr\u00f3caire, reveals that as of June 2024, an astonishing (EURO)31 billion in fossil fuel investments were held by Irish-based financial institutions. Even more disturbing, 91% of that investment is tied to companies actively expanding fossil fuel operations in direct defiance of international scientific consensus on the need to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>Tr\u00f3caire and ActionAid witness the unequal impact of the climate crisis in the communities we work with every day, who are on the frontlines of the climate crisis, despite contributing the least to its causes. This is a profound climate injustice. Devastating floods, storms, cyclones, droughts, famine, biodiversity loss and ecosystem breakdowns are having a disastrous impact on the lives of billions of people worldwide.<br/></p><h>Investor vs planet</h><p>Climate disasters leave a litany of human rights impacts as livelihoods are destroyed, including disproportionately harming young girls and their access to education. 12-year-old Miriam from rural Guatemala and her family had their income decimated by a recent drought, which destroyed their crops. Miriam was due to go to secondary school, an hour drive away, but her parents cannot now afford the (EURO)5 a week for the bus that would take her there.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6689751/original/?width=580&amp;version=6689751\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Fossil fuels - coal, oil, and gas - account for over 75% of global greenhouse gas emissions, and nearly 90% of carbon dioxide emissions. They are the primary driver of climate change. But for investors, they remain staggeringly profitable, both for companies and their investors. That's why billions continue to be funnelled through Ireland to the very companies accelerating planetary collapse.</p><p>Our report names some of the financial heavyweights with significant fossil fuel-related holdings domiciled in Ireland. The top three firms are: BlackRock ((EURO)18.4 billion), State Street ((EURO)4.3 billion) and Cr\u00e9dit Agricole ((EURO)2.1 billion).\u00a0</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6689756/original/?width=580&amp;version=6689756\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Ireland's status as a conduit for climate-wrecking capital is the result of deliberate policy decisions and the outcome of our Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) model and weak national and EU regulations.</p><p>The Irish government argues that financial flows are regulated under EU directives. But these frameworks are woefully inadequate. They focus on transparency and minimal incentives for greener investments, not on curbing fossil fuel financing. Even those modest rules are now under threat, as the European Commission rolls back green finance and corporate sustainability initiatives, just as global fossil fuel use and emissions reach record highs.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6689753/original/?width=580&amp;version=6689753\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Far from transitioning, the fossil fuel industry is entrenching itself, and so are its investors. Our report reveals that BlackRock, which had over (EURO)18 billion in fossil fuel investments routed through Ireland in 2024, is also pulling back on previous sustainability pledges.</p><p>There is no credible path to climate justice if financial flows to fossil fuels, including those channelled through Ireland, are not stopped. This means direct regulation of financial institutions, requiring them to adopt and implement transition plans aligned with the Paris Agreement.</p><h>Leading the way</h><p>Ireland has both a responsibility and an opportunity to lead. By ending its role as an enabler of destructive fossil fuel investments and regulating investment through a lens of human rights and environmental due diligence, we can begin to put justice and sustainability at the centre of our financial system.</p><p>Given its position as a hub for multinational financial institutions, we are calling on the Government to regulate the private financial sector to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement and end our outsized role as an enabler of fossil fuel investment. This includes prohibiting investments in projects that expand coal, oil, and gas production, as well as investments in the companies behind the expansion.</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6689749/original/?width=580&amp;version=6689749\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Ireland should also introduce a strong gender-responsive national human rights and environmental due diligence framework that contributes to a global just transition. Such a law should include the regulation of investors with respect to human rights and the environment and climate.</p><p>Globally, we should support the creation of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://fossilfueltreaty.org/\">Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty</url> to halt expansion and ensure a fair, funded global phase-out of fossil fuels. In addition, new taxes at both the EU and national levels can mobilise funds for climate justice, including wealth taxes, climate damage taxes on investors, and levies on aviation and shipping.</p><p>And we can support debt cancellation and advocate for a UN framework for sovereign debt to give countries on the frontline of the climate crisis the breathing room to address the crisis.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6689798/original/?width=580&amp;version=6689798\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Currently, the climate crisis is accelerating faster than political action to curb climate breakdown. Without urgent structural transformation, including a rapid global phase-out of fossil fuels, the world is on track for 2.6\u00b0C to 3.1\u00b0C of warming by 2100. Scientists have warned that this trajectory would be catastrophic, rendering vast regions uninhabitable.</p><p>Ireland has the power to become a leader in climate justice. We can no longer afford to look away while billions flow through our financial system into the industries destroying our planet. It's time to stop fuelling climate chaos and to start building a future that's fair and sustainable for all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Caoimhe de Barra is CEO of Tr\u00f3caire and Karol Balfe is CEO of ActionAid Ireland.

Progress reports on recycling projects, maybe news of player awareness campaigns on climate change. That sort of thing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prepare to have those preconceptions shredded.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bohs are well down the road of what might be termed mainstream green avenues. The club uses DHL's green programme to ship their jerseys. They have talked sustainability with O'Neill's. All of the vendors at Dalymount Park have moved to compostable packaging, and they work with Dublin City Council (DCC) on compostable waste and the like.</p><p>Children from schools in the nearby area designed environmental posters that have been put up on rubbish bins in the ground. And the club did a matchday audit for a home game with Shamrock Rovers last year that showed their average fan produces just 87g of waste when the Uefa norm is basically 10 times that.</p><p>\"We could improve on that 87g,\" McCabe says, \"but what's the point?\"</p><p>Eh, come again?</p><p>McCabe isn't dismissing the importance of this stuff. The point is that it amounts to the lowest of hanging fruit, that clubs shouldn't be applauded for doing any of it, and that it ultimately won't make any meaningful dent on the wider climate and sustainability crises. Bohs, he explains, see things differently to the rest of the sports sustainability community.</p><p>\"We are so far into the abyss here that a lot of the conversation really annoys me in sports sustainability because it is just rearranging the deckchairs. You can find any number of resources to see where we are going. One in particular, the [predicted] collapse of the Atlantic currents as early as this year, is genuinely some of the most scary stuff you can read.\"</p><p>So, what role does sport have in combating climate change then? \"I would argue we fundamentally don't.\"</p><p>So far so confusing, right?</p><p>Sport can't run from climate change any faster than other industries. Pitches and other infrastructure are at risk of rising sea levels and from fluctuating weather patterns. Athletes are being exposed to insufferable heat. Then there are the economic nuts and bolts that get corroded by the changes. Supply chains, transport, schedules, all of it.</p><p>Climate change means food shortages, mass migration, and displacement. That leads in turn to civil unrest and instability, geopolitical fragmentation and, if society breaks down, then sport will be the last of anyone's concerns. So, for McCabe and Bohs, it is social transformation that is the cornerstone of their climate change work.</p><p>\"That's what we see as our role here now, to walk the talk quite quickly.\"</p><p>McCabe did some sums a while back and found that 175 clubs that had made up the now-defunct European Football for Development Network were contributing 6.1m tonnes of CO2 every year. Considerable but, at the same time, a drop in the ocean. Now consider that there are 290m football fans in Europe with a footprint of 1.62bn tonnes.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big difference</emphasis></h><p>\"So this is where we change the dial. Not fan travel, or where you are getting your jerseys from. That's important stuff but ultimately meaningless in terms of the scale of the emergency we are facing... We are in a planetary emergency. How do we play to our strengths? What are our strengths? Our strengths are our fans.\"</p><p>Social transformation is one of their three core beliefs. The second is that you have to take actions that are accessible and meaningful. Uefa made a sustainability ad last year with people shutting fridge doors and turning off lights. A stadium cheered every time a woman turned down a thermostat by a degree.</p><p>Great and all, but 30% of Irish people are living in energy poverty. Some are choosing between warmth and food in the winter months. So that's one-third of the population alienated from Uefa's message straight up. Bohs don't see an awareness crisis: People know what's happening. They see an affordability crisis.</p><p>Which takes us to the third core point.</p><p>This is explained with a picture of Buenos Aires streets heaving with millions of people after Argentina's 2022 World Cup win. Transfer that communal bond into solutions for the climate crisis and you're in business, and Bohs believe that, being 100% fanowned, they can use football's economies of scale to build community wealth through climate action.</p><p>\"We think that if you can own a football club and compete against Dermot Desmond as a football community then you could own other tangible assets that could be beneficial for our community.</p><p>\"There are 3bn football fans in the world. Why in the name of jaysus would we be looking at them and wondering, 'how do we get them to use a bamboo toothbrush, or take a shorter shower and eat less hamburgers?' It's madness.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mobilising collective</emphasis></h><p>The key is in mobilising this collective, and it starts by addressing inequality.</p><p>Earlier this month, McCabe and members of the club board, staff, Dublin City Council representatives, members of the Education and Training Board Ireland, and local development partners, travelled to the Basque region in Spain to visit the Mondragon Corporation.</p><p>Set up in 1956 by Fr Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, Mondragon is an enormous network of semi-autonomous businesses across finance, industry, retail and the knowledge sectors. Each one is owned and operated by its workers while, at the same time, part of a larger, mutually-beneficial association.</p><p>Mondragon has built up 81 separate cooperatives and employs 70,000 people. It generated a profit in 2023 of  593m with revenues that have pushed past  11bn and, because of its ownership model, the area has the lowest inequality in Europe. Bohs used their links with Athletic Bilbao to get in touch.</p><p>Another trip has just been undertaken to Cleveland, Ohio, where the Evergreen Cooperative, set up in 2008 when the global recession hit, is operating under principles learned from Mondragon. Their umbrella group now boasts a laundry, a solar co-op and a green growers co-op among their operations.</p><p>This is the sort of space where Bohs sees themselves making an impact.</p><p>Dublin City Council has already adopted community wealth-building into its economic strategy for the capital city and Bohs want to be a part of that: Part of a hub that supports businesses, provides central funding, and takes back a small percentage of the money generated.</p><p>The environment and the community would benefit. And so would the club. \"For the fan-owned model to continue to exist, we have to get quite innovative about how we resource it,\" says McCabe, \"because the money [needed] in the League of Ireland is going up, it's not going down, right?\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skills programme</emphasis></h><p>They have already dipped a toe in these waters with a free eight-week Spark Skills programme teaching up to 150 members of the local community how to build solar circuits, fix bikes, and learn about energy efficiency. Sheffield United have been handed the blueprint and plan to start their own version next year.</p><p>The Phibsboro club are currently working with Uefa, Solar Power Europe, KPMG, and others on an application for European funding towards a project that, supported by a credit union, would put 500 units of free solar on their supporters' homes with fans repaying through the savings generated.</p><p>Doing it at that sort of scale would bring down the terms of the loan, improve the efficiency of installation, and create opportunities for employment. Bohs are also liaising with the Education and Training Board Ireland, thanks to a grant from SSE Electricity, to put a green apprenticeship programme in place alongside their football academy.</p><p>Young players who don't make it in football full-time - and that's the vast majority of them - would pick up a lifetime skill that offers a career in a potentially lucrative industry that would serve the environment.</p><p>So, there may be no points or trophies at play here, but the prize could hardly be greater.</p><p>\"We have a very unique opportunity here to shift an entire mindset globally because the NFL come to visit us here,\" says McCabe.</p><p>\"We've had football associations from Bulgaria, from Latvia, and football clubs from all over Europe. There is a genuine interest in what we are trying to do.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HOT TOPIC: Bohemians' head of climate justice and sustainability Sean McCabe speaking at the launch of its social impact report at the Mansion House</emphasis>.

We ve the Bubl\u00e9 CD on and we re all wearing our Christmas jumpers. Mine has a picture of Tadhg Furlong, Dan Sheehan and Andrew Porter wearing Santa hats and the words  O Scrum All Ye Faithful  on it. Sorcha has made hot chocolate for everyone and I m sitting there with my pen poised.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Johnny s like,  A focking bike! </p><p>Leo s there,  An electric guitor! </p><p>Brian goes,  A mini Ferrari! </p><p>And I m like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Go slower, goys,  because I m struggling to get it all down on paper.</p><p>But that s when Sorcha decides to put an end to the fun.</p><p>She goes,  We re not just going to throw everything down on paper as it occurs to us. We re going to write a more <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">considered</emphasis> letter to Santa this year? </p><p>The boys look at me as if to say,  Talk to your wife, will you? It sounds like she s having another one of her wobbles. </p><p>Honor goes,  Oh my God, does this have anything to do with the letter that JP and Chloe wrote last year? </p><p>Yeah, no, long story short, JP and Chloe posted little Isa s Santa letter on Instagram   it was very cute, in fairness to it   and it ended up going viral. And I remember Sorcha complaining at the time that our Santa letters had all the chorm of a ransom note, containing, as they did, nothing more than a list of demands and instructions.</p><p>Sorcha produces a small box, which it turns out contains writing paper   and not just ordinary writing paper either.</p><p> It s from a fully sustainable source!  Sorcha goes.  Meaning it was produced using virgin fibres from a Forest Stewardship Council-certified wood, adhering to the strictest environmental, social and economic standards! It s also corbon-neutral in the sense that any CO2 emissions caused by its production were offset by methods to remove it from the atmosphere! </p><p>You can almost hear the Christmas joy being sucked out of the room.</p><p>Honor s like,  I m sure you ll make sure to mention that in your Instagram post. </p><p> Also,  Sorcha goes, producing a pen,  we re going to write it using a soy-based ink, which has a far less hormful environmental impact than petroleum-based inks. </p><p> People are just going to think you re a knob,  Honor goes.</p><p>Sorcha just ignores her. She takes a page from the box and goes,  Okay, we ll stort with the address. Obviously, it s different from last year. We won t go into details about the fire. We ll just say that we re living with Grandma and Grandpa Lalor for now. Okay, here we go. I ll put  Dear Santa . Then I ll stort off by saying that we hope he and Mrs Claus are keeping well, despite the fact that the North Pole is, like, 20 degrees warmer than it was a century ago. And I ll say that you ve been very, very good boys this year. </p><p>I m there,  Again, we won t mention the fire. </p><p>She goes,  Right, what we do want for Christmas   as in, what do we, like, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">really </emphasis>want? </p><p>I m there,  Johnny mentioned a bike. </p><p> A focking bike,  Johnny goes.</p><p>I m like,  A <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">focking</emphasis> bike. I stand corrected. </p><p>Sorcha goes,  Why don t we   just for one year   ask for gifts that are slightly more, I don t know, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ethereal</emphasis>? </p><p>The three boys look at me for an explanation.</p><p>I m there,  I haven t a clue, goys. I was on the senior cup team, bear in mind? </p><p>Honor goes,  It means things that don t cost any money. </p><p>Sorcha s there,  It means spiritual things. </p><p> Oh my God,  Honor goes,  this is totally for Instagram. People will say that your children are going to grow up to hate you. </p><p>Sorcha s there,  Why don t we ask for   just as an example   peace on Earth. </p><p>I m like,  Is that not ? </p><p>Sorcha s there,  What? </p><p> Well, God s deportment?  I go.  I mean, Santa is just a dude who runs a workshop where he makes <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">toys</emphasis> all year round? </p><p> I m putting down peace on Earth,  Sorcha goes, then she writes the words.  Okay, what else? What about climate justice? </p><p> The fock is that?  Leo goes   and he s well within his rights.</p><p>I m there,  Again, Sorcha, I m wondering is climate justice maybe a bit above<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Santa s pay grade? </p><p>She s there,  I m going to ask him for a stabilisation in our emission of greenhouse gases in the short term to at least put off the global catastrophe that s coming our way. And also more windmills and solar panels for the world. Okay, what else? </p><p> A mini Ferrrari,  Brian goes.</p><p>And Sorcha s like,  Again, Brian, we re trying to think of less <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">tangible</emphasis> things? </p><p>He looks at me.</p><p>I m there,  Jesus Christ, Brian, you d a bigger vocabulary than me when you were five. </p><p> Come on, what else?  Sorcha goes.  What if we just ask Santa to keep us all safe and healthy during the coming year? </p><p>I m there,  Again, I see Santa as the boss of a humungous Amazon-type warehouse in the snowy wilds of wherever. I think we re asking a bit much from him.

The Narrow Road is a gruelling watch. It is also a strain on the eyes, with much of the action shrouded in shadow, making it often difficult to discern what is going on. That is perhaps a mercy. Much like the book, the series is a rebuttal to cinema s historic tendency to portray the second World War as a jolly jaunt in distant climes.</p><p>The moral centre of the piece is Belfast s Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. He plays the older Dorrigo Evans, a surgeon from Tasmania captured by the Japanese in Indonesia and forced to labour on the notorious Burma Death Railway. </p><p>As empathetically brought to life by Hinds, Evans is a successful doctor who reluctantly recalls his war years for a journalist. But just below the patrician surface lurks unresolved trauma. The source of that pain is made dreadfully clear in the flashbacks to the war, where the young Evans is inhabited with charismatic stoicism by Jacob Elordi. </p><p>Horror is blended with heartache through flashbacks, in which Evans embarks on an enthusiastic affair with his uncle s wife (Odessa Young) shortly before shipping out to war   and despite being engaged to his girlfriend (Olivia DeJonge). Oddly, the same plot device is central to Sebastian Faulks  first World War elegy, Birdsong. What is it about young men who are about to potentially meet their maker and the forbidden rhapsody of the love of an older woman?</p><p>Sunday nights on the BBC tend to be dedicated to superior, cosy crime or binge-worthy drama. The Narrow Road to the Deep North is something else. It s slow, difficult TV. But it is worth the effort, and Hinds has never been more commanding as a man who has left hell but knows hell will never leave him.</p><p>Mary Robinson has been a transformative figure in Irish politics   the country s first woman president, a tireless campaigner for equality and ferocious advocate for human rights.</p><p>It s a shame, then, that her life has been flattened out into a functional feel-good story by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mrs Robinson</emphasis> (RT\u00c9 One, Wednesday). The documentary, released in cinemas in 2024 and now airing on terrestrial television, has a becalmed,  eat your greens  quality and is incurious about the private person behind the public figure.</p><p>The best that can be said is that it does an efficient job tracing the broad arc of Robinson s career   from her childhood as the daughter of two doctors and the grandchild of a well-connected local lawyer in Ballina to her advocacy for women s rights as a young barrister in 1970s Dublin. </p><p>Her fearlessness in the face of power is confirmed all over again as we see her become UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and stand up to both China and the United States   only to be asked to leave the job before her term was up.</p><p>The turning point in her life, of course, was the 1990 presidential election. As the film shows, the campaign against her had a nasty edge. </p><p>One low was Charles Haughey apparatchik P\u00e1draig Flynn going on the radio and claiming that she was presenting a fake version of herself and of her having a newfound interest in her family.</p><p>However, Mrs Robinson makes the baffling decision to skirt around rival candidate Brian Lenihan s self-sabotage when he contradicted himself on television over whether he had phoned the \u00c1ras to ask president Hillery to decline to dissolve the D\u00e1il in 1982.</p><p>At the time, the  mature recollection  debacle was widely regarded as having swung the election. And yet Mrs Robinson does not mention it. Nor does it broach the whispering campaign against the president once she had taken up residency at the Phoenix Park for instance, the notorious  Big Bird  incident in which her fashion sense was mocked. There was a feeling at the time that many in Ireland wished to undermine her and could not come to terms with a woman in power. You wouldn t know it from watching Mrs Robinson.</p><p>There are contributions from celebrity admirers such as mogul Richard Branson and musician Peter Gabriel. The film isn t quite a hagiography, however. Robinson admits to bad judgment over leaving the presidency three months early to take up her job with the UN. She is embarrassed, too, over having been manipulated into vouching for the safety of Dubai s Princess Latifa.</p><p>Good on her for having the courage to acknowledge her missteps   and for her continuing advocacy for climate justice. As both a young lawyer and today as an outspoken elder stateswoman, she has always walked towards the future with dignity and courage. She deserves better than this often plodding film.</p><p>Watching the 2024 Southport riots from across the Irish Sea, there was an obvious and awful sense of history repeating. Just as the stabbing of a child in Dublin in November 2023 triggered racist violence, so the fatal attack on a dance class near Liverpool was seized upon as an excuse for carnage in the UK. Children had died, cities were burning   and British politicians appeared dazed by the scale of what had happened.</p><p>Twelve months later, Finding Neverland director Dan Reed has painstakingly and cripplingly chronicled these terrible events with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One Day in Southport</emphasis> (Channel 4,9pm). If only a filmmaker of equal stature would turn their attention to the anarchy that gripped Dublin seven months previously. Alas, we wait in vain. </p><p>He begins with a close-up on one of the survivors of the attack   a now 13-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons.</p><p> My vision was going blurry and I ran across to this guy and I said to him:  I ve been stabbed, I think I m dying,  she recalls of the brutal assault by Axel Rudakubana on the Hart Space, a community hub in Southport, a quiet seaside town 27km north of Merseyside.</p><p> I was struggling to breathe, and I saw my sister there and she was saying,  Please don t die, please don t die . </p><p>Her voice is heavy with trauma, and the viewer s heart will break for her and for the families of the three children who died: six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar, aged nine.</p><p>What happened next was, of course, shocking but not surprising. Racists, thugs and  citizen journalists  descended on Southport and whipped up hysteria against a local mosque. With police on the ground seemingly in the dark about Rudakubana, rumours that he was a Muslim immigrant began to spread. He was, in fact, born in Cardiff to a family from Rwanda, which is overwhelmingly Christian. Yet that was of little comfort to the terrified people inside the mosque in Southport.</p><p>Reed isn t interested in blaming people and wisely avoids portraying Rudakubana as some sort of interesting or complicated villain (he is now serving a 52-year murder sentence). He wants to give a voice to the victims of the attack and to understand the anger that turned town centres across Britain into a war zone.</p><p>Those on the hard right tell Reed that their protests are not about race but about working-class people.  The issues we are now fighting has changed. It ain t about race no more, it is about class,  claims Wendell Daniel, the black videographer who works with Tommy Robinson, one of Britain s most prominent far-right activists.</p><p>However, chilling footage from around Britain suggests that the 2024 protests quickly descended into mob rule, as we see when another panicking videographer rushes back to his car after thugs surround his Asian wife.</p><p>No Irish person needs to be reminded about racism in British society. Nonetheless, something has shifted since the pandemic, says Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up to Racism. Right-wing marches used to attract a certain type, he says    Billy No-Mates , middle-aged men, without friends or a purpose in life.</p><p>Now, they are increasingly joined by women and young people, says Bennett   an entire swathe of society that feels abandoned, and believes people such as Tommy Robinson claim to have the answer.</p><p>It s a terrifying thought. But then, as anyone who saw Dublin burn in November 2023 will know, it isn t really a thought at all, it s the new reality with which we are all going to have to come to terms and, sooner or later, perhaps, take a stand against. l </p><h>Ones to Watch </h><p>Rob Brydon maroons contestants in a mystery country and invites them to work out where they are in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Destination X</emphasis> (BBC One, Wednesday, 9pm)</p><p> Did Britain s most iconic royal secretly tie the knot with her groundsman?

There's an inequality in that which doesn't ring through. It devalues what we do\", he said.</p><p>Now aged 68, Damien's worries constantly about what will happen to his girls if he and his wife pass away. \"No way do I ever want my other children, to have to do what we have to do. We do it because we are parents, they don't have to do it and nor should they ever have to do it\", he said.</p><p>\"I dread when I'm another 10 years older and the girls are 40.

Over 72% have never received respite care, severely impacting their physical and mental health. Moreover, more than 15,000 children face unacceptable delays, often over a year, for essential assessments and therapeutic supports.</p><p>She said family carers save the state over (EURO)20 billion each year, and Budget 2026 presents a \"vital opportunity\" to deliver on their election promises and support family carers.</p><p>Aisling McEniffe said she has also had to fight every day to access the care needed for her son Jack, 18, who has Down Syndrome and complex medical needs. \"I feel very tired, and I'm only 20 years in,\" she said.</p><p>\"I used to be terrified that he'd die, now I'm terrified I'll die\", Aisling said, explaining that her own health problems make her live in fear for her son's future.</p><p>\"My beautiful son is who I care for.

Mr \u00d3 hAnnaidh will be asked to confirm his name, age and address, and that he is aware of the ch arg e against him. A date will then be set for the first Crown Court hearing.</p><p>It is usually at that second hearing that pleas are entered. However, not only will the musician take the opportunity to plead not guilty today, but a statement will also be read out after the hearing.</p><p>His fellow fluent Irish speaking bandmates - Naoise \u00d3 Caireall\u00e1in, aka M\u00f3gla\u00ed Bap, and JJ \u00d3 Dochartaigh, the musician also known as DJ Pr\u00f3va\u00ed and who often wears a Tricolour balaclava - are expected to attend the hearing.</p><p>So too are thousands of the band's fans, who have all been urged to turn up at the court near Edgware Rd in central London.</p><p>Representing him in his defence against the terror charge are some of the world's most formidable human rights and criminal defence law experts.</p><p>They include international human rights lawyer Darragh Mackin, who represented the families of victims of the 1981 Stardust fire, and criminal defence expert Gareth Peirce, who defended the Birmingham Six and Guilford Four.</p><p>The legal team instructed by Phoenix Law includes Blinne N\u00ed Ghr\u00e1laigh, who represented South Africa at the International Court of Justice in its 2024 case alleging genocide by Israel in Gaza.</p><p>Brenda Campbell, who has represented families in both the Stardust and Hillsborough inquests, is also representing the musician, as is Jude Bunting, a freedom-ofexpression expert, and Rosalind Comyn, who recently acted on behalf of climate justice activists charged with vandalising Vincent Van Gogh's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sunf lowers</emphasis> painting.</p><p>Shortly after Mr \u00d3 hAnnaidh was charged, the band posted on social media: \"14,000 babies are about to die of starvation in Gaza, with food sent by the world sitting on the other side of the road and the British establishment is focussed on us. We deny this 'offence' and will vehemently defend ourselves. This is political policing. This is a carnival of distraction. We are not the story. Genocide is.\"</p><p>They added that while the UK authorities \"profit from genocide\", they asked what the objective was in using an anti-terror law against the band for \"displaying a flag thrown on stage\". The band has previously insisted they have \"never supported\" Hamas or Hezbollah, which are banned in the UK.</p><p>The band was set up in 2017 during a campaign that ultimately led to the passage in 2022 of the UK's Identity and Language (Northern Ireland) Act, which granted the Irish language equal status with English.</p><p>Controversial from the start, Kneecap's first single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">C.E.A.R.T.A.</emphasis>, was banned from RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gael-tachta because of its \"drug references and cursing\".</p><p>Their first album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">3CAG</emphasis> - short for the phrase \"tr\u00ed chonsan agus guta\" which translates into \"three consonants and a vowel\" - is named after a slang reference to the drug MDNA.</p><p>Two years after formation, they released the award-winning film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Kneecap</emphasis> starring Michael Fassbender, a fictionalised biopic of their life in the North against a backdrop of the campaign to get Irish recognized.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kneecap's Liam \u00d3g \u00d3 hAnnaidh, left, will plead not guilty to a terrorism charge today over the alleged display of a flag in support of Hezbollah</emphasis>.

As temperatures are rising, so too are incidences of extreme weather, from droughts and floods to heat waves and wildfires - with over 3bn people living in areas of high vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>It is clear from scientific evidence that the children and young people of today are the \"generation most affected\" by the climate crisis. Children and young people today are the most impacted by the climate crisis - a crisis they have been born into. Yet, they will shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of climate change, resulting in both direct and indirect impacts on their well-being across the lifespan.</p><p>Unicef's recent report, 'A Threat to Progress', states that \"climate change is changing children... impacting almost every aspect of child health and wellbeing\". In terms of health, children are now more susceptible to respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, and infectious disease, as a result of changing air quality, water pollutants, extreme heat, and other ecosystem hazards.</p><p>From Los Angeles to Laos, more than 200m children's schooling was disrupted or displaced in the last year by extreme weather, such as flooding and wildfires. We know that children experience trauma from these extreme weather events that they carry with them into adulthood. We also know that climate anxiety and distress are rising among children and young people worldwide, who report feelings of betrayal by the inaction of adults and po-licymakers. This youngest generation are not just passive victims of climate impacts; they are potential catalysts for change. It is critical that development of climate leadership among children and young people therefore starts as soon as possible.</p><p>Climate leadership in regards to children means actively involving young people in understanding, addressing, and advocating for solutions to climate change. By combining education, empowerment, and action in age-appropriate ways, we help children become informed, responsible, and proactive members of their communities.</p><p>Recent research demonstrates the importance of developing climate leadership among children, where they can play an effective role in sustainabil-ity advocacy. Our children hold a unique position within their families, schools, and wider communities; they promote pro-environmental behavioural change, because they possess powerful agency to drive awareness and action. Climate leadership is dependent, however, on two key issues: Children's accurate knowledge of climate change, and their active involvement in sustainability leadership activities, both inside and outside of school.</p><p>While primary schools are increas ingly supported by national policies to embed education for sustainable development in the curriculum, the Global Learner Survey, 'Making the grade for climate education: I learned about the weather, but not climate change', shows frustration among learners worldwide about the adequacy of topics related to climate issues in school. This issue is even more salient for young people, and their parents, since every job will have a climate component over the next decade - from doctors and nurses, to accountants, tradespeople, sustainability officers, or policymakers.</p><p>It is understood that children and young people require education in climate leadership. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">National Geographic Kids</emphasis> published a practical set of recommendations on 'How do you teach children about climate change?' . This simply involved a three-step process of explaining the science of our world and environment; explaining the problems that are arising because of climate change; and finally, explaining the solutions. This solution-driven approach is very much required by our young people to lead in climate change.</p><p>However, we will have to be much more creative and applied in the education of our children and young people in climate change.</p><p>Kemmy Business School is leading a new creative and applied climate initiative, Climate Leadership through Na-ture's Canvas. This partnership with primary school teachers, children, and their families educates children about climate science through play and art, and offers the opportunity to develop leadership skills while engaging in creative art and works.</p><p>This initiative challenges all participants to explore, create, and lead. The first engagement with children involves the introduction to the Climate Fresk game. Children will solve a puzzle, each piece of the puzzle represents a crucial aspect of climate change - from human activities to their environmental consequences, such as sea level rise or ocean acidification. By linking puzzle pieces on the causes and consequences of climate change, children and their teachers will build a storyboard of climate change, becoming participative learners. What follows is a facilitated discussion on potential actions and solutions, with the intention of leaving all participants with a feeling of hope and empowerment to move toward action.</p><p>Next, in collaboration with Irish children's artists, a poetry canopy - similar to a patchwork quilt inspired by poetry - will be created using recycled materials and natural objects. This collaborative green art activity is designed to help children and their teachers understand environmental issues such as pollution, deforestation, and resource overuse. As they explore these topics through art, children gain a deeper awareness of the challenges associated with climate change and begin to appreciate the need for sustainable practices. This activity will also develop important leadership capabilities, such as self awareness, collaboration, and communication. They will learn how to share ideas, listen to others, and find ways to compromise and influence in group settings.</p><p>There has been some very positive, albeit laboured steps at third level-education, to embed climate courses or climate-related courses into the curricula - such as climate change sociology and economics. Despite the supportive nature of this inclusion, Universities are challenged to integrate climate change into all curriculum.</p><p>However, we cannot afford to leave the key climate leadership skills education until this later stage. Educating children about climate change from an early age helps instil life-long sustainable habits, fosters critical thinking, and encourages the problem solving skills needed to address the climate crisis. An understanding of climate change enables young people to safeguard their health and wellbeing in the face of climate-related risks, while enabling them to become active citizens, environmental stewards, and leaders of climate justice.</p><p>The education for sustainable development report calls for the transformation of the learning environment in which challenges all schools to approach education for sustainable development, \"where learners learn what they live and live what they learn\". To do this, leadership skills will be central to the advancement of this mission both by the educators and the learners' alike.</p><p>* Mary Curtin, Jean McCarthy, and Christina O'Connor teach at Kemmy Business School, University of Limerick.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Enriching young people with knowledge to help understand and confront climate change is crucial in order to help those who will be most affected by the world's challenging climate issues</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G69-PSS3-RS0H-X4TM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1293\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

No matter how much you try to solve for X   working from home, asking relatives for help, using cr\u00e8ches, childminders and availing of State subsidies and payments   it seems designed to break you financially and emotionally. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It s been 20 years, but my nerves still haven t recovered from organising childcare for our two kids. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like most people, I had to work to help pay the bills. Choice didn t come into it. Even though my husband and I were highly educated, well-paid professionals living in Dublin, it was an exhausting struggle. We were paying EUR 2,500 on our mortgage and EUR 2,000 monthly for the creche in which we were lucky to get two places. The numbers never added up. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My husband is an accountant and I was a personal finance journalist. We had knowledge, energy and means and we still couldn t find the right formula for our family. Financially, I could only afford to take five months off with each child.</p><p>We didn t live large. The kids  clothes were a combination of hand-me downs, gifts or purchases from Penneys, Dunnes or other low-cost retailers. To save money, we used home exchanges for our holidays and our car was second-hand. We weren t buying designer clothes, takeaways, lattes or going to the pub every week   common  advice  at that time from the older generation and finance experts. </p><p>Every penny was counted, every possibility explored, but since we didn t have family to help out for free   which isn t ideal or fair anyway   it became a constant puzzle to be solved.</p><p>My husband s job was not flexible, so I had to reorganise my work schedule for school training days or holidays. The one-hour difference in pick-up times between junior/senior infants and first through sixth class was ridiculous, coming as it did right in the middle of the work day. If you don t work near where you live, it is impossible. </p><p>Children s childcare and developmental needs also change as they grow, so we had to constantly seek out the most suitable arrangements such as a creche, au pair or childminder. Afterschool care was not available at that time for older children; nor were breakfast clubs.</p><p>For me, the juggle became impossible unless I worked from home. When we had two children, doubling the cost for a creche, an au pair was an obvious solution. She minded the older child while I was working in the kitchen. I ll never forget interviewing economists with the phone on my left shoulder while breastfeeding our younger on my right. </p><p>Add a sick child into this fragile mix, and it was absolute chaos. Naturally, children want and need their parents when they re not feeling well, but deadlines and workflows are not easily adjusted. In the end, I quit my beloved career in journalism and started my own company. </p><h>Rigged game  My story is every parent s story then and now. No matter what you do or how you plan, the numbers can never add up in Ireland. The game is rigged against working parents. </h><p>Today, childcare costs are still high, places are like hen s teeth, and the stress this places on working parents and their children is enormous. Mortgages, rents and the high cost of living all make things more difficult.</p><p>Ireland has some of the highest childcare costs in Europe, with one-third of a woman s median full-time earnings being used on childcare back in 2019. That figure rises in lower-income family households, particularly lone-parent households (overwhelmingly led by women). </p><p>Ireland also has the highest reliance on unpaid care work in the European Union   most of it unpaid childcare likely provided by relatives. </p><p>In recent years, government has committed to providing more support and is moving towards a public childcare model. The National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme help parents reduce costs. </p><p>The Core Funding grant helps early- learning and childcare providers with their operating costs. Recently announced new caps on what providers can charge from September should mean no parents pay more than EUR 295 a week for a child attending a service in the scheme for 40 to 50 hours a week. That figure will, in most cases, fall to EUR 198.70 after other supports are factored in, but the caps vary according to the number of hours involved.</p><p>High childcare costs are a barrier to women working outside the home, and this has prevented Ireland s child poverty rates from improving. The existing system is not working well for current or future generations.</p><p>Women have been in the workforce for decades. The majority of families need two incomes to pay the bills. Why haven t we been able to solve this equation? Is it because we think it s just a women s issue, or are we under the delusion that most families can survive on one salary?</p><p>Who should be responsible for childcare and the tasks involved in raising happy and healthy kids? Naturally, it s the parents  responsibility first, but society, the Government and employers all have a part to play. </p><p>And, weirdly, everyone seems to forget that men are parents too. In Ireland, women spend on average 21.3 hours per week on unpaid care work, in comparison to 10.6 hours per week for men. </p><p> In Irish society, the crisis in care is central to women s inequality, with under-resourcing, lack of adequate provision, accessibility issues and moves towards commodification and corporatisation affecting almost all aspects of care and support provision,  states a recent study,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Gender equity and care for transformative climate justice, by Jennie Stephens of Maynooth University and Orla O Connor of the National Women s Council. </p><p>When childcare can t be provided by the mother, it s often a woman   not the father   who steps into the breach. Although paternity leave and family leave are legally mandated, only around half of fathers avail of paternity leave and a quarter take parent s leave, compared to two-thirds of mothers, according to research by the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission (Ihrec<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">),</emphasis> Child Related Leave: Usage and Implications for Gender Equality. </p><p>The related welfare benefits paid are flat-rate, so income-related concerns are a significant barrier to higher take-up rates. A lack of a supportive employer culture and inconsistent employer top-ups also discourage fathers from taking paternity leave. If 100 per cent of their earnings were covered while on leave, and if part of child-related leave was ring-fenced for fathers, these figures would be likely to improve.</p><p> The fact that women do far more care and care work, paid and unpaid, than men plays a significant part in women s lower economic status in Ireland. To address persistent, structural inequality between women and men, Ireland must find a new relationship between paid employment, care work and gender roles,  said Liam Herrick, Ihrec chief commissioner.</p><p> This report robustly demonstrates the need for effective and gender equitable child-related leave schemes, and where policy efforts should be focused to greatest effect.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Margaret E Ward is chief executive of Clear Eye, a leadership consultancy;

While it is encouraging to see educators engaging students through popular platforms, this trend raises deeper questions about what we value in education and what we may be losing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rise of exam-focused influencers, with their bite-sized hacks and algorithm-boosted predictions, reflects an increasingly transactional view of learning. It reduces education to short-term performance strategies, exam shortcuts and curated content designed for engagement rather than understanding. In doing so, it reinforces the already unhealthy obsession with grades while sidelining the kind of slow, reflective, critical thinking that education should foster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There s also something troubling about how the popularity of a teacher is now mediated through social media metrics. When pedagogical credibility becomes synonymous with likes and views, we risk replacing thoughtful educators with charismatic content creators.</p><p>Antonio Gramsci reminded us that hegemony is not just maintained through force, but through culture   through what people come to accept as common sense. If we are not careful, a generation will come to believe that real learning is something that happens online in 30 seconds, and the purpose of education is to win the game of exams, not to understand the world.   Yours, etc,</p><p>GAVIN REDDIN,</p><p>Swords,</p><p>Co Dublin. </p><p>Human costs </p><p>of air traffic </p><p>Sir,   It is vital that the human costs of unprecedented air traffic levels are prioritised in discussions about  Irish airport expansion. The claim that local residents are  possibly the last great stakeholder in what has become an increasingly frenetic policy area , is misinformed and short-sighted ( Everybody wants to get on board the State s aviation policy , Cantillon, Business, May 13th). </p><p>Children s safety, health and economic prospects unequivocally depend on urgent and economy-wide cuts to fossil fuel use. The record-breaking levels of flight traffic in Ireland also means record-breaking levels of aviation fossil fuel use. </p><p>In 2023 Ireland used 1.36 billion litres of aviation fossil fuel and this will increase massively if national airport expansion takes place. Experts advise there is no viable or sustainable alternative to jet kerosene, and there is none for the foreseeable future. </p><p>In recent days we learnt that 100 million of the world s five year olds (83 per cent) face deadly and unprecedented heat in their lives if climate action is not strengthened. Yet children continue to be ignored as key stakeholders in decisions that will have irreversible impacts on their lives   such as massive and polluting airport expansion. The reason our children are on track for deadly heat, among many other life-threatening hazards, is inadequate action to cut the fossil fuel pollution endangering their futures.</p><p>The aviation industry must do its fair share for climate action and protect children from the horrendous and avoidable harms they are facing. The State must regulate it accordingly via a science-based aviation policy. </p><p>It is only children who have the fundamental right to growth, development and survival, not any industry, and the State must fulfil its obligations to them.   Yours, etc,</p><p>LOUISE O LEARY,</p><p>Terenure, </p><p>Dublin 6W.</p><p>Stark failings on infrastructure</p><p>Sir,   Arthur Beesley and John McManus describe the failure to provide infrastructure in stark terms (May 14th). They cite Uisce \u00c9ireann and the Greater Dublin Drainage project, EirGrid, the passenger cap at Dublin Airport and the Ardee bypass, the National Maternity Hospital, social and affordable housing in Ringsend, wind farms and MetroLink. </p><p>Both refer to the problems of planning as favourite culprits in this failure, particularly referring to individuals standing in the way of the common good. This has never been a real factor. With the exception of EirGrid, whose problems are of resources, the failure lies firmly with the leadership of the infrastructure providers, not with the citizens who occasionally attempt to hold their power to account.</p><p>It would take too long to analyse all the examples cited, but looking at just two of the failures, the passenger cap was a condition of planning permission granted in 2007; the DAA had more than 15 years to address it but did not. Metro North was actually granted planning permission in 2011 and that permission was allowed to lapse.</p><p>Effective leaders take responsibility for their actions and unite people with a shared vision, working together to overcome vested interests. Without gifted leadership, we would not have been able to tackle the financial crisis nor the pandemic. We would not have the IFSC and the Dublin docklands. Ardnacrusha was the gift of the leadership of a young Irish engineer in the 1930s.</p><p>It s time that we stopped blaming the citizen for failure. The responsibility lies with the leaders of the infrastructure organisations, who should be capable of carrying out their tasks.   Yours, etc,</p><p>ROBIN MANDAL, chair</p><p>Dublin Democratic Planning </p><p>Alliance,</p><p>Blackrock,</p><p>Co Dublin.</p><p>Sir,   There is something profoundly wrong with Ireland. From the politically engineered housing crisis to the absurdly dysfunctional planning system, we seem incapable of delivering even the most basic public infrastructure, whether it s public or active transport, healthcare or community amenities. </p><p>There is no political leadership or ambition, and there is no accountability. Every time I visit another European country, the contrast becomes starker, and the dysfunction at home even more glaring. We deserve so much better.   Yours, etc,</p><p>OLA L\u00d8KKEN NORDRUM ,</p><p>Dublin 4. </p><p>Money and </p><p>power addicts</p><p>Sir,   I agree with Prof Ian Robertson s piece about the pursuit of money shaping US politics and the love of money being an addiction ( Want to understand what money does to your brain? Look at this photo , Opinion, May 11th).</p><p> Money and power addicts readily dispense with values that they seemed to hold, so that they can feed their habit,  he writes. There is a great paradoxical lesson to learn with this understanding. Money and power addicts do not have power over the choices they make as the addiction has authority over them. They have, in fact, lost their power to the addiction. Paradoxically, money and power is their master rather than their servant. </p><p>I live in hope that we become more aware of this lesson. Perhaps the world has taken the wrong road to the right place!   Yours, etc,</p><p>ELAINE BYRNE,</p><p>Ballinteer,</p><p>Dublin 16.</p><p>Scourge of dereliction </p><p>A chara,   Does it not say it all when the lobbying body for the construction industry owns a derelict building that collapses in the centre of Dublin? ( Collapsed Victorian cottage in Ranelagh is owned by Construction Industry Federation , News, May 12th.)</p><p>The fact that a reported derelict building in a prime area, served by sustainable transport, services, schools, employment and social outlets can be allowed to occupy a site for so long is scandalous.</p><p>When will this Government enforce and address dereliction in our existing urban centres and stem our unsustainable suburbanisation of the country?   Is mise le meas,</p><p>COLM WALSH, </p><p>Rathmines, </p><p>Dublin 6. </p><p>Catastrophe </p><p>in Gaza</p><p>Sir,   There are children dying every day in Gaza. These are children who should get to live, play, learn and grow up. Right now they are dying because Israel is choosing to starve them and the international community has decided to stand idly by. I cannot understand it. </p><p>I cannot believe that the world s leaders can watch and continue to act as normal towards any nation who would treat humans in such a deplorable way. How abandoned and distraught must Palestinian people feel, to know that the world watches and does nothing? Where has our humanity gone?

Has Israel ever taken the idea seriously? </p><p>Since the Oslo Accords, Israel has continued to increase its colonial grip, building military and civil infrastructure, and allowing a massive influx of Israeli settlers onto Palestinian land. </p><p>The Israeli state was busy changing the facts on the ground while the US and EU mumbled listlessly about the desired  two-state solution . </p><p>Pretending otherwise is unhelpful and encourages the dangerous delusion that words alone can persuade Israel to stop what it is doing in Gaza and the West Bank.

It is heartening to see the power of art recognised, not just as a way to express emotion but to connect people to complex issues such as climate change.</p><p>Here in Ballymun, we are seeing that notion in action through a project called Ballymun is Brilliant. This climate action project brings locals together through art, community events and shared ideas about building a fairer, greener future. </p><p>Funded by the Government s Creative Climate Action Fund, the project helps people to feel more connected: to each other, to the place they live in, and to what is happening to the planet. What makes this project stand out is its commitment to inclusion, recognising that climate justice must make space for voices often left out of the conversation.

He surpassed the world record as the longest-serving chess columnist in 2016. </p><p>At 93, Mr Walsh has shown how important mental stimulation improves one s brain function and can prevent the development of cognitive problems. The old adage of  use it or lose it  is never more poignant than when making reference to one s brain. He is a role model for all older people, inspiring them to find ways of improving their brain function. As a clinician, I see clearly the value of reading, writing, doing crossword puzzles, bridge, chess, etc, when it comes to looking after the old grey matter.</p><p>I would like to thank Mr Walsh for the joy that he brought so many readers over his many years as The Irish Times chess columnist.</p><p>Wishing him the happiest and most relaxing retirement.

Such figures starkly highlight the injustice of the situation.</p><p>Wealthier nations in the Global North, where emissions are highest, have not taken the lead in reducing their carbon footprints, instead allowing climate-harming corporations to operate primarily without regulation. This negligence manifests as a human rights crisis across the globe, with marginalised communities - who have contributed the least to climate change - suffering the most. They face extreme weather, loss of lives and livelihoods, displacement, and hunger, pushing them deeper into poverty and amplifying existing inequalities.</p><p>Globally, governments continue to enable the expansion of this destructive industry, often at the expense of the world's most vulnerable populations.</p><p>Alarmingly, by 2030, governments collectively plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels required to stay within the critical 1.5C warming limit, set by the Paris Agreement. This completely disregards the scientific consensus, the necessity of phasing out fossil fuels to mitigate further climate impacts, and violates the agreements and obligations to protect and support those who have done the least to cause this crisis, but who are suffering the most.</p><p>It may not surprise many to read that Ireland is falling short of its commitments, but by how much is truly shocking. Current government policies and private-sector initiatives are facilitating an increase in the country's fossil fuel demand and infrastructure, (such as plans for liquefied natural gas facilities) and the proliferation of data centres.</p><p>These plans directly contradict Ireland's climate obligations and risk entangling the country in human rights abuses linked to continued high greenhouse gas emissions and excessive energy demands.</p><p>Claims that dependence on more polluting, fossil fuels is a solution to energy security couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, it only exacerbates vulnerability to geopolitical shifts and price shocks.</p><p>Earth is now projected to reach a sobering 2.6C-3.1C of warming by 2100. However, if the rest of the world had polluted like Ireland, the world would already be at 3.6C of warming. Ireland is on a slippery slope to missing our emissions reduction target of 51% by 2030, with just a 23% reduction expected.</p><p>Even before you consider the impacts of new liquefied natural gas facilities and the energy use of projected data centres, Ireland's ambition and delivery on climate action falls far short of our fair share. These shortcomings alone are due to cost the country  26bn - an alarming sign of a government failing to meet its obligations.</p><p>Ireland's role as a global financial hub further complicates the issue. With substantial investments in fossil fuel companies through Irish subsidiaries, Ireland is directly and significantly implicated in the climate crisis.</p><p>In June 2024, Irish investment firms held roughly  31.76bn in fossil fuel assets, 91% of which were tied to companies actively expanding fossil fuel production. The emissions linked to these investments exceeded Ireland's national emissions by a staggering 20%, underscoring the need for accountability on these activities, which is currently lacking.</p><p>The climate crisis is fundamentally a human rights crisis, and there have been increasing calls from human rights treaty bodies for a complete fossil fuel phaseout and stringent regulations against corporations responsible for damage both at home and abroad.</p><p>In Malawi where Tr\u00f3caire works, 56% of those affected by Cyclone Freddy's impacts were children. Following</p><p>Cyclone Freddy, hundreds of health facilities were disrupted, while displacement camps faced limited access to sanitation and medical care, leading to a surge in the spread of cholera, malaria, malnutrition, covid-19, and other vaccine-treatable diseases.</p><p>This is what climate injustice looks like: Those who do the least to cause the crisis are paying the highest price. Children, women, and the world's most vulnerable are losing everything.</p><p>It is time for a decisive shift away from fossil fuels. Ireland can be a key player in this transition by endorsing a global Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, by prohibiting new fossil fuel infrastructure, and swiftly implementing policies that promise a just phase-out of fossil fuels domestically, and urgently reduce emissions.</p><p>Every fraction of a degree of warming holds dire consequences, making every tonne of carbon pollution critical. Ireland must urgently align with the global call for action to mitigate against catastrophic climate breakdown. It's time to hold both polluters, states, and corporations, and their investors accountable.</p><p>To address our complicity in the climate crisis, Tr\u00f3-caire is calling on the Government to implement a climate damages tax on fossil fuels investments, which could generate up to  3.33bn by 2030 and  20bn by 2050. This would help partially address the ecological debt incurred from exceeding our fair share of carbon limits.</p><p>Additionally, leveraging public finance to compel polluters to pay for their contributions to the crisis could provide critical resources for climate finance commitments and support marginalised communities; a climate damages tax and other measures available to Ireland that would make polluters pay could generate up to  9.7bn annually.</p><p>Failing to act decisively compromises our environment and increasingly stains our moral fabric as a nation responsible for national and global human rights. The time to act is long overdue.</p><p>* Sin\u00e9ad Loughran is climate justice, policy, and advocacy advisor at Tr\u00f3caire</p><p>Men salvage parts from their destroyed home after heavy rains caused by Cyclone Freddy in southern</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Malawi in 2023; 56% of those affected by Cyclone Freddy's impacts were children</emphasis>.

True, an infinitesimally small contribution   but one that reminds us that some of the greenhouse gases we emit today will still be around, trapping the Earth s heat, far into the distant future. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some have shorter lifetimes. Methane, for example, which constitutes 30 per cent of Irish greenhouse gas emissions, produces its intense warming effect 80 times greater than CO2 over 20 years. But it doesn t stop there, as much of it then converts to CO2, which joins the long-term store of that gas for centuries. Those who would have you believe that the warming effect of methane emissions disappear after a decade or so are simply wrong. It matters not to the atmosphere whether that methane has come from a dairy cow or a leaking gas pipeline. It all ends up in the atmospheric reservoir of greenhouse gases for future generations to cope with.</p><p>So decisions made today regarding our emissions have very long-term consequences for those who come after us. It also confirms that there is no turning back the dial in terms of the warming effect of gases already emitted. No feasible removal technology exists at the scale and deployment level to get us out of our predicament over the next few decades. This means that there is only a certain amount of additional emissions that the world can add to the atmosphere before trigger points of warming and potential tipping points of climate dislocation are inevitable. </p><h>Radical cuts </h><p/><h>For a 50-50 chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the remaining global budget at the beginning of this year was estimated to be 235 billion tonnes of CO2. This will be used up in around six years at current rates of emission. The best we can do is buy time by radical cuts in emissions.</h><p>What is Ireland s fair share of this remaining budget? How should countries that have benefited from burning fossil fuels since the industrial revolution do in any allocation, compared with developing countries that have only recently started emitting significant amounts of greenhouse gases?</p><p>Ireland has sought to address these issues in its climate legislation and its adherence to the Paris Agreement of 2015 by a system of legally binding five-yearly carbon budgets. The most recent update of these has been recommended to the Minister for the Environment by the Climate Change Advisory Council. These limit national emissions to 295 million, 200 million and 160 million tonnes for each of the five year periods 2021-25, 2026-30 and 2031-35 respectively. Before taking these limits to the Oireachtas for approval, the Minister is seeking public submissions on them to be made before June 4th. </p><p>It is an opportunity for citizens to express their views on this critical intergenerational issue.</p><p>These new carbon budgets were required to be formulated in compliance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which was passed overwhelmingly, and enthusiastically supported by the two major parties in government today. </p><p>This Act also requires consistency with Article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement, which requires governments to implement climate actions to  reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.  </p><p>This convoluted phrase essentially brings us back to the issue of fairness. What is fair for a rich country like Ireland to claim in terms of the remaining global carbon budget? Has this principle been observed in formulating the new round of carbon budgets?</p><p>In its first report in 2021 advising the minister on the design of the original carbon budgets (2021-2030), the Climate Change Advisory Council produced a reasoned justification of how the budgets represented a fair and equitable contribution to meeting the needs of Paris 2.2. But in the latest iteration, this aspect is completely missing. Only a temperature criterion is offered regarding compliance with the Paris objective of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees, without any significant consideration of equity/fairness. This raises important legal issues as to the extent to which the required consistency with an international treaty is being observed.</p><h>Unethical and selfish </h><p/><h>For a nation with a proud record of supporting less well-off countries in the Global South, ignoring a basic tenet of climate justice is unethical and selfish. It s rather like saying we will grab an unfair share of the remaining carbon budget and expect poorer countries to accommodate us by picking up the slack   the same countries that will also suffer more adverse climate consequences.</h><p>The reality is that we in Ireland have already   or are close to having   exhausted our fair share of the dwindling global carbon budget. We are now entering carbon debt territory to the rest of the world. This is not an academic exercise   we are disproportionately contributing to the climate disasters of the present and future beyond our shores. This is not a comfortable situation to be in.</p><p>What will you say to your children and grandchildren?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/></p><p> Sorry, kids, we opted to plunder your legacy to sustain our comfortable lifestyles in the 2020s. We wanted to keep our SUVs, further intensify our agriculture, and continue subsidising fossil fuels to the extent of EUR 4.7 billion annually. Our political leaders facilitated us at every stage as they prioritised holding on to power. Yes, we did know that blowing your legacy condemns everyone here in Ireland to future catastrophic flooding, heatwaves, droughts and storms. It s tough, but do the best you can. </p><p>John Sweeney is emeritus professor in the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units (Icarus) at the department of geography at Maynooth University</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21905768</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FWB-6FV3-RRWX-12S7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"977\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 24, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

Big business is an increasingly influential presence across Ireland's education sector.<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>This trend is often framed by both government and industry as a net positive for Irish society. Private funding is seen as a way to build closer relationships between universities, industry and government - ensuring that teaching and research activities target the same 'strategic goals'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Private funding is also viewed as a way to compensate for the funding gap in education, which was estimated by the\u00a0Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science in 2022 to be <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/funding-the-future-summary-of-the-departments-policy-response.pdf\">(EURO)307 million per year</url>. Within this context, academic-industry partnerships have taken centre stage in Ireland. But to date, little attention has been paid to the multiple risks associated with industry funding of universities identified by <url normalizedValue=\"https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.904\">international research</url>.\u00a0 \u00a0<br/></p><h>Why do corporations invest in universities?\u00a0\u00a0</h><p>Extensive analysis has <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0253272\">mapped the corporate influence of science</url> to show how major industries, including those in tobacco, chemical, pharmaceutical industries and energy, have strategically funded research to delay critical progress, obscure industry harms and oppose government regulation in areas such as public health and climate change.

One major risk of this is that academic areas that are not perceived as having commercial value are underfunded and marginalised in many education systems.</p><p>This is already happening in Ireland; consider that in 2020, the majority of industry-funded research in Ireland focused on Health, Engineering, Technology and Natural Sciences, amounting to (EURO)39.1 million, while the <url normalizedValue=\"https://assets.gov.ie/static/documents/-education-research-development-survey-2022-2023.pdf\">humanities only received (EURO)200,000</url>.</p><p>There is strong evidence that the '<url normalizedValue=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-024-03696-4\">corporate capture</url>' of universities and academic research intends to legitimise corporate-friendly policies and reduce regulatory constraints on big business. Decades of <url normalizedValue=\"https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wcc.904\">research on universities in the United States, Canada, the UK and Australia</url> shows that since the 1970s, the fossil fuel industry lobby has been strategically funding teaching and research agendas that promote climate denial, obstruct environmental action and direct attention to narrow technical fixes to social problems.</p><p><br/></p><p>With the government planning for <url normalizedValue=\"https://hea.ie/policy/research-policy/impact-2030/\">industry funding to double</url> in Ireland by 2030, this raises the question - are similar corporate strategies unfolding here?\u00a0 How can Ireland protect against the mega-corporations of aviation, tech, pharma, finance and agri-food strategically investing in the education landscape to promote and obscure the harms of their activities?</p><h>New analysis on industry funding in Irish universities</h><p>These questions were among the key issues we investigated in a recent research paper <url normalizedValue=\"https://publicpolicy.ie/papers/industry-funding-of-irish-universities/\">published in PublicPolicy.ie</url> in which we reviewed the current extent and dynamics of private sector funding in education, based on publicly available data. Our work offers a snapshot of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/education/2025/04/29/irish-universities-take-millions-of-euro-from-big-business-are-they-too-close-for-comfort/?\">how large corporations invest in universities across Ireland</url>, highlighting concerns about potential conflicts of interest.</p><p>We also highlighted the lack of transparency surrounding industry funding in Irish universities. Although some sources, such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://hea.ie/statistics/data-for-download-and-visualisations/institutes-performance/system-performance-framework-dashboard-23-28/\">the HEA's databases</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.knowledgetransferireland.com/Reports-Publications/Annual-Knowledge-Transfer-Survey-2023.pdf\">KTI's Annual Knowledge Transfer Survey</url>, provide a general overview of the funding landscape, there is a lack of granularity on the types of industries, organisations and types of investment being made.\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>If the public and academic community cannot access clear information about where, how, and why corporations fund universities, then we are left to accept it uncritically, despite international evidence that such investment often serves corporate interests at the expense of the public good. The many crises facing Ireland today, including the housing crisis and a precarious economic system that is over-reliant on US industry, require transformative social, cultural and economic change. Transformation will not be achieved through narrow silver bullet solutions, the kinds of approaches often promoted by corporations, where a new technology will come to the market and 'solve' humanity's grand challenges.</p><p>Irish society is facing systemic vulnerabilities associated with housing insecurity, climate destabilisation, and growing economic, educational and health disparities among communities and households struggling to thrive. To contribute to addressing these issues, our universities need to be publicly funded and independent from corporate influence.</p><p>Another danger of industry funding of Irish universities is the inability to uphold the integrity and independence of academic institutions. If Ireland's education landscape continues to be shaped by profit-seeking objectives and market-driven priorities, students and staff will continue to be thwarted in their efforts to work toward the changes that are so desperately needed for a more just, healthy, and peaceful Irish society.\u00a0\u00a0<br/><br/>\u00a0<br/><br/>The extent and dynamics of industry funding in Irish universities and its potential to narrow the priorities of education require additional scrutiny and discussion. New processes of transparency and accountability are also urgently needed across Ireland's education sector so that university staff, students and the Irish public are involved in decisions on when and where it might be appropriate for Ireland's public universities to accept industry funding.</p><p>And to maintain the public good mission of Irish universities, public funding must be increased so that educational institutions can retain their integrity and focus on co-creating a more hopeful future for Ireland and the world.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"> Jennie C Stephens is Professor of Climate Justice at the ICARUS Climate Research Centre, Maynooth University.

I recall at the end of our meetings he would say as to his work on such issues,  it is very difficult , as he asked for and offered prayers. It is important that the steps he took are built upon as they constitute a source of hope in the years to come. </p><p>Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin has said Pope Francis was a pontiff who lived the Gospel and got the fundamentals right in urging people to cease conflict and war.</p><p> He was a voice for the voiceless, the marginalised, the poor, the migrants. In a world which is turbulent, and where there has been shocking conflict, I think he was a very pure voice of love and mercy,  he said.</p><p>Mr Martin said the pontiff had to be commended for his work to raise awareness about climate change and in calling out  the shocking killing of innocent people  in Gaza and Ukraine. </p><p>Asked about the legacy of his papacy for Ireland, Mr Martin referred to how the pope dealt with sexual abuse in institutions run by Catholic orders in the State.</p><p> He dealt with the issues of child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church and acknowledged his own feelings in that regard. And in many ways, his non-judgmental approach to life itself enabled him to deal with these issues, perhaps ultimately, more effectively than maybe others. </p><p>T\u00e1naiste and Fine Gael leader Simon Harris said Francis had worked to make the church more inclusive and that his  influence transcended the Vatican, offering moral leadership during times of uncertainty .</p><p> He promoted reconciliation, unity and compassion over division. His 2018 visit to Ireland for the World Meeting of Families was particularly significant, inspiring hope and renewal within the church,  he said.</p><p> His emphasis on mercy, healing and reconciliation continues to resonate in our efforts towards addressing the challenges of the past and building a more inclusive future. </p><p>Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O Neill paid tribute to the pope as a  strong, determined leader  whose loss would be mourned by Catholics in Ireland and worldwide.</p><p>In a post on X, the Sinn F\u00e9in politician said Francis was  a man of great faith  who, during his 2018 visit to Ireland, spoke passionately in support of the peace process.</p><p> He also marked the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, giving thanks for the peace it delivered in Ireland,  she said.</p><p> Pope Francis showed compassion on LGBT issues and condemned right-wing extremists and he was in advance of many world leaders in speaking out against the Israeli war in Gaza. </p><p>Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly said Francis was  held in high regard and admiration by so many  and that his loss  will be felt deeply .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21821673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FMH-4KN3-RRS9-N3TR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"630\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 22, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

On paper, he has all the attributes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At a time of unprecedented global political, economic, and climate instability, we need leaders with guts, determination, and the desire to make a positive impact on the world stage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dr Ryan, 60, held the role of executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies programme prior to his position as deputy director. At a time when the political arena is dominated by egotists, parties, and individuals addicted to wealth and power, the need for an objective champion of truth as well as social, health, and climate justice has never been greater.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is understood the Labour Party has discussed the possibility of approaching Dr Ryan, who rose to prominence during the covid pandemic and has been an outspoken voice on the humanitarian costs of Israel's assault on Gaza in recent weeks.</p><p>Dr Ryan was appointed to the role of WHO deputy director general last year but has recently been dropped from the new executive management team, following a funding gap of $1.7bn ( 1.5bn) in its $4.2bn budget over the next two years.</p><p>US president Donald Trump ordered the cut via an executive order withdrawing the US from the WHO. It contributed $1.3bn during 2022-23.</p><p>Labour leader Ivana Bacik said there have been a \"number of names floating around\" and \"there's certainly still discussion ongoing about the idea of uniting behind a candidate that would continue Michael D Higgin's legacy\".</p><p>The WHO's loss could be Ireland's gain.</p><p>Dr Ryan has a unique combination of core values, aptitudes, and personality traits that align with what we perceive as presidential at a time of perpetual crisis on the world stage.</p><p>In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Becoming You</emphasis> (2025), Suzy Welch, a professor of management practice at NYU Stern School of Business, suggests values are a poorly understood concept that often include attributes like personality traits such as optimism; or virtues, like integrity or generosity; or 'big umbrellas of needs', like love and respect.</p><p>\"For the record,\" states Prof Welch, \"values are the desires, motivations, and beliefs that animate our actions and decisions.\" This would include concepts such as wanting a big and interesting life or wanting to be wealthy or wanting to be a person that ends world hunger.</p><p>In other words, a value is something that is strong enough to influence decisions about what job you choose or who you want to spend your life with.</p><p>As part of her research, Prof Welch has identified 15 core values, each one existing along a continuum. The values are in no particular order and none is more important than the other. But our position on the continuum of each value does give an insight into our suitability for a particular role - in this case, the president of Ireland.</p><p>Of the 15 values, the ones that I would rate as values aligning with the role of president include the following:</p><p>* Radius: A measure of how much you value being in a position to change the world. This is not about fame but about \"how big a crater there would be if your life was dropped on the world like a bomb\". Welch suggests that \"most people who have an off-the-charts high radius ranking are coming from a noble place, galvanised by a soul-deep yearning to restore dignity to the powerless, aching, and disenfranchised\".</p><p>Dr Ryan, while managing health emergencies in the WHO for the past 27 years, and leading the organi-sation's response to covid, as well as more recently deploring the atrocities in Gaza, including child deaths and starvation, has consistently demonstrated a high radius ranking;</p><p>* Non Sibi is the Latin term for 'not for self' and as a value it reflects helping others as a life-organising principle. Another value that</p><p>Dr Ryan would appear to rank highly;</p><p>* Agency is a measure of self-determination as a life-organising principle. Steve Jobs personified agency as a value when he said \"your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other opinions drown out your own inner voice.\" In a nutshell, drive your own bus;</p><p>* Achievement: How much you value respect from your community, for being the very best you can be at what you do;</p><p>* Work centrism: Linked to valuing achievement - placing work as a key priority in your life that defines your meaning and momentum;</p><p>* Voice: A strong desire to say what you think. Dr Ryan's recent comments about the atrocities in Gaza and previously about social justice and health justice - specifically in relation to the distribution of the covid-19 vaccine to low-income countries - were examples of his ability to speak his mind.</p><p>Welch lists other core values that all of us have to a greater or lesser degree but may not sit as comfortably with the role of president. These include a desire for affluence; luminance (recognition); family centrism (how much family considerations determine your decisions; eudemonia (a measure of the pursuit of joy, fun and/or wellbeing in your life); and beholderhism (how much everything in your life, including your own appearance looks, matters to you).</p><p>Added to that are values of connectivity - how important it is to you that you are part of a large group of friends, or community; and finally, the value of place - how important it is to you that you live in a particular place or part of the world.</p><p>The role of president, along with a set of core values, also calls for particular aptitudes including the ability to get on with people and express yourself with courtesy, democracy, and restraint.</p><p>Added to that are key personality traits that include nerve or guts; soundedness (a mixture of positivity, self- awareness, integrity, and resilience); a sense of curiosity to learn new things; and finally, elasticity - a willingness to continually expand our collection of skills and our collection of friends.</p><p>In the run-up to the presidential race, the potential candidates already named combine varying sets of values.

It is evidence of what writer Rebecca Solnit has called  hope in the dark , in the face of accelerating climate disruption and unrelenting nature loss. </p><p>People in every corner of Ireland are looking to their immediate locality and taking grassroots action. While despair can lead to inaction, it s a luxury we cannot afford. No human can justifiably do nothing in the face of accelerating global warming, species wipeout and pollution (most obvious in poor water quality). </p><p>A flavour of entries outlined in this piece may prompt other communities (in the broadest sense) to consider entering. By any measure the scale of local environmental betterment with the help of many hands is impressive. It ranges across groups engaging in bog restoration   enabling vast tracts of land to become carbon stores, slowing water to mitigate flooding and enhancing biodiversity   to towns transforming cityscapes into more liveable locations. So this is a call-out to them; an opportunity to get recognition for their endeavours. </p><p>There is also the option of individuals nominating their home place, where they work or where they visit. Highlighting projects here is not an indication of likely winners, who will emerge from a separate judging process. </p><p>The categories are Ireland s greenest suburb; greenest village, greenest town and Ireland s greenest community   from which an overall winner will be selected. </p><p>The ability of an area as small as a suburb to pursue transformative actions is typified in the work of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Connecting Cabra</emphasis>, which is involved in a multiplicity of activities, including staging biodiversity festivals and helping to convert gardens and open spaces into mini-nature reserves. This extends into adopting renewable energy, helping people pursue retrofitting in some of the poorest areas of Dublin and facilitating authentic  circular living . </p><p> I could list dozens more activities that Connecting Cabra and other groups run ... but that would miss the main point; that Cabra is addressing climate action and sustainability together as a community in a way that involves and actively empowers everybody and is focused on climate justice,  says Connecting Cabra chair Brian Gormley.</p><p>With two of the top 10 electoral districts most affected by climate change being in its locality, Connecting Cabra is determined nobody should be left behind, Gormley, brother of former Green Party leader John, adds. Through Cabra Warmer Homes Project, group members go door-to-door to help residents to apply for retrofitting grants. </p><p>Residents of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Seafield Road in Booterstown</emphasis>, Co Dublin, illustrate how a single action can be impactful   in their case the planting of 60,000 flowering bulbs (seven different varieties) and 60 trees, along a 300m stretch of a residential street. The initiative adds to the visual appeal of a neighbourhood but also plays a crucial role in supporting local biodiversity. Flowering bulbs bloom in succession, providing a continuous source of nectar and pollen throughout the growing season, giving pollinators and other beneficial insects a reliable food source. </p><p>Adding to ecological benefits is an innovative rain garden, designed to efficiently harvest stormwater. This not only mitigates flooding but also promotes  groundwater recharge  ensuring a greener landscape. </p><p>Dublin Landscaping was entrusted with the project, which showcases how, with community engagement, a residential street can become an environmentally friendly haven, benefiting both people and the wider ecosystem. </p><p>The coastal village of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Castlegregory</emphasis>, Co Kerry, illustrates the benefits of building on a TidyTowns platform of consistently ensuring that thriving green areas are well used by local people and visitors, and with minimal littering. In tandem with this, pollinator-friendly planting, use of native trees and a  no spray policy  promoting sustainable, chemical-free practices, allow biodiversity to thrive. </p><p> Castlegregory is a small village with a big environmental commitment, where community, climate action and biodiversity go hand in hand,  says Bettina Pickering, who nominated the village.</p><p>The breadth of activities keeps volunteers  connected and involved , she adds.  Our green efforts go beyond TidyTowns. The community council hosts annual circular economy events ... A tree planting group runs meitheals for native planting in private gardens and the nature park behind the secondary school also uses this space for biodiversity and geopark learning.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Kiltimagh </emphasis>in Co Mayo has a green heart; a 6.5-acre biodiversity park at its centre, which opened last year. It is called Emigrant Park, in tribute to Bill Durkan, a native of the area who emigrated to Britain and donated EUR 100,000 for its creation. </p><p>Gary Smyth of Kiltimagh Amenity Park, a voluntary group that developed the park, says some initial reaction was negative; people said paths were not maintained, some even said  it s too wild . </p><p>But when members explained that no pesticides or herbicides were used in the best interests of biodiversity, attitudes quickly changed.  Now they say,  we love it  ... It s a place to go for a coffee to de-stress.  </p><p>The park has features such as a nesting wall for sand martins, designed to be educational on the importance of nature.  In many ways, it s replicating a bog road,  says Smyth.</p><p>He describes the village as an island surrounded by rivers. This includes the Pollagh,  a bluedot river  indicating that it is one of the highest-quality rivers in the country.  Our community are deeply invested in protecting and enhancing our natural heritage,  says Smyth. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">D\u00fan Laoghaire</emphasis>, Co Dublin, is tilting private car usage towards public transport and active travel   walking and cycling. This has been facilitated by residents backing a  living streets  project, says Claire Macken. </p><p> It will be implemented through 2025-2026. It involves sustainable mobility and public realm improvements. It aims to make our local streets safer and greener, our communities more connected and to keep our economy vibrant,  she explains. </p><p>It is complemented by D\u00fan Laoghaire Harbour Master initiatives, that  reimagine urban spaces to prioritise pedestrians and cyclists and access to the marina, reduce car dominance, and enhance biodiversity with more trees, seating and shared public spaces . </p><p> D\u00fan Laoghaire blends smart urban planning, environmental care and inclusive values, making it a model suburb for green and resilient living in Ireland,  says Rob McCullagh, who nominated it in the suburb category. </p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Farming Rathcroghan</emphasis> project in Co Roscommon is addressing the critical challenges of rural depopulation, sustainable land use and climate change. That alone is challenging in modern Ireland, but the project is operating in an important archaeological landscape. </p><p> The farmland comprising the ancient  royal  landscape of Rathcroghan is a little greener than most, due to the initiative of the local landowners, farmers and the surrounding community,  says Joe Fenwick. </p><p>It was the prehistoric capital of Connacht. Rathcroghan Mound was where the kings and queens of the province were inaugurated in a ritual  mating  with the local Earth goddess. </p><p>Established in 2018, the project is supported by the EU Just Transition Fund, and has 60 participating farming families, with others waiting to join. Its  success can be measured in the positive impact, ambition and cohesion that it has brought to the wider community. It is based on a simple model of collaborative, community-led governance,  says Fenwick. </p><p>It promotes solutions and innovations devised by local people with a view to sustaining fulfilling farming livelihoods, while promoting the stewardship, conservation and protection of the archaeological, ecological and cultural heritage of the area. It also addresses wider environmental concerns; maintaining groundwater quality, carbon sequestration and other actions in support of achieving climate neutrality. </p><p>Those involved have demonstrated the benefits of embracing farming traditions that are as old as the locality s archaeological monuments, Fenwick believes, but also apply modern, imaginative, green innovations. </p><p>The greening of Millbrook, surrounding <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oldcastle Gaelic Football Club s</emphasis> pitches in Co Meath, is a perfect example of starting small and reaping benefits over time. </p><p> [It] shows how the GAA community can contribute to lowering carbon emissions, teaching people about biodiversity and the benefits of green spaces,  says Ealma Purcell. Pitches are surrounded by a walking track beside the river Inny. Extensive recent planting is delivering rich biodiversity. </p><p> Signs carry information for people, and local schools visit for nature walks. We start with a bed of nepeta, adored by pollinators, a hive of buzzing activity. The riverbank is fenced off for safety, allowing it to become a wildlife haven, with otters and a resident heron,  says Purcell. </p><p> We never cut the grass here, making it a totally safe environment for any creature that calls it home, and you can often hear the squeaks of little mammals. We let nettles and all sorts of other native plants [grow], providing food and nesting places for insects and butterflies. We have bird boxes and recently added in 12 fruit trees, the start of our own community orchard.  </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jacksmill</emphasis> is a small farm diversification project in north Wicklow owned by Huw O Toole and his family. Located between Wicklow town and Bray, it is made up of a large forest garden and  Hub13 , a rural remote working hub repurposed from a disused sawmill into studios with co-working and office spaces. </p><p>The garden is 2.8 hectares (seven acres) of regenerated pastoral farmland transformed from heavily sheep-grazed ryegrass. Within the project are various small and family-sized allotments maintained through no pesticide use and deploying  no dig  organic methods. </p><p>Taking over the family farm in 2014,  Huw saw the pronounced decline in insects he remembered seeing in the meadow when he was child. He was asked to sell sites for one-off housing but made a decision instead to enhance the environment and restore lost biodiversity,  says Caroline Costigan, who works there part-time. </p><p>The allotments provide families with space and awareness to care for nature and the opportunity to make sustainable choices to grow their own food, limit food waste and avoid chemicals and excessive plastic packaging. </p><p>Hub13 provides a rural biodiversity-focused workplace to people including creative artists and those who were feeling isolated working at home or were previously commuters on the N11, she adds. It has become,  a thriving blueprint of the resilience of small farms and of how they can be diversified to lead climate and biodiversity action . </p><p>The <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dingle Peninsula-Corca Dhuibhne</emphasis> is a standout example of how sustainability can be multilayered and adopted across a large area embracing every aspect of the local economy. </p><p>It is about joining forces to find solutions that work, says Gr\u00e1inne Kelleher.  Diverse local groups work diligently to help the peninsula move towards being more resilient, having cleaner energy, protecting our natural and beautiful landscape while keeping the local economy strong to ensure a vibrant, liveable place for future generations ... it s about local people having a real say in shaping their community s future.  </p><h> Footprint for good  The concept of a  carbon footprint  has come to be understood as an indicator of our ecological impact on Earth, but it has ignoble origins. </h><p>The idea gained popularity in 2003 when fossil-fuel company BP launched an advertising campaign asking people on the street what their carbon footprint was. It emerged that marketing agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather s brief was to promote the slant that climate change is not the fault of an oil giant, but of individuals. The company unveiled its  carbon footprint calculator  so people could assess how their normal daily life   going to work, buying food and travelling   is largely responsible for heating the globe. Initially, it was a guilt trigger. </p><p>In spite of the sinister motivation of Big Oil, individuals can address their carbon footprint meaningfully; their actions add up to significant impact. However, it is only by collective action   in decarbonising, restoring nature and using water sustainably   that the necessary multiplier effect is deployed. Ireland s Greenest Places shows this type of combined effort is taking root in rural and urban heartlands across the island.</p><p>The Irish Times Ireland s Greenest Places competition is in association with Electric Ireland</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21955342</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1T-K9D3-RRPC-D3VT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2217\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 14, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DNWB</classCode><className>GREENWASHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008ZAI</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp;

The evolution of cultural perspectives is shaped by institutions, by scholars, rebels, and civil-society movements. Pope Francis, who died on April 21, did much to evolve society, pushing towards an eco-centric outlook in which care for all people, and for all of creation, is invited back in to the core of our shared cultural values.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I myself am not religious. However, I remember being intrigued when, in 2015, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato Si'</emphasis> was published.</p><p>In this eloquent, philosophical, and comprehensive encyclical, Pope Francis wrote with fluency about how our consumer-obsessed culture has been driving Earth's planetary systems toward collapse.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato Si</emphasis>' - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Encyclical Letter of the Holy Father Francis on Care for our Common Home</emphasis> is a powerful call for a global ecological 'conversion', for new ways of living that take responsibility for the health and wellbeing of all creatures, as well as for the most vulnerable people on the planet.</p><p>Pope Francis writes with stunning insight about almost every key environmental issue of the 21st century, while continually pairing these challenges with the injustices that arise from ecological destruction.</p><p>'Mother Earth' is referred to as 'sustaining and governing us', a significant shift from the perspective that creation was a gift to man, a set of resources to subdue, control, and exploit. He discusses the disproportionate impact of environmental degradation on the poor and vulnerable, a core moral imperative to urgently tackle both the biodiversity and the climate crises.</p><p>There are many radical statements in the encyclical, such as how \"the cult of unlimited human power.... sees everything as irrelevant unless it serves one's own immediate interests\". In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato Si</emphasis>', Pope Francis also goes in to the specifics of the harm and abuse we have inflicted on Earth's natural systems. There is much about living oceans, including strong critiques of practices such as fisheries discards; overfishing; and the specific means by which coral reefs are being destroyed.</p><p>The encyclical calls for more countries to establish \"sanctuaries on land and in the oceans\" to preserve and restore their ecological integrity, echoing global campaigns for marine protected areas that have been gaining momentum over the past two decades. It criticises the shortfalls in \"the system of governance of the oceans\" and how \"the lack of strict mechanisms of regulation, control, and penalisation\" undermine these efforts to protect oceanic \"global commons\".</p><p>Pope Francis presents impressive detail about the deficits of environmental regulation and participation in decision making, stating how, in assessing technological innovations, \"profit cannot be the sole criterion to be taken in to account\".</p><p>When it comes to the global balance of power, his language is forthright, calling out the extreme inequality that now characterises the world and how this manifests in the destruction of Earths ecosystems.</p><p>He refers, for example, to \"those richly biodiverse lungs of our planet which are the Amazon and the Congo basins\" and how plans to further exploit these vital planetary systems \"only serve the economic interests of transnational corporations\".</p><p>He states that \"politics must not be subject to the economy, nor should the economy be subject to the dictates of an efficiency-driven paradigm of technocracy\" - words that are at least as necessary today as they were 10 years ago.</p><p>Especially relevant in debates that are taking place currently about the role of private investment and market-driven conservation is his statement that \"the environment is one of those goods that cannot be adequately safeguarded or promoted by market forces\".</p><p>This is a momentous work, packed with compelling calls for a profound transformation in the attitudes and behaviours that are embedded in our culture.</p><p>Pope Francis was loud and clear in urging wider recognition of the moral imperative to care for all life on Earth and the mass collective action required to change the status quo.</p><p>I have often asked religious lay people about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato Si's</emphasis> teachings and whether they are filtering in to the messages of the Church here in Ireland or elsewhere. Few had ever heard of the encyclical.</p><p>Pope Francis's intended legacy, his \"urgent appeal\" for a new dialogue about how we are shaping the future of our planet, does not appear to have had much of an influence on the conversations taking place at congregational level.</p><p>Pope Francis's eloquent plea for all his followers to become strong advocates for the Earth has, however, prompted a global grassroots movement around <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato Si'</emphasis>, celebrating his legacy.</p><p>One of the movement's founding members is Scottish-Irish Dr Lorna Gold, a Maynooth-based academic and author and leading voice in climate justice movement in Ireland and beyond.</p><p>In January of this year, Ms Gold became the executive director of the worldwide <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Laudato Si'</emphasis> movement.</p><p>There is hope yet that the depth of compassion and ecological wisdom embodied by Pope Francis throughout his life will be capably carried forward by the movement, especially in combination with other civil-society movements working to effect the trans-formative changes that are necessary to care for our common home.</p><p>There is hope, too, that \"all people\", whom Pope Francis so eloquently addressed his wisdom toward, will be able to overcome individualism, to take urgent action for justice and peace, and awaken a new reverence for life.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pope Francis at \u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in with President Michael D Higgins and Sabina Higgins in 2018 where the late Pontiff planted an Irish oak tree</emphasis>.

At the time, the newly formed Irish Government was just getting up and running. Soon, it would be plunged into weeks of indolence by the exasperating speaking rights row. But, at the time, this particular parish still had faith that ministers would be far more consequential in the short term than they have managed to be.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The healthy congregation that morning - a mix of young families, older people and twentysomething migrants - were asked to pray to God to guide the decisions of those in power. I've heard similar utterances from the altar before, on issues like housing and Gaza. While appeals from priests over the last decade against social reforms like marriage equality and abortion rights have tended to attract more public and media attention, it is often forgotten that the Irish Catholic Church remains a legitimate political constituency in Ireland.</p><p>For any political anorak, an election is an election. So the eyes of the wannabe psephologists of the world are this week trained on the mysterious and almost high-camp machinations of the conclave that is trusted with voting for the next Pope.</p><p>Like any good election, the selection of the next pontiff has activated an intensive lobbying effort. Climate justice activists have stressed the need for the new Pope to continue where Pope Francis's environmental advocacy left off. And there is an international tug of war for the heart and soul of the Catholic Church, with liberals and conservatives arguing between themselves about which decisive direction the world religion should venture towards now.</p><p>In Ireland, we have also been having these conversations for the last few weeks. Theologians and Catholic commentators have been parsing issues like gay rights and marriage equality, a policy on which Pope Francis brought the church right up to a line that it never quite crossed.</p><p>The possible future role of ordained women in the church, the important place of the Vatican in an international political climate that has become hostile to immigration, how radical a plea for peace has become in 2025, and the unfortunately perpetually relevant question in this country about the way the church has - or, more often, has not - responded to heinous child sex abuse have all been interrogated.</p><p>So while our media and political system does recognise the Catholic Church as an important political body, there is an incongruous difference between the way that we talk about the international church and our own domestic one. The Irish Catholic Church only ever seems to be talked about as an institution that has been completely politically neutered. Is that fair?</p><p>Of course, everybody knows that the Irish Catholic Church will always suffer from historic comparison in any conversation about its political relevance. It had a mighty influence in the 20th century in Ireland that not only can't be replicated again, it shouldn't ever be replicated again. However, comparing the Irish Catholic Church to what was almost like theocracy by proxy from the 1930s on is always going to make the religion look like a political force in decline. When really, it could just be a political force in proportion.</p><p>The legacy of the most shameful parts of our social history has left Ireland with a visceral fear of mixing religion and politics. Modern Ireland wants its church and its State as far away from each other as possible, for rational reasons that we all understand. Talking about the church as a political lobbying force makes people suspicious, and it conjures fears of regressive policy efforts. It shouldn't.</p><p>Because Ireland went through radical social change later but at a more intense pace than other European countries, the Irish Catholic Church only exists in the minds of younger people who remember its interventions in recent referenda as a fringe conservative lobby group with a weird and disproportionate focus on sexual morality. The Irish Catholic Church shares a fair proportion of the blame for this.</p><p>If those social issues, which it thankfully lost the argument on, were the only policies of the Irish Catholic Church, then maybe it would be accurate to say it has no political purpose now. But taking the issue of housing as one example, the dominant Irish political issue of this century, the church has a long record of advocacy - including its presence in frontline emergency accommodation services like the Peter McVerry Trust and the Capuchin Day Centre. The Irish Catholic Bishops have also taken a solid line against successive governments on the scandal of the homelessness crisis.</p><p>Considering the well-established position of the church on the issue of migration and the Middle East, I would argue that the Irish Catholic Church might actually have the potential to become more politically relevant than it has been in recent years.</p><p>Why does that matter? Well, because there are plenty of lobby groups and representative bodies who rightly get the platform and attention from the political system that they deserve - who might just happen to represent fewer people than go to mass every week. If you have thousands of people attending a weekly event where inherently political messages are being shared, then that qualifies the Irish Catholic Church as a relevant political force by any reasonable metric.</p><p>The way we talk about the church now often creates images of empty, cobweb-strewn pews. In my personal experience, congregation sizes are healthier than they're often portrayed - especially in urban areas with young migrant populations. And from anecdotal evidence of the effect of shared parishes and cut mass times, I wonder if the vocation crisis shouldn't be the greater concern over mass attendance anxieties.</p><p>A healthy secular political system would recognise the Irish Catholic Church for what it is - a political force, yes, but not a domineering one. The church thankfully doesn't have that mighty mandate of the past anymore, but it still has a moral one that deserves to be listened to.</p><p>'The legacy of the most shameful parts of our social history has left Ireland with a visceral fear of mixing religion and politics'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIIND-204487953</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIIND2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FSC-2863-RS19-W1T5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">304313</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Independent Newspapers Ireland Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Irish Independent</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"40446\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 10, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>National Edition</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

Figures released by the Vatican said approximately 250,000 people had filed past the coffin of Francis in St Peter s Basilica between 11am on Wednesday and 6pm on Friday.</p><p>The Mass in St Peter s Square took place on Saturday morning in glorious sunshine and was celebrated by Dean of the College of Cardinals Giovanni Battista Re (91) who, in his homily, spoke of how the late pope,  despite his frailty and suffering towards the end  still chose  to follow this path of self-giving until the last day of his earthly life .</p><p>He was the Good Shepherd who, the previous Sunday, and  despite his serious health problems, wanted to give us his blessing from the balcony of St Peter s Basilica .</p><p>Recalling  the outpouring of affection that we have witnessed in recent days following his passing from this earth into eternity, tells us how much the profound pontificate of Pope Francis touched minds and hearts , the cardinal said.</p><p>Francis was  a pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone. He was also a pope attentive to the signs of the times and what the Holy Spirit was awakening in the church . </p><h> Pastoral balm  </h><p/><h>Francis s image was of the church as a  field hospital  and he had memorable outreach to migrants and refugees, as exemplified by the visits to Lampedusa, Lesbos and the US-Mexico border.</h><p>Speaking of Francis s 47 trips abroad, Cardinal Re highlighted his visit to Iraq in 2021 as a  pastoral balm  in the context of inter-religious relations. He also noted how Francis, through resolute leadership, had also  immediately made his mark on the governance of the church .</p><p>Earlier, the wooden coffin carrying the remains of Francis had been carried into the square by 14 pallbearers and was laid on a carpeted forecourt of St Peter s Basilica, while  a copy of the gospels was placed on top.</p><p>The Mass itself was as would be found at most Catholic funerals, albeit with the Sistine Chapel Choir and 250 cardinals present as well as upwards of 130 countries represented, including 10 reigning monarchs and about 50 heads of state. </p><p>Among the dignitaries were President Michael D Higgins, Taoiseach Miche\u00e1l Martin, T\u00e1naiste Simon Harris, Northern Ireland First Minister Michelle O Neill, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, British prime minister Keir Starmer and Prince William, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US president Donald Trump.</p><p>One of the abiding memories of the funeral will be the image of Mr Trump and Mr Zelenskiy sitting on two chairs on a marble floor in St Peter s Basilica before the Mass, in intense conversation. </p><p>Mr Trump, Mr Zelenskiy, Mr Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron had a positive meeting on the sidelines of the funeral, it was reported.</p><p>Speaking after the funeral, President Higgins spoke warmly of his five meetings with Francis, his  major revision of the church s relationship to nature and that s something that is very, very strong . The President also mentioned how in dealing with migration from  very, very early on  Francis was  drawing subconsciously on his own family s migrant background . </p><p>The Taoiseach described Francis as  a people s pope who reached out . He was  very inclusive and, in our view, through his pastoral approach won many friends and opened many doors .</p><p>It was, he said,  a particular honour to be here, as Taoiseach , in recognition of  his very strong leadership both spiritually and also in recognition of very strong relationship between Ireland and the Vatican .</p><p>There were, Mr Martin  said,  the many common issues that we worked on together, particularly in the area of climate, foreign policy, human rights and his very strong and fearless stance on war, conflict, particularly, in more recent times, in the Middle East, Sudan and indeed in many areas around the world .</p><p>Mr Harris said  the scale of the global response to his passing and the unprecedented attendance at his funeral speak to the profound impact Pope Francis had during his time as the leader of the Catholic Church . The late pope was  a moral voice on the world stage, advocating tirelessly for peace, for climate justice, for the poor and the displaced. In Ireland, he will forever hold a special place in our hearts for his historic visit in 2018. That visit was a moment of reflection and dialogue, of healing and hope, and it resonated deeply with people of all faiths and none .</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21835977</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FNS-YSJ3-RS51-G4S4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIFM</classCode><className>CATHOLIC POPES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp; CATHOLICISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000309</classCode><className>CLERGY &amp; RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL5A</classCode><className>RELIGIOUS FACILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DM88</classCode><className>ECUMENISM &amp; INTERFAITH RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001461</classCode><className>REFUGEES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp; FOREIGN RELATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST0009EVK</classCode><className>MEDICINE &amp; HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>STX001193</classCode><className>TERRITORIAL &amp; NATIONAL BORDERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000C9Z9</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TOURISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>PE000DAZW</classCode><className>POPE FRANCIS I</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX166</classCode><className>ROME, ITALY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX162</classCode><className>DUBLIN, IRELAND</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC300</classCode><className>VATICAN CITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC342</classCode><className>MEXICO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC320</classCode><className>IRELAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>GC358</classCode><className>IRAQ</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Since the first Earth Day, in 1970, young people have been at the forefront of climate action and activism, because they are the future generations who will inherit the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While Ireland's greenhouse gas emissions per capita have lowered slightly, they are still among the highest in Europe, according to the Central Statistics Office. The <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Lancet Countdown Report 2024</emphasis> found that children born today face malnutrition, a shorter life expectancy, and a myriad of other health hazards caused by the climate crisis.</p><p>Young people are acutely aware of this reality, and it is having a significant impact on their mental health. Research from ECO-UNESCO, carried out in partnership with Spunout, found that 96% of young people are concerned about the climate crisis.</p><p>Half of young people reported feeling anxious and fearful about it. Despite these fears, the climate crisis has also inspired young people: 37% reported that thinking about it made them eager to act.</p><p>This impetus to act has led to some of the largest climate movements in history.</p><p>In 2018, Greta Thunberg, then just 15, began striking from school until her country, Sweden, aligned with the 2016 Paris Agreement.</p><p>Her actions inspired millions of students to take part in global school strikes, pushing the climate crisis up the political agenda.</p><p>The Paris Agreement now binds almost all countries, including Ireland, to reduce the rise in global temperature to below the expected, catastrophic forecast of 2C.</p><p>While many factors, including the pandemic and barriers to participation, have caused the momentum behind these strikes to wane, the majority of young people in Ireland are either involved, or want to get involved, with climate action. The voices of young people continue to be crucial in raising awareness and pushing for meaningful action.</p><p>In Ireland, the intersection of the climate crisis and social inequality is becoming more pronounced. The Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) estimates that a third of households are experiencing energy poverty. This is not only an economic issue, it is a matter of public health. Housing conditions can impact the health of inhabitants, with energy poverty a public health concern in Europe and internationally.</p><p>A study published by ESRI researcher Gretta Mohan found that there are higher odds of respiratory illness among young children in households that experience energy poverty.</p><p>And it is not just children who are vulnerable to energy poverty. People living in rental accommodation, Traveller communities, the elderly, low-income households, and lone-parent families are all also disproportionately affected.</p><p>These vulnerable groups may be at a social disadvantage already, and are likely to be living in houses with low energy efficiency, or unable to keep up with rising energy prices or rent. Any measures taken to combat energy poverty and move away from fossil fuels should take the needs and lived experiences of these groups into account. If not, we risk leaving the most vulnerable in society behind.</p><p>The good news is that energy poverty and the climate crisis are interconnected, and both can be tackled through smart policy decisions.</p><p>These include supporting and promoting the retrofitting of homes and the use of renewable energy by households. However, the responsibility to stop the climate crisis cannot land on the individual, while governments and corporations continue to burn fossil fuels and ignore their binding Paris climate targets.</p><p>While young people may be leading the way on climate justice, urgent Government action is needed to tackle the crisis.</p><p>Earlier this year, a report by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and Climate Change Advisory Council found that if the State continued with its existing climate policies and took no further action, it could be hit with fines or costs of between  8bn and  26bn. This is money that could be better invested in Ireland's future by funding youth mental health services and investing in housing and youth work.</p><p>ECO-UNESCO's research found that 75% of young people felt that not enough was being done to tackle the climate crisis.</p><p>They identified Government policy as one of the key areas that needed to be addressed.</p><p>While some progress has been made, more action is needed.</p><p>With last month the hottest March on record in Europe, and more heatwaves and wildfires expected this summer, the climate crisis is too urgent to be left on the back burner.</p><p>Climate inaction is no longer just an environmental issue, it's a mental health crisis, a public health concern, and a threat to future generations. Young people have been shouting for long enough.</p><p>It's time the Government listens.</p><p>* Rebekah Connolly is the head of content at Spunout, Ireland's youth information and support platform</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Younger people are acutely aware of the impact of environmental destruction because their futures are at stake</emphasis>.

Despite the fact that there was as much as, if not more biographical information about Brigid than there was about Colmcille and Patrick, the Vatican had decided there was insufficient evidence to prove the important Irish saint had ever existed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Historians have questioned if it was possible that the significance of Brigid, who was written about extensively in the seventh century, might have been diminished for sexist reasons.</p><p>Could it be that the unconditional faith that sits at the foundation of Christian spirituality could actually become quite conditional after all when it came to believing that a woman held a very foundational role in what is now the Irish Catholic Church?</p><p>The modern Irish celebration of St Brigid has, ironically, almost detached her from Christianity altogether.</p><p>February 1 has become an individual celebration of Brigid and a day that seeks to mark other strong and fearsome women.</p><p>Catholic purists who are aggrieved by that may only have their own church to blame.</p><p>As articulated by one of the nuns who floated almost wordlessly around the Casa Santa Marta in the 2024 political Vatican drama Conclave: \"We sisters are supposed to be invisible.\"</p><p>When cardinals gather in the coming weeks for the real-life conclave, they will decide not just on the new Pope, but the future of the soul of the Catholic Church.</p><p>Whatever fallible mortal man agrees to take on that mighty burden will have to choose whether or not he wishes to continue with the paradox that Pope Francis set for Catholic women - finally visible, but still very much diminished.</p><p>As has been widely and rightly recognised in the eulogies written for him around the world, Francis was a galvanising and righteous force for good.</p><p>His fidelity to Christian values - particularly towards refugees and those experiencing poverty, and his advocacy for climate justice - made him a radical, because it put him in contrast to an international world order that was often driving as fast as possible in the other direction.</p><p>The binary between authentic and phony Christianity has never appeared in sharper relief than it did when Francis was photographed last weekend with US vice-president JD Vance - one of the poster boys for a US administration that uses a corrupted version of Christianity to fuel its reign of heartless division.</p><p>And in some analyses of his legacy, Francis has been credited for advancing the role of women in the church to a certain degree.</p><p>He appointed women to roles that had previously only been held by cardinals and bishops.</p><p>He also encouraged more of a candid debate about the future role of women in the church, telling women who were critical of either him or the church to speak with courage.</p><p>But what might sound like progress under Pope Francis may have actually presented a new barrier for women.</p><p>While previous Popes had decided that issues like women's ordination were simply not up for debate, Francis had given that argument space never afforded to it before.</p><p>So he heard the testimony of women who wish to serve in greater roles, and still said no.</p><p>It's one kind of slight for women to feel invisible; it's another entirely to know that you were heard, but still had your wishes ignored.</p><p>Francis, who was often criticised for promoting simplistic notions about gender roles, would effectively argue that women were almost too special to be priests and should only serve the church in a kind of motherly role.</p><p>Some progressive theologians have made compelling arguments explaining the ordination of women shouldn't happen in desperate circumstances.</p><p>In other words, the Catholic Church shouldn't decide to ordain women only because it is running out of men who wish to be priests.</p><p>But the ordination of women can be advanced for its own good reasons while also still happening to solve some legacy issues that have dogged the church.</p><p>Francis had devoted much effort to encouraging the Catholic Church to reject clericalism - the superiority complex that often brought clerics away from not just ordinary people but sometimes the basic principles of Christian faith, the most heinous example being the endemic child sex abuse scandals perpetrated and covered up by people of faith.</p><p>There is no question that meaningful female leadership would trigger the exact kind of culture change that Francis himself had advocated for.</p><p>The modern Irish Catholic Church relies heavily on the unpaid work of women for its day-to-day running, and there is a real appetite among the Catholic faithful for women to be able to take on more meaningful senior roles.</p><p>Whether or not the next Pope is brave enough to advance that common sense argument remains to be seen.</p><p>'The modern Irish Catholic Church relies heavily on the unpaid work of women for its day-to-day running'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>St Brigid's Day is now seen as a modern celebration of strong women and has little to do with Catholicism.

'Hear Our Voices' is an action-packed day with inspiring talks, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities focusing on how a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is both a human right and necessary for children to enjoy their rights. The all-day event is about recognising the diverse voices of young people and the existing community of young rights and climate activists, environmental NGOs and academics who are passionate about delivering a 'just transition' movement. Recognising the changes, decision-makers must make to combat the effects of climate breakdown to ensure no one is left behind. Special guests will facilitate workshops and 'walkshops' focusing on advocacy and voice, skills development and creative practices around Greenmount Campus' scenic grounds. To fully immerse delegates in nature as they experience a unique opportunity to share stories, learn from each other, and ensure every voice is heard in the fight against climate and environmental breakdown. The event chair, Sarah Martin from NICCY Youth Panel, said: \"Words procrastinate, but actions build. Actions have consequences, and we want these consequences to be positive steps to restoring a healthy planet where we can fully enjoy our rights.\" Commissioner Chris Quinn will support young people to host the event and will listen to the demands of young people about their local environment. Chris said: \"Children and young people have the right to grow up in a healthy, safe, and sustainable world. Climate change is not just an environmental issue-it is a children's rights issue, impacting all areas of our lives. \"The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child makes it clear that government must protect these rights. In August 2023, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child published 'General Comment 26' explicitly affirming children's right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment. It reinforces children's right to be heard and to hold decision-makers accountable for climate action. \"Our Youth Panel and others from rights and environmental organisations have worked so hard to put this fantastic event together. They have designed, planned and delivered it, and propose a motion in the NI Assembly to reflect young people's views on this crucial issue.

Many higher education institutions now rely on corporate sponsors to plug State funding gaps</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ryanair s CEO, Michael O Leary, has publicly discredited sustainable aviation fuels, calling them a  wheeze . And yet, Ryanair has donated EUR 4m to Trinity College s Ryanair Sustainable Aviation Research Centre. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2016 Trinity College announced that it would divest from fossil-fuel related investments. But, in 2020, it accepted a donation from Cement Roadstone Holdings (CRH) to fund a new professorial chair of climate science. In 2022, CRH emitted 46.5 million tonnes of carbon, more than the combined emissions of the 59 lowest carbon-emitting countries in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At UCC, Meta, the company behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has sponsored an industrial chair of semiconductor technologies at the Tyndall National Institute and the School of Chemistry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These are not anomalies. Rather, according to new PublicPolicy.ie research into funding of Irish universities by researchers at Maynooth University, it is increasingly becoming the norm   and Government policy is clear that the influence of corporates and the private sector is set to grow. </p><p>Indeed, the establishment of technological universities and the Higher Education Act 2022 both play a role in increasing third-level and industry collaboration   especially in science and technology which, in 2022, secured 99 per cent of all industry funding, compared to just one per cent for humanities.</p><p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, State investment in higher education plummeted, with core public funding decreasing by 50 per cent between 2008 and 2019. In 2022, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS) reported a EUR 307m annual funding gap. </p><p>The PublicPolicy paper is authored by Jennie Stephens, professor of climate justice at the Icarus Climate Research Centre in Maynooth University; Dr Conch\u00far \u00d3 Maonaigh, postdoctoral fellow with Maynooth s department of geography; and Laurie Reilly, a research assistant at the geography department. </p><p> International research on industry funding of universities shows that there are several risks,  they write.  It can lead to an erosion of support for academic endeavours that may not be perceived as having commercial value. It can also distract academic attention away from social and economic policies that prioritise human health and ecological health. </p><p> And there is a challenge in preserving the integrity and independence of academia in a higher education landscape increasingly driven by profit-seeking objectives and market-driven priorities. </p><p>Speaking to The Irish Times, the three researchers say there is a significant lack of transparency about the scale and scope of industry funding of higher education. </p><p>Stephens spent some time working in US academia before returning to Ireland, where she studied the influence of the private sector in higher education   and where it has long been recognised that investment in academia buys power and influence.</p><p> Fossil fuels, plastics, technology, chemical and agrichemicals invest strategically in higher education,  Stephens says.</p><p> We know that they are not doing it out of the goodness of their heart. They are strategically investing because they think that investment in universities will help profits, whether through improving their reputation or being able to influence policy, because universities play a big part in setting the discourse for policy options. </p><p> Because the public system is strong, but chronically underfunded, there is more pressure to get money from other sources. </p><p>The source of funding does not necessarily speak to the quality of academic work, says Stephens, and lots of good work can come from industry-funded research.</p><p> But at the agenda-setting level, especially with fossil fuels, it means that companies might fund fossil-fuel friendly technical fixes, such as carbon capture, but not fund science on how to phase out fossil fuels. This is one of the biggest risks. </p><h>Safeguards </h><p/><h>Dr Lisa Keating, director of research and innovation with the Irish Universities Association, says there are safeguards around private research funding to third-level.</h><p> They are subject to rigorous due diligence processes to assess ethical, reputation and strategic considerations before acceptance,  she says.</p><p> When it comes to collaborative research projects, similar safeguards are in place to maintain academic independence and research integrity. These include clear contractual frameworks, conflict of interests declarations [which] help to mitigate risks related to biased research agendas or compromised academic freedom, oversight and review committees and performance and compliance monitoring. </p><p>Keating says universities do not approach industry funding for research as a money-saving exercise. </p><p> In our public universities, industry funding is seen as complementary to State or other funding, such as that from the EU. Many major research programmes have multiple funding sources. </p><p>She says, however, that industry funding cannot fund the sector alone. </p><p> It can support national innovation goals and relieve some burden on the public sector, [but] it cannot replace the foundational role of strong, sustained government investment in research and development   investment that enables research for public good, supports a diverse knowledge base and ensures Ireland s global competitiveness in the long-run,  Keating says.  We have called on the Government to undertake a major research investment programme. </p><p>A spokesperson for Trinity endorsed the comments made by the IUA and added that Trinity worked with industry  because it wants to make things better .</p><p>\u00d3 Maonaigh says industry funding can have public value, but says there is a pressing need for more transparency about who is funding what   and why. </p><p>Industrial funders are allowed to choose whether to keep their contributions confidential, while  commercial sensitivity  means access to information can be routinely denied to both researchers, journalists and the wider public. </p><p> It isn t always possible to know the information that we want,  says \u00d3 Maonaigh.  But we re not looking for the intellectual property of technologies, but simply what is the scale of investment going into certain departments. There is information held in a remote server at the Department of Enterprise, but it is difficult for the public or the academic community to measure it,  he says.</p><p>Reilly struggled to gather comprehensive data for the paper, because the data itself is scant.</p><p> It s so fragmented, even within government departments, so policymakers themselves don t have an accurate picture and map of industry funding,  she says.</p><p> While DFHERIS [the Department of Higher Education] releases some reporting on funding, it is limited. </p><p>With a requirement that publicly funded research centres secure funding from industry, \u00d3 Maonaigh   himself an early-career academic   points out that younger researchers can be particularly vulnerable to corporate pressure.</p><p> Early career academics are struggling with precarious work and lack of funding, so if an organisation comes along offering a salary, it s hard to say no. Perhaps there may be more freedom when someone is more advanced in their career,  he says.</p><h>Openly report </h><p/><h>In response, Keating says all IUA member universities openly report their research projects. </h><p> At any one time, there are a myriad of research projects at various stages of operation. If you look at, for instance, the University of Galway s Combustion Chemistry Centre, you will see the details of the project, including the commercial partners involved in supporting it. </p><p>This, Keating says, helps safeguard academic independence and ensure oversight when companies such as CRH fund research activities. </p><p>Stephens says, however, that private industry funding can constrain academics and research centres by ensuring that only companies with enough wealth get to dictate the agenda in the first place. </p><p> Geothermal energy, for instance, has so much potential, but it doesn t have a powerful lobby group, so it is under-recognised and underinvested. And how secure will academics feel to critique their key or future funders? These are the longer-term consequences that we need to consider. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21820122</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FP0-XY83-S585-V4S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 29, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002S0T</classCode><className>RYANAIR HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0007WNR</classCode><className>CEMENT-ROADSTONE HOLDINGS PLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00023Y2</classCode><className>CRH PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS481111 SCHEDULED PASSENGER AIR TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC4512 AIR TRANSPORTATION, SCHEDULED</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

Flying the fag upside down 'is, according to the US fag code \"a signal of dire distress in instance of extreme danger to life or property\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was appropriate that Yosemite, among the first of the US National Parks, was chosen for this act of resistance against the Trump regime and the chainsaw-wielding billionaire Elon Musk.</p><p>The enormously popular US national park system is among the few areas left in American society enjoying broad support across the political divide. The parks, together with other lands within federal and state protected reserves, are also home to critically important forests, wetlands, and habitats for endangered species.</p><p>The abrupt firing of a thousand workers, including rangers, places the parks in dire peril at a time when their conservation is needed in response to the climate and biodiversity crisis.</p><p>One of the park employees involved in the protest told CNN that \"we're bringing attention to what's happening to the parks, which are every American's properties. It's super important we take care of them, and we're losing people here, and it's not sustainable if we want to keep the parks open\".</p><p>It is, of course, just one aspect of the assault on nature from MAGA republicans and their anarchocapitalist ideologues. Their contempt for public services is driven by a conviction that all taxes are theft, all public spending is squander and that the profit motive for private gain is the only path to human progress.</p><p>Thus we have seen that the attack on the National Park Service is only the tip of the iceberg:</p><p>* Public lands are to be opened to fossil fuel exploitation, more than one million square kilometers of forests are to be felled for timber</p><p>* Terms such as 'pollution' and 'climate justice' are to be censored from federal communications</p><p>* Internationally respected scientific bodies such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are to be defunded and undermined.</p><p>* Even existing electric car charging points at federal buildings are to be switched off.</p><p>\"They just hate the idea that someone might do something that doesn't damage the planet\" veteran environmental campaigner, Bill McKibben, wrote on Bluesky.</p><p>Alas, as we watch in horror from this side of the Atlantic at the puerile vandalism of Trump and his demented cronies, we should not feel that things are going much better at home. A similar attack is underway in Europe. Both the Commission and Parliament in Brussels are now markedly more right wing in their leanings and top of their agenda is dismantling as much of the Green Deal as they can.</p><p>Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who hailed the Green Deal as Europe's 'moon shot' only six years ago, seems happy to lead the dismemberment. She has so far been successful in reducing protections for wolves across the continent, in fagrant contradiction of all the facts. She falsely claimed that \"wolf packs have become a real danger especially for livestock\" despite the fact that EU funds are helping to reduce livestock attacks and promote co-existence with predators in member states.</p><p>It also seems that, in the name of competitiveness, recently-passed laws forcing companies to report their environmental impacts, will be scrapped or watered down. It comes as extremist politicians have environmental NGOs and the EU's environmental funding programme, known as LIFE, in their sights. Untrue claims have been spread that NGOs have been paid by the Commission to lobby in favour of the Green Deal or to \"defame farmers\".</p><p>And it's not just at EU level. Recent months have seen unprecedented pressure on France's environmental enforcement authority, the Office Fran\u00e7ais de la Biodiversit\u00e9 (OFB), including the ransacking of offices and threats from farming unions to burn out their cars should they enter farmland. France's new prime minister, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, joined the attack in January, prompting the staff of the OFB to go on strike.</p><p>This echoes calls in Ireland in recent years for An Taisce, an NGO, to be defunded, and its status as a statutory consultee in the planning process revoked, due to its staunch defence of the public's right to clean water, and attacks by many politicians on the Environmental Protection Agency and its data showing how water quality is deteriorating due to farming practices.</p><p>In the US, the 'Alt National Park Service' has emerged as leading the resistance to Trump &amp; Musk online, amassing millions of followers on Facebook, Bluesky and other platforms.</p><p>In Europe, however, the response to the roll-back of the Green Deal has been muted. Perhaps the political leadership on this side of the Atlantic are less unhinged at this moment, but it doesn't mean they don't want the same outcome.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture 1, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A US flag is hung upside down below the Upper Yosemite Falls during a protest against federal employee layoffs at Yosemite National Park, California </emphasis>.

Allowing LNG could \"further entrench fossil fuel dependence and risk forfeiting a tremendous opportunity to transition towards a cleaner, more secure energy system\".</p><p>\"The vision of ending our dependence on costly and polluting imported energy to secure our energy supply and meet our international climate change commitments is attainable with your leadership,\" the experts wrote.</p><p>The letter is signed by Irish academics Professor Hannah Daly, Professor in Sustainable Energy, University College Cork;

So it wasn't that the word 'sustainable' was something I wanted to have in my clothing brand, it was why I started. Nature was in every single part of what I was doing, from my inspiration to my fabric sourcing. It was so seamlessly integrated into my process.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A huge part of my ambition as a fashion designer is to try to redesign the Irish and international fashion industry to offer more transparent and circular fashion where we don't create any waste.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pat Kane</emphasis>: I would blame [my passion] on my grandmother. We grew up with her growing her own vegetables, raising her own animals. Not to eat them but more just to have them around, which was lovely to see. I was raised by the sea in Rio de Janeiro. The sea was my garden so there was always that respect going on - it was a natural fit.</p><p>I'm the founder of Reuzi, Ireland's one-stop shop for sustainable living goods to help reduce household waste.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dr Tara Shine</emphasis>: To go back to where my interest in sustainability comes from, it predates the word, I guess. That's how old I am. But, in less glamorous surroundings of Kilkenny rather than Rio de Janeiro, I had a similar love for nature and curiosity about the natural world.</p><p>I trained as an environmental scientist. I'm lucky because it has taken me all around the world as a climate change negotiator, as an adviser to different governments and international agencies. After eight years of travelling with Mary Robinson as part of the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, I decided to turn my attention to Ireland. That led me to write a book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">How to Save Your Planet One Object at a Time</emphasis>, and to set up Change by Degrees.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor Spacey</emphasis>: I'm 37 years cooking, which is long before the word 'sustainability' even appeared or anyone knew what it was. I founded a company 10 years ago called FoodSpace. I work on food systems here in Ireland but on a global level as well.</p><p>I brought out my first book two years ago, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wasted</emphasis>, which is based on food waste. That was always my thing - people at home [and] showcasing simple little hacks and changes that they can make to stop food waste in their home.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On sustainability being a 'trend'</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor</emphasis>: I do struggle with the word 'sustainability' because I think it has kind of lost its meaning, to be quite honest.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pat</emphasis>: I completely agree and I'm not in the field for so long. I come from a different world, but I think greenwashing is a big problem - people using the word just because they can.</p><p>I feel like it has become the trendy little thing. You see content creators who are being sponsored by fast fashion suddenly talking about sustainable fashion. Because it's cool. It feels like you can just use the word - you don't have to find any depth in knowledge or the understanding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: I would say, though, I've seen a lot of these words come in and out over the years... but the overriding response we get in Change by Degrees when we help people understand what sustainability is - is surprise. They didn't know that sustainability was about human rights; they didn't know it was about their health and wellbeing; they didn't know it was about the representation of women in minorities in decision making - they just thought it was about boring old carbon and pollution.</p><p>Helping people to understand what the word means so they're also better able to hold the people who use it incorrectly to account is, I think, important. Just throwing the word in the bin isn't going to solve the problem. But I understand the frustrations. I have those too.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: It's funny - it was two years into my business and I was creating these sustainable clothes but I felt like I wasn't getting through to people. I felt like I was just talking about sustainability but I wanted to do more. It was two years in that I started to do Rewilding Retreats.</p><p>It was all about really getting people in and - as you said, Tara - educating people on what sustainability actually means; what having a conscious mindset actually means. Education is the biggest part of my role nowadays.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On politics, the pandemic, and where the world stands now</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor</emphasis>: I think there's a lot of really good stuff going on and it's masked by what's going on in the States and so on in terms of corporations and political moves. Do I believe that Trump can deliver on anything that he's threatening to deliver? I don't. I'm not in any way political but I don't think he'd be allowed to.</p><p>When the big corporations which are already taking a hit, when they are affected, it will stop because at the end of the day that's where the money is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: I'm really frustrated with the state of the world in this current moment. I see an amazing lack of leadership. That failure is also an opportunity, I hope, for new leaders to be inspired enough to step in so our kids might grow up with a different style of leadership. I think what's really important is we don't all get dispirited and just switch off but rather to say, 'I'm going to use my sphere of influence to make the best impression,' do good for people, do good for the planet. Get reenergised by that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pat</emphasis>: I do think in some ways we have regressed since the pandemic and the political climate. Sometimes these kinds of things tend to favour short-term solutions over the long-term sustainability initiatives we need to see. Now, we are looking at economic recovery, trying to deal with any sort of immediate issues around immigration, jobs, health. But I do think in many ways we have progressed as well. I'm seeing people become more conscious of individual impact, local sourcing is becoming more common; I see this with clients. There is a rise in sustainable consumption practices.</p><p>I do think there's growing public pressure for bigger systemic changes in areas of renewable energy, reducing waste, transportation. Even if I compare my little journey here over the past eight years, people were asking me, 'What are you doing? Are you crazy?' And now everybody is like, 'This is it. We have to do it.' I do feel like, as a collective, we're more conscious on where we need to go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: It's a hard one, isn't it, because there is so much hopelessness sometimes that people feel with sustainability but I think all of us here are very hopeful - that's probably why we're all in these sectors. You have to be hopeful when it comes to this, especially with what's happening in the world.</p><p>We're filming a documentary at the moment all around the impact the fast fashion industry is having on our planet. I was over in Kenya at Dandora landfill, one of the biggest landfills in the world, and it was so heartbreaking and so scary to see. But what it also gave me was hope, because when I talked about it and when I shared the message online - the amount of interest - I could see people actually cared.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On what the future looks like</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: A crisis is always an opportunity for growth and disruption. If you remember back to covid, we talked about building back better. Do you remember that expression? We were going to learn the lessons of a global pandemic and we were going to do things differently. We haven't. We've just gone back to doing things exactly like we used to.</p><p>That's a very frustrating part of human nature. When we have such a deep experience, a lived experience, why doesn't it change how we do things?</p><p>Now we're in the midst of another crisis around cost of living, around the great geopolitical changes in the world... so again we have an opportunity to say, 'OK, in all of this mayhem, what's going to emerge from this?'</p><p>As people who care about other people and people who care about nature, that's where we need to be putting our heads together and getting organised and figuring out how we're going to find a way out of this current situation and into something better.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: What I'd love to see is more of this conscious mindset coming in and that people understand that if they do invest in this garment, they will hand it down from generation to generation.</p><p>Another big thing that I want to see come to life more is understanding the ingredients. It's very similar to food. Having better quality ingredients in what you have is not only better for the planet but also better for yourself. It's the same for fashion. The material I'm wearing now is sustainable wool - Irish woven fibre - and is much better than wearing a polyester fibre and then, if you're looking at the lifecycle of that garment, you're starting from nature, you're ending in nature.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: I do not know why women accept to be dressed in plastic. I don't get it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: I feel like sometimes a lot of people don't even know what polyester is actually made of. Or don't want to know.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor</emphasis>: Same as food. People don't actually realise what it means. Because these items are given different names, it disguises the fact of what they are, and I see that in food as you see it in fashion, Aoife.</p><p>It's set up in a way that you have to google what you're wearing - because on the label it's going to say 30% cotton, 70% polyester, or whatever it is, and [they're] not realising its plastic. There's more plastic in that top than your credit card.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On where to start and why we don't have to be perfect</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor</emphasis>: People are more and more aware but, with that, comes people being overwhelmed. They don't know where to start.</p><p>My youngest - she's 14 now - goes to McDonald's. I'm not going to say she doesn't. She goes with her friends and she has chicken nuggets. I've shown her the videos. I've shown her what the chicken nugget is.</p><p>I was driving her one day from school and she said, 'Can we go to the drive-thru?' And I said, 'You hardly want to get chicken nuggets. I told you - it's beaks, it's eyes...' She goes, 'Hang on a minute, you're all about food waste so, if that chicken is being killed, should we not be eating all of it?' This is where you have this young generation who think they know it all and they have smart answers and we have the parents who are trying to make changes. They are aware but they're overwhelmed.</p><p>It's [all about] making out positive, little steps - easy wins that give you confidence. All of a sudden, when you see these changes happening in your home, you kind of go, 'Wow, I can do that.' Don't set yourself up to fail. Be positive. Plan out. Make easy wins.</p><p>I know time is not on our side but, to bring people on the journey, I always say - set out a year,a 12-month plan. In my home, what am I going to do? Make it accessible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pat</emphasis>: Coming from my area of sustainable living, I would say try to embrace sustainable habits in your daily routine. Start with something very simple yet impactful.</p><p>It's not a massive lifestyle change. It's a small thing you can do. I'm always coming from a place where I'm encouraging people to audit their lifestyle. Look inside your bins and see what it is that you're wasting the most? It's such a small thing but, at the end of the week, what went into our bins? If there's a lot of food packaging, can I do better on that front? If there's a lot of composting waste, what happened there? Why did we throw away so much food?</p><p>It's not a cake recipe. We're not all going to all have the same issues because we have different lifestyles but understanding the problem and setting up your goals and what 'good' looks like could be a good place to start.</p><p>It is cost effective. I would love for people to start seeing that. Why would you go for a fashion haul when you can buy a very good piece or an item that will last you for years?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: For me, it's can you do something small? Can you look to second-hand? Can you set up a vault on your account to start saving for that investment garment?</p><p>When you invest in something, when you spend that money and save for it, you really do appreciate it so much more than that fast-fashion or that cheaper purchase that you're not as connected to.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: Sustainability doesn't belong to green people. It belongs to everybody, and everybody belongs in the conversation. That is not a conversation for people who are perfect.</p><p>Conor just said he's not perfect. His kids eat McDonald's, my kids eat McDonald's. That's how it is. There is no perfect in this.</p><p>Know where your food comes from, read the label on your clothes, be curious. Then take an action. Do something different. When you take that action, think about how that makes you feel. Human beings are driven by emotional stories so tell the story of your action, not in a preachy way but rather like, 'It felt so good because I did this.'</p><p>Your friends and family and colleagues trust you and listen to you more than any politician, any expert. You are their biggest influencer and that is the great untapped power.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">From left: Pat Kane, Aoife McNamara, Conor Spacey, and Tara Shine say you can make a big difference to the environment by embracing sustainable habits in your daily routine</emphasis>.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRIEX-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRIEX2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FWD-G6P3-RW4C-72WP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315447</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2120\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Landmark Digital Media Ltd.

For a kind of brightness that wasn't about youth, but about seeing. You'd walk barefoot through the grass - wet, wild, alive - and you'd know, if only briefly, what it felt like to belong to the earth instead of owning it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People tied red ribbons and flowers around cattle for protection. They lit fires not just for spectacle but to call in the summer, to purify the herd, to keep illness at bay. It wasn't quaint. It was fierce. Tenderness and survival are intertwined.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some said it was the season of <url normalizedValue=\"https://irishfolklore.wordpress.com/2017/04/30/the-folklore-of-may-day-bealtaine/\">butter stealing</url>\u00a0- that come Bealtaine, the veil thinned not only between worlds, but between hands - what was yours might not stay yours. The churn might turn hollow. The cow might dry up. A neighbour's glance could curdle cream. The land, newly green and trembling with promise, was also thick with risk.<br/></p><h>May and fertility</h><p>We often speak of May Day as a festival of flowers, of fertility, of warmth returning to the land. But we forget how closely joy was braided with fear. That same May morning when bonfires blazed on hilltops and young people leapt the flames for luck, doors were bolted, fires watched, and wells guarded like treasure chests - not for what they held, but for what they might lose.</p><p>In the stories passed down, those suspected of butter theft were almost always women. Poor, widowed, solitary or simply somehow deemed 'odd'. A woman who asked for coal or a cup of milk on May morning might be enough to draw suspicion. <url normalizedValue=\"https://irishfolklore.wordpress.com/2017/04/30/the-folklore-of-may-day-bealtaine/\">\"Don't give anything away,\" people said. \"No fire, no milk, no water, no gifts</url>.\"</p><p>And so, in some parts, the countryside became a landscape of vigilance.</p><p>There were tales of old women dragging spancels - straw ropes used for cattle - through the dew of a neighbour's field, stealing milk with each slow sweep. Of hares spotted suckling on cows' udders at dawn. Of men chasing them with dogs, only to find, later, an injured woman behind a bolted door.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nli.ie/news-stories/stories/there-once-was-welsh-priest-called-gerald\">Giraldus Cambrensis, </url>writing in the 12th century, tells of such transformations: women becoming hares, slipping through fences, stealing sustenance with teeth and tongue.</p><p>Shape-shifting, in these stories, is rarely a gift.</p><p>It is almost always a crime.</p><p>There was the threat of the well being \"burned\" by cinders dropped into it, a kind of curse cast by a visitor who came too early and left too fast. If the wrong person took the first water of the day, it could rob the community of its milk profit for the whole year. In response, families rose early. Some stayed up all night to guard the well. Others fetched the \"flower of the well\" before dawn and fed it to their cattle as protection.</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6690675/original/?width=580&amp;version=6690675\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>These rituals of defence were intricate and intimate. Rowan branches and yellow primroses were strung over doorways. Butter churns were chained. Bonfire smoke was gathered in bowls and carried back to the hearth. Holy water was sprinkled on animals. Some struck their cows with a quicker-berry switch to drive out the invisible.</p><h>The past and the present</h><p>It would be easy now to dismiss these practices as quaint or backwards. But they weren't just stories. They were systems of care. Memory-maps for surviving hunger, illness, isolation. And yes, they were also tools for control. For identifying enemies. For managing fear.</p><p>These customs also remind us of how gender, vulnerability, and power are deeply entangled. The accused were never random. They were women who lived alone. Women who owned little. Women who asked questions or offered herbs. Women whose usefulness had run out - or who refused to be used at all.</p><p>That logic is alive and well today.</p><p>We see it in the return of far-right rhetoric. In attacks on reproductive rights. In the demonisation of migrants. In how queerness, difference, dissent and refusal are once again made to stand trial in the court of public opinion. We see it in the algorithms. In the microphones of men who want women quiet and borders hard. In every politician who claims neutrality is outdated, as though peace were a luxury, not a commitment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6690668/original/?width=580&amp;version=6690668\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Here in Ireland, the debate around potential changes to our neutrality is one of the clearest signs of this erosion. For decades, our military neutrality rested on the principle that any deployment required the approval of the UN Security Council, the government and the D\u00e1il. The Triple Lock has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2025/03/04/cabinet-signs-off-on-proposals-to-scrap-triple-lock-for-troop-deployments/\">now been loosened</url>. We are told it is pragmatic. Strategic. And yes, admittedly, we have a determined warmonger in Russia's Putin at the doors of Europe. The world is changing, and we have to acknowledge that. But this does signal a profound shift: from protection to participation. From principled caution to silent complicity.</p><p>Bealtaine, if we let it, can help us ask better questions.\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://irishpagan.school/\">Lora O'Brien and Jon O'Sullivan</url>\u00a0remind us that Bealtaine is not just about flowers and fire. They see it as a time to renew our commitment to protection, both practical and sacred. In their teachings, they urge us to walk the boundaries, to gather yellow blossoms, to cleanse our thresholds - not just with smoke or water, but with intention. Most importantly, they ask us to reflect on: What are we protecting? What needs to change? These are not abstract reflections, but urgent political questions. Around us, wars rage. Genocides unfold in real time. Governments fail or actively harm. Climate collapse accelerates. The bonfire on the hill cannot shield us from this. But it can still remind us of who we are when we gather around it.</p><h>Looking inward</h><p>From the <url normalizedValue=\"https://uisneach.ie/bealtaine/\">Hill of Uisneach</url> right across Ireland to <url normalizedValue=\"https://feilenabealtaine.ie/\">Dingle town,</url> Bealtaine is still celebrated, and regional traditions are embraced. The Uisneach Fire Festival brings people together to honour the sacred centre of Ireland, where flames are lit and rituals shared - part resistance, part renewal. In Dingle, where the Atlantic meets myth, Bealtaine is marked with seaside blessings, floral garlands and community walks that call in the season through joy and care.\u00a0</p><p>In Killorglin,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/maydaykerry/\">the Bealtaine festival</url> founded by the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kfest.ie/news/remembering-conor-browne-a-pillar-of-k-fest-and-the-killorglin-community/\">late Conor Browne </url>continues to grow, bringing together art, ritual, music and politics in ways that honour both ancestral memory and urgent present-day solidarities between people, land and the spirit of collective care. Folklorists and historians like <url normalizedValue=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/bealtaine-the-hill-of-uisneach-handfasting-and/id1484857885?i=1000653706285\">Shelly Mooney in Wexford </url>and <url normalizedValue=\"https://tradition.ie/folklore/\">Billy Mag Fhloinn in Kerry</url> have worked to recover and reimagine these traditions for new generations. MagFhlionn's contributions to F\u00e9ile na Bealtaine in Dingle bring a theatrical and communal energy to contemporary celebrations, bridging folklore and embodied practice in vivid, provocative ways, most notably through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://tradition.ie/pagan-rave/\">Pagan Rave Project</url>.</p><p>These revivals matter because they resist the hollowing out of seasonal knowledge and communal time. They hold open a space where slowness is not failure, where repetition is not redundancy, but remembrance. They remind us that ritual can still be a form of resistance - a way to insist on presence in a world that demands acceleration, distraction, forgetting.</p><p>To gather, to light a fire, to walk the bounds of your place: these acts are quiet refusals. Of extraction. Of disposability. Of the myth that we are separate from the land, or from one another.</p><p>And yet, even as these festivals flourish, they do so in tension with a broader landscape of loss - ecological, spiritual, civic. A world where the weather is stranger, the soil more tired, the commons ever more divided. Where the rituals may survive, but the conditions they once protected against now roar louder than ever.</p><p>And now somehow the dew is harder to find. The grass is fenced off, chemically treated, bought up by developers who speak of land as \"assets\" and rain as \"risk.\" The bonfires still burn - but now they're surrounded by hazard tape, or else condemned entirely.</p><p><br/></p><p>What we once did to honour the season, to mark our kinship with soil and seed, we now outsource to corporations who sponsor tree-planting drives while cutting down forests elsewhere.</p><p>But still. Still, the impulse remains. In the rise of community gardens on vacant plots. In the school strike signs that say there is no planet B, and the fierce clarity in young faces. In people standing between bulldozers and bogland. In the quiet refusals - the ones who walk the canal instead of shopping, who repair instead of replace, who share instead of hoard. In the faces of the young, and the brilliant students I am privileged to teach at DCU, who ask sharp questions, who volunteer, who understand advocacy and activism, who imagine better ways of living together, even when the news tells them not to. In students across Ireland and the world who refuse despair, and make solidarity into practice.</p><h>Irish spirit</h><p>Bealtaine was never about passive celebration. It was a reckoning. A refusal to surrender to coldness. A flare to say: life matters here. And we will guard it, if we must, with flame.<br/><br/>And flame, of course, is never singular.</p><p>There is the fire that razes, that bombs, that incinerates. But there is also the fire of communion. Of bonfires lit not just to warm, but to warn. To gather. To signal across distance. To hold space. There is the fire of protest. Of workers who walk out. Of marches that clog streets with possibility. Of vigils, songs, fists - not only lifted in fury, but in collective clarity.</p><p>This, too, is May Day.</p><p>Because May Day belongs not only to the land, but to those who labour upon it, and beyond it. To the ones who rise up when the land is hoarded, when care is undervalued, when work is invisibilised. It is the day of garment workers and carers, dockers and teachers, farmhands and freelancers. It is etched in union banners and whispered at kitchen tables. It reminds us that labour isn't just what's waged - it's what's required for any of us to survive.</p><p>May Day insists that these labours, too, are sacred. That fire isn't only for mourning or warning, but for insisting: another way is possible. So yes, Bealtaine is about butter and blossoms - but also about barricades. About collective bargaining. About housing that doesn't break us. About reproductive autonomy. About climate justice. About rights-rights not as theory, but as breath. As bone.</p><p>And so, yes. It's easy now to say the world is on fire and mean it literally. Australia, the US and Greece. The Amazon. Gaza. Khartoum. Our housing systems. Our summers. The temperature rises like a pulse, like the rage we've tried too long to suppress.</p><p>And yes, despite everything that's been stolen - butter, land, futures - we still gather. Still tend. Still leap the flames. Not because we are untouched by grief, but because grief has taught us how to protect what remains.</p><p>The rituals may have shifted shape, but their core still holds.</p><p>We face the thresholds together - barefoot, trembling, bright with defiance - lit by what we still carry: the courage to imagine otherwise.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dr Fiona Murphy is an anthropologist based in the School of Applied Language &amp;

My sister-in-law in South Pasadena fled with her family to San Diego to escape the approaching wildfires. Someone who had worked with my sister has lost her home to the fires, as has the mother-in-law of a neighbour from Dublin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As I write, the death toll is 24 people, and is likely to rise. Meanwhile, the red and orange imagery on our screens looms large. There s a shot of Sunset Boulevard with flames behind, and the Hollywood sign with smoke and flames in the distance. Some video footage from the Malibu coast road brought to life Cormac McCarthy s post-apocalyptic novel The Road.</p><p>It felt similar two months ago when I was in Barcelona speaking at a conference on  decarbonising architecture . News started coming into people s phones about the floods in Valencia, just a few hours south, and hundreds of lives were being lost as we spoke about the imperative for climate action. These events are starting to repeat themselves; it must be a call to greater action.</p><p>Last week s news from the EU s Copernicus Climate Change Service was more than worrying. 2024 was the warmest year on record globally, and the first calendar year that the average global temperature exceeded 1.5 degrees above its pre-industrial level. </p><h>Short-term gain </h><p/><h>We cannot simply kick the can down the road and say we ll act at some unspecified date in the future. And yet, despite the ever-growing body of evidence, and the climate catastrophes that have struck European countries, the European People s Party led by Manfred Weber continues with its green-bashing, attacking climate policies for short-term political gain. </h><p>By delaying the solutions urgently needed to curb the devastation of extreme weather events, centrist and right-wing parties are failing to protect the people, both today and for future generations. Climate justice delayed is climate justice denied.</p><p>Obfuscation, delays and denial are not only being used by national political leaders on both sides of the Atlantic, similar tactics can also be found closer to home. </p><p>Here, some columnists, business groups and commentators have queried plans to reduce our emissions in Ireland. The Bus Connects plan? But how will drivers get to the car parks? Maintain flight levels at Dublin Airport? Not a chance: the Airport Authority states that  there is unequivocal national demand for air travel which is essential to Ireland as an island state . Safe segregated cycle lanes? The Greens  have turned Dublin into a spaghetti junction of cycle lanes that have divided the city like East and West Berlin , says the Fine Gael MEP Regina Doherty. </p><h>Moral imperative </h><p/><h>Even now, as we face fires of Biblical proportions in Los Angeles, we have Fianna F\u00e1il saying the 2:1 ratio of expenditure between new public transport and new roads spending enshrined by the previous government is probably  open for discussion . It seems like we are going back to the future with an incoming government that may endorse policies that continue with business as usual.</h><p>There is a moral imperative to act, but there are also financial reasons for doing so. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has warned that the State could face a cost of EUR 20 billion if it fails to achieve reductions in carbon emissions by 2030. The new government must therefore continue to invest in public transport route improvements, lower fares, and ramp up retrofit supports. These measures tackle energy poverty, improve air quality, save people money on bills and help the planet. </p><h> A just transition Over the last five years I worked in the European Parliament on a European Green Deal that lays the foundation for action in the years ahead. We passed around 20 separate laws that tackle deforestation, support renewable fuels for aviation and shipping, encourage the renovation of our building stock and ensure a just transition. </h><p>The Nature Restoration Law, even reduced in scope, will help reset our relationship to the natural world to keep us safer. It is important that this work continues. If we do this right, we will improve the quality of people s lives. It can provide decent employment for businesses small and large, and it can reduce the risk of extreme weather events in the future. </p><p>Political decision-making requires courage. The incoming government must rise to the climate challenge and continue the work started in Ireland and Europe.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Ciar\u00e1n Cuffe was a Green Party MEP from 2019 to 2024 and is co-chair of the European Green Party</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ITIMES-21577501</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ITIMES2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DWM-56J3-RWN9-300V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">142626</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"755\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Irish Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Irish Times</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>January 14, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Business &amp;
