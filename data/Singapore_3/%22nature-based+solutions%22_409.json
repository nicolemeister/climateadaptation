Environment. </p><p> Hence, under a high-emissions scenario, the projected rates of sea-level rise by 2150 would be faster than any other period in the last 21,500 years.</p><p> Under a moderate-emissions scenario, the scientists had statistically estimated that rates of sea-level rise were last exceeded only when ice rapidly melted during the last deglacial period between 9,000 and 14,000 years ago, which also led to significant landscape and population changes in South-east Asia. </p><p> Dr Shaw noted that the projected rates of sea-level change under moderate- to high-emissions scenarios could also make it difficult for coastal ecosystems such as mangroves to survive. </p><p> Mangroves buffer the coastline from major storm events and sea-level rise. </p><p> A 2020 study by NTU found that existing mangrove habitats may not survive beyond 2050 if sea levels continue to rise at rates above 7mm per year. The current rate of increase is 4mm a year.</p><p> \"The difference between our future climate pathways is clear. A low-emissions pathway that slows the rate of sea-level rise allows nature-based solutions such as mangroves to thrive and continue providing many ecosystem services,\" Dr Shaw added.</p><p> The MSS spokesman also noted that the mean sea-level rise projections may vary at different locations in Singapore, depending on factors such as local vertical land motion changes, including sinking land, and ocean circulation changes.</p><p> The ongoing work at the Centre for Climate Research on Singapore's sea-level projections, as part of the Third National Climate Change Study (V3), would potentially narrow down the current range of uncertainty at different locations. </p><p> The V3 study, which will be completed by September, looks to provide localised and advance climate projections for South-east Asia, particularly Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-4U3C527</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68SC-3WW1-DYX4-0197-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"774\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

We're working to grow our economies even faster and even fairer through the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, of which Singapore was an early and enthusiastic supporter,\" he said. </p><p> He noted that Singapore is also a critical security partner, \"hosting American ships and aircraft, sending pilots to train in the skies above Arizona and Idaho\". </p><p> He said: \"For six decades now, the strategic partnership between the United States and Singapore, rooted in respect for the rules-based international order, has helped strengthen peace and stability in the region and around the world.\" </p><p> Dr Balakrishnan said the deep economic relationship reached far beyond trade. </p><p> \"Singapore's investments into the United States and US exports to Singapore in fact support more than... 250,000 jobs in America itself,\" he said. </p><p> \"So... it's not just about trade for its own sake, but also in terms of jobs and opportunities for people on both sides.\"</p><p> He noted: \"On the bilateral front, everyone knows that we've got a very robust economic relationship.</p><p> \"But we haven't stood still. We're also expanding into new frontiers.\"</p><p> In addition, the US' strategic presence and contribution have provided stability and opportunity in the region, and \"helped to underwrite the peace which we should never take for granted\", said Dr Balakrishnan.  </p><p> \"The fact that President (Joe) Biden attended the Asean summit in Phnom Penh last year, and the President also hosted the Asean-US Special Summit in Washington in May last year... sent a very strong signal of engagement,\" he said. </p><p> The elevation of Asean-US relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2022 is \"not just a form of words, but the real substance, the real deal\", he added.  </p><p> Dr Balakrishnan said the US' strategic engagement in South-east Asia was of critical importance to the region.</p><p> \"And... there is in fact a deep reservoir of goodwill and trust, and you have many partners in the Asia-Pacific,\" he said. </p><p> Asean is at the heart of the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy, Mr Blinken reiterated.</p><p> \"The United States supports Asean's centrality, and we see a considerable convergence between our own Indo-Pacific Strategy and Asean's Outlook on the Indo-Pacific, epitomised by a shared belief in inclusive economic growth, transparency, and the rule of law,\" he said. </p><p> Dr Balakrishnan also underscored the importance of Mr Blinken's trip this weekend to Beijing, where he will meet Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang and other officials. </p><p> \"There are many global, planetary issues -- climate, pandemics, even cyber security -- which require the United States and China to work off the same page and be key pillars for a global system, which will help increase resilience to threats to welfare, health, and prosperity for people all over the world,\" he said. </p><p> He added: \"More than ever... as the world transits into a multipolar world... we need a rules-based multilateral system with institutions and processes fit for purpose, updated where necessary.</p><p> \"And again, this requires the United States and China to achieve a modus vivendi.\"</p><p> Dr Balakrishnan is on a working visit to the US until Tuesday. </p><p> He has met senior climate officials in the Biden administration, as well as Democrat and Republican lawmakers focusing on Asia and China legislation. </p><p> Dr Balakrishnan is due to travel to New York as well, where he will deliver Singapore's national statement on marine biodiversity at the United Nations on Monday.</p><p> While in New York, he will meet UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UN General Assembly president Csaba Korosi. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken at a joint press conference in Washington on Friday.

Unlike past reports issued by global bodies like the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that also warned about climate effects, the latest report from Singapore bears greater scrutiny as it is a deeper dive into how the country's weather will become more extreme in the coming years. The findings include predictions on specific shifts in temperature, sea level rise, rainfall and wind by the end of the century and beyond, based off a more \"accurate simulation\" of regional climate changes on a finer scale, said the agencies behind the report. Should global emissions almost double by 2050 under the worst-case scenario, for example, Singapore's average temperatures could shoot up by 0.55\u00b0C per decade, among other possible impacts. This would be a faster pace of increase than the 0.24\u00b0C per decade observed in the past 40 years, according to Singapore's third national climate change study, also known as V3. Conducted by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore, which is under the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS), V3 provides updates on the national climate change projects over V2, the previous study done in 2015. Three governmental bodies including the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) said in a joint press release on Friday that the latest study was based on several global climate models taken from the sixth assessment report published last March by the IPCC. </p><p>The bodies said that these findings will be taken into account by the Government in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure the country remains climate resilient. Experts told TODAY that the findings were concerning, with possible impacts on physical health and infrastructure, among other things. Read on as TODAY delves into V3's findings, why people living here should be concerned and what actions the authorities here are taking in light of the findings. HOW FINDINGS WERE CUSTOMISED TO SINGAPORE In exploring the possible range of outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by the year 2100, V3's projections are: A low-emissions scenario where net zero targets are achieved globally after 2050 and temperatures rise by 1.8\u00b0C by end-century A middle-of-the-road scenario where emissions hover around current levels before they start to decline by 2050 and temperatures rise by 2.7\u00b0C by end-century A high-emissions scenario where emissions almost double by 2050 and temperatures rise by 4.4\u00b0C by end-century It does not offer IPCC's best-case scenario, where net zero targets are achieved globally by 2050 to meet the Paris Agreement goal, and temperatures rise by 1.5\u00b0C. V3's study selected six global climate models and downscaled them. Then, taking a modelling system used here to generate weather forecasts, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore created a customised modelling system to run its studies. Through this customised system, the scenarios are then simulated based on an 8km domain for the region, and a 2km domain for Singapore. This means that the V3 study had a much clearer projection over a larger area than the V2 study in 2015, and it is also more accurate. WHY SHOULD YOU CARE? Experts told TODAY that the V3 report findings are a stark reminder that Singapore and the world need to act swiftly to reduce carbon emissions and act on climate change. Associate Professor Jason Lee from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine at the National University of Singapore (NUS) said that the most concerning part was the report's findings that hotter days and nights were on the horizon in all three scenarios. \"We'd better be alarmed and this alarm should trigger a sense of urgency to take actions at all levels proactively and not reactively,\" he said. \"(More warm nights) means that we will reach a point in time that we will progressively feel the heat even while resting without no cooling aids.\" Professor Winston Chow of Singapore Management University whose research is on urban climate said that the warm nights could lead to health problems as people get poor sleep, and it could also start a vicious circle of producing more emissions as people use air-conditioners more often. With more periods of dry spells and rainy days predicted based on V3's findings, the extreme weather may also affect biodiversity. Prof Chow, who is also the co-chair of the IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, said: \"With more extremes of rainfall and heat, the question is whether existing biodiversity can adapt. \"Some (species) can adapt better than others, such as mosquitoes that are likely to thrive in such conditions. \"But our trees that are used to tropical habitats might not be used to more episodes of dry spells.\" Singapore relies on nature-based solutions to regulate temperatures - such as trees to mitigate urban heat and green walls to reduce buildings' absorption of heat - so the extreme weather could negate the effect of these green spaces, Prof Chow added. The rising temperatures will not just be uncomfortable, it will also bring about more pressure on the country's healthcare system. Assistant Professor Borame L Dickens from the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said that the increased extreme and frequent heatwaves will worsen heat stress on human bodies. Asst Prof Dickens said: \"Vulnerable groups - especially children, the elderly and those who are suffering from chronic conditions or diseases such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity - will be especially susceptible to having complications because of these heatwaves.\" This could add strain to healthcare demands, with more hospital admissions for people who have existing cardiovascular and respiratory disorders. \"Mental health conditions are also made worse because of distress resulting from the heat, which can compromise decision-making, leading to more accidents, more incidents of aggression and even suicides,\" Assoc Prof Lee added. Rising sea levels and higher temperatures could also affect crucial infrastructure such as Changi Airport and Tuas port, Prof Chow said. HOW HOT WILL IT BE, WHAT CHANGES LIE AHEAD 1. TEMPERATURE Currently, Singapore's average daily mean temperature is 27.9\u00b0C. In all of V3's three projected scenarios, the average daily mean temperature and the Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WBGT) will increase by end-century. WBGT is heat stress in direct sunlight, taking into account other environmental factors such as humidity, wind speed and cloud cover. For now, it is 26.6\u00b0C. In the best-case scenario, the average mean daily temperature would rise between 0.6\u00b0C and 1.6\u00b0C, while WBGT would increase by 0.5\u00b0C to 1.4\u00b0C In the worst-case scenario, the average mean daily temperature would go up by 2.8\u00b0C to 5.0\u00b0C, while WBGT would go up by 2.5\u00b0C to 4.3\u00b0C This means that WBGT would be around 30\u00b0C on average daily by end-century. With WBGT at 33\u00b0C or higher, the risk of heat stress and related illnesses such as heat cramps, heat exhaustion and heat stroke will be higher. And should emissions increase rapidly, there could be between 207 and 326 of such high heat stress days yearly by end-century. V3's study threw up possible scenarios and one is that there may be more warm nights of between 312 and 316 days in the best scenario - or warm nights all year round at the worst. Warm nights are when daily minimum temperatures equal or exceed 26.3\u00b0C. 2. RAINFALL Singapore will see much more rainfall during rainy monsoon seasons. By 2100, rainfall during the December-January period will increase by up to 58 per cent in the best scenario, and by up to 44 per cent in the worst scenario. The dry months from June to September will also be hotter, with a 10 per cent drop in rainfall in the best case, and a 42 per cent decline in the worst case. The study also found that in the worst-case scenario, there will be one dry spell of up to around 21 days for every 10 months. Dry spells are periods of at least 15 consecutive days where the island-wide average of rainfall is less than 1.0mm on each day. 3. WINDS Overall, the study predicted wind speeds to increase by up to around 6 to 20 per cent during the northeast monsoon and southwest monsoon seasons in each projected scenario. The inter-monsoon months of April and May will see an increase in wind speeds of up to 6 to 11 per cent by the end of the century. Daily maximum wind gusts are expected to increase by up to 10 per cent come 2100, which can potentially cause damage to Singapore's infrastructure and uproot trees. 4. SEA LEVELS In all projected scenarios, the sea levels will rise. In V3's study, there is better research than V2's study in 2015 into the melting Antarctic ice sheets and their contribution to global sea levels. In the best case, Singapore's mean sea level will go up between 0.23m and 0.74m In the worst case, the mean sea level will rise by 0.54m to 1.15m By 2150, sea levels here could rise by 1.37m in the worst-case scenario. About a third of Singapore's land area is less than 5m above mean sea level, so a 1m increase in sea levels could result in several plots of land being lost if nothing is done. WHAT IS BEING DONE TO MANAGE PROJECTED CHANGES? In Friday's joint press release, MSE, MSS and the National Environment Agency (NEA) said that Singapore's future climate depends on all countries acting collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. MSS will be sharing the data from V3 with member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) \"at a later stage\". MSS will also be collaborating with international entities and the scientific community to undertake joint research using V3's data. Beyond research, the Government \"takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change\", the three governmental bodies said. \"The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate-resilient.\" Some key things that the Government would be doing include reviewing building codes to ensure the structural integrity of infrastructure, as well as climate-proofing network infrastructure such as transport, telecommunications and energy in the face of projected higher temperatures and wind speeds, for instance. There are plans to cool urban spaces in more ways, by using modelling in district and estate planning to preserve wind corridors, and deploying cool paint to reduce heat absorption, for example. The Government already announced plans for the \"Long Island\" reclamation project off the country's eastern coast in 2019 to \"project coastal projection seawards\". \"Government action alone will not be sufficient. Everyone - individuals, communities and corporates - has a role to play to promote sustainability and mitigate climate change,\" MSE, NEA and MSS said. Some things that individuals can do include saving electricity by adopting energy-efficient appliances, reducing water usage and buying domestic produce that has a lower carbon footprint.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-2335951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B1S-60N1-DXPH-P01G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 5, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>climate change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>temperature</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>rising sea levels</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><className>Business &amp;

Redd+ stands for \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore is preparing to release by year's end a list of eligible host countries, programmes and methodologies under its International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, which will allow companies to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions beginning in 2024. </p><p> This comes after the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment and the National Environment Agency (NEA) published the eligibility criteria underpinning the coming list.</p><p> Jurisdictional Redd+Redd+ projects have come under intense scrutiny amid heightened scepticism about the integrity of their emissions reduction claims.</p><p> Responding to BT's queries, the government spokesperson said Singapore recognises the need to support the management and conservation of existing forests, and to restoring deforested areas.</p><p> Therefore, \"we will accept Redd+ projects that adopt a jurisdictional approach in countries with historically significant levels of deforestation\", he said. These include projects developed using the jurisdictional and nested Redd+ (JNR) framework of the Verified Carbon Standard (VCS).</p><p> JNR projects are seen to avoid some of the criticisms that have plagued the project-level Redd+ methodology. </p><p> Project-level Redd+ credits have bore the brunt of criticisms about inflated baselines and over-crediting, but JNR projects are seen to be subjected to stricter oversight.</p><p> This position is aligned with the eligibility criteria set by the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (Corsia), which is regarded as one of the most rigorous and reputable international standards, the spokesperson explained.</p><p> Environmental integrity The government is unlikely to include \"high forest, low deforestation\" (HFLD) credits in the initial version of the eligibility list.</p><p> The spokesperson said these credits are still new, and will require further assessment for environmental integrity.</p><p> HFLD credits have been mooted for heavily forested areas with historically low rates of deforestation, on the basis that it is important to protect these areas early on. But whether the avoided emissions from such projects are truly additional to business as usual has been a subject of debate.</p><p> The Singapore government's stance is to monitor developments and international discourse around these credits, explore working with HFLD jurisdictions to refine HFLD methodologies, and come up with mechanisms that offer incentives to promote conservation, the spokesperson said.</p><p> Coal phase-out credits\"Transition credits\", recently proposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore as a way to credit the avoided emissions when coal-fired power plants are retired early, are also unlikely to be on the eligibility list because they are still too nascent. The same applies to carbon-capture credits tied to oil extraction processes, and direct air capture credits.</p><p> The spokesperson said: \"We are unable to make an assessment on these activities, as there are no crediting methodologies meeting Article 6 requirements that have been published as of now.\"</p><p> However, he said Singapore recognises the importance of developing the carbon market and the rules governing it, to facilitate international cooperation in this market. The government will review the credibility of these methodologies when they become available and assess whether they meet Singapore's criteria.</p><p> Reversal protectionAccepted projects should have mechanisms to monitor, mitigate and compensate for the possibility of \"reversals\", which occur when a credit can no longer support claims for the amount of emissions it reduces or removes, the spokesperson said. </p><p> For instance, a wildfire in a forest conservation site releases carbon that had previously been stored in the area, and might require a reversal. However, projects that might face a risk of reversals might be required to maintain a \"buffer\" pool of credits to insure against reversals.</p><p> If there are serious concerns about the environmental integrity of any ICC project, NEA, as administrator for the carbon tax regime, may remove these projects from the eligibility list, the spokesperson said.</p><p> In terms of the scope of Singapore's carbon tax, the spokesperson said there are no plans at the moment to lower the taxable threshold of 25,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions per year. Facilities that emit above that level are subject to Singapore's carbon tax.</p><p> The spokesperson explained that Singapore's carbon tax coverage is already \"one of the highest in the world\". More than 90 per cent of Singapore emissions are already subjected to a carbon price. </p><p> Carbon tax covers about 80 per cent of emissions; the rest is covered through excise duties that offer incentives to lower transport emissions, he noted.</p><p> At this level of coverage, the carbon tax is imposed at key nodes, and flows through the rest of the economy. This, in turn, reduces the administrative load on small emitters -- especially small and medium-sized enterprises -- to measure, report and verify their emissions, he added.</p><p> Supply and demandThe spokesperson said it is not possible to forecast the projected supply of ICCs because Singapore is still negotiating implementation agreements with about a dozen countries, with varying levels of progress in each.</p><p> These implementation agreements are being drawn up to ensure that the credits are not double-counted in two countries' nationally determined contributions when credit trades take place. Singapore has set these agreements as a prerequisite for credits that can be accepted under its ICC framework.</p><p> Also, commercial sensitivities may make project developers choose not to disclose what they are planning in the potential host countries. This prevents \"meaningful forecasting\", the spokesperson said.</p><p> Nevertheless, Vietnam and Ghana -- the countries with which Singapore is closest to signing implementation agreements -- seem to have taken commercial interest in developing projects in the areas of landfill methane capture, efficient household appliances, renewable energy, and nature-based solutions, the spokesperson said.</p><p> In any case, the market demand for ICCs is expected to be slow at the start, he noted. \"As the option to use ICCs to offset carbon tax is new, we expect that companies will need time to build up the requisite knowledge and capabilities to avail themselves of this option,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p> Market observers have told BT that ICCs are expected to command a price premium over voluntary credits that do not come with corresponding adjustments. </p><p> The spokesperson agreed with these higher costs, on the back of the need for host-country authorisation and higher environment integrity. Prices will, however, be determined by market dynamics, the spokesperson added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The government will explore working with \"high forest, low deforestation\" jurisdictions to refine HFLD methodologies and come up with mechanisms that offer incentives to promote conservation.

It also comes soon after the COP27 UN climate conference in Egypt. </p><p> \"Two weeks ago, we had a mountain of differences to resolve. Today, we leave with an agreement that starts, at least, to heal our relationship to nature,\" said Dr Lin Li, senior director of global policy and advocacy at WWF International.</p><p> The outcome of the talks, under the UN's Convention on Biological Diversity, reflects the urgency of the crisis facing life on the planet, with about 40 per cent of land degraded by agriculture, mining and urbanisation. </p><p> Wildlife population sizes have shrunk alarmingly in the past 50 years, and a million species face extinction this century, with climate change taking an increasing toll on ecosystems too. </p><p> The climate and biodiversity crises are closely interlinked because ecosystems such as forests and grasslands soak up large amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2), the main greenhouse gas, thereby acting as a brake on the pace of global warming. </p><p> Destroying these ecosystems intensifies the heating up of the planet and triggers wilder weather. It also wipes out key environmental services, such as clean air and water that humanity relies on. </p><p> \"Nature sustains all human life, underpins countries' economies, and is vital to reining in climate change. We cannot achieve the 1.5 deg C climate goal without changing how humans treat nature,\" said Dr Craig Hanson, managing director for programmes at the Washington-based World Resources Institute think-tank, referring to a key temperature limit of the Paris climate pact.</p><p> \"Yet, the agreement is only as strong as countries' political will to implement it, and countries now face the urgent task of turning these commitments into action.\"</p><p> Under the agreement, nations agreed on 23 targets for 2030. The key target is to conserve at least 30 per cent of land, freshwater and ocean by 2030, while respecting the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities.</p><p>  At present, 17 per cent of the world's terrestrial areas, and 10 per cent of the world's marine ones, are under protection.</p><p> Mr Will McGoldrick, Asia-Pacific regional managing director for The Nature Conservancy, described the deal as historic. </p><p> But he said: \"South-east Asia will continue to lose biodiversity until we change the incentives for companies and communities. We need to reward and support those who invest in nature.\" Possibilities include debt-for-nature swops, for example. </p><p> The region's rainforests, mangroves and peatlands are giant carbon stores rich in nature and key to fighting climate change. </p><p> \"Peatlands and mangroves are the unsung heroes of conservation and climate action. These systems store even more carbon per hectare than the region's iconic rainforests, yet are often overlooked and undervalued,\" Mr McGoldrick said. </p><p> He said a key part of the agreement is guidance to countries to ensure that large companies and financial institutions assess and disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on nature, and reduce their negative impacts over time. </p><p> \"This puts financial centres like Singapore and Hong Kong on the main stage of global conservation efforts, as they will be expected to bring these new provisions to life.\"</p><p> For investors in nature-based climate solutions, such as projects that restore and protect mangroves, the COP15 deal could boost investments.</p><p> \"Overall, I think COP15 is an important and significant step forward for biodiversity and wildlife conservation globally and in South-East Asia,\" said Mr Mikkel Larsen, chief executive of Singapore-based Climate Impact X, a global exchange and marketplace for carbon credits. </p><p> He told The Straits Times that he expected investment flows into nature and nature-based solutions to rise. \"That includes investment from public and private funding and not just market-based solutions such as carbon credits.\"</p><p> He also feels that increasing regulatory requirements in which companies must disclose their impacts on nature, such as the impacts of their supply chains, will also drive positive change and investment. </p><p> Professor Koh Lian Pin, director for the NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions (CNCS), said the adoption of the COP15 agreement so soon after the COP27 climate talks, whose outcome referenced the importance of nature-based solutions, highlighted the value of tackling biodiversity loss and climate change together.</p><p> He said Singapore can help to play a role in the conservation of vital habitats such as mangroves. For example, CNCS researchers have mapped out where forests and mangroves under threat are located. \"This could help carbon projects to be established in these areas, saving them from being cut down,\" Prof Koh said. </p><p> Dr Zeng Yiwen, CNCS assistant research professor, said it is important to ensure the quality of habitats that are selected for conservation rather than just trying to achieve the 30 per cent target. </p><p> \"Simply conserving 'rock and ice' habitats or areas far from urban centres will not yield as many benefits to the climate or wildlife as these areas.\" </p><p> Not everyone was pleased with the agreement. </p><p> Greenpeace said COP15 failed to deliver the ambition, tools or finance necessary to stop mass extinction. Others said some of the mid-century biodiversity goals lacked clear targets. </p><p> But UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said it was a step in the right direction. \"We are finally starting to forge a peace pact with nature,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The president of the COP15 biodiversity conference, China's Minister of Ecology and Environment Huang Runqiu, signalling the passage of the Kunming- Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework in Montreal, Canada, on Monday. photo: REUTERS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-BD15NH7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:674K-K2K1-JCF2-80RM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1023\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The plan aims to make Singapore a more liveable, inclusive, and endearing home. Over the next two years, URA will engage Singaporeans and stakeholders to gather ideas and feedback on various plans, including new homes in central locations, a Recreation Master Plan, and enhanced Identity Corridors. The DMP25 will focus on four broad themes: shaping a happy healthy city, strengthening urban resilience, enabling sustainable growth, and stewarding nature and heritage.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The DMP25 will inject more flexible and mixed-use workspaces in areas like Jurong Lake District and foster innovation.</p><p>* The DMP25 aims to balance development with nature and heritage assets, enhance green and blue spaces, and strengthen the distinctive character and heritage of towns.</p><p>* URA will engage stakeholders to develop the Heritage and Identity Structure Plan and enhance Identity Corridors.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Oct. 5 -- Urban Redevelopment Authority, Government of Singapore issued the following news release:</p><p>New homes in more central locations, a Recreation Master Plan and enhanced Identity Corridors are just some of the plans that the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) will engage Singaporeans and stakeholders on over the next two years as part of the latest review of the Master Plan. The review will culminate in a presentation of the Draft Master Plan 2025 (DMP25), detailing land use and development plans for Singapore over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, launched the public engagement exercise this morning when he unveiled five new and improved connections under Phase 1 of the Bishan-to-City (B2C) Links project. These connections were first presented in 2017 as part of plans to revitalise areas along the Kallang River. Minister Lee also announced that construction works for the final connection across the Pan-Island Expressway (PIE) - including Singapore's longest elevated pedestrian and cycling bridge - will soon commence under Phase 2 of the project.</p><p>When fully completed, the B2C links will connect communities along the river, providing users a seamless 10km green commute along the Kallang Park Connector from Bishan to the city as well as contribute to a more sustainable, car-lite and healthier city. Refer to Annex A (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36a.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36a.pdf</url>) for more information on the B2C Links project.</p><p>Stewarding our limited land resources and balancing diverse needs</p><p>Long-term planning has guided us in managing our limited land resources and shaped the city we live, work and play in today. To ensure that Singapore continues to be an endearing home where generations of Singaporeans can continue to achieve their aspirations and thrive, we must work together to find solutions to meet our diverse needs and steward our land.</p><p>In the Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) that concluded last year, URA engaged over 15,000 Singaporeans from all walks of life to re-imagine how Singapore can meet our diverse needs over the next 50 years and beyond. Ideas to better optimise Singapore's scarce land resources and safeguard options for future generations as well as how Singapore can remain sustainable in an increasingly complex and uncertain environment were discussed. From the LTPR engagements, URA developed seven pillars to guide Singapore's long-term development strategies. Refer to Annex B (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36b.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36b.pdf</url>) for a summary of these pillars.</p><p>Coming together to make Singapore a more liveable, inclusive and endearing home</p><p>In this latest review of the Master Plan, URA will build on the conversations from the LTPR and engage Singaporeans and stakeholders to co-create the DMP25, aimed at making Singapore a more liveable, inclusive and endearing home.</p><p>Over the next two years, URA and partner agencies will seek ideas and feedback from Singaporeans and stakeholders on various plans, through platforms such as competitions, exhibitions and focus group discussions. The four broad themes for DMP25, translated from the LTPR pillars, are as follows:</p><p>i) Shape a Happy Healthy City</p><p>The DMP25 aims to improve housing accessibility and affordability by providing more liveable and inclusive homes for all, with neighbourhoods and spaces that support families, ageing-in-place and active living. Plans will also focus on enhancing active mobility networks and the rejuvenation of towns under the Housing &amp; Development Board's (HDB) Remaking our Heartland programme.</p><p>Key proposals include siting new homes and neighbourhoods in more central locations, developing a Recreation Master Plan and building on the ideas and proposals being developed for the Health District @ Queenstown.</p><p>ii) Strengthen Urban Resilience</p><p>To combat climate change, optimise our limited land resources and respond nimbly to future challenges, the DMP25 will focus on capitalising on our sea, underground and under-utilised spaces as well as co-locating multiple uses. It will also look to innovatively integrate nature-based solutions with infrastructure.</p><p>Key proposals include studying measures for coastal protection and heat resilience, and expanding efforts to use our underground space.</p><p>iii) Enable Sustainable Growth</p><p>To sustain a thriving economy that meets the evolving needs of businesses and workers, the DMP25 will focus on injecting more flexible and mixed-use workspaces in areas like Jurong Lake District.</p><p>The government is also studying more sale sites with different lease durations and densities to foster innovation, adapt to emerging trends and nurture vibrant commercial nodes to bring jobs closer to homes.</p><p>iv) Steward our Nature and Heritage</p><p>We will continue to carefully balance development with our nature and heritage assets to shape a home that is anchored on a strong sense of identity. The DMP25 aims to bring nature closer to people, enhance green and blue spaces, and strengthen the distinctive character and heritage of our towns.</p><p>URA will engage stakeholders to further develop the Heritage and Identity Structure Plan introduced in the LTPR as well as new plans to enhance Identity Corridors, such as the Thomson-Kallang Identity Corridor [1] and Rail Corridor.</p><p>Refer to Annex C (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36c.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36c.pdf</url>) for a summary of the DMP25 public engagement themes, and Annex D (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36d1.pdf\">https://www.ura.gov.sg/-/media/Corporate/Media-Room/2023/Oct/pr23-36d1.pdf</url>) for more details on some projects under each theme.</p><p>Mr Lim Eng Hwee, Chief Executive Officer of URA, said, \"We believe that our plans will be truly relevant and meaningful only when they reflect the collective aspirations and hopes of Singaporeans. It is therefore important for us to work together to discuss ideas and opinions as well as understand the challenges involved, to establish a common vision for our future urban environment. We look forward to having fruitful conversations with Singaporeans and stakeholders in shaping Draft Master Plan 2025.\"</p><p>Join us in shaping our city together</p><p>Members of the public can visit go.gov.sg/URADraftMasterPlan to indicate their areas of interest, stay updated on the DMP25 and sign up for public engagement activities.</p><p>Footnote:</p><p>[1] The Thomson-Kallang Corridor was one of five Identity Corridors introduced in the Long-Term Plan Review, defined by their unique streetscapes, heritage, and experiences.

Good morning everyone. I am glad to be here today, to join grassroot leaders, colleagues, and stakeholders to plant coastal trees to enhance East Coast Park.<br/><br/>2. For those of us who are old enough to remember, the land we are currently on used to be the sea. Land was reclaimed from the sea, from here all the way to Marine Parade Road.</p><p><br/><br/>3. This was called the \"Great Reclamation\": it was an ambitious reclamation project along the south-eastern coast of Singapore that our pioneer leaders embarked on, shortly after our independence. Full-scale reclamation work started in 1966, and over twenty years, we gradually added over 1,500 hectares of land, equivalent to 2,100 football fields, stretching from Tanah Merah Besar all the way to Telok Ayer Basin. Now this created additional space for Singapore, to build schools and homes, and to create job opportunities.<br/><br/>4. Our pioneers also envisioned that this reclaimed segment would be, \"a principal recreational lung for the whole island\". East Coast Park was opened in the 1970s on this reclaimed land, and we have gradually added new recreational facilities and green spaces over the subsequent years and decades.<br/><br/>5. We will continue to improve East Coast Park. For example, my NParks colleagues will create a 15 km nature trail along East Coast Park over the next eight years. The trail will connect existing and upcoming recreational and green spaces in the park, and bring you closer to greenery and to nature. Our tree planting efforts later this morning will contribute to this new nature trail.<br/><br/>Coastal Protection at East Coast<br/><br/>6. Let me now speak a little bit about coastal protection here at East Coast. When our pioneers embarked on the reclamation of East Coast more than 50 years ago, they were not only addressing immediate and pressing challenges that Singapore faced at that time. They were looking very far ahead, imagining what the future might look like, and creating space and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.<br/><br/>7. We must continue this discipline of long-term planning. Thinking about future generations, and not just about ourselves.<br/><br/>8. One major area of work for us, is preparing for the long-term impact of climate change. As a low-lying island state, rising sea levels poses an existential threat to Singapore. Mean sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1 metre by the end of this century. When high tides coincide with storm surges, sea levels could rise by up to 4 to 5 metres above mean sea level (AMSL). This is a very serious problem, because around one-third of our island is below 5 metres above mean sea level, and at risk of being inundated by the sea. While it may seem quite distant from today, we have to start planning and preparing now.<br/><br/>9. The East Coast of Singapore is low-lying and faces a high risk of flooding. We have already experienced flooding along this stretch. In January this year, some parts of East Coast Park were flooded for around two hours.<br/><br/>10. We need to put in measures to protect our homes and livelihoods in this area, and have been studying various coastal protection measures and options.<br/><br/>11. One possible measure is to build a sea wall along the entire coastline from the City to East Coast. You can call it a \"Long Wall\" approach.<br/><br/>12. Under this option, we will need to build a continuous sea wall that is up to 3m in height along the entire waterfront of East Coast Park, from Marina East to Tanah Merah. We will also have to build 12 tidal gates and pumping stations along each of the existing outlet drains along East Coast Park to keep the sea out and to pump rainwater out, when heavy rain coincides with high tide. Many of you would have seen the tidal gate and pumping station at the Marina Barrage which serves this same function. So imagine a smaller version of this tidal gate and pumping station, and having 12 of these along East Coast Park to provide coastal defence for the entire stretch of coastline.<br/><br/>13. This option is technically feasible, but it is really not ideal for East Coast Park. This is because, we will need to close off large stretches of East Coast Park from the public when constructing the sea wall and the tidal gate. After construction is complete, the sea wall will permanently limit park users' access to the waterfront for recreation and sports. The 12 tidal gates and pumping stations will also take up a lot of space within East Coast Park, around the size of 15 football fields. So you can imagine if we adopt this \"Long Wall\" approach, a lot of existing greenery and recreational facilities must go. In essence, this approach means we implement coastal protection along the existing East Coast Park, but lose significant portions of the park and recreational use of the coastline.<br/><br/>Long Island<br/><br/>14. A more optimal solution that we have been studying is: to integrate coastal protection measures with our future reclamation plans for the area. This idea of \"Long Island\" was raised by Prime Minister during the National Day Rally in 2019, and showcased at URA's Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) exhibition in 2022.<br/><br/>15. We received a lot of feedback and suggestions on the \"Long Island\" concept, during the Long-Term Plan Review, as well as PUB's \"Our Coastal Conversations\". For instance, while people recognised the vital importance of protecting low lying areas, they wanted to retain unimpeded access to the waterfront. The area also holds fond memories for many Singaporeans, and many hoped that we could preserve the heritage and recreational spaces along our coast.<br/><br/>16. We have taken many of these pieces of feedback onboard. So let me take this opportunity to update you on the latest concept, the latest thinking, behind \"Long Island\": The concept of \"Long Island\" is to project coastal protection seawards, by reclaiming three new tracts of land, at a higher level, away from the current coastline. This will allow us to retain the existing East Coast Park, largely as it is. It will also create an enclosed waterbody, preserving the waterfront character of the original East Coast Park. Over time, the waterbody will become a freshwater reservoir, which the public can use for water activities such as canoeing and dragon-boating. The reservoir will also add to our water supply. There will be two large tidal gates and pumping stations on the reclaimed \"Long Island\", as compared to twelve smaller ones along East Coast Park in the other option that I spoke about earlier. These tidal gates and pumping stations will also be much further away from existing residential and recreational spaces. Here is an artist's impression of how \"Long Island\" might look like from the existing East Coast Park.<br/><br/>17. While we are still working out the details, the reclaimed \"Long Island\" may potentially be around 800 ha, about twice the size of Marina Bay. This creates opportunities for future generations of Singaporeans. They could build homes, create jobs, develop services and amenities that they need, and add around 20 km of new coastal and reservoir parks, extending from the current East Coast Park. This would triple the length of the existing waterfront area along East Coast Park today.<br/><br/>18. Let me show you an artist impression of what \"Long Island\" could potentially look like when it is finally completed.<br/><br/>19. So, in essence, \"Long Island\" will help us to achieve a number of objectives: (a) primarily, protect us from rising sea-levels, (b) second, preserve the existing East Coast Park for park users, (c) third, enhance our water resilience, (d) fourth, develop more waterfront for outdoor recreation, and (e) fifth, create land optionality and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.<br/><br/>Technical Studies and Public Engagement<br/><br/>20. Because \"Long Island\" is a very major undertaking, the planning and implementation will take decades. We are still at a very early stage in this journey. The pictures you have seen are just artist impressions, examples of what might be possible. The final shape and form of \"Long Island\" will evolve over time, and we must wait for the studies to be undertaken. As a start, we will need to kickstart extensive environmental and engineering studies to see if the conceptual reclamation profile is feasible, and formulate innovative and cost-effective nature-based solutions to reclaim and develop \"Long Island\". We expect the studies to take around five years. These studies will need to begin now, so that \"Long Island\" can be realised in time to protect the area from rising sea levels.<br/><br/>21. In parallel, we will also be engaging residents and stakeholders, and collecting more feedback and ideas from Singaporeans. We want to hear from as many of you as possible - the general public, residents, businesses in the local area, the nature and heritage community, sports and recreational interest groups and many more. Join us to explore the possibilities. When we complete the technical studies, we will also engage you on the design and masterplanning for \"Long Island\".<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>22. In closing, \"Long Island\" holds tremendous opportunities and possibilities for Singaporeans to come together, and lead the way in showing what can be done and what be possible in dealing with climate change and rising sea levels.<br/><br/>23. As we protect our homes, infrastructure, livelihoods, and our cherished East Coast Park, we will collectively create new opportunities for quality living and recreation, for the benefit of Singaporeans today and for our future generations.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp;

And with that regional protection, we can be assured that we can continue to have basements and more infrastructure development without compromising the resilience of our (urban) development,\" she said at the forum yesterday.</p><p> Panellist Zeng Yiwen, from the NUS Centre for Nature-Based Climate Solutions, said nature-based solutions may be cheaper options. Regenerating and conserving mangroves along some coastlines can guard the coasts as they buffer against storms and build up sediment to fend off rising seas. There are other benefits: Mangroves can soak up three times more carbon than forests can.</p><p> While noting that nature-based solutions can be a cheap alternative in some areas, Dr Zeng acknowledged that such methods may not be as extensively employed in land-scarce Singapore.</p><p> Urban areas are also at risk of more flash floods caused by extreme and erratic rainfall that comes with rising temperatures.</p><p> To tame the stormwaters, Ms Khoo said PUB has been using the \"source-pathway-receptor\" approach, which aims to make the entire drainage system adaptable to deal with unpredictable weather. For instance, it is looking at increasing and improving the capacity of the drainage system by widening and deepening drains.</p><p> Meanwhile, critical infrastructure such as Changi Airport's Terminal 5 and Tuas Port will be built at least 5m above sea level.</p><p> But ultimately, the root cause of sea level rise - planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - must be tackled, Professor Benjamin Horton, director of Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore, stressed.</p><p> \"You need to remove the greenhouse gases to slow down the rates of (sea level) rise - then we can adapt, then we can live along the coastline, we can work along our coastline and our ecosystems can thrive,\" he said. \"But if we don't get at the root cause, your adaptations are meaningless.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-796522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62GW-3HH1-DYX4-00DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 22, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DS67</classCode><className>COASTAL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001074</classCode><className>MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541330GM</classCode><className>CIVIL ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMX1</classCode><className>CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

And with that regional protection, we can be assured that we can continue to have basements and more infrastructure development without compromising the resilience of our (urban) development,\" she said at the forum yesterday.</p><p> Panellist Zeng Yiwen, from the NUS Centre for Nature-Based Climate Solutions, said nature-based solutions may be cheaper options. Regenerating and conserving mangroves along some coastlines can guard the coasts as they buffer against storms and build up sediment to fend off rising seas. There are other benefits: Mangroves can soak up three times more carbon than forests can.</p><p> While noting that nature-based solutions can be a cheap alternative in some areas, Dr Zeng acknowledged that such methods may not be as extensively employed in land-scarce Singapore.</p><p> Urban areas are also at risk of more flash floods caused by extreme and erratic rainfall that comes with rising temperatures.</p><p> To tame the stormwaters, Ms Khoo said PUB has been using the \"source-pathway-receptor\" approach, which aims to make the entire drainage system adaptable to deal with unpredictable weather. For instance, it is looking at increasing and improving the capacity of the drainage system by widening and deepening drains.</p><p> Meanwhile, critical infrastructure such as Changi Airport's Terminal 5 and Tuas Port will be built at least 5m above sea level.</p><p> But ultimately, the root cause of sea level rise - planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - must be tackled, Professor Benjamin Horton, director of Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore, stressed.</p><p> \"You need to remove the greenhouse gases to slow down the rates of (sea level) rise - then we can adapt, then we can live along the coastline, we can work along our coastline and our ecosystems can thrive,\" he said. \"But if we don't get at the root cause, your adaptations are meaningless.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-796522</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62W0-H731-DYX4-01JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"441\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 22, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DS67</classCode><className>COASTAL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DS4V</classCode><className>SEA LEVEL CHANGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001074</classCode><className>MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541330GM</classCode><className>CIVIL ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMX1</classCode><className>CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

Other types of projects, such as those that use technology to suck up carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere, will be listed in the second half of this year.</p><p> As forests can take in planet-warming CO2 from the air through photosynthesis, every unit of CO2 absorbed by a forest can be sold as a credit.</p><p> There are currently about 10 to 15 such projects on the platform, including the Tambopata-Bahuaja Biodiversity Reserve located in the Peruvian Amazon.</p><p> The agroforestry project, which spans an area roughly the size of Los Angeles, entails the restoration of degraded areas there. Help is also given to local farmers to help them transition to sustainable cocoa production, reducing their need to cut down trees in the area.</p><p> CIX chief executive Mikkel Larsen said credits from nature-based solutions typically range from US$12 (S$16.35) to US$17 per credit.</p><p> He said he expects those listed on Project Marketplace will be \"on the higher end\", although the price will ultimately depend on the supplier.</p><p> The global trade in carbon credits essentially entails treating carbon as a commodity.</p><p> Each carbon credit represents one tonne of emissions, so buyers of the credits can offset this amount from their total emissions.</p><p> CO2, produced from human activity like burning fossil fuels and deforestation, is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change.</p><p> Companies or countries that find it hard to shrink their carbon footprint in the short term can purchase carbon credits - essentially paying someone else to reduce emissions on their behalf.</p><p> CIX, which was jointly established last year by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered and Temasek to facilitate the trade of carbon credits, said its marketplace will enable businesses of all sizes to participate in the voluntary carbon market.</p><p> The platform can also be used to \"retire\" the credits so they are never to be traded or swapped again, to ensure carbon savings are not double-counted.</p><p> The launch of the marketplace comes as the Government announced last month that large emitters in Singapore that have to pay a carbon tax can, from 2024, buy international carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions.</p><p> Mr Larsen said creating marketplaces defined by transparency and integrity is of utmost importance for a rapidly evolving landscape like the voluntary carbon market, especially during periods of uncertainty.</p><p> \"Responsible corporates are looking for assurance that the credits they buy will deliver tangible, lasting climate impact... Our aim is to engender greater confidence amongst buyers and sellers of carbon credits,\" said Mr Larsen.</p><p> \"To achieve that goal, we focus on curating quality credits and offering credible data, insights and practical guidance to our wider community.\"</p><p> Project Marketplace will feature third-party ratings, supplemented with satellite monitoring technology data, of the various carbon projects listed on it.</p><p> Sylvera, a firm that provides data on nature-based offset projects, will provide information such as the permanence of the carbon removal, co-benefits of nature-based projects and risk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1029894</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6511-H0F1-DYX4-003W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"592\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

We are indeed very honoured this morning to welcome Madam President as our Guest-of-Honour again. She has been a very strong supporter of the Festival of Biodiversity and the work that many of our partners do on the ground, nurturing our City in Nature. I would like to thank Madam for taking the time to join us in celebrating our native biodiversity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A big thank you as well, to the members of the Biodiversity Roundtable and our partners from the nature community, teachers and students, for your support and hard work, in organising and contributing to the Festival of Biodiversity for the tenth year running. And if my memory serves me right, we have been organizing Festivals of Biodiversity every year, even last year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whether it's helping to set up the exhibition booths, sharing your projects or reaching out to the public - I would like to thank all of you for your passion and dedication. We hold this Festival every year in celebration of the rich biodiversity that we share our island with, and in recognition of our responsibility, as stewards of our environment, to take good care of this natural heritage for future generations.</p><p>But as a small city state, we face many challenges in doing so. Our land constraints mean we must carefully balance our developmental needs with nature conservation. And we also face the pressing concern of climate change, which is an existential threat for us - and our biodiversity. That is why we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 to pursue sustainable development, and to do our part to combat climate change.</p><p>One of the key pillars of the Green Plan is to transform Singapore into a City in Nature. Given our limited land that is both a city and a country, we don't have the luxury of large areas outside our city where we can conserve nature.</p><p>For us, nature is within, nature is all around, and nature is part of the city, not outside. Hence, we are weaving nature much more closely as part of the fabric of our city. So that City and Nature not only co-exist but can also form a symbiotic relationship</p><p>Today, I'd like to share a bit more about what we're doing to achieve this vision: how we're using more nature-based solutions to strengthen our climate resilience; how these and other efforts help to conserve our native biodiversity; and how all of us can play a part in this journey.</p><p>Strengthening Climate Resilience through Nature-based Solutions</p><p>Let me begin with nature-based solutions. These are efforts to enhance our natural environment, which in turn also help us to mitigate the effects of climate change. So nature-based solutions are win-win solutions, for nature and the city.</p><p>Let me briefly share three types of nature-based solutions that we are working on. First, we are using nature-based solutions to protect our coastlines. By planting trees and shrubs, as well as enhancing and restoring mangroves along our coasts, we can help to defend ourselves from rising sea levels, while at the same time, providing key habitats for marine and coastal species to thrive.</p><p>We started these efforts as early as 2010 when we enhanced the protections along the coastline of Pulau Tekong. Learning from this experience, we recently completed a similar coastal protection project at Kranji Coastal Nature Park, bordering the coast of Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve.</p><p>With the help of more than 250 enthusiastic members of our community, we successfully planted nearly 800 trees and shrubs to restore and enhance the coastal site, including rare species such as the Ormocarpum cochinchinense - a native tree previously thought to be extinct in Singapore.</p><p>Through such hard work, combined with good engineering, we established a natural green belt and low rock structures that will enhance the various habitats in the area, while protecting our coastlines from erosion.</p><p>I am therefore happy to announce that we will be embarking on two new and more extensive coastal protection projects on Pulau Ubin. These will be carried out in partnership with the community: one at the northern coastline, and the other in the south, at Sungei Durian. This will restore the island's coastlines and mangrove habitats, and bring back more of the island's rich biodiversity by addressing ongoing erosion and habitat loss.</p><p>Second, we are intensifying and enhancing nature in our green spaces, which will help to cool the environment. Today, more than 7,800 hectares of Singapore's total land area is set aside for green spaces like nature reserves, parks, and park connectors.</p><p>We are doing a lot more to enhance this, including setting aside another 1,000 hectares for green spaces and planting an additional one million trees through the OneMillionTrees movement. These trees and green spaces can sequester carbon, improve our air and water quality, provide shade for pedestrians, and cool our urban environment - especially in some of our hotter areas, such as in our industrial zones.</p><p>Third, we are naturalising more of our blue spaces - our waterways and waterbodies - which will also enhance our city's flood resilience. Over the past decade, we have been widening and deepening our existing drains, and building larger new drains, to improve our flood resilience.</p><p>We are also naturalising our waterways and waterbodies, by transforming concrete canals into natural rivers or streams, or reservoirs into natural lakes. This will help to reduce the risk of flash floods for adjacent properties. At the same time, it creates new habitats for wildlife and more recreational spaces for Singaporeans to enjoy. You can see the results of such work at Bishan-Ang Mo Kio Park and Jurong Lake Gardens. We will continue to do this in our other parks and gardens.</p><p>Enhancing Our Biodiversity Conservation Efforts</p><p>In these ways, nature-based solutions can help to protect our coastlines, cool the environment, and improve our flood resilience. At the same time, they support our key strategies in building climate resilience under our City in Nature vision and improve our ecological resilience as well - by creating new habitats and connecting existing ones, nature-based solutions help us to better conserve our biodiversity.</p><p>We will continue to press on with our biodiversity conservation programmes. For example, through our species recovery programme, we make a special effort to conserve our key native flora and fauna, especially rare and threatened species, by reintroducing and propagating them into their original habitats, as well as suitable new habitats.</p><p>This year, we will add 13 new plant species, as well as 13 new animal species, to our species recovery programme. This includes the native orchid species, Nervilia singaporensis, previously thought to be extinct in Singapore. Yet it was re-discovered by our very own NParks researchers in July 2019 at the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve.</p><p>And we are committed to do more. We will set more ambitious targets, to increase our recovery efforts from 90 plant and 40 animal species currently, to 100 plant and 60 animal species by 2030.</p><p>Through research and development, we are also developing new technologies that aid in conservation. As part of NParks' Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme, we are experimenting with a new mineral accretion technology, which stimulates corals through low-voltage electricity, to promote coral growth.</p><p>And we are expanding our outreach efforts, to involve more people in our collective conservation efforts. For example, we are implementing the new Marine Educational Outreach programme for schools and the public on local marine biology and marine conservation.</p><p>Together, these marine conservation programmes will help to restore and enhance key habitats, including our coral reefs, which are particularly vulnerable to changing temperatures as a result of climate change. I would like to thank Aramco Asia Singapore - who are here with us today - for your generous donation, and strong support for these marine conservation initiatives.</p><p>We are already beginning to see the fruits of our conservation efforts. Two years ago, we shared that we were reviewing and updating the Singapore Red List, which indicates the conservation status of our biodiversity, including plants and animals that are vulnerable or endangered.</p><p>I am happy to share some updates from our ongoing review, which we will consolidate into the third edition of the Singapore Red Data Book, which is a key resource that guides our conservation strategies. Based on our current findings, over 40 of our animal species are now more resilient in Singapore. For example, the Sunda Slow Loris - which was previously a critically endangered species, is now less threatened in Singapore.</p><p>A recent study by NParks on the Lesser Mousedeer also highlights how the critically endangered population has recovered since the 1990s, which is highlighted by this review as well. This is also the first time that sponges and stony corals have been evaluated in the Singapore Red List, thanks to the increasing capabilities of our marine experts, and the growing interest in marine science in Singapore.</p><p>In fact, Singapore's contributions to biodiversity conservation go beyond our shores. We have just launched the updated version of the Singapore Index on Cities' Biodiversity. This is an index under the United Nations' Convention on Biological Diversity, used by cities worldwide to measure their progress in biodiversity conservation, and to guide their policies and plans in this area.</p><p>It was named after Singapore as we had first proposed it, and our very own NParks officers helped to develop it. We are proud to do what we can to support biodiversity conservation around the world, especially in cities and urban areas.</p><p>Partnering the Community</p><p>None of these achievements would have been possible without the strong support of our community partners. Over the years, we've seen a growing interest and passion in safeguarding our natural heritage among many Singaporeans.</p><p>Today, we have nearly 70 members in the Biodiversity Roundtable, from nature groups, schools, academia, as well as members of the Friends of the Parks initiatives. This is more than twice the number since the launch of this Festival in 2012. Our citizen scientists have also grown in strength - from less than 500 individuals to over 9,000 this year. They form part of NParks' volunteer base of over 54,000 individuals.</p><p>This is a very encouraging development, and we do hope that even more people will step forward and join us in our journey to transform Singapore into a City in Nature.</p><p>If you are interested to find out more about our local biodiversity, and how you can get involved in our conservation efforts, do participate in the Festival's events. We have had a series of in-person events such as tree-planting, with safe-distancing measures of course. And, we have planned a suite of virtual programmes, such as a virtual webinar on our rainforests, and stay-home activities, so that more Singaporeans can celebrate with us, in a safe manner.</p><p>Even beyond this Festival, there are always lots of ways to get involved, from tree-planting under our OneMillionTrees movement, to citizen science programmes under our Community in Nature initiative. Just visit our NParks website, follow us on Facebook or Telegram, or write to us at any time.</p><p>On that note, thank you once again Madam President, thank you to all our friends from the Festival of Biodiversity organizing committee and from the Biodiversity Roundtable. I wish you all a wonderful and safe Festival of Biodiversity. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0057024684</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63P9-2RM1-DXMP-K4HY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1968\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 25, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>Fish &amp; Wildlife Protection</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0M4Qjg3OThGNzhFNDVEN0FDRDc4NzNCRDVGQkE5NzI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DSEI</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DRDE</classCode><className>HALIMAH YACOB</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The number registered has more than doubled from 16,000 in 2020 to 37,320 as at end-June. But the spike has also brought problems -- a rise in road accidents involving e-bikes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There were 157 accidents involving e-bikes in 2022, a slight rise from 150 in 2021 but doubling from 78 in 2020. Eight were fatal, and in August 2023, a 64-year-old e-bike rider died after being hit by a minibus in Hougang.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Motorised devices have speed limit restrictions, are banned from footpaths, and theory tests are mandatory to ride them on roads. Notices were issued by the Land Transport Authority (LTA) to more than 5,000 e-bike users in 2022 for riding on footpaths.</p><p> Despite the regulations and active enforcement, e-bikes on roads still pose risks. Much of this stems from the tension between motorists and e-bike users.</p><p> In a report from The Straits Times that examined this, a seasoned e-bike user from Norway, who continued his practice in Singapore after he moved here, candidly said it was not for the faint of heart. He emphasised the need for drivers to treat bikers with more respect. Irate drivers have also expressed frustration at e-bike riders flouting traffic rules and norms, and riding dangerously.</p><p> The friction between the two modes of transport has been observed in other countries, even in contexts where traditional bicycles have long been part of daily life, such as in the Netherlands.</p><p> These experiences show that regulation, education and appropriate infrastructure are key to ensure that e-bikes can be well integrated to the fabric of cities as a sustainable mode of transportation.</p><p> This is important, as clearly e-bikes are here to stay: A large part of the rise of e-bikes has been their popularity with food delivery drivers, as they are cheaper to own and run than motorbikes. E-bikes are also popular with commuters who want to avoid crowded public transport or bridge the last-mile connection between transport hubs and home.</p><p>Singapore is already well primed for e-bikes due to its mostly flat landscape and excellent connectivity, so we should start considering making the city more conducive and safe for them. A bonus is that addressing these concerns can offer an opportunity to achieve other goals, as e-bikes can be part of a transition to a healthier and greener model of urbanisation.</p><p> Helping e-bikes have  their rightful placeBehavioural change and careful planning are needed to safely integrate e-bikes into existing transport networks. If we can overcome these barriers, e-bikes can help us reduce our long-held dependence on cars and motorcycles, alongside expanding and improving the public transport system.</p><p> Promoting a culture of mutual respect between car drivers and e-bike riders necessitates a comprehensive approach focused on heightened awareness campaigns and educational initiatives. For car drivers, a deepened understanding of the presence and rights of e-bike riders is imperative, facilitating a significant enhancement in shared road safety. Concurrently, e-bike enthusiasts should be equipped with a solid grounding in road etiquette, adherence to traffic regulations and safety protocols to ensure a more harmonious coexistence with other motorists.</p><p> Beyond changing attitudes and enforcing laws, there's a need for infrastructure. </p><p> Dedicated cycling lanes are necessary to keep both pedestrians and electric or pedal-powered riders safe. These could also provide alternative routes for riders who would otherwise travel on roads. They also take up far less space than multi-lane roads, freeing up much-needed land for green space. </p><p> It's worth noting that LTA is studying the feasibility of removing street-side parking to make way for cycling paths in some roads and has identified 60 sites to be converted into paths for pedestrians and cyclists. In its latest announcement in September on expanding Singapore's cycling connectivity, LTA called a tender to build 34.4km of new cycling paths in western and central Singapore. </p><p> But Singapore could take a stronger grip of the wheel in paving the path for green areas that are e-bike inclusive. In an earlier piece for ST in July that focused on nature-based solutions, I put stress on how Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and other Asean countries were struggling to find space for green infrastructure, including green roofs, parks and community gardens. Serving as an example to the region, Singapore can lead the way by making space for green areas integrated into cycling infrastructure.</p><p> Additionally, the potential benefits for our health are many, and it would help change mindsets to be more inclusive of e-bikes if people were more aware of this. Fewer cars and motorcycles on the road mean less air pollution. Expanding green spaces provides opportunities for recreation and physical activity, as well as having positive benefits for our mental health. Integrating green space across the city is also essential to conserve our precious biodiversity.</p><p> Reducing dependency on carsIn many ways, Singapore is the perfect city for e-bikes -- compact, well-connected and mostly flat. But, like most cities around the world, the Republic has an in-built dependency on cars. According to LTA, Singapore has 9,500km of roads, taking up a whopping 12 per cent of the total land area.</p><p> As we reduce our dependence on cars as part of the vision for a car-lite city, the expansion of the cycling network to accommodate e-bikes could lead to a win-win situation. Along with reducing air and noise pollution, e-bikes can lead to a city with fewer cars, which could free up valuable space from unnecessary roads and carparks in the long term.</p><p> They also are cheaper and offer greater flexibility in getting around -- especially with the expansion of cycling paths and park connectors.</p><p> Green benefits of  accepting e-bikesTransitioning to new forms of transport, including e-bikes, is a key step to rethink how we use our city and build a greener future. Around the world, we are seeing cities move from traditional grey infrastructure to greener alternatives.</p><p> The city of Sheffield in Britain, for example, is converting redundant roads into green spaces to reduce flood risk. The project, known as \"Grey to Green\", has reimagined an inner-city highway -- converting two lanes of the road into rain gardens and cycling lanes. The new green belt was integrated into the cycling network and also serves as a flood protection system by collecting excess rainwater.</p><p> Replacing roads and concrete carparks with cycling lanes and green spaces is also a key strategy to reduce the urban heat island effect. Due to their dark colour and impermeable surface, asphalt roads are good at holding heat. As Singapore feels the effects of a warming climate, reducing urban heat and providing cool spaces throughout the city will be essential to prevent heat stress. </p><p> Indeed, following Singapore's landmark vision of a City in Nature, the adoption of green cycling lanes could be the next step in a strategy to bring more green to the country.</p><p> It will take some careful urban planning, and a shift in the way we think, but e-bikes have the potential to play an important part in changing the way we use our city -- for the better.</p><p> Erich Wolff is a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University's Earth Observatory of Singapore. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singapore is already well primed for electric bikes due to its mostly flat landscape and excellent connectivity, so we should start considering making the city more conducive and safe for them, says the writer. st photo: KEVIN LIM</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-EN4KT8H</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69CM-RP01-JCF2-8014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1249\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

One source of carbon credits comes from nature-based solutions or initiatives that save forests and other natural habitats from being destroyed.</p><p>  NECESSITY Protecting forests is necessary if we are to fight or reverse climate change.</p><p> MR TOPHER WHITE,  founder of Rainforest Connection.  Forests have the natural ability to suck up planet-warming carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store them in the roots and branches of trees, or in the soil.</p><p> Earlier this year, Singapore announced plans for Climate Impact X - a global carbon exchange and marketplace where \"high-quality\" carbon credits can be traded.</p><p> But Mr Frederick Teo, managing director of sustainable solutions at Temasek, said there were challenges in scaling up such nature-based projects. \"The monitoring and verification process for nature-based projects today often relies on infrequent and manual auditing,\" he said. \"There is also limited transparency around the level of impact and potential risks associated with different projects.\"</p><p> But technological solutions, such as the one offered by Rainforest Connection, can help ensure that these biodiversity treasure troves remain standing - for wildlife, and for people too.</p><p> The non-profit group's acoustics monitoring solution is in use in more than 18 countries, including forests in Indonesia and even underwater off Vancouver's coasts, to monitor the activity of whales, dolphins and porpoises.</p><p> Mr White told The Straits Times during a video call from San Francisco last month that his team is continuously \"training\" the algorithm to recognise a whole variety of sounds.</p><p> More than just the sounds of chainsaws or passing ships, Rainforest Connection is also working with wildlife scientists to build a repository of animal calls.</p><p> \"Our technology protects forests through avoided deforestation, but other than that, it also showcases the co-benefits of forest preservation,\" said Mr White.</p><p> He cited less tangible aspects such as biodiversity preservation and community involvement which may be of interest to investors looking to put their money into forest conservation projects.</p><p> The Californian start-up was one of five firms shortlisted earlier this year for the Sustaintech Xcelerator - a six-month programme focusing on increasing confidence in carbon credits from nature-based solutions.</p><p> The programme is an initiative of DBS Bank, Google Cloud, the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore, Temasek, Verra and the World Bank.</p><p> The other four - Treevia, Farm-Trace, Cloud Agronomics and Sylvera - also use technology to improve the monitoring or verification of nature-based solutions, such as using artificial intelligence to quantify the amount of carbon locked up in soil.</p><p> The five finalists, picked from over 200 applications, were each given resources such as a $50,000 grant. They also had the chance to showcase their work at events such as Ecosperity Week.</p><p> According to Mr Teo, the Sustaintech Xcelerator aims to improve nature-based solutions verification and improve investor confidence in such projects.</p><p> Projects that have verifiable biodiversity and social impact - such as protecting critical species or benefiting rural communities that support natural ecosystems - have the potential to be traded as \"high-quality\" carbon credits on the voluntary carbon market, he said.</p><p> This is provided they are also able to deliver emissions reductions that are real, permanent, additional, without leakage and without double counting.</p><p> \"Climate Impact X is constantly exploring technology partnerships to improve the trust and credibility of the high-quality carbon credits that are traded on its platforms,\" he said.</p><p> \"This will include, but are not limited to, the start-ups from the Sustaintech Xcelerator programme.\"</p><p> More details on potential partnerships will be given later.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-851455</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63TJ-35J1-JCF2-802B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"975\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 11, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

Catalytic funding from the government would be an important starting point to lower the risks of adaptation-development projects, but the observers also said that it is paramount for the private sector to invest in such measures to build business resilience - especially for sectors such as agriculture, which is directly exposed to climate-change impacts.Those comments came in the wake of the Paris Agreement's first Global Stocktake synthesis report, which showed that adaptation efforts are not keeping pace with increasing climate impacts and risks. The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.The need for blended finance Sharad Somani, partner and head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out that adaptation measures are often seen as the poorer cousin of climate mitigation; they are under-invested, as the focus has been to contain climate impacts through the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.That's because most adaptation measures tend to be public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems. And such projects tend not to lend themselves well to traditional commercial financing models, said Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public-sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re. </p><p>This is because dividends often manifest as a loss avoided, rather than an additive cash flow on which investors can rely on, he added.On top of these challenges are the facts that adaptation efforts are costly and most often needed in countries with limited resources, and they tend to be localised projects - where there are plenty of needs competing for limited funds, he also said.The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments. However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period. Citing forecasts from the UN Environment Programme, Somani pointed out that the annual cost of climate adaptation in poor countries alone could double or possibly even quadruple - from US$70 billion today to between US$140 billion and US$300 billion by 2030.To direct such high levels of capital towards climate adaptation, observers said that blended finance - which combines private, public and catalytic funding - is an important mechanism.Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.\"Only then, when you de-risk to this point... private players with innovative solutions can come in and build adaptation solutions on top of that, because they know that they have a stable policy environment, they know they have risk support, they know they have technical support,\" she said. Catalytic funding, in the form of grants, government incentives or impact investment, can also be the first layer of capital that enables the development of pilot solutions and proofs of concept, said Varbanov. He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. Mobilising private finance To get more private financing into climate adaptation, Somani said there is a need to address companies' bias against such measures, which are often wrongly perceived as having low returns and impact. The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted.As the impacts of climate change become more evident, businesses may actually end up forking out as much as 44 per cent of their profits to pay for damages caused by climate-related impacts, going by an economic study of nearly 15,000 public companies published in the journal Science last month. One way to unlock more private-sector financing for climate adaptation is to have companies pay more attention to disaster risk, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific Climate and Resilience Hub.For example, a coastal manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, which experiences 20 typhoons annually on average, would see the value of investing in the conservation of mangrove swamps. These natural ecosystems have proven to be effective in preventing storm surges from reaching inland.\"This is a public good... But the mangrove being there is providing (the factory) financial benefits. It's protecting your facilities. It's allowing you to exist... You may not own the mangrove, but we think you should invest in its conservation because it's protecting your facility,\" said Au. He also noted that there has been academic work showing that such nature-based solutions reduce losses from natural disasters by 25 per cent. With reduced losses as a result of climate adaptation, companies could potentially experience more affordable and stable insurance premiums as well, though observers noted that premiums may not actually come down given that many other factors are being considered when pricing them. While some told BT that there is a lack of data - regarding both adaptation activities and exposure to climate-related events - to help others understand how adaptation investments could affect broader risk assessments, Tobias Grimm said Munich Re has seen strong indications in its own data and analysis that climate change is a massive loss driver.The head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at the reinsurer said: \"Strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability - at both individual and community levels - will help to soften the societal and economic shocks of natural disasters.\"While all companies across all sectors should invest in strengthening their business resilience against climate-related events, the agriculture industry is particularly exposed to direct impacts, observers pointed out.With farmers facing more drastic weather cycles, major agribusinesses that depend on them as suppliers could consider extending loans to these farming cooperatives for them to invest in better irrigation systems or purchase seeds with higher yields, said Willis Tower Watson's Au. Financial institutions, though not directly hit by such events, have the most difficult and widespread exposure, said Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact. \"Portfolio managers face a daunting task (grappling) with widespread impact and inability to drive direct adaptation measures on the ground,\" they said. On the other hand, property developers are potentially big winners, especially those ahead of the curve on sustainable design and construction, said Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. \"In the future, we can imagine floating residential districts off the coasts of Asia's big cities, integrated with resilient infrastructure. In the more immediate future, onshore developments can incorporate flood protection with restoration of waterways and urban regeneration, raising property values,\" she added. Technology companies with solutions to improve water efficiency and reuse wastewater also stand to benefit in an increasingly water-insecure region.Ultimately, regardless of the sector they are in, companies that take measures to strengthen their resilience against climate-related impacts would be able to stay ahead of the game, observers said.Those that are able to come up with adaptation solutions, such as climate-adaptive clothing that is able to cool down body temperatures, or incorporate drought- or flood-resilient materials in construction, could also come out on top, said Bhatia of ERM. Sometimes, adaptation actions do not have to come in the form of an infrastructure project, which is the conventional idea of what such measures entail. Au noted that some companies are already increasing their resilience by identifying risks in their supply chains and addressing, diversifying or shortening them. \"The market will increasingly favour forward-looking companies that prioritise sustainability and are mitigating and adapting to climate change for a robust supply chain,\" said KPMG's Somani.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Observers say that the private sector should look into investing in climate adaptation to increase business resilience, especially for sectors such as agriculture, which is directly exposed to climate-change impacts.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6999-2KC1-JCF2-8006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1486\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

An island created from reclaimed land in Johor across from Singapore.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The setting seems idyllic, but this is not a primary coastal forest. It is an island of tower-block apartments and other residential infrastructure called Forest City. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The same place is often referred to by the media as \"ghost city\", a mega-development by Chinese investors that was never completed amid the Covid-19 pandemic and financial woes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> News reports about the development often underscore its falling into disrepair and neglect. Main backer Country Garden's target was to have 700,000 people living in the completed 1,370ha development, but the artificial city launched in 2016 has barely 10,000 residents today. It was even branded the \"World's 2nd Most Useless Mega Project\" by YouTube channel Top Luxury.</p><p> Less covered are the ways in which Mother Earth is making her presence felt.</p><p> Nature returnsAs someone who lives in the community around Forest City Island and has studied its rise, I have seen the seagrass and mangroves return.</p><p> It's not just me. Students and staff at the Shattuck-St Mary's Forest City (SSM-FC) International School -- set up in the early days of Forest City -- have been trained by a local community organisation, Kelab Alami, as citizen scientists. Over the past two years, under the leadership of its head, Dr Gregg Maloberti, they have documented the wilding of the island.</p><p> The results are fascinating. Ms Glenda Lakey, a teacher at SSM-FC, has recorded more than 100 species of birds, both resident and migratory. The island has become an important stopover for migrating birds from the Northern Hemisphere that head south for the winter.</p><p> She has recorded a number of rarely seen migratory species such as the ruddy kingfisher -- a highly sought-after species by bird-watching enthusiasts -- as well as the blue-tailed bee eater and blue-throated bee eater.</p><p> Students under her tutelage excitedly point out milky storks and lesser adjutant storks on the mudflats or walking through the mangroves, both of which are endangered and endemic to South-east Asia.</p><p> Ironically, the very same problems that Forest City faced amid a property crisis in China and the lockdown during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic have enabled nature to thrive. </p><p> Yet, it is hard to pinpoint when the birds started returning. When Ms Lakey first arrived at Forest City, her early-morning walks were eerily silent. Now, just before dawn breaks, the campus is filled with the sounds of both the large-tailed nightjar and savannah nightjar. Art class students on the top floor are often visited by a pair of oriental pied hornbills. At night, the red-wattled lapwing can be heard screeching.</p><p> It is a small school, and the 250 or so students and staff have caught on to the initiative to record and report the many animals, reptiles and insects spotted. They reflect in wonder at the healthy biodiversity slowly engulfing the island.</p><p> The community organisation also works with the school to document nearby seagrass habitats. Mangroves have settled naturally along the island's shores, with marine fauna such as endangered horseshoe crabs and juvenile catfish returning -- living proof that the habitats are beginning to serve their function as breeding grounds for more marine life.  </p><p> When Forest City removed a bridge previously created to facilitate the transport of sand, the seagrass meadow grew back within two weeks. Local community reports indicate that this has expanded to areas once buried by reclaimed land. </p><p> These habitats are vital to the local fishing community and have been key fishing and gleaning areas supporting their livelihoods. </p><p> SSM-FC continues to be the heartbeat of the island. About four in 10 of its families live in Forest City apartments; the others are boarders or children of the faculty.</p><p> The school is now showing the way by actively engaging with residents for environmental activities such as mangrove-tree planting and beach cleanups, at least once every quarter over the past year.</p><p> A mixed luxury residential-and- business development that began reclamation works in 2015, Forest City has been infamous for its sudden appearance and a subsequent stop-work order by the Malaysian Department of the Environment. The project did not complete a Detailed Environmental Impact Assessment, required by Malaysian law for all reclamation projects. </p><p> After some controversy and a revision of the original development plans, the project continued apace. It was officially launched in 2016, with the first keys handed over to apartment owners in 2018.</p><p> In the early days, Forest City was touted as a revolutionary approach to island creation and development, with innovative technology in land settlement that enabled piling work to begin just three months after sand dumping. Since then, Chinese government-imposed capital controls stalled most publicised property sales as its mainly middle-income buyers from China could not complete payments.</p><p> The  pandemic put paid to any further ambitions for development expansion. Forest City was closed off to the world for health security reasons. Hundreds of construction workers, housed in hostels in the surrounding fishing villages of Mukim Tanjung Kupang, were sent home. </p><p> Subsequently, Country Garden, which has a 60 per cent stake in the Forest City project, recorded more than US$150 billion (S$199 billion) in losses and defaulted on debt repayments, putting the future of the island development further in doubt. </p><p> In sales presentations in China, Country Garden -- which says it is business as usual for its Malaysian project -- notes that it will not build the other three islands initially planned for land reclamation, given the environmental impact. Property analysts note a more plausible reason for the about-turn: financial difficulties.  </p><p> The remaining 40 per cent stake in Forest City is held by the Johor state government, which has a vested interest in its success. In a recent interview with The Straits Times, Sultan Ibrahim Iskandar of Johor, who will be appointed Malaysia's king in January 2024, announced an interest in reviving the high-speed rail (HSR) project linking Kuala Lumpur to Singapore, and diverting it through Forest City.</p><p> With the King having played a critical role as kingmaker during Malaysia's 2022 General Election, there was little surprise when Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim announced plans in August to make Forest City a special financial zone (SFZ). </p><p> This will, among other things, fast-track entry for those working in Singapore and provide preferential income tax rates, to boost investment. </p><p> Today, many of Forest City's residents are renters, largely made up of Malaysians working in Singapore who commute daily to work. On Dec 12, a new bus link to the Second Link bridge and Tuas was announced, making it even easier for visitors or renters to cross the border.</p><p> Integrated living with naturePerhaps the SFZ and the HSR will deliver the necessary financial injection to revive the island. Such a strong endorsement by the Malaysian government bodes well, considering the disparagement and attempts to kill the project by past administrations.</p><p> This also augurs well for new approaches to integrate \"forest\" and \"city\". Research by the community and Kelab Alami has shown that nature can regenerate over areas left fallow around the artificial island. The budding prospects of eco-tourism are bright. </p><p> This would require Forest City's management to work actively with the local community to continue protection and research of its surrounding habitats to avoid accusations of greenwashing. </p><p> Modest efforts are already under way. Blossom Landscape Forest City, the developer's subsidiary, has transformed the island's greenery, previously manicured to look like a golf course using non-native plants. After the pandemic and toll of the tropical weather, the landscaping was replaced with native species, many grown in nurseries in the surrounding villages. </p><p> Today, the area thrives with local flora, and has riverine walkways reminiscent of Sungai Api-Api in Pasir Ris in Singapore. Artificial lakes and wetlands seem so natural, with frequent shorebird and otter sightings, that one almost forgets the entire space is man-made.</p><p> News stories carry narratives of Forest City descending into a ghost town, with people expressing buyers' remorse. Yet, reporters I have spoken to gathering information for stories on the development often comment in bewilderment that residents they interviewed seem pretty happy. </p><p> I have met residents perched on the beach and exhaling in satisfaction at the seaview. Indeed, if you stand on the reclaimed beachfront of the Ataraxia apartments that look out to where the Johor and Melaka Strait meet, the fresh sea breeze makes it easy to overlook how much damage the island construction has caused to the environment. </p><p> Yet, the constant redevelopment in this area is a stark reminder that industrial build-up has not been confined to Forest City alone. There are plans at the nearby Tanjung Piai Maritime Industrial Park for the reclamation of a 1,410ha island for oil, gas and chemical storage. The Port of Tanjung Pelepas and the Tuas Mega Port are both expanding facilities in the vicinity. </p><p> Acknowledging past problemsDr Qiu Lipeng, Country Garden Malaysia-Singapore's region vice-president, acknowledged the problems that arose in the early days, but stressed greater efforts to reduce Forest City's environmental impact. </p><p> \"I cannot stop the development,\" he said, \"but I will make sure that our construction does as little damage as possible.\" </p><p> He was stunned by the rich biodiversity that I showed him on the seagrass meadows at low tide, just off the main Forest City beachfront. He seemed determined to support the local fishing community's eco-tourism and seafood sales. Residents at Forest City are often sent reminders via their community's online chat groups to buy fresh from local fishermen. </p><p> He told me he has directed his hotel, communications and other project-management departments to work with community representatives on the promotion of local natural and cultural heritage, through tours offered by the community, or by showcasing local ecological knowledge and research outputs in the Forest City EcoMuseum. The access road to surrounding villages has also been repaired, facilitating engagements with local small businesses and communities. </p><p> When SSM-FC conducted mangrove-planting events, it sent out invitations to Forest City residents and several turned up with children in tow. A number asked how often these programmes were run, and how they could get involved in other activities. When the school decided to do a beach cleanup in September, several of the same faces turned up to help. </p><p> Dr Maloberti told me that as he toured China engaging with potential buyers to tell them about the strengths of SSM-FC, most parents were attracted by the sustainability aspects of the project. The citizen science programmes and other environmental events were of key interest, as were links between the school, Forest City, and the local fishing community and its surrounding seas. </p><p> There is much more Forest City can do to enhance its value proposition in sustainability. For one thing, the development was first pitched as a car-free, cycling-friendly development with elevated walkways and centralised parking facilities to keep it safe and pedestrian-friendly. There is little traffic, and buggy services ferry residents around, but the lack of pavements between the school and nearby apartments remains a bugbear.</p><p> Forest City could also examine how its buildings could be more habitable towards migratory species, following the lead of SSM-FC. Students and staff there encounter migratory birds when many fly into the windows of their buildings. One solution the school is working on is reflective stickers, a simple but effective means to warn birds of otherwise transparent glass windows. </p><p> Perhaps in integrating cities with nature, the Forest City developer should consult the community and Kelab Amani for local nature-based solutions to improve local ecology. They would know what works best in the area, having done the work for almost 20 years. </p><p> Forest City could also include green concepts -- green corridors and eco-bridges -- in the development, which have proven successful in Singapore and other parts of South-east Asia.</p><p> Life comes backHuman life, too, is returning to Forest City. There are many more lights on in apartments at night, according to SSM-FC staff who head to the beachfront pubs and cafes for a drink after work. Whenever I go to the island on weekends to check on habitats or the EcoMuseum, the water parks and swimming pools are full of Malaysian families.  </p><p> Residents say there have been new investments, with repairs and overdue maintenance works ongoing in the second half of 2023. </p><p> It is heartening to see the pause in development allowing the island to become part of the surrounding ecosystem -- an unexpected positive, considering the environmental problems plaguing Forest City from the outset. But while the federal and state governments work to boost investments, the most appealing aspect of Forest City is its fresh sustainability drive. </p><p> Home-grown efforts to welcome and integrate the island's new residents with the local community through seafood sales, habitat tours and citizen science training are things few other developments can offer. </p><p> Much of the returning plant and animal life was not mentioned in the environmental impact assessment for Forest City. Their revival demonstrates how nature can recover if left alone. It is now up to the developer and residents to make sure they can thrive.</p><p> Serina Rahman is a lecturer in the South-east Asian Studies Department at the National University of Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Residential apartments in Forest City in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, built on reclaimed land near Singapore.

The reclamation project started in 1966 and added over 1,500 hectares of land. A 15 km nature trail will be created along East Coast Park over the next eight years. Mean sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1 metre by the end of this century. The East Coast of Singapore is at risk of flooding due to rising sea levels. One possible measure to protect against flooding is to build a sea wall along the entire coastline. Another option is to integrate coastal protection measures with future reclamation plans, known as 'Long Island'. 'Long Island' involves reclaiming three new tracts of land at a higher level away from the current coastline. The reclaimed 'Long Island' may potentially be around 800 hectares, about twice the size of Marina Bay. 'Long Island' will protect against rising sea levels, preserve East Coast Park, enhance water resilience, and create more waterfront for outdoor recreation. Extensive environmental and engineering studies will be conducted to determine the feasibility of 'Long Island'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nov. 28 -- Urban Redevelopment Authority, Government of Singapore issued the following speech by Mr Desmond Lee:</p><p>Good morning everyone. I am glad to be here today, to join grassroot leaders, colleagues, and stakeholders to plant coastal trees to enhance East Coast Park.</p><p>For those of us who are old enough to remember, the land we are currently on used to be the sea. Land was reclaimed from the sea, from here all the way to Marine Parade Road.</p><p>This was called the \"Great Reclamation\": it was an ambitious reclamation project along the south-eastern coast of Singapore that our pioneer leaders embarked on, shortly after our independence. Full-scale reclamation work started in 1966, and over twenty years, we gradually added over 1,500 hectares of land, equivalent to 2,100 football fields, stretching from Tanah Merah Besar all the way to Telok Ayer Basin. Now this created additional space for Singapore, to build schools and homes, and to create job opportunities.</p><p>Our pioneers also envisioned that this reclaimed segment would be, \"a principal recreational lung for the whole island\". East Coast Park was opened in the 1970s on this reclaimed land, and we have gradually added new recreational facilities and green spaces over the subsequent years and decades.</p><p>We will continue to improve East Coast Park. For example, my NParks colleagues will create a 15 km nature trail along East Coast Park over the next eight years. The trail will connect existing and upcoming recreational and green spaces in the park, and bring you closer to greenery and to nature. Our tree planting efforts later this morning will contribute to this new nature trail.</p><p>Coastal Protection at East Coast</p><p>Let me now speak a little bit about coastal protection here at East Coast. When our pioneers embarked on the reclamation of East Coast more than 50 years ago, they were not only addressing immediate and pressing challenges that Singapore faced at that time. They were looking very far ahead, imagining what the future might look like, and creating space and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>We must continue this discipline of long-term planning. Thinking about future generations, and not just about ourselves.</p><p>One major area of work for us, is preparing for the long-term impact of climate change. As a low-lying island state, rising sea levels poses an existential threat to Singapore. Mean sea levels around Singapore are projected to rise by up to 1 metre by the end of this century. When high tides coincide with storm surges, sea levels could rise by up to 4 to 5 metres above mean sea level (AMSL). This is a very serious problem, because around one-third of our island is below 5 metres above mean sea level, and at risk of being inundated by the sea. While it may seem quite distant from today, we have to start planning and preparing now.</p><p>The East Coast of Singapore is low-lying and faces a high risk of flooding. We have already experienced flooding along this stretch. In January this year, some parts of East Coast Park were flooded for around two hours.</p><p>We need to put in measures to protect our homes and livelihoods in this area, and have been studying various coastal protection measures and options.</p><p>One possible measure is to build a sea wall along the entire coastline from the City to East Coast. You can call it a \"Long Wall\" approach.</p><p>Under this option, we will need to build a continuous sea wall that is up to 3m in height along the entire waterfront of East Coast Park, from Marina East to Tanah Merah. We will also have to build 12 tidal gates and pumping stations along each of the existing outlet drains along East Coast Park to keep the sea out and to pump rainwater out, when heavy rain coincides with high tide. Many of you would have seen the tidal gate and pumping station at the Marina Barrage which serves this same function. So imagine a smaller version of this tidal gate and pumping station, and having 12 of these along East Coast Park to provide coastal defence for the entire stretch of coastline.</p><p>This option is technically feasible, but it is really not ideal for East Coast Park. This is because, we will need to close off large stretches of East Coast Park from the public when constructing the sea wall and the tidal gate. After construction is complete, the sea wall will permanently limit park users' access to the waterfront for recreation and sports. The 12 tidal gates and pumping stations will also take up a lot of space within East Coast Park, around the size of 15 football fields. So you can imagine if we adopt this \"Long Wall\" approach, a lot of existing greenery and recreational facilities must go. In essence, this approach means we implement coastal protection along the existing East Coast Park, but lose significant portions of the park and recreational use of the coastline.</p><p>Long Island</p><p>A more optimal solution that we have been studying is: to integrate coastal protection measures with our future reclamation plans for the area. This idea of 'Long Island' was raised by Prime Minister during the National Day Rally in 2019, and showcased at URA's Long-Term Plan Review (LTPR) exhibition in 2022.</p><p>We received a lot of feedback and suggestions on the 'Long Island' concept, during the Long-Term Plan Review, as well as PUB's \"Our Coastal Conversations\". For instance, while people recognised the vital importance of protecting low lying areas, they wanted to retain unimpeded access to the waterfront. The area also holds fond memories for many Singaporeans, and many hoped that we could preserve the heritage and recreational spaces along our coast.</p><p>We have taken many of these pieces of feedback onboard. So let me take this opportunity to update you on the latest concept, the latest thinking, behind 'Long Island': The concept of 'Long Island' is to project coastal protection seawards, by reclaiming three new tracts of land, at a higher level, away from the current coastline. This will allow us to retain the existing East Coast Park, largely as it is. It will also create an enclosed waterbody, preserving the waterfront character of the original East Coast Park. Over time, the waterbody will become a freshwater reservoir, which the public can use for water activities such as canoeing and dragon-boating. The reservoir will also add to our water supply. There will be two large tidal gates and pumping stations on the reclaimed 'Long Island', as compared to twelve smaller ones along East Coast Park in the other option that I spoke about earlier. These tidal gates and pumping stations will also be much further away from existing residential and recreational spaces. Here is an artist's impression of how 'Long Island' might look like from the existing East Coast Park.</p><p>While we are still working out the details, the reclaimed 'Long Island' may potentially be around 800 ha, about twice the size of Marina Bay. This creates opportunities for future generations of Singaporeans. They could build homes, create jobs, develop services and amenities that they need, and add around 20 km of new coastal and reservoir parks, extending from the current East Coast Park. This would triple the length of the existing waterfront area along East Coast Park today.</p><p>Let me show you an artist impression of what 'Long Island' could potentially look like when it is finally completed.</p><p>So, in essence, 'Long Island' will help us to achieve a number of objectives: (a) primarily, protect us from rising sea-levels, (b) second, preserve the existing East Coast Park for park users, (c) third, enhance our water resilience, (d) fourth, develop more waterfront for outdoor recreation, and (e) fifth, create land optionality and opportunity for future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>Technical Studies and Public Engagement</p><p>Because 'Long Island' is a very major undertaking, the planning and implementation will take decades. We are still at a very early stage in this journey. The pictures you have seen are just artist impressions, examples of what might be possible. The final shape and form of 'Long Island' will evolve over time, and we must wait for the studies to be undertaken. As a start, we will need to kickstart extensive environmental and engineering studies to see if the conceptual reclamation profile is feasible, and formulate innovative and cost-effective nature-based solutions to reclaim and develop 'Long Island'. We expect the studies to take around five years. These studies will need to begin now, so that 'Long Island' can be realised in time to protect the area from rising sea levels.</p><p>In parallel, we will also be engaging residents and stakeholders, and collecting more feedback and ideas from Singaporeans. We want to hear from as many of you as possible - the general public, residents, businesses in the local area, the nature and heritage community, sports and recreational interest groups and many more. Join us to explore the possibilities. When we complete the technical studies, we will also engage you on the design and masterplanning for 'Long Island'.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In closing, 'Long Island' holds tremendous opportunities and possibilities for Singaporeans to come together, and lead the way in showing what can be done and what be possible in dealing with climate change and rising sea levels.</p><p>As we protect our homes, infrastructure, livelihoods, and our cherished East Coast Park, we will collectively create new opportunities for quality living and recreation, for the benefit of Singaporeans today and for our future generations.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp;

Trees soak up and store large amounts of CO2 as they grow. </p><p> \"Although we sell many other types of credits, we still believe that nature-based solutions are a very important part of the market -- hence why we're coming to market first with CNX, which is a nature-based solution contract,\" he told The Straits Times. </p><p> The CNX contract bundles 11 forest conservation projects. These projects are under the United Nations' Redd+ scheme, which refers to the reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, the conservation and sustainable management of forests, and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks. </p><p> The 11 projects are in Africa, Asia and the Americas and generate about two-thirds of all global Redd+ credits on the market. This ensures there is ample supply of offsets available -- each CNX lot equates to 1,000 carbon credits.</p><p> Companies buy these offsets to reduce their own carbon footprint, especially in areas where it is hard to cut emissions to reach net-zero. </p><p> This idea underpins the roughly US$2 billion (S$2.7 billion) a year voluntary carbon market, in which investors who develop projects that reduce or avoid CO2 emissions are rewarded with the sale of their verified offsets to a buyer looking to reduce their emissions. </p><p> Traders also buy the offsets to sell later for a profit if the market rises. </p><p> But the market has long been clouded by criticisms that many projects lack integrity, do not lead to meaningful emissions reductions, or that some credit buyers are greenwashing. </p><p> For example, buyers may use the credits to claim they are tackling climate change, but they are not taking meaningful steps to reduce emissions themselves. </p><p> Mr Larsen said CIX recognises these concerns but that the firm conducts thorough vetting of all projects that are featured on its marketplace, sold at regular auctions or will be available for spot trading on the new exchange. </p><p> He said doubts about the market had hurt prices and buying interest, but the aim of the exchange is to help boost confidence.</p><p> \"Many people have asked me: 'Why would you launch now''\" Mr Larsen said, referring to the spot exchange, especially since competitors such as AirCarbon Exchange already conduct spot trading in Singapore. </p><p> \"I think that this is part of the contribution to making nature-based climate solutions credible again,\" he said. </p><p> A key to this is trying to establish a benchmark market price for nature-based offsets and to create liquidity through daily spot trading of the CNX contract and offsets from a total of 34 nature-based projects listed on the exchange. </p><p> \"What we want to give is certainty of delivery, and we want to give certainty of execution. We've not come to market in a rush,\" he added.</p><p> \"With our contract, if our (CNX) benchmark goes up, then the price for the other projects hopefully will go up as well. And that's what we're trying to create -- a reliable benchmark, and there isn't such a thing today.\"</p><p> CNX aims to establish a benchmark price for credits issued between 2019 and 2022.</p><p> Mr Larsen said the plan is to keep expanding the types of spot trading contracts on the exchange and eventually lay the groundwork for futures contracts.</p><p> If the exchange is successful, he said it would show that Singapore, despite its size, can create global market liquidity for carbon spot trading. </p><p> \"And hopefully that will be another cornerstone ensuring Singapore can be a carbon market, not just for Singapore but... for other countries as well.\"</p><p> CIX is jointly owned by DBS, Singapore Exchange (SGX Group), Standard Chartered and Temasek's green investment company GenZero.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Each carbon credit traded on the new CIX Exchange represents a tonne of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, reduced or avoided.

The report will play a key role in the upcoming United Nations (UN) Climate Conference in Dubai, which begins in late November, as negotiators contemplate the future of their climate commitments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The need for blended finance Sharad Somani, partner and head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) at KPMG in Singapore, pointed out that adaptation measures are often seen as the poorer cousin of climate mitigation; they are under-invested, as the focus has been to contain climate impacts through the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions.</p><p> That's because most adaptation measures tend to be public infrastructure projects, such as coastal defences or drainage systems. And such projects tend not to lend themselves well to traditional commercial financing models, said Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public-sector solutions for Asia-Pacific at Swiss Re. </p><p> This is because dividends often manifest as a loss avoided, rather than an additive cash flow on which investors can rely on, he added.</p><p> On top of these challenges are the facts that adaptation efforts are costly and most often needed in countries with limited resources, and they tend to be localised projects -- where there are plenty of needs competing for limited funds, he also said.</p><p> The Global Stocktake report found that financial support for adaptation continues to fall far behind mitigation investments. However, the share of total climate-specific financial support has grown to 28 per cent between 2019 and 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous two-year period. </p><p> Citing forecasts from the UN Environment Programme, Somani pointed out that the annual cost of climate adaptation in poor countries alone could double or possibly even quadruple -- from US$70 billion today to between US$140 billion and US$300 billion by 2030.</p><p> To direct such high levels of capital towards climate adaptation, observers said that blended finance -- which combines private, public and catalytic funding -- is an important mechanism.</p><p> Neha Bhatia, partner for ESG and sustainable finance at consultancy ERM, said that beyond developing a baseline framework or policy guidelines from which adaptation projects can take off, governments can provide the first layer of capital to absorb the initial risk before partnering multilateral development banks, or local development financial institutions, for the next layer of developmental capital.</p><p> \"Only then, when you de-risk to this point... private players with innovative solutions can come in and build adaptation solutions on top of that, because they know that they have a stable policy environment, they know they have risk support, they know they have technical support,\" she said. </p><p> Catalytic funding, in the form of grants, government incentives or impact investment, can also be the first layer of capital that enables the development of pilot solutions and proofs of concept, said Varbanov. He added that such collaborative models spread the costs and risks of change over several different actors. </p><p> Mobilising private finance To get more private financing into climate adaptation, Somani said there is a need to address companies' bias against such measures, which are often wrongly perceived as having low returns and impact. </p><p> The bias is evident given that the private sector's contribution to adaptation measures stood at just 2 per cent of the global adaptation spend, according to data collated by non-profit outfit Climate Policy Initiative, he noted. As the impacts of climate change become more evident, businesses may actually end up forking out as much as 44 per cent of their profits to pay for damages caused by climate-related impacts, going by an economic study of nearly 15,000 public companies published in the journal Science last month. </p><p> One way to unlock more private-sector financing for climate adaptation is to have companies pay more attention to disaster risk, said Christopher Au, director of Willis Tower Watson's Asia-Pacific Climate and Resilience Hub.</p><p> For example, a coastal manufacturing facility located in the Philippines, which experiences 20 typhoons annually on average, would see the value of investing in the conservation of mangrove swamps. These natural ecosystems have proven to be effective in preventing storm surges from reaching inland.</p><p> \"This is a public good... But the mangrove being there is providing (the factory) financial benefits. It's protecting your facilities. It's allowing you to exist... You may not own the mangrove, but we think you should invest in its conservation because it's protecting your facility,\" said Au. </p><p> He also noted that there has been academic work showing that such nature-based solutions reduce losses from natural disasters by 25 per cent. </p><p> With reduced losses as a result of climate adaptation, companies could potentially experience more affordable and stable insurance premiums as well, though observers noted that premiums may not actually come down given that many other factors are being considered when pricing them. </p><p> While some told BT that there is a lack of data -- regarding both adaptation activities and exposure to climate-related events -- to help others understand how adaptation investments could affect broader risk assessments, Tobias Grimm said Munich Re has seen strong indications in its own data and analysis that climate change is a massive loss driver.</p><p> The head of climate advisory and natural catastrophe data at the reinsurer said: \"Strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability -- at both individual and community levels -- will help to soften the societal and economic shocks of natural disasters.\"</p><p> While all companies across all sectors should invest in strengthening their business resilience against climate-related events, the agriculture industry is particularly exposed to direct impacts, observers pointed out.</p><p> With farmers facing more drastic weather cycles, major agribusinesses that depend on them as suppliers could consider extending loans to these farming cooperatives for them to invest in better irrigation systems or purchase seeds with higher yields, said Willis Tower Watson's Au. </p><p> Financial institutions, though not directly hit by such events, have the most difficult and widespread exposure, said Alain Mahieu and Amy Steel, climate risk experts at Engie Impact. </p><p> \"Portfolio managers face a daunting task (grappling) with widespread impact and inability to drive direct adaptation measures on the ground,\" they said. </p><p> On the other hand, property developers are potentially big winners, especially those ahead of the curve on sustainable design and construction, said Olivia Jensen, deputy director for Lloyd's Register Foundation Institute for the Public Understanding of Risk at the National University of Singapore. </p><p> \"In the future, we can imagine floating residential districts off the coasts of Asia's big cities, integrated with resilient infrastructure. In the more immediate future, onshore developments can incorporate flood protection with restoration of waterways and urban regeneration, raising property values,\" she added. </p><p> Technology companies with solutions to improve water efficiency and reuse wastewater also stand to benefit in an increasingly water-insecure region.</p><p> Ultimately, regardless of the sector they are in, companies that take measures to strengthen their resilience against climate-related impacts would be able to stay ahead of the game, observers said.</p><p> Those that are able to come up with adaptation solutions, such as climate-adaptive clothing that is able to cool down body temperatures, or incorporate drought- or flood-resilient materials in construction, could also come out on top, said Bhatia of ERM. </p><p> Sometimes, adaptation actions do not have to come in the form of an infrastructure project, which is the conventional idea of what such measures entail. </p><p> Au noted that some companies are already increasing their resilience by identifying risks in their supply chains and addressing, diversifying or shortening them. </p><p> \"The market will increasingly favour forward-looking companies that prioritise sustainability and are mitigating and adapting to climate change for a robust supply chain,\" said KPMG's Somani.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Observers say that the private sector should look into investing in climate adaptation to increase business resilience, especially for sectors such as agriculture, which is directly exposed to climate-change impacts.

With the right strategy, Indonesia is poised to position itself as an engine of global green growth, unlocking a US$400 billion annual green growth economic opportunity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The truth is that Indonesia's impressive economic expansion has put it at the sharp edge of the climate challenge. </p><p> Changes in land use, fossil-fuel-heavy energy production, and growing consumption mean Indonesia is now the fourth-largest annual emitter of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), responsible for 4 per cent of global annual emissions. </p><p> It's equally true that, as a developing country, Indonesia needs to maintain economic growth to further improve living standards. </p><p> However, it is increasingly important that this occurs in a way that decouples growth from emissions. </p><p> If global warming exceeds 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels, Indonesia is vulnerable to an economic hit as extreme as a 40 per cent loss to GDP, with over 19 million people potentially displaced by rising sea levels. These stark figures highlight the imperative to build a green growth future for Indonesia.</p><p> Fresh opportunitiesIndonesia's transition to a green growth economy will require a whole-of-nation approach, engaging communities and businesses of all sizes. Large players will, of course, play a critical role, but so too will the vibrant micro-, small-, and medium-sized enterprises that provide the backbone of the national economy.</p><p> In our recent study, Catalysing Indonesia's Green Growth Potential, Boston Consulting Group and AC Ventures identified a substantial US$400 billion annual green growth windfall Indonesia could unlock by 2030. This lucrative transition will require all stakeholders, of all sizes, across all sectors to participate, with three central participation pathways.</p><p> Green growth strategy and professional services to help organisations transform could unlock up to US$46 billion annually.

Countries are strengthening their climate pledges in advance of the COP27 meeting in Egypt later this year, and governments are designing regulations to help achieve these pledges -- for example, by enshrining net-zero goals in law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Cutting emissions requires a major focus and effort across the economy. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says we must invest in activities that remove CO2 from the atmosphere if we are to meet the Paris aims. </p><p> However, it is also important to stress that natural carbon cycles and nature-based solutions will be a key part of the response to climate change.</p><p> Forestry: part of the solutionForests are central to the global carbon cycle, acting as the Earth's lungs by removing and releasing CO2 in tune with the waxing and waning of the seasons.</p><p> Deforestation has interrupted this cycle by releasing CO2 into the atmosphere, while there are no trees to store the CO2 again through regeneration. Protecting mature forests and engaging in reforestation can help to maintain stored carbon and/or increase nature's capacity to draw it back down.</p><p> Recent research has indicated that between 2001 and 2019, global forests acted as a net carbon sink through natural growth, removing around 7.6 gigatonnes of CO2 per year from the atmosphere.</p><p> Clearly, this is a crucially important ecosystem service. Beyond the lens of net zero, forests provide other benefits such as biodiversity preservation and water management.</p><p> Thinking along these lines, and in a world where CO2 is increasingly valued, the dynamics of forests as an asset class are changing. </p><p> Traditionally, forestry was viewed as a source of predictable cash flows from products such as wood, pulp and paper, and has been used to hedge against inflation.</p><p> Now, forests have become a key means of addressing carbon footprints. There are other reasons to rethink forest assets. If managed sustainably, forests can provide bio-based products that reduce the reliance on emissions-intensive equivalents -- for example, cross-laminated timber in buildings rather than steel, concrete or plastic alternatives.</p><p> Furthermore, there is the generation of carbon-offset credits. Owners of forests can recognise and capitalise on their annual carbon storage through these carbon credits.</p><p> Investors in forests therefore can take credit for any carbon offsets generated by their investments, reducing residual emissions in their portfolios.</p><p> Surplus credits generated could be sold to third parties. In such a case, only the buyers of the credits could then recognise the potential offset.</p><p>  A market in carbon offsets from forests could reach US$800 billion by 2050, driven by investors and corporates interested in offsetting unavoidable emissions. BloombergNEF predicts offset prices could reach up to US$215 per ton in 2030, from an average of around US$2.50 today.</p><p> It is important, however, that forest carbon credits are generated carefully and verifiably according to recognised standards to ensure a real-world CO2 reduction. This is needed to avoid poor quality projects that result in \"junk\" credits entering into circulation. This problem has plagued offset markets. Initiatives that bolster trust such as the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets should help.</p><p> Wildfires -- like those seen recently in France and across Europe -- represent another threat to carbon offsets and the permanence of stored CO2, and will need to be taken into account when designing effective offset projects.</p><p> A strategic asset allocationIt is becoming clear that achieving net zero only through the reduction of CO2 emissions by large corporates is unlikely to suffice. Unavoidable emissions will remain, despite best efforts, given the existing technological constraints. Therefore, significant investment in reforestation, afforestation and nature-based solutions will be critical to achieving net zero.</p><p> We believe forestry represents a strategic asset class to which institutional investors are underexposed. </p><p> Currently, investors have around US$100 billion dedicated to forestry, compared to around US$4 trillion in private equity.</p><p> In our view, forests are attractive thanks to portfolio diversification. They offer the prospect of positive returns through carbon price increases and through rising demand for wood from sustainable sources. </p><p> Recent rounds of timber inflation underscore the financial value of this important commodity. Forests also support carbon reduction and biodiversity.</p><p> To boost the appeal of forests as an investment, one will need to consider the opportunity and risks from traditional forest product sales, as well as new ones involving carbon offsets. This is particularly the case in emerging markets as 71 per cent of the unrealised CO2 sequestration potential exists in tropical ecosystems.</p><p> It is also important to consider how policy related to these assets will change in the future. Similar to a broader Inevitable Policy Response (IPR), there could be opportunities for investors in a significant, inevitable forest finance response. Net-zero commitments together with the relative affordability and scalability of nature-based climate solutions can help reverse the current deforestation trend.</p><p> IPR's Forecast Policy Scenario expects net forest-cover loss to cease by 2030, and 350 million hectares of afforestation and reforestation to occur by 2050. Consideration will need to be given not only to the availability of land for reforestation, but also to the impact on food production and biodiversity hotspots.</p><p> We believe there is significant unrealised potential and an opportunity for investors when it comes to forestry -- both to diversify portfolios and to support carbon reduction efforts. </p><p> The writer is biodiversity lead, BNP Paribas Asset Management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Forests are a net carbon sink through natural growth and remove 7.6 gigatonnes of CO2 a year from the atmosphere. photo: Pixabay</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-J6HDPE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:668D-NHC1-DYX4-0232-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1005\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Singapore and Sweden are both ranked among the Top 5 most innovative economies on the 2023 Global Innovation Index. Singapore has committed about S$25 billion between 2021 and 2025 to strengthen research, innovation, and enterprise capabilities. Singapore has launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, the first of its kind globally to comprehensively define transition activities across 8 focus sectors. Singapore is continually enhancing its R&amp;D ecosystem to offer partners a testbed for innovation and a gateway to scale new technologies across Asia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dec. 5 -- Prime Minister's Office Singapore issued the following speech by Heng Swee Keat:</p><p>Speech by Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies Heng Swee Keat at the Sweden Indo-Pacific Business Summit on 5 December 2023.</p><p>Mr Johan Forsell, Minister for International Development Cooperation and Foreign Trade, Sweden,</p><p>Mr Anders Sjoberg, Ambassador of Sweden to Singapore,</p><p>Mr Andrew Kwan, Non-Resident Ambassador of Singapore to Sweden,</p><p>Mr Jan Larsson, CEO, Business Sweden,</p><p>Excellencies,</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Good morning and a very warm welcome to Singapore to Minister Forsell and his delegation. Welcome also to friends from around Asia who are joining us for today's Sweden Indo-Pacific Business Summit with an important theme, \"Green Transition, powered by Innovation\".</p><p>Even though Singapore and Sweden are almost 10,000 kilometres apart, it is remarkable that so many Swedish businesses have invested here and in the wider region.</p><p>In Singapore alone, almost 500 Swedish companies have established a presence over the years.</p><p>These include some household names to many Singaporeans today, like Ikea, Electrolux, and H&amp;M.</p><p>Prominent Swedish citizens have also made notable contributions to Singapore's growth story.</p><p>This includes Professor Bertil Andersson who was President of Nanyang Technological University from 2011 to 2017 and led NTU to strong international recognition.</p><p>I am also delighted to see Mr Marcus Wallenberg joining us today. Marcus served for many years on the Board of Temasek. Today, he continues to share his insights and experience as a member of the Temasek International Panel. Thank you, Marcus, for your many valued contributions!</p><p>That many Swedish businesses venture into markets far from home reflects the strong entrepreneurial spirit of your business leaders. Coming from a temperate climate, you are adventurous and bold enough to brave the heat of the tropics!</p><p>It also illustrates how Sweden, like Singapore, recognises the importance of globalisation and our role in a globalised world. Even though we are small states, size alone does not determine our economic growth and ambitions.</p><p>We can be active and constructive on the global stage in ways that bring value to us and the world.</p><p>By supporting a rules-based international economic order and nurturing globally minded enterprises, we can contribute to building global prosperity, uplift people both at home and abroad, and take care of our planet.</p><p>As we look to enhance global economic resilience in the coming years, I share the view of many that innovation, especially that powered by technology, will be critical.</p><p>In the past few years, we have seen a wave of new technological breakthroughs across sectors.</p><p>During the COVID pandemic, we saw how the rapid development of mRNA vaccines saved millions of lives.</p><p>More recently, the growing deployment of digital technology and Artificial Intelligence is transforming how we live and work.</p><p>Such advancements in science and technology can unlock new growth opportunities and address global challenges, across borders and regions.</p><p>Sweden and Singapore both appreciate the value of innovation and have invested in building capacity for innovation.</p><p>We are both ranked among the Top 5 most innovative economies on the 2023 Global Innovation Index.</p><p>In 2022, Singapore launched a pilot acceleration programme in Stockholm under the Global Innovation Alliance initiative to help promising Singapore startups scale internationally. This was our first such partnership in the Nordic region.</p><p>Since then, we have forged win-win partnerships through collaboration with Swedish enterprises and will implement a second run of the programme in 2024.</p><p>Such innovation is not only good for business and economic growth.</p><p>As we head into a more uncertain world, innovation will also help us tackle pressing global challenges and build a better future.</p><p>One such critical global challenge is climate change.</p><p>Climate change affects everyone across countries, regardless of size or geography.</p><p>Extreme weather events could also trigger broader social and economic disruptions.</p><p>Europe saw one of its warmest summers in 2023, with record temperatures of 48.8 degrees Celsius in some areas.</p><p>Here in Southeast Asia, climate change has notably intensified floods and typhoons. Singapore, as a low-lying island state, is particularly vulnerable to the threat of rising sea-levels.</p><p>Climate action, and making the green transition, is therefore more than just a priority. It is essential for our survival - here in this region and globally.</p><p>Sweden, with the rest of the European Union, has launched the European Green Deal with the aim of making Europe the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050.</p><p>Here in Southeast Asia, nine countries have articulated net-zero goals by or around mid-century.</p><p>Singapore, on our part, has committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with the public sector committing to net-zero by 2045, 5 years earlier.</p><p>Two years ago, we published the Singapore Green Plan 2030 charting ambitious and concrete targets to advance our national agenda on sustainable development.</p><p>The Green Plan recognises that any successful green transition must involve all stakeholders and leverage a range of policy tools and programmes.</p><p>We have boosted the adoption of electric vehicles and accelerated the transition of the use of cleaner and lower-carbon fuels for our maritime and aviation sectors.</p><p>We are also investing in building green skills in our workforce - such as carbon footprint management, and energy management and audit - to prepare them to pivot to a low-carbon future.</p><p>In 2019, Singapore also became the first country in Southeast Asia to implement a carbon tax.</p><p>We are raising this progressively in stages until 2030, to strengthen the price signal and impetus for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>Our carbon pricing trajectory will enhance the business case to invest in low-carbon solutions, helping businesses remain competitive in a low-carbon future.</p><p>The revenue collected from the carbon tax will be used to support decarbonisation efforts and the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as cushion the impact on businesses and households.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore, our central bank, is also supporting the mobilisation of green and transition finance to catalyse greater climate action in the region.</p><p>Two days ago at COP-28, MAS launched the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy, the first of its kind globally to comprehensively define transition activities across 8 focus sectors.</p><p>By providing an objective definition on whether economic activities are green or transition, taxonomies guide investors and financiers to channel capital responsibly.</p><p>This new Singapore-Asia Taxonomy will enable financing to flow to climate-friendly transition activities while minimising the risk of greenwashing.</p><p>MAS has also launched a Transition Credits Coalition, or TRACTION.</p><p>This will study the challenges and propose solutions to scale the early retirement of coal-fired power plants in Asia through high-integrity carbon credits.</p><p>I said earlier that innovation can help us address global challenges.</p><p>To support our R&amp;D ambitions, Singapore has committed about S$25 billion between 2021 and 2025 to strengthen our research, innovation and enterprise capabilities.</p><p>A big part of this, complementing our green transition, is being channelled towards the urban solutions and sustainability domain.</p><p>Our universities and research institutes are studying low-carbon energy solutions like hydrogen, decarbonising the built environment, tackling urban heat, and sustainable agri-food production.</p><p>Some companies, partnering with our universities, have also set up various Corporate Labs pursuing market-relevant research in clean energy and sustainability solutions. Climate change also has a significant impact on human health. Many researchers and institutes in both Sweden and Singapore are also working on this.</p><p>The impact of such innovation and research can be amplified significantly through cross-border and cross-regional collaboration.</p><p>Singapore and Sweden are well-positioned to leverage strong frameworks of cooperation and deepen our linkages in this area.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, for instance, has added robustness to Singapore's economic ties with Sweden.</p><p>Since the Free Trade Agreement entered into force in 2019, bilateral trade in goods has increased by nearly 25% and trade in services has risen by almost 50%.</p><p>The Free Trade Agreement also commits both sides to resolving non-tariff barriers including for renewable energy generation.</p><p>In addition, the Free Trade Agreement protects intellectual property and soft assets, including many innovative green technologies.</p><p>More recently, we have also launched negotiations on an EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement, to enhance digital connectivity between the two sides and give businesses added confidence to transact in the digital economy.</p><p>The digital revolution is closely interlinked with the green transition. New digital solutions and technologies can potentially help accelerate our progress to a greener, more sustainable future.</p><p>Singapore looks forward to the Swedish business community's support for the EU-Singapore Digital Trade Agreement, which will help send a strong signal on shaping global rules and standards on digital trade.</p><p>It could also serve as a pathfinder for similar future arrangements between the EU and ASEAN.</p><p>In a similar vein, I would also encourage Swedish companies to consider collaborating with the Singapore ecosystem.</p><p>Sweden has produced sustainability champions, both in terms of large corporates driving sustainability innovation and scale-ups deploying next-generation technologies.</p><p>In fact, I was at the EuroCham Sustainability Awards last month where the Swedish Chamber of Commerce here won the inaugural Green Initiative of the Year award, setting a positive example for other international business chambers.</p><p>Southeast Asia is a dynamic and high-growth region of more than 670 million people.</p><p>The region is projected to be the fourth-largest economy globally by 2030, driven by youthful demographics and a growing middle class. If you include India, then it is a combined market size of more than 2 billion.</p><p>As a regional business and finance hub, Singapore can be a base for Swedish businesses to connect with partners across Southeast Asia and the larger Asia-Pacific region, making the best use of trade, investment and intellectual property agreements that we have negotiated over the years.</p><p>For example, we are leveraging our strengths as an international financial centre and business hub to establish ourselves as a vibrant carbon services and trading hub. Carbon Impact X, a global carbon exchange and marketplace looking at the trading of carbon credits, is based in Singapore.</p><p>We welcome companies across the carbon market value chain to set up in Singapore and use us as a base to expand into the region which has huge potential for mitigation activities particularly in nature-based solutions.</p><p>I earlier mentioned MAS' activities in green and transition finance. Singapore is working with various stakeholders to develop and scale Asia-tailored transition finance solutions to capture transition opportunities.</p><p>To enable the new Singapore-Asia Taxonomy to facilitate cross-border green and transition financial flows, we have embarked on plans to enhance interoperability with the taxonomies of other geographies, including the EU.</p><p>We are keen to work with European partners, including from Sweden, to develop sustainability-related capabilities in Singapore and grow the range of sustainable finance solutions to serve clients in Asia.</p><p>As a Global-Asia node of technology, innovation and enterprise, Singapore is also continually enhancing our R&amp;D ecosystem to offer partners a testbed for innovation and a gateway to scale new technologies across Asia.</p><p>Our Institutes of Higher Learning and research institutes are ready partners to industry.</p><p>Their deep capabilities and translational platforms can accelerate the translation of research into industry and market-relevant solutions.</p><p>I am also pleased to see our Institutes of Higher Learning deepen linkages with Swedish counterparts with an eye to enabling the green transition.</p><p>NTU, for example, will be collaborating with the Stockholm School of Economics, Minister Forsell's alma mater, to deliver its Executive Master of Science in Sustainability Management.</p><p>This will help to meet growing industry needs for expertise in sustainability management.</p><p>I hope that more universities on both sides can follow suit to forge similar collaborations.</p><p>Let me conclude. Since we established diplomatic relations in 1966, Singapore and Sweden have built up wide-ranging cooperation in defence, education, the environment, and research and development.</p><p>As we move forward to further enhance ties, tackling climate change and making the green transition are good opportunities to deepen our collaborations in the important area of innovation.</p><p>I wish you meaningful, productive, and constructive discussions for the rest of the Summit today. Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Professional Services, Events]</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063260750</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69T3-WC71-JB5M-W4Y8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2321\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>December 5, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

Located in the western part of the Gardens, the 60-ha Lakeside Garden has a new northern section that serves as its newest active zone. It features the biggest outdoor skate park in Singapore, situated amidst recreated forest habitats interspersed with wetland pools. The skate park is also the first in Singapore with a parkour park and bouldering wall, and was designed in close consultation with the community. The new active zone expands the variety of experiences for visitors of all ages at Lakeside Garden, advancing the Gardens' vision of being a people's garden.</p><p>Located adjacent to Lakeside MRT station, the new 7-ha northern section of Lakeside Garden serves as a main gateway into the Gardens, the first national gardens in the heartlands, and offers the public even more recreational options set amidst nature, contributing towards NParks' efforts to transform Singapore into a City in Nature.</p><p>To mark the completion of Lakeside Garden, special guests Mr Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Senior Minister and Coordinating Minister for Social Policies and Adviser to Jurong GRC Grassroots Organisations (GROs) (Taman Jurong), Ms Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Adviser to Yuhua GROs, and other Advisers to Jurong GRC GROs joined Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, to plant Jurong trees (Mussaendopsis beccariana) at the northern section of Lakeside Garden.</p><p>New youth-oriented amenities, including biggest outdoor skate park in Singapore</p><p>Lakeside Garden is a green recreational node with spaces for all to enjoy, including nature areas with rich biodiversity, community spaces for events and gatherings, and active zones for leisure and recreation. Similarly, the new northern section was designed in accordance with the Gardens' key themes of nature, community and play. It is the newest active zone within Lakeside Garden, offering an array of youth-oriented amenities. This includes the biggest outdoor skate park in Singapore at nearly 17,000 m2, which also includes a parkour park and a bouldering wall.</p><p>These features are the culmination of the feedback received from engagements with various sport interest groups such as skateboarders, in-line skaters, BMX riders and parkour enthusiasts. The skate park will also play host to vibrant programming for the youths and sporting community, such as skateboarding or parkour-related competitions and workshops.</p><p>Continued focus on sustainability and technology</p><p>As NParks' Living Lab, the Gardens is a showcase for sustainable design and development, and smart technology for sustainable operations. The northern section of Lakeside Garden continues the Gardens' emphasis on sustainability and technology with solutions that contribute towards sustainable outcomes and efficient operations. These include using greener materials that are sensitive to the environment such as mass-engineered timber, leveraging nature-based solutions such as vegetated detention ponds for irrigation, and implementing the first Integrated Gardens Management System in a park or garden. This push for sustainability is also in line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a nationwide movement that charts Singapore's sustainable development.</p><p>Upcoming enhancements</p><p>Since the opening of Lakeside Garden in 2019, the Gardens has attracted over 17 million visitors. With Lakeside Garden now completed, the public can next look forward to the opening of Chinese and Japanese Gardens in 2024. The Gardens is part of broader efforts to develop Jurong Lake District as an urban centre outside the downtown area to bring jobs, amenities and recreational options closer to homes. As the green oasis of Jurong Lake District, the Gardens with its upcoming features will continue to serve as a people's garden for all to enjoy within our City in Nature.</p><p>Source: National Parks Board, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Business Expansion]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0060507511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67XM-7J61-DXMP-K27T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"830\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 1, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CQVD</classCode><className>JURONG INTERNATIONAL HOLDINGS PTE LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541330 ENGINEERING SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS541310 ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120MM</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; RECREATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CRH5</classCode><className>SKATEBOARDING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001832</classCode><className>WETLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DN66</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001620</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION FACILITIES &amp; VENUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001191</classCode><className>CLIMBING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001960</classCode><className>PUBLIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A3I2</classCode><className>EXTREME SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Instead, the republic should invest in the region and serve as a knowledge hub for sustainability, says conservation scientist Professor Koh Lian Pin.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Koh is director of the Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions (CNCS) at the National University of Singapore (NUS). In January, he took on an additional portfolio as policymaker, and currently serves as a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's neighbours may hold the key to a greener world. Koh says Indonesia and Malaysia are among the top five countries in the world where the most carbon emissions can be avoided, simply by protecting their forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are financial motivations as well, as these forests provide high-quality nature-based carbon offsets for the region. These will come to the fore with the launch of Climate Impact X (CIX), Singapore's global carbon exchange and marketplace, later this year.</p><p>The Asia Pacific has the highest concentration of the most profitable carbon projects, Koh adds, which can generate returns close to US$25 billion ($33.6 billion) in net present value each year for the next three decades. \"Indonesia alone can generate about US$10 billion per year, every year, for the next 30 years,\" he says.</p><p>At the CNCS, Koh and his fellow scientists work closely with both the public and private sectors to address the most urgent science and knowledge gaps. \"[We] improve the evidence base that helps inform our policies and business decisions on climate strategies and actions,\" says Koh.</p><p>On Sept 30, Temasek pledged $3 million to the NUS CNCS to implement a five-year research programme. The new NUS-Temasek Blue Carbon Project builds on nearly a decade of NUS research in measuring blue carbon, particularly in mangroves and sea grasses. Mangroves are one of the coastal ecosystems that have been identified to sequester and store more carbon per unit area than terrestrial forests.</p><p>Speaking at Temasek's Ecosperity Week 2021, Koh stressed that nature-based solutions - like protecting existing forests - are a scalable solution. \"We know that global carbon emissions are currently at about 40 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year. Our research shows that by protecting threatened forests across the tropics, we can avoid the loss of almost two billion tonnes of CO2 per year. This is greater than the emissions of Indonesia and Singapore combined.\"</p><p>By simply leaving forests untouched, the world can do more by doing less. Could this be more effective than spending millions on new equipment to placate our green guilt?</p><p>In an interview with The Edge Singapore, Koh points to the recent launch of the world's biggest carbon capture plant, which cost U$15 million and took 18 months to construct. Located in Iceland, the machine - named Orca - can trap and sequester 4,000 metric tonnes of CO2 per year.</p><p>That gas is mixed with water and the mixture is pumped into the volcanic basalt bedrock of Iceland to form calcium carbonate, otherwise known as limestone. Iceland is built upon relatively younger basalt - which is more porous - offering more space for carbon to fill.</p><p>It sounds impressive, until the penny drops: In a year, Orca will offset just three seconds' worth of global emissions. \"That is a hugely expensive machine, both financially and in terms of energy demand,\" says Koh. \"It is still very much a demonstration - a pilot project - and there are huge questions and uncertainties about scalability, whether we can actually scale it up to a level that will make any real difference.\"</p><p>\"Whether we invest in technological solutions or not, we still need to turn off the tap of emissions; from land use change, deforestation and forest degradation,\" he adds.</p><p>Singapore's green strategy</p><p>Koh brings 16 years of international research experience in sustainability and environmental science, having worked previously as a Swiss National Science Foundation Professor at ETH Z\u00fcrich - a public research university in the city of Z\u00fcrich, Switzerland - as well as in Australia and the US.</p><p>Koh, who has a doctorate in ecology and evolutionary biology from Princeton University, returned to Singapore last year under the National Research Foundation's Returning Singaporean Scientists scheme for a homecoming of sorts - he joined the Department of Biological Sciences at NUS, where he did his bachelor's and master's in biological sciences.</p><p>When he was tapped to join Parliament late last year, Koh consulted with Dr Geh Min - former president of the Nature Society (Singapore) and NMP from 2005 to 2006 - who convinced him to accept the role.</p><p>\"My main motivation for accepting the nomination is to serve as a bridge between the government and the environmental community in Singapore,\" he says.</p><p>In July, the government walked back plans to raze Dover Forest for housing projects after conservation scientists highlighted the value of the 33ha site. Instead, public housing will only be launched in half the plot, for now.</p><p>\"That shows the government is taking the concerns and the opinions of the public very seriously, while also having to juggle different priorities,\" says Koh.</p><p>Such cases of competing uses of land in Singapore extends to our green strategy, says Koh. One example is the newly launched solar floating farm at Tengeh Reservoir. \"We have many other priorities; there's only so much we can do in terms of implementing nature-based solutions in Singapore.\"</p><p>For all the buzz over the Sembcorp Tengeh Floating Solar Farm, the facility has its limitations too. Besides being land intensive, the other constraint is Singapore's persistent cloud cover, says Koh. \"The number of conducive daylight hours for maximum solar energy production can be quite limited, especially during certain parts of the year,\" says Koh.</p><p>One thing we have yet to learn is the potential environmental impact on the reservoir itself, he adds. \"There's always a trade-off. We need to have a good idea of what that means for the plants, animals and microbes living below the water, or in the water.\"</p><p>The pluralistic approach</p><p>Now armed with months of experience in Parliament, how would Koh reshape Singapore's environment if offered unlimited resources? \"Interesting question. I would actually continue down the road that Singapore is on, which is a pluralistic approach.\"</p><p>\"One is to continue to identify priority areas that we should be investing in, to produce high-quality carbon offsets, as well as to protect and regrow the forest,\" says Koh.</p><p>\"Secondly, [I would] invest in capacity building at the regional level. I think Singapore has the educational and research infrastructure to be a knowledge hub and knowledge partner for the region. We have the responsibility to make sure that we build capacity across the region, so that our neighbours can help realise the potential of these nature-based solutions across Southeast Asia,\" he adds.</p><p>\"Thirdly, I would invest quite a bit on facilitating and empowering public [and] private sectors to work more closely together. What we have done with the Emerging Stronger Taskforce and the many Alliances for Action is a great model we can replicate for other challenges we are facing,\" says Koh.</p><p>\"The private sector can implement these viable products through these discussions and the public sector can support them with policy frameworks and an enabling environment around those solutions,\" he adds. \"I hope that these public-private partnerships can continue to flourish as we address other emerging challenges.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6421-PP11-JCF0-3007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1259\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Glad you can join me to mark the completion of Phase 1 of the Bishan-to-City route.</p><p>Bishan-to-City Route</p><p>The 10km Bishan-to-City route, or B2C route for short, connects Bishan to our Central Business District. It provides a safer and more direct journey for pedestrians, joggers and cyclists traveling from our heartlands to the city. It is part of our plan to rejuvenate the Kallang River and enhance the existing Kallang Park Connector. The project also supports our national sustainability goals, by facilitating greener commutes through active mobility infrastructure.</p><p>Previously interrupted by expressways and major roads, we have introduced new and enhanced underpasses as well as signalised crossings, allowing seamless movement along the park connector from Bishan to Potong Pasir, and from Kolam Ayer to Marina Bay.</p><p>Construction works to bridge the last gap across the PIE will start soon. This will include Singapore's longest elevated pedestrian and cycling bridge, and we expect it to be completed by 2027.</p><p>Besides improving connectivity, this project has allowed us to create vibrant public spaces with the community. We also have plans to enhance residents' access to the Kallang River.</p><p>The painted benches you see here are actually the work of residents and students, some of whom are with us today. Can I invite you to raise your hands so we can acknowledge you? We will also be planting trees, later this morning. Thank you for coming together to make this space even more vibrant. We hope that all of you can join us in planting the trees, especially our children. We plant trees today, for the benefit of giving shade to the next generation.</p><p>Importance of Long-Term Planning</p><p>Let me say a bit more about long-term planning. The B2C route and other developments you see along Kallang River today are examples that demonstrate the way we plan in Singapore.</p><p>Decades ago, our early planners envisioned transforming the river and its surroundings into a highly liveable environment - one that not only catered to the needs of their time, but also for generations after them - for us and for our children.</p><p>By carefully stewarding our limited land and taking a long-term perspective, the plans were progressively brought to life over many decades - from paper, to reality on the ground. Today, diverse housing options, modern workplaces and green recreation spaces are meaningfully and sensitively interwoven to form vibrant neighbourhoods for residents, businesses, and the community.</p><p>It is this very same principle of stewardship - of planning ahead, thinking beyond our own immediate interests, and balancing the needs of our generation and the next - that we want to continue to embody, as we chart Singapore's future development.</p><p>This is especially critical as land pressures become increasingly acute and trade-offs harder to navigate. We must also find creative and innovative ways to optimise the use of land. This includes tapping underground spaces, co-locating multiple uses within a single space, and redeveloping brownfield sites, including residential estates. Such comprehensive redevelopment allows us to rejuvenate our estates and provide new housing opportunities for future generations.</p><p>Launch of the Draft Master Plan 2025 Conversations</p><p>With this in mind, I am now delighted to launch the public engagement for the Draft Master Plan 2025 today, where we will reach out to Singaporeans and invite you to join us in conversation. T his follows from the recent Long-Term Plan Review where we developed long-term strategies to guide Singapore's development over the next 50 years.</p><p>During those conversations as well as our Forward Singapore engagements, many Singaporeans have shared their aspirations for the Singapore of today and tomorrow and the values that they hold dear. These include accessible and affordable housing, good job opportunities for all, and a city that is sustainable, green, and anchored on a strong sense of identity.</p><p>In reviewing the Master Plan, we will translate the long-term strategies identified during the Long-Term Plan Review into detailed plans that we will implement on the ground and in your neighbourhood, over the next 10 to 15 years.</p><p>Over the next two years, we will reach out to stakeholders from all walks of life on the Draft Master Plan so that we can shape the future Singapore together.</p><p>With many competing needs as well as the increasingly diverse aspirations of Singaporeans, our choices on how we use our land may not necessarily meet everyone's expectations. But through the process of dialogue and conversation, of give and take, of thinking about what we need and what future generations need, and also trying to come up with win-win solutions, we hope both planners and members of public can better understand the range of different needs and interests, and how they can be appropriately accommodated within our small island city-state.</p><p>Shaping the future of Singapore</p><p>We propose to plan along four key themes.</p><p>First - 'Shaping a Happy Healthy City'. To build stronger communities and cater to diverse aspirations, we will be studying the possibility of developing a good mix of private and public housing in more central locations, which may include the city area, former Keppel golf course site, and Bukit Timah Turf City. We will also develop a Recreation Master Plan to see how we can make facilities and spaces more accessible in order to promote active lifestyles, ageing-in-place and a healthier population.</p><p>The second theme is, 'Strengthening Urban Resilience'. We will need to protect Singapore against the adverse effects of climate change, and respond more nimbly to crises and challenges. We will adopt technology and innovation, optimise existing spaces, and integrate nature-based solutions within our city infrastructure. We will tap on more underground spaces, and study how we can better protect our coastlines and enhance the heat resilience of our city. Because Singapore will not withstand the effects of climate change, and how well we protect Singaporeans and our city from climate change will define us into the future.</p><p>The third theme is, 'Enabling Sustainable Growth', we will focus on sustaining a thriving economy and meeting the needs of businesses and our workers. More flexible spaces and mixed-use sites will be injected into areas such as Jurong Lake District as well as other commercial nodes. We will also launch sites with different land tenures and different plot densities to meet the changing needs of our businesses and enterprises.</p><p>The final theme is 'Stewarding Nature &amp; Heritage'. Singaporeans cherish our biodiversity, our green spaces and natural environment, and desire to retain well-loved and familiar surroundings. Through identity corridors, like the Kallang River, which is part of the Thomson-Kallang Corridor, we will strengthen the distinctive character and heritage of our towns and our neighbourhoods. We will also continue to enhance our green and blue spaces to bring the benefits of nature closer to Singaporeans.</p><p>We will share more on these very exciting plans over the next year. In short, we completed the Long Term Plan Review, came up with broad themes and strategies for the next 50 years, and from today, we want to engage you on how to translate those bold ideas for the next 50 years onto the ground, into our neighbourhoods. So participate actively because we will work with you to plan for the rejuvenation of the places that we live, and you will be part of the conversations for the transformation of Singapore.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Later, we'll be doing tree planting. Over the years, the saplings that we will be planting will grow into tall trees. Singapore's transformation did not take place overnight. Today we enjoy the fruits of labour from those who came before us. They had the foresight to safeguard options for the future and made a lot of sacrifices, trade-offs and hard decisions during that time.</p><p>In that same spirit, let us work together to create the Draft Master Plan 2025, not just for ourselves, but also for our children. We are always thinking of them, and the children who come after them. We want to hear your views and ideas, and discuss them constructively to make Singapore a more liveable, inclusive, and endearing home.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Transportation Infrastructure, Highways &amp; Railtracks, Business Expansion, Events]</p><p>Source: Urban Redevelopment Authority, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062660136</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69BG-SJ11-DXMP-K18R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1599\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 5, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOLT</classCode><className>PEDESTRIAN SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOGU</classCode><className>PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DIDA</classCode><className>COMMUTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001778</classCode><className>URBAN DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOGU</classCode><className>PEDESTRIAN WALKWAYS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX290</classCode><className>SINGAPORE, SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Asia -- which now runs on mainly renewable energy sources, captures carbon emissions, and continues to price and tax companies that emit greenhouse gases -- has successfully transitioned to net zero. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore has played a strong role in supporting and partnering Asia through its decarbonisation journey.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The jury is still out on whether this scenario could become reality. But it is a goal that Singapore continues to pursue. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Two years ago, Singapore launched its Green Plan 2030 to demonstrate its commitment to sustainable development. Last year, we committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p> Since then, we have made some headway, from introducing incentives to encourage businesses to be more energy-efficient to diversifying our sources of clean energy through electricity imports. Our long-term goal is to import 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will make up 30 per cent of Singapore's electricity supply by then.</p><p> But there is much more to be done. For example, we are working to develop enabling technologies, such as in carbon capture, and exploring regional partnerships to build a hydrogen supply chain in Asia, to scale our deployment of clean technologies to get us to net zero. </p><p> At the same time, as South-east Asia's governments and corporates embrace sustainable economic growth, there will be significant economic opportunities in green growth areas. The 2022 Green Economy report by Bain states that the South-east Asian region presents an annual green economic opportunity of up to US$1 trillion by 2030, across manufacturing and services in areas like agrifood, electric mobility, solar and nature-based solutions. </p><p> Taking stockIn 2019, Singapore became the first South-east Asian country to announce a carbon tax. We engaged businesses early and launched a transition framework to support companies to reduce their own emissions and navigate these changes. The government made clear that the carbon tax was not a means of deriving additional revenue in this decade but to support decarbonisation efforts and cushion the impact on businesses and households. The tax covers 80 per cent of Singapore's emissions and sends a clear price signal to induce greater decarbonisation.</p><p> Subsequently, we have announced other policies to move forward with our decarbonisation efforts. One project we view with importance is Jurong Island, which we are transforming into a sustainability-focused energy and chemicals park (\"Sustainable Jurong Island\").</p><p> Through \"Sustainable Jurong Island\", we aim to abate more than six million tonnes of carbon per year via low-carbon solutions and quadruple the island's output of sustainable products, such as bio-based fuels, from 2019 levels by 2050.</p><p> We aim to achieve this through the efforts of more than 100 leading companies in the energy, petrochemical, and specialty chemicals sectors on Jurong Island. </p><p> One such example is Arkema, a global leader in specialty materials, which plans to produce Rilsan polymer -- a robust high-performance and chemical-resistant polymer capable of withstanding high temperatures -- from castor beans, a renewable and sustainable raw material.</p><p> We are working with companies and research institutes through the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative to develop and enhance existing decarbonisation technologies. As these technologies will have to be piloted and scaled, we are studying the potential of having a Low Carbon Technologies Translational Testbed on Jurong Island. </p><p> This aims to be a plug-and-play facility, making it easy for companies to scale new technologies in the field of carbon utilisation and low-carbon hydrogen. </p><p> 'The planet's biggest opportunity for climate results'Singapore's strengths -- our strategic location in the region and strong partnerships with industry to develop innovative sustainable solutions -- put us in a good position to support Asia's decarbonisation journey and seize growth opportunities along the way. </p><p> In the heart of South-east Asia, Singapore is well placed to support the region unlock its significant potential in renewable energy. Poised to be the world's fourth largest economy by 2030 with a growing population of 500 million, the region's energy needs will be immense. </p><p> Scaling of renewable power generation such as solar and wind will be key to achieving net-zero targets in South-east Asia, while meeting the region's growing power demand. Singapore is a solar hub for Asia, with more than 100 international and local clean energy companies based here. </p><p> Our deep ecosystem with players across the value chain -- ranging from R&amp;D providers, project and legal advisories to Energy Storage System (ESS) system integrators -- also supports renewable energy companies in developing and executing projects in the region.</p><p>Singapore is also preparing for a future where low-carbon hydrogen forms a significant part of our fuel mix. We are embarking on a project to develop an end-to-end low carbon ammonia power generation and bunkering solution in Singapore. </p><p> Apart from helping to secure our clean energy future, this project will also enhance Singapore's maritime hub status as ammonia is emerging as a potential alternative fuel for shipping.</p><p>Singapore has also made headway in the development of biofuels. These fuels are produced from wastes and residues such as used cooking oil and animal fats, and have a lower greenhouse gas footprint. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), for example, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.</p><p> We are proudly the world's largest producer of SAF, thanks to renewable fuels producer Neste. In April 2023, the company expanded the capacity of its refinery, doubling its production capacity and is now able to produce up to a million tonnes of SAF each year.</p><p>Singapore is also emerging as Asia's carbon services and trading hub. Our city has the highest concentration of carbon service providers in South-east Asia, with many providers drawn to our pro-business environment, proximity to demand opportunities and collaborative ecosystem. </p><p> We are home to key organisations that work in the field of climate change and carbon markets including South Pole, The Nature Conservancy and Carbon Trust, and more than 100 other companies that use Singapore as a regional gateway to provide carbon services in Asia. Beyond carbon services and offsets, we are also leveraging our position as a green finance hub to drive investments in low-carbon solutions in Asia. </p><p> Investing in talentThe growing green economy is creating meaningful job opportunities for locals to contribute to a more sustainable future from Singapore.

Asia - which now runs on mainly renewable energy sources, captures carbon emissions, and continues to price and tax companies that emit greenhouse gases - has successfully transitioned to net zero. Singapore has played a strong role in supporting and partnering Asia through its decarbonisation journey.The jury is still out on whether this scenario could become reality. But it is a goal that Singapore continues to pursue. Two years ago, Singapore launched its Green Plan 2030 to demonstrate its commitment to sustainable development. Last year, we committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.Since then, we have made some headway, from introducing incentives to encourage businesses to be more energy-efficient to diversifying our sources of clean energy through electricity imports. </p><p>Our long-term goal is to import 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035, which will make up 30 per cent of Singapore's electricity supply by then.But there is much more to be done. For example, we are working to develop enabling technologies, such as in carbon capture, and exploring regional partnerships to build a hydrogen supply chain in Asia, to scale our deployment of clean technologies to get us to net zero. At the same time, as South-east Asia's governments and corporates embrace sustainable economic growth, there will be significant economic opportunities in green growth areas. The 2022 Green Economy report by Bain states that the South-east Asian region presents an annual green economic opportunity of up to US$1 trillion by 2030, across manufacturing and services in areas like agrifood, electric mobility, solar and nature-based solutions. Taking stockIn 2019, Singapore became the first South-east Asian country to announce a carbon tax. We engaged businesses early and launched a transition framework to support companies to reduce their own emissions and navigate these changes. The government made clear that the carbon tax was not a means of deriving additional revenue in this decade but to support decarbonisation efforts and cushion the impact on businesses and households. The tax covers 80 per cent of Singapore's emissions and sends a clear price signal to induce greater decarbonisation.Subsequently, we have announced other policies to move forward with our decarbonisation efforts. One project we view with importance is Jurong Island, which we are transforming into a sustainability-focused energy and chemicals park (\"Sustainable Jurong Island\").Through \"Sustainable Jurong Island\", we aim to abate more than six million tonnes of carbon per year via low-carbon solutions and quadruple the island's output of sustainable products, such as bio-based fuels, from 2019 levels by 2050.We aim to achieve this through the efforts of more than 100 leading companies in the energy, petrochemical, and specialty chemicals sectors on Jurong Island.One such example is Arkema, a global leader in specialty materials, which plans to produce Rilsan polymer - a robust high-performance and chemical-resistant polymer capable of withstanding high temperatures - from castor beans, a renewable and sustainable raw material.We are working with companies and research institutes through the Low-Carbon Energy Research Funding Initiative to develop and enhance existing decarbonisation technologies. As these technologies will have to be piloted and scaled, we are studying the potential of having a Low Carbon Technologies Translational Testbed on Jurong Island. This aims to be a plug-and-play facility, making it easy for companies to scale new technologies in the field of carbon utilisation and low-carbon hydrogen. 'The planet's biggest opportunity for climate results'Singapore's strengths - our strategic location in the region and strong partnerships with industry to develop innovative sustainable solutions - put us in a good position to support Asia's decarbonisation journey and seize growth opportunities along the way. In the heart of South-east Asia, Singapore is well placed to support the region unlock its significant potential in renewable energy. Poised to be the world's fourth largest economy by 2030 with a growing population of 500 million, the region's energy needs will be immense. Scaling of renewable power generation such as solar and wind will be key to achieving net-zero targets in South-east Asia, while meeting the region's growing power demand. Singapore is a solar hub for Asia, with more than 100 international and local clean energy companies based here. Our deep ecosystem with players across the value chain - ranging from R&amp;D providers, project and legal advisories to Energy Storage System (ESS) system integrators - also supports renewable energy companies in developing and executing projects in the region.Singapore is also preparing for a future where low-carbon hydrogen forms a significant part of our fuel mix. We are embarking on a project to develop an end-to-end low carbon ammonia power generation and bunkering solution in Singapore. Apart from helping to secure our clean energy future, this project will also enhance Singapore's maritime hub status as ammonia is emerging as a potential alternative fuel for shipping.Singapore has also made headway in the development of biofuels. These fuels are produced from wastes and residues such as used cooking oil and animal fats, and have a lower greenhouse gas footprint. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), for example, can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 80 per cent compared to conventional jet fuel.We are proudly the world's largest producer of SAF, thanks to renewable fuels producer Neste. In April 2023, the company expanded the capacity of its refinery, doubling its production capacity and is now able to produce up to a million tonnes of SAF each year.Singapore is also emerging as Asia's carbon services and trading hub. Our city has the highest concentration of carbon service providers in South-east Asia, with many providers drawn to our pro-business environment, proximity to demand opportunities and collaborative ecosystem. We are home to key organisations that work in the field of climate change and carbon markets including South Pole, The Nature Conservancy and Carbon Trust, and more than 100 other companies that use Singapore as a regional gateway to provide carbon services in Asia.Beyond carbon services and offsets, we are also leveraging our position as a green finance hub to drive investments in low-carbon solutions in Asia.Investing in talentThe growing green economy is creating meaningful job opportunities for locals to contribute to a more sustainable future from Singapore. From providing low-carbon advisory services to developing clean energy solutions such as solar, Singaporeans, from fresh grads to mid-career hires, are expressing keen interest in participating in these new and emerging roles.For our green economy to thrive, we will need to upskill and empower more Singaporeans to take on related roles. In the past few years, initiatives have been put in place to ensure that we have the right talent for this growing industry.For example, Workforce Singapore's (WSG) Career Conversion Programme for Sustainability Professionals is helping to reskill Singaporeans for sustainability careers through courses and on-the-job training.We also welcome global talent with specialised skill sets in carbon under our upcoming employment pass framework. We want Singaporeans to gain a competitive advantage through working alongside international experts, which we are supporting through WSG's Capability Transfer Programme.The continued momentum for climate action is an economic opportunity for South-east Asia. Singapore can play a role by supporting businesses in accessing financing, key markets and talent to meet the needs of this growing green economy. We also have a major role to play in accelerating the commercialisation of new sustainability technologies in partnership with international companies of all sizes and stripes - including venture-backed startups. If solutions developed in Singapore can catalyse the green transition efforts of our partners, be they corporates or governments, globally - then there is a fighting chance that our vision for 2050 can become reality, to move the needle on global net-zero transition.The writer is executive vice-president at the Singapore Economic Development Board</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:691G-61R1-DYX4-02XH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Songbirds and dragonflies flitting about.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But the picture is in full colour and the setting is not a kampung, but prime residential land.</p><p> The bungalow sits on 30,000 sq ft of land in Bukit Timah. </p><p> The fish are growing in the swimming pool. In keeping with the times, a chef comes in twice a week to cook for private-dining guests, using vegetables, herbs and flowers from the farm.</p><p> For about a year, Abundant Cities, a natural science and research experimentation company and consultancy, has been farming on about 15,000 sq ft of the land. </p><p> It worked with Habitat Collective, which champions small-scale agriculture, to design the farm around sustainable and ecologically sound principles.</p><p> Ms Sarah Lewis, 38, chief executive of Abundant Cities, says the farm collects rainwater to irrigate the crops, the chickens turn food scraps into compost for the soil, a biofilter keeps the swimming pool clean using plants and beneficial microbes, and the farm attracts bees that pollinate the plants.</p><p> Groups of volunteers come in to work on the farm, some with kids in tow. At the end of the session, they sit down to a meal made with the produce they helped to nurture and grow.</p><p> \"A lot of people say this is like kampung life,\" she says. \"Without any prompting, many of them say this is a healing space.\" </p><p> Ms Lewis adds that the home owner, who lives in the house but declines to be named or interviewed, believes in this way of farming. She wants her young children to experience what it is like to grow, harvest and eat the food they help to produce.</p><p> Among the crops in the farm are Alabama Red Okra, heirloom brinjals, green beans, spinach, ginger, taro and tapioca; fruit such as papaya and coconut; and herbs and flowers such as ulam raja, sawtooth coriander, Mexican tarragon, sorrel, marigolds, hibiscus and roselle. </p><p> The farm puts out about 50kg of produce a month, which supplements the diet for about 15 families. Ms Lewis, a Briton and Singapore permanent resident, is aiming for the farm to produce 150kg a month eventually.</p><p> The chickens are put to good use -- and not for eating. They turn food scraps from food and fruit stalls, and spent grain from breweries, into compost for the soil. </p><p> Volunteers and private-dining guests get to enjoy the eggs the chickens produce.</p><p> The pool is filled with guppies and a freshwater fish known as Tinfoil Barb (right). The fish feed on mosquito larvae, keeping the mosquito population in check, and the larger fish feed on the guppies.</p><p> Weekly tests are done on the water, the mosquito population is tracked weekly and the soil is tested every quarter to make sure the ecological system is safe and sound.</p><p> Twice a week, chef Tse Shu Chun -- who has worked at Fat Lulu's, Moosehead Kitchen-Bar, Restaurant Labyrinth and Restaurant Zen -- cooks for groups of between eight and 12. </p><p> Meals are priced at $220 a person, with at least eight or nine courses. The 36-year-old goes by word of mouth and people can book dinners via his Instagram account, @lepetitefire.</p><p> He runs a tight, no-waste ship. \"Having worked in restaurants, I realise we waste a lot of food. When I started cooking in people's homes and doing private dining, I was able to cut down on that. The trimmings feed me and my family,\" he says.</p><p> \"Poultry suppliers say they throw away innards and parts like necks, or give them to pet food and composting companies. But they are perfectly delicious.\"</p><p> As a result, he might make duck neck sausages and serve grilled duck hearts. </p><p> And the rustic vibe of the farm informs the way he prepares the food -- most of it is cooked over charcoal.</p><p> Because chef Tse is cooking on a small scale, he can serve cuts, such as beef shortribs, which require long cooking -- something that a busy restaurant kitchen, with limited storage space, might not want to do. </p><p> He also has access to produce from the farm. The heirloom brinjals go on the grill, and are served with housemade tofu and ponzu sauce. Grilled Alabama Red Okra is paired with garlic chilli crisp.</p><p>Mexican tarragon from the farm goes into making a parfait, slices of which are stuffed into Japanese wafers called monaka, then studded with marigold and ulam raja petals he harvests. </p><p> This last course in the meal has a purpose too -- the carotenoids in tarragon are said to aid digestion. \"I am doing food that is more thoughtful,\" he says.</p><p> The farm is also open to small groups of visitors. Abundant Cities is working with Wow Kampung -- a group that designs learning experiences for pupils, students, teachers and corporate groups -- on sustainability-themed programmes for pre-schoolers.</p><p> Ms Lewis says: \"We manage the natural resources here using nature-based solutions. Then we have people come in and disrupt the natural system that we have set up in this urban context to see if it is resilient.\" </p><p> She calls the home farm a \"proof of concept\" project, and hopes to replicate it in other homes and possibly public parks. </p><p> Abundant Cities is also looking to support the residents of Housing Board flats to grow edible plants on their balconies and in corridors.</p><p> Ms Carrie Tan, an MP of Nee Soon GRC, visited the farm earlier in 2023 and found it educational. </p><p> She visited again soon after -- this time with representatives from the Nee Soon Town Council, Nee Soon South grassroots organisations, community gardeners and National Parks Board staff -- to learn more about the farming practices.</p><p> She says she will continue to refer groups of community volunteers from her constituency to attend learning sessions at the farm, find out more about the practices and facilitate similar projects in Nee Soon South.</p><p> \"I thought it was very good to have met people so passionate about ecologically sustainable farming,\" she says. </p><p> \"It's not just about the farming techniques, but also fostering a sense of community ownership to drive a project like that together.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-702T9L8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68J5-YD91-DYX4-02JJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1007\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Driven by factors like climate change and geopolitical developments that pose threats to food production on a global scale, the need for a sustainable global food system has intensified over the years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the United Nations Environment Programme,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/why-global-fight-tackle-food-waste-has-only-just-begun\">global food systems are exerting significant pressure on both human and planetary health</url> . They consume 70 per cent of the Earth's water, contribute up to one-third of total greenhouse gas emissions produced by humans, and, through agriculture, pose a threat to over 86 per cent of the 28,000 endangered species in the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In Singapore, the impact of climatic shifts and supply disruptions can be distinctly felt by the city-state, which imports more than 90 per cent of its food. To address this, the Singapore Food Agency has committed to  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sfa.gov.sg/food-for-thought/article/detail/a-sustainable-food-system-for-singapore-and-beyond\">gaining greater food resilience by setting a '30 by 30' goal, with the aim of producing 30 per cent of local nutritional needs by 2030</url> .</p><p>However, with less than one per cent of land designated for farming, Singapore must produce more with fewer resources. Faced with these challenges, the nation needs to reduce food waste while increasing food production in a sustainable way.</p><p>Where social consciousness meets food waste management</p><p>Driven by a strong sense of social consciousness, 33-year-old Singaporean entrepreneur Nathaniel Phua founded Ento Industries in 2020. Ento Industries is a  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122950/\">yellow biotechnology firm</url>  and a subsidiary of local food waste management firm Tiong Lam Supplies.</p><p>Phua's inspiration stemmed from witnessing the stark contrast between the significant food waste produced in Singapore and the persistent issue of global hunger, as highlighted by  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.un.org/en/chronicle/article/feeding-world-sustainably\">a United Nations report which projected that 300 million people worldwide may face food shortages by 2050</url> .</p><p>'I worry that my children may grow up in a world shaped by decisions made today. While I can't revamp the food industry, I believe that I can play a role in making a difference,' said Phua.</p><p>In Singapore, food producers generally find it difficult to manage food waste due to the high cost of implementing waste management solutions. As a result,  <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/3r-programmes-and-resources/food-waste-management\">the city-state produced an estimated 813,000 tonnes of food waste</url> , accounting for 12 per cent of the total waste produced, while  <url normalizedValue=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/07/1138612\">as many as 783 million people worldwide faced hunger in 2022</url> .</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/hydroleap-revolutionises-wastewater-treatment-leading-industries-into-a-sustainable-future-20230912/\">Hydroleap revolutionises wastewater treatment, leading industries into a sustainable future</url></p><p>However, picture a world where food waste is no longer a liability but a valuable asset for food production. To bring this vision to reality, Phua developed a method to valorise food waste using black soldier flies, an effective and affordable process which converts food waste and its byproducts into higher-value products that contribute to the food supply chain, such as feedstock for fish farms.</p><p>Additionally, although the number of local food farms in Singapore has increased with government funding, the supporting industries such as feed and fertiliser production companies have not kept pace. The shortage of these supporting industries could significantly hinder Singapore's pursuit of food security.</p><p>Fortunately, Ento Industries' food waste management solution can help to address this challenge by enabling local food producers to reduce their reliance on imported animal feed and compost, strengthening Singapore's food resilience.</p><p>Using insects to save the world</p><p>For context, black soldier flies are capable of consuming a large amount of waste without producing any harmful emissions. In their larval stage, they can eat almost any organic matter, up to four times their body weight per day.</p><p>The nutrient-rich excrement produced by black soldier fly larvae can be used as fertiliser in agriculture to improve soil quality and crop yields, while the larvae itself can be harvested as a high-value animal feed. This makes black soldier flies a valuable tool for reducing food waste, improving food security, and creating a more sustainable food system in Singapore.</p><p>Here are the steps involved in Ento Industries' food waste management process:</p><p>Food waste is collected from restaurants, supermarkets, and other businesses.</p><p>The wastes are first treated and formulated into an optimal feed for black soldier flies.</p><p>These wastes are then fed to multiple batches of black soldier flies.</p><p>The black soldier flies break down the food wastes into a nutrient-rich liquid fertiliser.</p><p>The larvae of these black soldier flies are harvested and processed into a high-protein feed ingredient for pets and farm animals.</p><p>An infographic depicting the process of food waste conversion into sources of high-quality protein and fertiliser using black soldier flies</p><p>Leading the way in food waste management, one step at a time</p><p>When Ento Industries first began, Phua had a clear understanding of the direction he wanted the company to take. As his team progressed, more ideas poured in, each sounding more attractive than the last.</p><p>As a result, they became somewhat hazy about their initial intentions and started working on multiple projects at the same time. The team soon realised that even though the company seemed to be picking up traction, it was losing capital. Phua felt that this experience helped him learn to remain laser-focused on his main goals and be more discerning when developing the business and bringing in new projects.</p><p>Phua also believes that humility is the key to success in entrepreneurship and sets aside time to engage with his team regularly.</p><p>'As business owners, we tend to think that we know what is best for the company - which may not always be the case. Keeping an open mind always helps me to look at my business from a different perspective and spot issues that I never knew were present.'</p><p>As a company that engages in both yellow biotechnology and waste management, it was difficult to recruit qualified manpower due to the stigma that existed in the industry. Hence, Phua worked with the various Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) to have their students join them as interns. This helped to break the stigma of working in the yellow biotechnology industry, as many interns extended their term with the company, and some even expressed their interest in becoming full-time staff.</p><p>To further mitigate the issue of manpower crunch, Phua adopted various project management and business automation tools such as human resource and finance software to streamline operations.</p><p>'It can be a tough and arduous journey, but I think for me, it was the support from my peers and family that helped to keep me going. I have also been privileged\u202fenough to have had mentors to guide me at each stage of my journey, of whom the most notable was my late father-in-law, who taught me the importance of building lasting relationships in business,' said Phua.</p><p>Phua also recommends that aspiring entrepreneurs and young leaders surround themselves with people who are in the same space or on a similar journey as them. It is important to seek out a mentor who is willing to guide them along their journey, and the insights gleaned from someone who has had a similar experience can prove to be invaluable, he explained.</p><p>Building trust and support</p><p>Ento Industries' impressive contributions to food waste management in Singapore have been recognised, and the company has received funding support from private investors in 2023, including undisclosed funds from ESG-focused private investors Tak Wai Chung and Te-Ling Nai.</p><p>Chung is a Co-Founder of Xcelerate Group, a regional platform investing in and operating businesses in the governance, risk, and compliance sector, including sustainability, while Nai is experienced in growing and managing business operations both in startup environments and multinational organisations.</p><p>The company has also obtained other notable grants to support its development of new products and services. These grants include:</p><p>EnterpriseSG Enterprise Development Grant in 2021: A government grant that provides funding for businesses to develop new products or services, expand their operations, or improve their productivity. Ento Industries received this grant in 2021 to help develop new products using black soldier flies.</p><p>DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant in 2020: A grant that is awarded to social enterprises working to address social or environmental challenges. Ento Industries received this grant in 2020 to help kickstart its pilot facility and increase capabilities.</p><p>Collectively, the funding support from both government and private investors enabled Ento Industries to expand its operations and develop new technologies to further its mission of reducing food waste and enhancing food resiliency in Singapore, aligning with the city-state's 30 by 30 goal.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/everything-you-should-know-about-the-future-of-futuristic-food-technology-20230221/\">Everything you should know about the future of futuristic food technology</url></p><p>The future of Ento Industries</p><p>\"I am excited about the potential of insect farming to help us solve some of the world's most pressing problems, such as food waste and climate change. I believe that black soldier flies are a sustainable and scalable solution to these problems. I am committed to working with others to make insect farming a reality,\" remarked Phua.</p><p>Since its inception in 2020, Ento Industries has grown to become one of Singapore's leading providers of food waste management solutions using black soldier flies. It has since upcycled more than 500 tonnes of food waste.</p><p>Phua believes that the food waste management industry is still in its early stages and that interest in sustainable businesses and nature-based solutions is growing. He is confident that competition will increase and more businesses will enter the field.</p><p>Building on its success, Ento Industries is expanding its operations to meet the growing demand for sustainable food waste management solutions. The company recently rolled out its food waste transformation initiatives to key partners in the food manufacturing and food and beverage sectors.</p><p>Phua envisions increasing its capacity to service and partner with a larger number of clients in Singapore in the future.

It has also planned strategies reflecting the system changes.

Here are some highlights:</p><p> Fidelity International: The firm focuses on the principle of \"double materiality\".

Ellie Tang, the firm's director for sustainable investing says: \"Double materiality looks at these risks and also at how a company is positively contributing to the environment and society.\" </p><p> \"This inside-out and outside-in view allows us to understand how a company's sustainability performance would look like in the longer term. Coupled with engagement and good communication with investee companies, we get a 360-degree view of companies and their abilities to translate strategy into implementation.''</p><p> Schroders: Mervyn Tang, head of sustainability strategy (Apac), says analysis of climate transition risk involves getting a handle on the challenges businesses face as they move towards a low-carbon regime. Carbon intensity provides insight, but only partially. \"Some companies may have more pricing power, allowing them to pass higher carbon costs to their customers.''</p><p> He notes the growing sophistication of sustainable investment themes, such as circular economy, biodiversity and active ownership. \"Central to this evolution is measurement. We're enhancing our methods to quantify the engagement progress and impact. The more we measure, the more transparency we can provide, which mitigates the risk of greenwashing.''</p><p> Wellington Management: Wendy Cromwell, the firm's head of sustainable investment, says some market inefficiencies support the case for sustainable investing as a source of alpha. These include an excessive focus on short term growth and inconsistent and backward-looking third-party ratings. \"Most climate analysis focus on mitigation, rather than adaptation. By focusing on the latter, managers can identify winners that will stand a better chance of thriving in a new climate paradigm.''</p><p> BNP Paribas Asset Management: Crystal Geng, Asia ESG research lead, says the firm's methodology is \"markedly differentiated, with a more focused number of ESG metrics and a clear preference for 'performance' over 'policy' indicators\". For industries and retail, for instance, the firm looks into indicators for worker mortality rate, accident rate and turnover, instead of just relying on a company's health and safety policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-IL34QP2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68NK-G8R1-DYX4-02F1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1279\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Coupled with engagement and good communication with investee companies, we get a 360-degree view of companies and their abilities to translate strategy into implementation.''Schroders: Mervyn Tang, head of sustainability strategy (Apac), says analysis of climate transition risk involves getting a handle on the challenges businesses face as they move towards a low-carbon regime. Carbon intensity provides insight, but only partially. \"Some companies may have more pricing power, allowing them to pass higher carbon costs to their customers.''He notes the growing sophistication of sustainable investment themes, such as circular economy, biodiversity and active ownership. \"Central to this evolution is measurement. We're enhancing our methods to quantify the engagement progress and impact. The more we measure, the more transparency we can provide, which mitigates the risk of greenwashing.''Wellington Management: Wendy Cromwell, the firm's head of sustainable investment, says some market inefficiencies support the case for sustainable investing as a source of alpha. These include an excessive focus on short term growth and inconsistent and backward-looking third-party ratings. \"Most climate analysis focus on mitigation, rather than adaptation. By focusing on the latter, managers can identify winners that will stand a better chance of thriving in a new climate paradigm.''BNP Paribas Asset Management: Crystal Geng, Asia ESG research lead, says the firm's methodology is \"markedly differentiated, with a more focused number of ESG metrics and a clear preference for 'performance' over 'policy' indicators\". For industries and retail, for instance, the firm looks into indicators for worker mortality rate, accident rate and turnover, instead of just relying on a company's health and safety policy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Nature is itself a carbon sink, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

A report just out has also posited that Asia could be at the forefront of such efforts, with the financial services industry playing a critical role.</p><p> Being \"nature-positive\"The Group of Seven (G7) world leaders have signed a 2030 Nature Compact to commit to a global mission of halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030. This means going beyond the damage-limitation approach already in place, and working with political leaders and stakeholders to ensure that economic activities enrich biodiversity, store carbon, purify water and reduce pandemic risk.</p><p> It has set a \"nature-positive\" global goal by 2030, and this will involve - among other things - dramatically increasing investment in nature from all sources, and to ensure nature is accounted for, and mainstreamed, in economic and financial decision-making.\u00a0</p><p> A \"nature-positive\" condition occurs when there is a natural capital surplus, or ecological reserve: when the ecological demand or footprint - the quantity of natural resources required to sustain an individual, goods or services, population or economic activity - does not outstrip nature's ability\u00a0to replenish these resources.</p><p> Conversely, a \"nature-negative\" or ecological-deficit condition is when the ecological footprint exceeds natural capital supply.</p><p> Investing in nature now is the key, says \"Banking on Natural Capital\" - a report recently published by global professional services firm, Deloitte, and wildlife advocacy and protection group, WWF-Australia. It looks at how the growing ecological deficit can be addressed by mobilising investment into the conservation, sustainable management and restoration of natural capital assets.</p><p> And, presenting natural assets as capital, it says, makes it clearer to see how the environment is made up of finite stocks, which may be invested in to generate value or degraded to deplete value.</p><p> Asia can leadThere is strong rationale and opportunity for the global market response to valuing natural capital to be led out of the Asia-Pacific, the report says, with the region being well positioned to act in supply, demand and enablement roles.</p><p> \"The Asia-Pacific region houses several global financial hubs with the financial muscle to fuel a sustainable market shift in the region,\" Guy Williams, Deloitte Asia Pacific &amp; Global Nature lead, told The Business Times. </p><p> \"As the Asia-Pacific has the most to lose and most likely the most to gain in any global market response to valuing natural capital, the scale of opportunity to shift additional finance (funds that contribute additionally to a nature-positive outcome than what would have happened if they were not invested) from nature-negative to nature-positive is greater than almost anywhere else.\"</p><p> \u00b7 SupplyThe scale of intact and at-risk biodiversity across Asia provides the natural-capital bank that will fund and fuel any marketplace for nature, Williams points out.\u00a0</p><p> The region has some of the most significant biological diversity on earth, eg. the rainforests of Southeast Asia and the reefs of the Coral Triangle, but also faces the highest rates of biodiversity loss - 60 per cent of global biodiversity loss comes from 7 countries, 6 of which are in the Asia Pacific.</p><p> \u00b7 DemandThe diversity of activities and the impact of Asian-owned and operated business give them the opportunity to set targets for improving natural capital and investing in this marketplace.</p><p> \"The decline in Asia-Pacific ecosystems has been largely due to the flows of finance. In the region, lending has put the largest quantities of nature at risk, partly due to relatively weak regulation in the region. In a review of lending policies, banks in the region performed the worst when it came to restricting the negative impact on biodiversity,\" Williams says.</p><p> \u00b7 EnablementStakeholders such as governments, financial institutions and support services in the region can be enablers for change - and will have much to gain from having such a marketplace housed and headquartered here.</p><p> \"As an important global financial hub, financial institutions in Asia Pacific must proactively manage flows of capital towards nature-positive outcomes. As nature has underpinned economic growth in the region for decades, ensuring that nature is responsibly managed and restored also presents some attractive opportunities,\" Williams said.</p><p> For example, Deloitte and WWF-Australia's report cited a study co-authored by Temasek, which found that investing in just 59 nature-positive business opportunities in the region could generate US$4.3 trillion and 232 million jobs annually by 2030 -- equivalent to 14 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the region. </p><p> \"We firmly believe this should not just be about divesting away from financing activities that enable a harmful impact on nature, but also about investing deeper into activities that have a positive impact,\" said Williams. </p><p> This could include nature-themed funds that invest in natural capital projects such as nature-based solutions and agro-forestry, or solutions that reduce negative impact on nature, such as circular production models and alternative proteins, he added. One recent example is Silverstrand Capital's Biodiversity Accelerator+, supported by Temasek, which aims to support startups offering either nature technology or nature-based solutions. </p><p> \"There's a whole lot of untapped opportunity in identifying and supporting the nature-positive businesses of the future,\" Williams says.</p><p> Shifting the inertiaDespite the region's potential, however, most natural capital initiatives and platforms, to date, have been designed and led out of Europe, Deloitte's report noted. </p><p> \"Relative inaction in the region to date is not primarily caused by a lack of resources, but rather inertia,\" Williams says.</p><p> Environmental action led out of Asia to date has been driven by government regulations, he notes, with many Asian-based organisations waiting for further clarity from the local and national government on nature-related disclosures and sustainable finance.</p><p> \"Asia has an opportunity to shift the inertia response, and to create a regional marketplace for natural capital that is open to Europe and other regional markets but aligns with emerging government-led green growth and net-zero commitments and policy.\"</p><p> There is a host of mechanisms and opportunities available to the private sector to increase investments in nature and enable this shift, as governments play the key role of catalysing and scaling such private-sector investment, both through fiscal and regulatory means.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>There is strong rationale and opportunity for the global market response to valuing natural capital to be led out of the Asia-Pacific, with the region well-positioned to act in supply, demand and enablement roles, says Guy Williams, Deloitte Asia Pacific &amp; Global Nature lead.

and</p><p>* upgrading the power grids to manage different energy sources and to minimise the intermittency of renewables.</p><p>To make this progressive shift to a low-carbon future, Asia will need a lot more transition financing than is available today.</p><p>To spur more green finance for transition, we need to have two things in place: a price on carbon, and a market for trading carbon credits.</p><p>Carbon Prices and Carbon Markets</p><p>Climate change is the result of probably the biggest market failure in history.</p><p>* For the longest time, the world did not put a price on the carbon emissions that have steadily degraded our environment and now pose serious climate risks.</p><p>A meaningful price on carbon is critical to create the right incentives to reduce emissions.</p><p>* The challenge is to arrive at the right price, one that does not unduly impede economic development and yet is sufficient to drive decarbonisation efforts that will enable the world to meet its climate targets.</p><p>Carbon pricing is gaining momentum.</p><p>* Globally, there are 61 carbon pricing initiatives in place, half of them carbon taxes and the other half emissions trading systems.</p><p>Singapore introduced in 2019 a carbon tax of $5 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions, to establish the principle of a price on emissions.</p><p>* The original intention was to gradually raise the tax from 2023 onwards to between $10 and $15 per tonne of emissions by 2030.</p><p>* The government is now reviewing both the post-2023 trajectory and the level of the carbon tax to ensure that they provide sufficient impetus for emissions reduction and restructuring towards a greener economy.</p><p>Asia's priority, as is Singapore's, must be to reduce carbon emissions through abatement efforts.</p><p>But not all firms can turn off the emissions tap fast enough.</p><p>* It may be challenging for some sectors, such as steel and utilities, to significantly reduce emissions in the short to medium term.</p><p>This is where a robust carbon market comes in.</p><p>* Carbon credits are essentially tradable certificates that represent the reduction, avoidance, or removal of a certain amount of emissions from the atmosphere.</p><p>* Firms can buy these credits to offset hard-to-abate emissions.</p><p>* To efficiently match the demand for carbon credits with the supply of these credits, we need a robust carbon market.</p><p>* In so doing, a carbon market becomes an important mechanism to channel funds to the emission reduction and removal projects that generate the carbon credits.</p><p>Adopting a twin strategy of reducing and offsetting carbon emissions is a practical and effective way to reach our climate goals in time.</p><p>Given Asia's transition needs, a well-functioning carbon trading ecosystem is particularly relevant to the region's decarbonisation effort.</p><p>There are two types of carbon markets:</p><p>* The compliance carbon markets support the trading of emission allowances by entities subject to mandatory targets set by national, regional or international emissions reduction regimes.</p><p>* The voluntary carbon markets, on the other hand, are not tied to emissions trading systems or regulatory requirements. Any company or individual can purchase carbon credits to offset their own carbon footprint voluntarily.</p><p>In our journey towards a greener world, voluntary carbon markets are expected to play a more impactful role.</p><p>* First, the voluntary market can cater to a wider group of firms and individuals.</p><p>- Emissions trading systems tend to cover sectors with higher emissions and so not all firms participate in the compliance carbon market.</p><p>* Second, firms which are already covered in emissions trading systems can tap on the voluntary carbon market to decarbonise further, going beyond their mandatory targets.</p><p>There is great opportunity to scale the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>* Globally, the demand for voluntary carbon credits is expected to grow 15-fold over the next 10 years, to 2 billion tonnes in 2030.</p><p>* More governments and companies are committing to net-zero targets.</p><p>- Last year, 1,500 companies across the world made net-zero commitments, a three-fold increase from the year before.</p><p>- This number will continue to grow rapidly.</p><p>There is also greater international impetus for growing the voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>* The Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets, sponsored by the Institute for International Finance, has set out 20 recommendations for building trusted and well-functioning markets for voluntary carbon credits.</p><p>Climate Impact X</p><p>This is why today's announcement of Climate Impact X, or CIX, is significant.</p><p>CIX is a visionary idea for a global carbon exchange and marketplace anchored out of Asia, centred on trust and innovation.</p><p>* It is an initiative borne out of the Alliance for Action on Sustainability under the Emerging Stronger Taskforce</p><p>* The Sustainability Alliance proposed to develop an Asian voluntary carbon credit market, and I am happy to see more partners coming together to take forward this meaningful work.</p><p>CIX is a promising solution to the problem we face today of fragmented carbon credit markets characterised by thin liquidity and credits of questionable quality.</p><p>CIX can be a test bed for the recommendations of the Taskforce for Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets.</p><p>* Example: the recommendation to create mechanisms for signalling demand.</p><p>- CIX is forming a coalition of buyers and sellers committed to high quality credits.</p><p>- This will provide suppliers the confidence to scale up supply and catalyse the development of the carbon market.</p><p>* If CIX can demonstrate the effectiveness of the recommendations of the Taskforce, it will build strong momentum for effective carbon credits markets globally.</p><p>Let me highlight two significant features of CIX:</p><p>* first, the focus on carbon credits generated through nature-based solutions; and</p><p>* second, the use of technology to ensure a transparent and verifiable carbon market.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are measures taken to protect, sustainably manage, and restore ecosystems.</p><p>* Examples include reforestation, and restoring peatlands and mangroves.</p><p>* It is estimated that nature-based solutions can provide more than 30% of the climate mitigation needed globally by 2030.</p><p>* Yet, such solutions currently only account for 2% of climate funding.</p><p>Nature-based solutions are an attractive proposition.</p><p>* They not only green the world, but provide social and economic benefits that make it a better place to live in.</p><p>* Take for example the restoration of mangroves.</p><p>- Mangroves not only save carbon emissions but also serve as a natural barrier against floods and support biodiversity.</p><p>Trust is a critical ingredient for any successful marketplace. The use of innovative technology solutions to ensure the integrity of the carbon credits traded will be a key focus of CIX.</p><p>* CIX will draw on technologies such as satellite monitoring, artificial intelligence, and blockchain to distill key data on emission reduction and removal projects to verify the quality of the credits that they generate.</p><p>Singapore as a Carbon Services and Trading Hub</p><p>Singapore is a good place for CIX to realise its vision to be a global carbon exchange and marketplace.</p><p>* We have a sound infrastructure, good governance, and a premium on trust - critical ingredients for a marketplace.</p><p>Singapore is located at the heart of Southeast Asia which is fertile ground to harness the potential of nature-based solutions.</p><p>* Southeast Asia holds more than one-third of the world's mangroves.</p><p>* It has about 120 million hectares of land suitable for re-forestation.</p><p>* If we are able to harness the potential of nature-based solutions in Southeast Asia, we can move the needle on carbon sequestration efforts.</p><p>* Proximity to Southeast Asia will enable CIX and its ecosystem partners to work closely with project developers to procure a supply of high quality carbon credits.</p><p>Singapore is well-positioned to be a carbon services and trading hub.</p><p>* We are strengthening the carbon credit value-chain.</p><p>- This includes growing capabilities to develop projects, conduct certification and validation of project design, and monitor and verify project outcomes.</p><p>* We are also a trusted international centre for financial services, professional services, and commodities trading.</p><p>As a country, Singapore is committed to sustainable development and our aspirations are reflected in the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p><p>* Singapore is attracting companies to anchor their R&amp;D activities here to develop new sustainability solutions, including technologies such as carbon capture, utilisation and storage.</p><p>MAS' Green Finance Action Plan has a focus on building strong capabilities in green finance.</p><p>* This includes initiatives to anchor in Singapore providers of sustainability rating and verification services, centres of excellence to undertake Asia-centric green finance research, and funding support for Green FinTech projects.</p><p>I believe Singapore has what it takes to anchor a thriving carbon marketplace at the heart of a vibrant carbon services hub, supporting Asia's transition towards greater sustainability.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Let me thank all our industry partners for making CIX possible.</p><p>Together, let us work towards a low carbon future.</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0056149729</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62R6-S7G1-DXMP-K1BY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1685\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 20, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

In recent weeks, air quality in parts of Malaysia and Indonesia has been poor and over the weekend, Singapore's readings hit the unhealthy range for the first time since 2019. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The haze has recurred frequently since the severe fires of 1997, but a recent interregnum of blue skies lulled many into thinking the problem was resolved. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In June 2023, the annual Haze Outlook issued by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA) sounded a \"red\" alarm about the risk of severe haze returning. At that time, the weather was still wetter than normal. But a major factor shaping the assessment was indeed the variable weather. The intersection of El Nino and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, where sea temperature changes affect air pressures over the Pacific and Indian Oceans, is deepening and extending the dry season.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SIIA sounded that alarm to call attention and nudge governments and companies to make preparations. In recent weeks, SIIA has also engaged officials, corporations and experts in countries key to the issue -- Indonesia and Malaysia. </p><p> The unhelpful blame gameWho is to blame? Some are already pointing fingers. Malaysia's Minister of Natural Resources, Environment and Climate Change Nik Nazmi blamed the haze hitting his country on fires from beyond his borders. The Indonesian authorities have rebutted this and suggested that problems stem from companies controlled by Malaysians. Among companies with plantation holdings, most are silent or point the finger to smallholders clearing land through fires that then run out of control. </p><p> The Indonesian authorities are now taking action -- not only in firefighting and disaster management, but also in investigating suspects and employing an array of legal sanctions. Last week, Indonesian officials announced they are preparing legal action, including bringing possible criminal charges against 11 companies in Sumatra that had fires on their land. </p><p> These companies hold sizeable properties in areas that can impact Singapore and Malaysia with haze, given wind patterns. Within Sumatra, the provinces of Jambi and South Sumatra have seen the most fires in 2023. More companies are being investigated in Kalimantan and other fire-prone areas. In total, over 200 companies have been warned.</p><p> Even before this, the Jokowi administration has given attention to the issue and taken unprecedented efforts. These include a permanent moratorium on granting new permits for businesses to clear primary forest and peatland and creating Manggala Agni, a nationwide fire brigade that also trains local police and fire rangers.</p><p>Indonesia's Ministry of Environment and Forestry has been enlarged and empowered. Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar, who is in charge of the ministry, has served both terms of the Jokowi administration and is acknowledged to be effective and willing to take on companies and others to achieve her goals.</p><p> On the basis of these and other reforms, President Joko Widodo, also known as Jokowi, declared the end of fires and haze to be one of the legacies of his time in office.  </p><p> It is clear the Jokowi government has done more than any earlier Indonesian government. But it is just as clear that these efforts are insufficient to fully resolve the problem. </p><p> We should acknowledge the dominant factor that has changed in 2023: the weather. Yet, this acknowledgement cannot be a blanket excuse for inaction. </p><p> Tackle haze nowIt is wrong to see the haze as a short-lived nuisance. </p><p> In previous haze years, fires peaked in September, clearing up by October with monsoon rains. But meteorologists are warning that with El Nino and the Indian Ocean Dipole, dry conditions will likely persist into late October or even November and fire risks will continue. </p><p> Moreover, these weather phenomena often extend across multiple years. Climate change may also reduce the interval between these events. </p><p> The challenge of fighting fires is real and must be an ongoing concern, with an eye on underlying factors in the resource and agribusiness sectors and another on how the haze worsens the impact of Indonesia's carbon emissions that contribute to climate change.</p><p> The political climate in Indonesia is also changing. Most immediately, with the upcoming general election to form the next Indonesian government, some local officials tend to relent on strict enforcement in order to court votes. There are already reports of some provinces  giving more attention to the issue than others. </p><p> For the longer term too, as a leadership change looms, it is unclear if the next president will do as much or more than the current administration. The economic and resource politics of Indonesia may evolve again -- for example, if the next government allows plantation operators to expand and clear more land. There are gaps to be addressed going forward to both mitigate the outbreaks of fires and to provide incentives for sustainability. </p><p> Although Mr Widodo's term is ending, political attention and will must be asserted to confront the current issues, if indeed this is to be an enduring legacy of his presidency that will endure. </p><p> Private sector action Consider firefighting, a key response capability. Mr Widodo has once again mobilised the police and military to assist in firefighting, an important signal that he is taking matters seriously. But in many parts of Indonesia, the majority of firefighting capacity is in the hands of the private sector, not local governments.  </p><p> Companies know they can be blamed for fires on their land, even ones they did not start, and most respond to fires within a 5km radius of their concessions as a condition of holding a business licence. Some are prepared to go further and help local communities be fire-free, with the support of local authorities. </p><p> Conservation and ecosystem restoration must be ramped up. This is especially needed for peatlands, which are wet in their natural state but can release the heaviest sooty haze and the most carbon when they are drained and burnt. </p><p> Created by Mr Widodo in 2016, the Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency has rewetted some 1.5 million ha of peat in public land -- an area more than 20 times the size of Singapore. Additionally, companies have undertaken rewetting initiatives on nearly 3.7 million ha of peatland under an initiative supervised by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Such efforts are reported to reduce fire outbreak within rewetted boundaries. </p><p> But while significant ground has been covered, Indonesia is home to over 20 million ha of peatland and some estimates suggest that around half that area is in need of rehabilitation. There are also non-peat forest areas prone to fire that could benefit from conservation. Such a vast scale suggests government action cannot succeed on its own. </p><p> Local communities should be involved. Government agencies and several companies are currently helping villages by providing assistance and incentives to keep themselves fire-free. The lack of alternatives and income insecurity are what often drives farmers to use fire. These efforts should be further encouraged and supported to ensure that livelihoods are secured in tandem with sustainability efforts.</p><p> Some companies are going further, pledging to conserve carbon- and biodiversity-rich areas within their concession boundaries. This is commendable but needs support. The business licensing system in Indonesia should be flexible enough to allow companies to commercialise such projects and allow them to generate and sell carbon credits. This would provide stronger financial incentives to safeguard such areas against fires and degradation. </p><p> But even as incentives are needed, so too are the right forms of pressure to instil responsibility.</p><p> Investigations and prosecutions are the clearest forms of deterrence. After all, while dry conditions make matters worse, the vast majority of fires are human-started. Indonesian officials need to keep a keen and fair eye on the ground, cooperating with helpful companies and singling out the recalcitrant.</p><p> Over the past three years, Indonesia has also conducted audits of plantation sectors, searching for corruption and abuses. Further action is expected in the remaining months of the present government's term to follow up on its governance push.</p><p> Can others help? The Indonesian authorities may seem sensitive to criticism and zealous over sovereignty issues, but there is a case for more transparency, dialogue, and cooperation. In policing corporations, investigations may uncover investment, trade, and finance links to Malaysia and Singapore. If there is a request from Indonesia backed up by credible evidence, governments should cooperate for cross-border enforcement. </p><p> There are also wider links to climate change. In an ordinary year, forestry and other land use accounts for 30 per cent to 40 per cent of Indonesia's annual emissions. In a severe haze year, the emissions from fires and the forestry sector can exceed the emissions from all other sectors combined. Stemming fires and preventing their recurrence could provide the basis for win-win cooperation on ecosystem conservation, including international investment in nature-based solutions and carbon credits. </p><p> In September, Indonesia launched its first carbon emissions trading market. While now focused on the power sector, Indonesia hopes to introduce a carbon tax in the future and encourage the wider buying and selling of carbon credits, including ones from forest conservation projects. Indonesia therefore has an incentive to keep carbon sequestered in its forests and be trusted to do so, rather than allowing trees and peat to burn. </p><p> At the regional level, Asean can play a supporting role. The grouping recently reached a final agreement to establish a permanent Asean Coordinating Centre for Transboundary Haze Pollution Control in Indonesia. It should facilitate better information sharing on haze situations, working with the existing Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre. The grouping is also rolling out a new haze-free road map for 2023 to 2030, along with an investment framework to support haze prevention projects. </p><p> There is also much to be done by the private sector outside of Indonesia. Increasingly, supply chains are subject to intense scrutiny, especially by developed markets and investors. Traders and financial institutions must map this sector more carefully to understand where the risks are and where efforts can be applied to improve practices. </p><p> The 2023 haze we have seen is not as severe as past instances. But unless actions are stepped up and then continued by the next government, the coming years could stain the efforts of the last decade and Mr Widodo's legacy, leaving a darker grey in the skies. </p><p> Associate Professor Simon Tay is chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, where  Ms Khor Yu-Leng and Mr Aaron Choo are respectively associate director and senior assistant director (special projects and sustainability). </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A firefighter trying to put out a blaze in South Sumatra in September.

The potential for nature-based solutions in South-east Asia is tremendous, as our region is home to the largest blue carbon stock in the world,\" he added. </p><p> Beyond institutions and faculties, students have also been encouraged to explore the region through study trips or internships, said Mr Heng. </p><p> \"Prior to Covid-19, we set out to enable 70 per cent of all students to have an overseas experience, of which 70 per cent will be in South-east Asia, China or India. With the pandemic receding, our institutes of higher learning will continue to work towards this goal.\" </p><p> Students, professionals or researchers from around the region are also welcome to explore opportunities in Singapore, he added, noting that NUS has close to 2,000 students from South-east Asia. </p><p> Held at University Town on the NUS campus, the event features discussions on current topics of interest such as emerging priorities among universities. </p><p> The series is organised across different regions in the world -- including Britain, Japan and the United States -- with the session in Singapore being the first for this region.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-MK13C8Q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:671T-YDF1-JCF2-80BT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It is a pleasure to join you today at the EuroCham Sustainability Awards 2023 to celebrate companies and organisations in Singapore for their outstanding sustainability efforts.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Story</p><p>For more than 20 years, EuroCham has helped to promote closer and stronger business, trade and investment linkages between the EU and Singapore as well as between the EU and ASEAN.</p><p>This underscores the EU's like-mindedness with Singapore on the importance of an open, inter-connected and integrated global economic system.</p><p>Indeed, European companies and individuals have played a constructive role in Singapore's development story.</p><p>Mr Rubbert earlier mentioned Mr Albert Winsemius. Mr Winsemius was one such individual from Europe who played an important role in the early stages of our economic development.</p><p>In our early years of independence, European companies like Siemens and Safran made significant investments into Singapore, creating many meaningful jobs, imparting skills and knowledge, and uplifting the lives and livelihoods of our people.</p><p>In fact, we used to have three training centres in Singapore - the German-Singapore Training Institute, the French-Singapore Training Institute and the Japan-Singapore Training Institute.</p><p>These three institutes later merged to form the Nanyang Polytechnic.</p><p>Today, the EU and Singapore have established a wide-ranging partnership spanning culture, science, education and research, defence, and healthcare, among others.</p><p>Singapore is the EU's largest trade and investment partner in ASEAN. Ambassador Piorko earlier mentioned the EU's extensive links with other countries in ASEAN. Many EU businesses based in Singapore also tap on us as a base to access the ASEAN market.</p><p>The EU is Singapore's 5th largest goods trading partner and more than 12,000 European companies have established a presence here.</p><p>Many of these companies are pursuing cutting-edge advances in areas like aviation and electronics, including in collaboration with our universities and research institutes, that will help both Singapore and the EU build more resilient, vibrant, and future-ready economies.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA), which entered into force in 2019, is the first such Free Trade Agreement between the EU and an ASEAN country.</p><p>Building on our strong economic links, the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement is helping to unlock opportunities for collaboration in new and emerging areas, positioning both the EU and Singapore well to tackle common challenges together.</p><p>The Green Chapter</p><p>Foremost among these shared challenges is climate change.</p><p>A changing climate knows no boundaries. Its impacts are felt globally, transcending geographical boundaries.</p><p>Europe saw one of its warmest summers in 2023, with record temperatures of 48.8 degrees Celsius in some areas.</p><p>Singapore, too, experienced its highest recorded temperature of 37 degrees Celsius in May this year.</p><p>Global warming intensifies extreme weather events and could trigger broader social and economic disruptions.</p><p>It also affects our biodiversity system in a very significant way and affects our food resilience. So climate action should be more than just a priority - rather, it is essential for our survival.</p><p>As signatories to the UN Paris Agreement, both Singapore and the EU are strongly committed to tackling climate change.</p><p>The EU was one of the co-leads for the Global Methane Pledge, which was launched to catalyse action to reduce methane emissions. Singapore is among the more than 110 countries to have signed the Pledge.</p><p>Singapore also co-facilitated ministerial consultations on Article 6 of the Paris Agreement at COP-26, which saw the finalisation of the rule book on carbon credits and carbon markets.</p><p>This reflects our commitment to enabling high integrity carbon markets that would help unlock more mitigation action and contribute to accelerating progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>Within the EU, as Ambassador Piorko mentioned earlier, the European Green Deal details your ambitious plans to make the European continent, the first continent, carbon-neutral by 2050.</p><p>On our part, Singapore has also committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050, and for the public sector by 2045.</p><p>Our Singapore Green Plan 2030 charts ambitious and concrete targets to advance our national agenda on sustainable development. We are making significant progress in accelerating the green transition throughout our society and economy.</p><p>In 2019, Singapore became the first country in Southeast Asia to implement a carbon tax.</p><p>We are raising this progressively in stages until 2030, to strengthen the price signal and impetus for businesses and individuals to reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>We are undertaking major research on urban solutions and sustainability - how do we make a city that is densely populated smart, green and sustainable? And this covers a whole range of work on the energy transition, on the use of renewables, recycling, and reducing waste.</p><p>Our carbon pricing trajectory will enhance the business case to invest in low-carbon solutions, helping businesses remain competitive in a low-carbon future.</p><p>The revenue collected from the carbon tax will be used to support decarbonisation efforts and the transition to a low-carbon economy, as well as cushion the impact on businesses and consumers.</p><p>We have also boosted the adoption of electric vehicles and accelerated the transition of the use of cleaner and lower-carbon fuels for our maritime and aviation sectors.</p><p>In addition, we have granted conditional approvals to import around 4 gigawatts of low-carbon electricity by 2035 to decarbonise our power sector.</p><p>And we are also working with our regional neighbours to develop an ASEAN Power Grid to facilitate regional decarbonisation and improve energy security.</p><p>The EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement gives Singapore and the EU a solid framework to advance our joint sustainability and development agenda.</p><p>It is a high standard and comprehensive agreement, which would eliminate tariffs on all products traded between us by end-2024. This includes tariffs on important green goods and services.</p><p>Under the agreement, both sides have also committed to resolve non-tariff barriers, including for renewable energy generation.</p><p>In addition, many innovative green technologies are valuable forms of intellectual property and soft assets that would be well protected under the EU- Singapore Free Trade Agreement.</p><p>Alongside cooperation with the EU, Singapore has also embarked on several joint green initiatives with our European partners.</p><p>In 2022, Singapore launched a Digital and Green Partnership with France and a Framework for Sustainability and Innovation with Germany. These initiatives provide a structured platform for cooperation on digital and green priorities including sustainable heritage conservation and green technologies.</p><p>As Ambassador Piorko earlier mentioned, the green and digital transformations are deeply interlinked. To enable zero or near-zero greenhouse gas emission shipping, Singapore's Maritime and Port Authority has worked with the Port of Rotterdam and 22 value-chain stakeholders to operationalise the Singapore- Rotterdam Green and Digital Shipping Corridor.</p><p>10. I am confident that our robust and wide-ranging green economy collaboration, including between our regions, will continue to grow from strength to strength.</p><p>The Role of Businesses</p><p>Let me now touch on the role of businesses. Singapore and European businesses can seize new growth opportunities together, while contributing to the two regions' sustainability goals.</p><p>Southeast Asia is home to some of the world's fastest growing cities, with a large youth population and a rapidly growing middle class.</p><p>There is potential to pursue emissions reduction while generating new growth opportunities as we shift to a greener economy.</p><p>To unlock this potential, all stakeholders including government and businesses need to make a concerted effort.</p><p>The private sector too plays a pivotal role in achieving the region's sustainability goals, including through uplifting Environmental and Social Governance (ESG) standards in the way you trade, invest and do business.</p><p>Let me highlight three promising areas where the private sector, including European businesses, can help catalyse decarbonisation at scale for the region.</p><p>First, carbon markets.</p><p>Singapore is leveraging our strengths as an international financial centre and business hub to establish ourselves as a vibrant carbon services and trading hub.</p><p>We welcome companies across the carbon market value chain to set up in Singapore, and use Singapore as a base to expand into the region which has huge potential for mitigation activities particularly in nature-based solutions.</p><p>Today, Singapore is home to more than 100 companies that tap on Singapore as a regional gateway to provide carbon services in Asia.</p><p>This includes key players such as Climate Action Data Trust, a global platform aimed at enhancing the transparency of carbon markets by integrating data from project registries.</p><p>Second, low carbon solutions.</p><p>We are investing in low-carbon technologies such as low-carbon hydrogen and carbon capture utilisation and storage, which can enable our transition to a net zero future.</p><p>The energy transition, in particular, is a prime area for new scientific and technological breakthroughs. R&amp;D, including into low-carbon solutions and new digital solutions, can help us lower our carbon footprint and raise energy efficiencies.</p><p>Given the scale of the task before us, global collaborations across borders and regions will be essential to accelerate our progress in building a greener world.</p><p>Third, green and transition finance.</p><p>As an international financial centre, Singapore plays an important role in supporting Asia's transition to a green and net-zero future.</p><p>In April this year, the Monetary Authority of Singapore launched a Finance for Net Zero (FiNZ) Action Plan laying out strategies to mobilise financing to catalyse Asia's net zero transition and decarbonisation activities in Singapore and the region.</p><p>We are working with various stakeholders to develop and scale Asia-tailored transition finance solutions and markets to capture transition opportunities, including scaling blended finance for transition projects with public, private and philanthropic partnerships.</p><p>As part of this, MAS is working with partners to develop regional taxonomies that can provide clarity to the market on what activities can be considered green or transition, thereby helping to unlock and scale up green and transition finance.</p><p>We are keen to work with European partners in developing sustainability-related capabilities in Singapore and growing the range of sustainable finance solutions to serve clients in Asia.</p><p>As a regional business hub, Singapore can be a base for European businesses to connect with partners across Southeast Asia and the larger Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>We can also serve as a living laboratory for innovative European businesses to test-bed novel solutions that can be scaled up regionally for wider impact.</p><p>In June 2023, Schneider Electric opened a Sustainability Competency Centre (SCC) for Asia in Singapore, in partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board.</p><p>The SCC would anchor Singapore as a global hub for sustainability leadership development and to develop and deliver sustainability services and solutions for the region.</p><p>Singapore is also pioneering the development of new rules and standards through Green Economy Agreements.</p><p>This can allow companies based in Singapore to connect with green economy markets overseas.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The EuroCham Sustainability Awards 2023 is a testament to the strong and growing partnership between Europe and Singapore. It also reflects the invaluable commitment from the private sector towards achieving sustainability goals.</p><p>In recognising companies and organisations for their accomplishments in social sustainability, sustainable investments and supply chains, and business innovations, EuroCham is helping to steer the interest of industry and partners onto a path towards greater sustainability.</p><p>Let me also commend the award finalists this evening for being good role models of how enterprises and organisations can support efforts toward a greener, more sustainable future. I am sure your work will be an inspiration for others , across sectors and domains, and also an inspiration to many young people to follow in your footsteps.</p><p>Let us continue working together to identify new opportunities to create inclusive and sustainable growth for our businesses and peoples. Congratulations to all our finalists I wish everyone a wonderful evening ahead.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Professional Services, Awards and Recognitions, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063082098</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69J8-0PF1-JB5M-W2B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2365\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 2, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002R2W</classCode><className>SIEMENS AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS334210 TELEPHONE APPARATUS MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

This refers to the natural processes through which trees and soils take in carbon dioxide.</p><p> For example, when plants photosynthesise, they use sunlight to convert carbon dioxide into organic matter, which is then locked in tree biomass such as trunks and roots.</p><p> This process draws down the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, contributing to climate mitigation and enhancing climate resilience. Carbon dioxide, produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels for energy, is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change.</p><p> Prof Koh cited a 2017 paper published in the scientific journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, which had found that natural climate solutions can provide 37 per cent of cost-effective carbon dioxide mitigation needed through 2030 for a greater chance of holding global warming to below 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p> Yet, while nature-based solutions have potential, trade-offs also have to be considered, he said.</p><p> For instance, preserving forests and preventing them from being cut down would mean less land for agriculture, which could negatively affect surrounding communities by compromising their livelihoods and food security.</p><p> Further research will help policy-makers determine how to strike this balance, added Prof Koh, who was most recently vice-president of science partnerships and innovation at international environmental group Conservation International Foundation.</p><p> Prof Koh has over the past 16 years worked in institutions across Switzerland, Australia and the United States. On April 1, he will assume the appointment of professor of conservation science, technology and policy in the Department of Biological Sciences at the NUS Faculty of Science.</p><p> LEADING THE WAY</p><p>It is not so much whether we achieve the goal of planting one million trees or what other nature-based solutions we implement in Singapore, but rather, how we do so that could become a model for other cities and countries to emulate.</p><p> PROFESSOR KOH LIAN PIN, conservation scientist who will be helming the upcoming Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions.</p><p>  The upcoming centre will have two overarching mandates - investing in policy-relevant research, and building capacity in Singapore and the region to respond \"appropriately and decisively\" to climate change, Prof Koh said.</p><p> Discussions are on to identify a physical space within NUS to house the centre, he added.</p><p> \"Over the next few months, we will be engaging and collaborating with government, non-governmental and corporate stakeholders to refine the specific aims and activities of the centre,\" he said.</p><p> Prof Koh is the sixth Singaporean scientist under the NRF's Returning Singaporean Scientists Scheme, which seeks to attract outstanding overseas-based Singaporean researchers back to lead research in areas important to the Republic.</p><p> Professor Chen Tsuhan, NUS deputy president for research and technology, said in a statement yesterday: \"NUS is delighted that Prof Koh has chosen to return to his alma mater to lead strategic efforts in growing competencies and evidence-based science to fight climate change... I am confident that he can leverage NUS' strengths and expertise in different domains of sustainability to create innovative solutions that positively impact Singapore and beyond.\"</p><p> Last October, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli told climate scientists gathered in Singapore that the Republic's plans to deal with sea level rise will incorporate nature-based solutions such as mangroves, as well as engineering solutions.</p><p> It was the first time the Government had officially said nature-based solutions are on the cards, following Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's National Day Rally speech last August in which he said Singapore would need to spend $100 billion over the long term to buffer the country against sea level rise.</p><p> Prof Koh said Singapore is an \"ideal innovation sandbox\" for test-bedding climate solutions, pointing to its plan to plant one million trees over the next decade.</p><p> \"The One Million Trees movement could be a microcosm of the World Economic Forum's One Trillion Tree initiative,\" he said.</p><p>Singapore's experience, he said, could help answer a few key questions, including: how tree-planting can be incorporated into spatial planning to demonstrate green (trees) - grey (concrete) infrastructural development, as well as how cost-effective techniques and technologies can be developed for mapping and monitoring of forest restoration efforts in other parts of the world.</p><p> Said Prof Koh: \"It is not so much whether we achieve the goal of planting one million trees or what other nature-based solutions we implement in Singapore, but rather, how we do so that could become a model for other cities and countries to emulate.\"</p><p> The United Nations has said nature-based solutions are actions which can benefit human well-being and biodiversity.</p><p> Botanist Shawn Lum from the Nanyang Technological University said Singapore's One Million Trees initiative could, for example, help to develop communities and strengthen their bond with nature, and also help create habitats for wildlife.</p><p> \"Trees are wonderful but individually they are just that - trees. Trees in a thriving, functioning ecosystem are part of a complex, wondrous and life-giving web of life that confers benefits to people and nature alike,\" said Dr Lum, who is also president of the Nature Society (Singapore).</p><p> \"Tree planting is beautifully complementary to, and not a substitute for, the care and protection of existing forest habitats.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PROFESSOR KOH LIAN PIN</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-672802</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YGC-NVR1-JCF2-80PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1079\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 21, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp;

The financial services sector is a key part of Singapore's economy, contributing around 14% of GDP and employing nearly 190,000 workers. The AFLP aims to build a core team with the right values, competencies, and strategic understanding to navigate the volatile and uncertain world. Trust and good leadership are crucial in this environment, as countries and organizations face challenges such as rising protectionism, climate change, and technological disruption.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The AFLP prepares Singaporean leaders for regional and global leadership positions in the financial sector.</p><p>* Financial sector jobs are becoming more international facing, and regional and international experience is crucial for leadership roles.</p><p>* Taking on overseas or HQ postings can provide advancement opportunities and influence.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Oct. 24 -- Prime Minister's Office Singapore issued the following speech by Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies:</p><p>Speech by Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies Heng Swee Keat at the Asian Financial Leaders Programme Graduation Dinner on 24 October 2023.</p><p>Prof Arnoud De Meyer</p><p>Chairman, Human Capital Leadership Institute (HCLI)</p><p>Ms Doris Sohmen-Pao</p><p>CEO, HCLI</p><p>Prof Lim Sun Sun</p><p>Vice-President, SMU</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>A very good evening. My heartiest congratulations to our graduates of the Asian Financial Leaders Programme (or AFLP).</p><p>There are five cohorts graduating today. While your programme may have been disrupted by COVID, the upside is that you get an upsized celebration!</p><p>So make the best use of this wonderful opportunity to network and get to know one another better.</p><p>The AFLP was established in 2015 as a strategic initiative of the MAS, to develop top talent in the financial sector to assume regional and global leadership positions in the various financial institutions.</p><p>Why the need for this? Because financial services is a key sector of Singapore economy, contributing around 14% GDP, employing nearly 190,000 workers, and offering good jobs.</p><p>It is also a highly competitive and fluid sector. What distinguishes one financial centre from another is the depth of its talent pool and ecosystem, as well as the quality of its regulations.</p><p>At the same time, the financial sector can be volatile - within the last few decades, we went through several financial crises.</p><p>With the financial sector being such a substantial part of the Singapore economy, it is critical that we invest in developing our talent; to ensure that our policies and regulations are responsive and innovative; and build a core team that has the right values, competencies and strategic grasp of issues.</p><p>In today's more volatile and uncertain world, the premium on trust and good leadership has grown.</p><p>While inflation appears to be slowly coming under control, the underpinning geopolitical risks have grown.</p><p>Beyond the US-China strategic competition, we are also contending with unrest and war in different parts of the world - Ukraine, and now Israel and Gaza.</p><p>Countries and companies are rightly seeking to \"de-risk\" and diversify their supply chains and operations.</p><p>In the immediate term, this has benefited safe and trusted nodes like Singapore.</p><p>However, the longer-term worry is that rising protectionism could result in a fragmented and decoupled global economy, which does not bode well for a small and open economy like ours.</p><p>We are also confronting the key challenges of climate change and the technology revolution.</p><p>There are numerous data points that underscore the urgency of the climate challenge - we are seeing rising sea levels and the warmest years on record.</p><p>Yet the world is hardly investing enough to enable the global transition to net-zero by 2050. It is difficult to galvanise leadership attention and mobilise collective action.</p><p>On the technology side, while there is optimism about the new possibilities it can unlock, technology's disruptive nature has also brought anxiety.</p><p>Technology is forcing the pace of economic and industrial transformation. Jobs are being reshaped, and may even disappear. Workers will need to retrain and reskill in order to remain relevant.</p><p>These anxieties can end up being misdirected. It is easier to blame foreigners for taking over jobs, than to confront the difficult task of transformation and reskilling. We have seen this happen in more than a few countries.</p><p>Moreover, with technology being viewed as a source of competitive advantage, some countries have been framing technology through a national security lens to curb collaboration.</p><p>In short, now more than ever, countries and organisations need good leadership and trust to navigate choppier waters.</p><p>At the same time, every challenge is also an opportunity. Can our financial sector help galvanise action to realise the transformations that are needed to overcome these challenges?</p><p>For example, to tackle climate change, we will need to facilitate access to capital, to invest in green and transition projects.</p><p>We want to scale up blended finance, to crowd in more private capital into key projects such as energy transition infrastructure and nature-based solutions in emerging markets.</p><p>It is through such projects that we can facilitate the major transformations across economies, societies and infrastructure.</p><p>On the technology front, we could be seeing fundamental changes to the way the financial system functions.</p><p>In the first digitalisation leap, we harnessed technology to improve access and inclusion for emerging economies, businesses and individuals.</p><p>In the current leap, we are making financial transactions and the banking sector as a whole, even more efficient and seamless, through technologies such as distributed ledgers, Generative AI, and the tokenisation of financial and real economy assets.</p><p>To realise the upside returns from the opportunities, and manage the downside risks, good leadership for the financial sector is critical.</p><p>And the most critical quality of good leadership is trustworthiness. Trust is the currency of finance. We need to maintain trusted systems and organisations, manned by officers of integrity.</p><p>The role of leaders in building, maintaining, and renewing trust cannot be stated enough.</p><p>In navigating a more uncertain world, we also seek leaders who can understand, and decisively respond to new risks, challenges, and opportunities.</p><p>They must then have the skills, savvy, and charisma to lead their organisations and workforces through the necessary transformation, while holding firmly onto core values like trust and integrity.</p><p>And because there are common challenges across the sectors, leaders must be able to drive collaboration across organisations and institutions to reap synergies and strengthen the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>Across the board, we see that industries and companies that have exceeded expectations are led by leaders who have a keen sense of opportunities, the ability to formulate strategies, and the capacity to build deep capabilities to deliver results.</p><p>This is why we started the AFLP, as a flagship programme to prepare Singaporean leaders for regional and global leadership positions.</p><p>For one, we see that financial sector jobs are becoming more international facing. The estimate is that close to half of these jobs are primarily international in nature.</p><p>This means that the competition for these leadership jobs is global. It is therefore critical that we equip Singaporean talent with the necessary capabilities and skills to succeed.</p><p>This is in line with our consistent commitment to human resource development. With no natural resources to count on, we always do our best to nurture and enable every Singaporean to maximise their potential.</p><p>There are very encouraging signs of this. MAS estimates that the number of Singaporeans taking up senior roles in the financial sector has more than doubled since 2016, in line with the growth of the sector.</p><p>One example is Dennis Tan, the CEO of Prudential Singapore. Dennis graduated from the AFLP in 2017 when he was Head of Consumer Financial Services at OCBC.</p><p>The AFLP enabled Dennis to broaden his horizons and expand his network, which were valuable in advancing his career and leadership journey.</p><p>In fact, after becoming CEO, Dennis was also appointed Managing Director of the Strategic Business Group covering Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. He is part of Prudential's Group Executive Committee at the global level.</p><p>When capable Singaporeans like Dennis win their seat at the table, it serves as inspiration and encouragement to others.</p><p>More importantly, it grows our collective capacity to build a diverse workforce, where we draw in the best talent from all over the world to contribute and grow the sector together.</p><p>I am glad that the AFLP provides a comprehensive experience to enable participants to build the necessary capabilities. Besides offering global perspectives across five countries, it also offers interactions with policymakers, academics, captains of industry, while helping participants sharpen their leadership skills.</p><p>The leadership journey</p><p>Today, we mark the milestone of graduation. But the leadership journey is a marathon, and the AFLP is merely the basic fitness training for you to start right.</p><p>What should you pay attention to as you head back into your workplaces? What else can you do? Let me offer two suggestions:</p><p>First - take charge of your growth, by owning your career and leadership journey.</p><p>Many financial institutions use Singapore as a base for the region, so to take on a leadership role here, it is crucial to build up regional and international experience. In fact, local banks in Singapore have grown their regional and global footprint.</p><p>So, do you do so? First and foremost, be prepared to take on overseas postings.</p><p>Working in a different context with a different set of stakeholders will require us to build up cross-cultural competencies and the muscle to mobilise diverse stakeholders.</p><p>But this requires us to uproot ourselves and even our families from a comfortable and known environment, and venture somewhere new.</p><p>Interestingly, research by the Centre for Creative Leadership showed that taking on HQ stints gives outsized influence and brings advancement opportunities.</p><p>So If you are offered the opportunity to take on an overseas or HQ posting - go for it! It will be good for both your career and personal growth.</p><p>MAS' International Postings Programme is available to help financial institutions defray the costs of such postings. Since 2016, nearly 180 Singaporeans have been supported on such postings.</p><p>The issue of developing leaders for our corporate sector, beyond finance, is one that we are working on.</p><p>Last year, I worked with the Singapore Business Federation to convene an Alliance for Action for business leadership development. The team released its findings and recommendations earlier this year, and emphasised the importance of building leadership muscles through overseas and cross-functional postings.</p><p>By widening our skillsets and broadening our exposure, we grow our competence and confidence in taking on regional and global leadership roles.</p><p>So this is the first point - we must take charge of our own growth and development.</p><p>Second - beyond personal growth, we must grow with others, and help others grow. I therefore encourage you to fully tap on and contribute to the various networks that you are part of.</p><p>First and foremost, there are more than 300 leaders who have come through the AFLP over the years.</p><p>I am glad to hear that there are healthy and sustained interactions, within as well as across cohorts. This alumni network is important to enable you to support one another.</p><p>Singaporean graduates from the AFLP are invited to join the MAS' Singapore Financial Leaders Network (or SFLN) to network and provide peer support to other leaders within the financial sector.</p><p>This initiative began around 10 years ago, during my first term as MAS Board member. Along the way, I have personally engaged with SFLN members and always found them thoughtful.</p><p>The SFLN is a good example of how it is possible to compete in the business, yet at the same time, collaborate and support one another as a community.</p><p>Given the many shared challenges that the financial sector faces, there is plenty of room to collaborate with one another, share good practices, and pursue opportunities at scale.</p><p>Leaders play an important role in building such positive norms and behaviours.</p><p>I am therefore glad that many of the SFLN members have also signed on to EDB's Singapore Leaders Network, which is run by HCLI and enables financial sector leaders to network with peers from outside the financial sector.</p><p>It is useful to be among this community of leaders, so that we can support, grow, and thrive with one another.</p><p>Finally, we must also pay attention to growing and nurturing the next generation of leaders.</p><p>Developing talent is a leadership responsibility; I am certain that in our own career journeys, we would have benefitted from a mentor or a boss who went the extra mile.</p><p>So I hope that you will be generous in paying it forward, by nurturing the young talent in your companies, and encouraging them to step out of comfort zone.</p><p>This way, we can build a sustainable community of leaders.</p><p>In closing, let me once again warmly congratulate all of you for achieving this milestone of graduating from the Asian Financial Leaders Programme.</p><p>The trends and circumstances of our world today means that the knowledge and skills you have picked up during the Programme will be very salient.</p><p>A more uncertain and volatile world calls for good leadership and building trust.</p><p>With our efforts to develop talent for the financial sector over the past decade, we have been able to seize opportunities and deepen the sector, which in turn create more good jobs.</p><p>Let us continue to build on this good work on this virtuous cycle, to strengthen our financial sector, deepen our local bench strength, and offer good leadership that serves not just Singapore, but the region and the world.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062931671</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69GB-X2X1-DXMP-K131-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2368\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 24, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000552</classCode><className>ECONOMIC POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

He congratulated the graduates and highlighted the importance of developing top talent in the financial sector. The financial sector is a key contributor to Singapore's economy, and it is crucial to invest in talent development and innovative policies. Mr Heng emphasized the growing importance of trust and good leadership in a volatile and uncertain world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* The AFLP alumni network and the MAS Singapore Financial Leaders Network (SFLN) provide opportunities for networking and peer support.</p><p>* Collaboration and support within the financial sector community are important.</p><p>* Growing and nurturing the next generation of leaders is a leadership responsibility.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Oct. 24 -- Monetary Authority of Singapore issued the following speech by Heng Swee Keat, Deputy Prime Minister and Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies:</p><p>Prof Arnoud De Meyer</p><p>Chairman, Human Capital Leadership Institute (HCLI)</p><p>Ms Doris Sohmen-Pao</p><p>CEO, HCLI</p><p>Prof Lim Sun Sun</p><p>Vice-President, SMU</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>1. A very good evening. My heartiest congratulations to our graduates of the Asian Financial Leaders Programme (or AFLP).</p><p>a. There are five cohorts graduating today. While your programme may have been disrupted by COVID, the upside is that you get an upsized celebration!</p><p>b. So make the best use of this wonderful opportunity to network and get to know one other.</p><p>2. The AFLP was established in 2015 as a strategic initiative of the MAS, to develop top talent in the financial sector to assume regional and global leadership positions in the various financial institutions.</p><p>a. Why the need for this? Because financial services is a key sector of Singapore economy, contributing around 14% GDP, employing nearly 190,000 workers, and offering good jobs.</p><p>b. It is also a highly competitive and fluid sector. What distinguishes one financial centre from another is the depth of its talent pool and ecosystem, as well as the quality of its regulations.</p><p>c. At the same time, the financial sector can be volatile - within the last few decades, we went through several financial crises.</p><p>d. With the financial sector being such a substantial part of the Singapore economy, it is critical that we invest in developing our talent; ensure that our policy and regulations are responsive and innovative; and build a core team that has the right values, competencies and strategic grasp of issues.</p><p>3. In today's more volatile and uncertain world, the premium on trust and good leadership has grown.</p><p>a. While inflation appears to be slowly coming under control, the underpinning geopolitical risks have grown.</p><p>i. Beyond the US-China strategic competition, we are also contending with unrest and war in different parts of the world - Ukraine, and now Israel and Gaza.</p><p>ii. Countries and companies are rightly seeking to \"de-risk\" and diversify their supply chains and operations.</p><p>iii. In the immediate term, this has benefited safe and trusted nodes like Singapore.</p><p>iv. However, the longer-term worry is that rising protectionism could result in a fragmented and decoupled global economy, which does not bode well for a small and open economy like ours.</p><p>b. We are also confronting the key challenges of climate change and the technology revolution.</p><p>i. There are numerous data points that underscore the urgency of the climate challenge - we are seeing rising sea levels and the warmest years on record.</p><p>ii. Yet the world is hardly investing enough to enable the global transition to net-zero by 2050. It is difficult to galvanise leadership attention and mobilise collective action.</p><p>c. On the technology side, while there is optimism about the new possibilities it can unlock, technology's disruptive nature has also brought anxiety.</p><p>i. Technology is forcing the pace of economic and industrial transformation. Jobs are being reshaped, and may even disappear. Workers will need to retrain and reskill in order to remain relevant.</p><p>ii. These anxieties can end up being misdirected. It is easier to blame foreigners for taking over jobs, than to confront the difficult task of transformation and reskilling. We have seen this happen in more than a few countries.</p><p>iii. Moreover, with technology being viewed as a source of competitive advantage, some countries have been framing technology through a national security lens to curb collaboration.</p><p>d. In short, now more than before, countries and organisations need good leadership and trust to navigate choppier waters.</p><p>4. At the same time, every challenge is also an opportunity. Can our financial sector help galvanise action to realise the transformations that are needed to overcome these challenges?</p><p>a. For example, to tackle climate change, we will need to facilitate access to capital, to invest in green and transition projects.</p><p>i. We want to scale up blended finance, to crowd in more private capital into key projects such as energy transition infrastructure and nature-based solutions in emerging markets.</p><p>ii. It is through such projects that we can facilitate the major transformations across economies, societies and infrastructure.</p><p>b. On the technology front, we could be seeing fundamental changes to the way the financial system functions.</p><p>i. In the first digitalisation leap, we harnessed technology to improve access and inclusion for emerging economies, businesses and individuals.</p><p>ii. In the current leap, we are making financial transactions and the banking sector as a whole, even more efficient and seamless, through technologies such as distributed ledgers, Gen AI, and the tokenisation of financial and real economy assets.</p><p>5. Putting the two together, good leadership for the financial sector is critical.</p><p>a. Trust is the currency of finance. We need to maintain trusted systems and organisations, manned by officers with integrity.</p><p>i. The role of leaders in building, maintaining, and renewing trust cannot be stated enough.</p><p>b. In navigating a more uncertain world, we seek leaders who can understand, and decisively respond to new risks, challenges, and opportunities.</p><p>c. They must then have the skills, savvy, and charisma to lead their organisations and workforces through the necessary transformation, while holding firmly onto core values like trust and integrity.</p><p>d. And because there are common challenges across the sector, leaders must be able to drive collaboration across organisations and institutions to reap synergies and strengthen the ecosystem as a whole.</p><p>6. Across the board, we see that industries and companies that have exceeded expectations are led by leaders who have a keen sense of opportunities, the ability to formulate strategies, and the capacity to build deep capabilities to deliver results.</p><p>a. This is why we started the AFLP, as a flagship programme to prepare Singaporean leaders for regional and global leadership positions.</p><p>b. For one, we see that financial sector jobs are becoming more international facing. The estimate is that close to half of these jobs are primarily international in nature.</p><p>c. This means that the competition for these leadership jobs is global. It is therefore critical that we equip Singaporean talent with the necessary capabilities and skills to succeed.</p><p>i. This is in line with our consistent commitment to human resource development. With no nature resources to count on, we always do our best to nurture and enable every Singaporean to maximise their potential.</p><p>d. There are very encouraging signs of this. MAS estimates that the number of Singaporeans taking up senior roles in the financial sector has more than doubled since 2016, in line with the growth of the sector.</p><p>i. One example is Dennis Tan, the CEO of Prudential Singapore. Dennis graduated from the AFLP in 2017 when he was Head of Consumer Financial Services at OCBC.</p><p>ii. The AFLP enabled Dennis to broaden his horizons and expand his network, which were valuable in advancing his career and leadership journey.</p><p>iii. In fact, after becoming CEO, Dennis was also appointed Managing Director of the Strategic Business Group covering Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. He is part of Prudential's Group Executive Committee at the global level.</p><p>e. When capable Singaporeans like Dennis win their seat at the table, it serves as inspiration and encouragement to others.</p><p>i. More importantly, it grows our collective capacity to build a diverse workforce, where we draw in the best talent from all over the world to contribute and grow the sector.</p><p>f. I am glad that the AFLP provides a comprehensive experience to enable participants to build the necessary capabilities. Besides offering global perspectives across five countries, it also offers interactions with policymakers, academics, captains of industry, while helping participants sharpen their leadership skills.</p><p>The leadership journey</p><p>7. Today, we mark the milestone of graduation. But the leadership journey is a marathon, and the AFLP is merely the basic fitness training for you to start right.</p><p>a. What should you pay attention to as you head back into your workplaces? What else can you do? I would like to offer two suggestions:</p><p>8. First - take charge of your growth, by owning your career and leadership journey.</p><p>a. Many financial institutions use Singapore as a base for the region, so to take on a leadership role here, it is crucial to build up regional and international experience.</p><p>b. How do you do so? First and foremost, be prepared to take on overseas postings.</p><p>i. Working in a different context with a different set of stakeholders will require us to build up cross-cultural competencies and the muscle to mobilise diverse stakeholders.</p><p>ii. But this requires us to uproot ourselves and even our families from a comfortable and known environment, and venture somewhere new.</p><p>c. Research by the Centre for Creative Leadership showed that taking on HQ stints gives outsized influence and brings advancement opportunities.</p><p>i. So If you are offered the opportunity to take on an overseas or HQ posting - go for it! It will be good for both your career and personal growth.</p><p>ii. MAS' International Postings Programme is available to help financial institutions defray the costs of such postings. Since 2016, nearly 180 Singaporeans have been supported on such postings.</p><p>d. I should also add that this issue of corporate leadership development is one that we are paying attention to at the broader level.</p><p>i. Earlier this year, the Alliance for Action for business leadership development released its findings and similarly articulated the importance of building leadership muscles through overseas and cross-functional postings.</p><p>ii. By widening our skillsets and broadening our exposure, we grow our competence and confidence in taking on regional and global leadership roles.</p><p>e. So this is the first point - we must take charge of our own growth and development.</p><p>9. Second - beyond personal growth, we must grow with others, and help others grow. I therefore encourage you to fully tap on and contribute to the various networks that you are part of.</p><p>a. First and foremost, there are more than 300 leaders who have come through the AFLP over the years.</p><p>i. I am glad to hear that there are healthy and sustained interactions, within as well as across cohorts. This alumni network is important to enable you to support one another.</p><p>b. Singaporean graduates from the AFLP are invited to join the MAS' Singapore Financial Leaders Network (or SFLN) to network and provide peer support to other leaders within the financial sector.</p><p>i. This initiative began around 10 years ago, during my first term as MAS Board member. Along the way, I have personally engaged with SFLN members and always found them thoughtful.</p><p>ii. The SFLN is a good example of how it is possible to compete in the business, yet at the same time, collaborate and support one another as a community.</p><p>iii. Given the many shared challenges that the financial sector faces, there is plenty of room to collaborate with one another, share good practices, and pursue opportunities at scale.</p><p>iv. Leaders play an important role in building such positive norms and behaviours.</p><p>c. I am therefore glad that many of the SFLN members have also signed on to EDB's Singapore Leaders Network, which is run by HCLI and enables financial sector leaders to network with peers from outside the financial sector.</p><p>d. It is useful to be among this community of leaders, so that we can support, grow, and thrive with one another.</p><p>e. Finally, we must also pay attention to growing and nurturing the next generation of leaders.</p><p>i. Developing talent is a leadership responsibility; I am certain that in our own career journeys, we would have benefitted from a mentor or a boss who went the extra mile.</p><p>ii. So I hope that you will be generous in paying in forward, by nurturing the young talent in your companies, and encouraging them to step out of comfort zone.</p><p>iii. This way, we can build a sustainable community of leaders.</p><p>10. In closing, let me once again warmly congratulate all of you for achieving this milestone of graduating from the Asian Financial Leaders Programme.</p><p>a. The trends and circumstances of our world today means that the knowledge and skills you have picked up during the Programme will be very salient.</p><p>b. A more uncertain and volatile world calls for good leadership and building trust.</p><p>c.

These habitats are known to store much more carbon than land-based forests.</p><p> Mr Heng said unlocking the potential of what nature has to offer at scale will require a significant amount of investment.</p><p> This requires a carbon marketplace with robust governance standards and an emphasis on trust must be built, he said.</p><p>Singapore is contributing to this on a few fronts, said Mr Heng, citing the Climate Impact X (CIX) - a global carbon exchange and marketplace funded by DBS Bank, Temasek, Standard Chartered bank and the Singapore Exchange announced earlier this year.</p><p> CIX is a promising solution in the fragmented carbon credit markets landscape today, which is characterised by thin liquidity and carbon credits of varying quality, said Mr Heng.</p><p>Singapore is also represented on the Taskforce on Scaling Voluntary Carbon Markets - a global initiative to help define the standards for carbon markets, he said.</p><p> Carbon must also be properly priced to account for the negative externalities that it contributes to the global climate.</p><p> Mr Heng said the Singapore Government is reviewing the trajectory and the level of its carbon tax post-2023. The current rate is $5 per tonne of emissions - a rate that critics have claimed is far too low.</p><p> Mr Heng said the Covid-19 pandemic did not derail the green movement, but instead gave it more momentum.</p><p> The global media is putting focus on this issue, he said, citing World News Day on Sept 28 that had focused on the climate crisis. The Straits Times has joined nearly 500 newsrooms from around the world in telling the story of how climate change is already impacting the lives and livelihoods of communities, and how they are grappling with it.</p><p> Environmental accountability is also becoming a key consideration alongside profitability, said Mr Heng.</p><p> \"What is clear is that carbon will become an increasingly greater constraint for the world. But this does not mean that global growth would be stunted, and human progress impeded,\" he said. \"What we can achieve in the decades ahead, depends critically on what we do today.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-847907</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63R6-D511-JCF2-8542-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"613\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 30, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0005JEZ</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK ZIMBABWE LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00064QT</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (THAI) PCL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC000DFWM</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NEPAL LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00080WB</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED AUSTRALIA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS522293 INTERNATIONAL TRADE FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC6082 FOREIGN TRADE &amp;

Sinking land, or land subsidence, can aggravate the problem, a team of international scientists led by the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) found.</p><p> Ms Cheryl Tay, a PhD student at NTU's Asian School of the Environment (ASE) and the Earth Observatory of Singapore (EOS), noted that the many coastal cities in Asia are now centres of growth and rapid urbanisation. This has driven up demand for groundwater extraction to meet growing water needs.</p><p> This, in turn, causes land to sink rapidly, said Ms Tay, who is the first author of the research study, which was done in collaboration with the University of New Mexico, ETH Z\u00fcrich and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Lab, which is managed by the California Institute of Technology.</p><p> Satellite images of 48 coastal cities globally were processed from 2014 to 2020, which showed that the median sinking speed was 16.2mm per year. Some cities had land sinking at 43mm a year, and land subsidence may vary at the neighbourhood level, said Ms Tay.</p><p> Current global mean sea-level rise is at 3.7mm per year.</p><p> The findings were published in scientific journal Nature Sustainability in September.</p><p> Data from the team's study shows that Jakarta is sinking at a rate of 4.4mm per year and Ho Chi Minh City at 16.2mm. Reports have shown that excessive groundwater extraction was the leading culprit for land subsidence in both cities.</p><p> In Ho Chi Minh City, the concentration of high-rise buildings in areas with weak foundations has also contributed to land subsidence.</p><p> Coupled with extreme rainfall and sea-level rise caused by climate change, land subsidence could lead to more frequent, intense and prolonged flooding for vulnerable places over the next few years, said Ms Tay.</p><p> \"Floods may disrupt businesses and damage property and infrastructure. In extreme cases, permanent flooding may affect livelihoods by damaging productive agricultural land, and force populations to move when places become uninhabitable,\" she added.</p><p> In Singapore, mean sea levels are rising at a rate of 3mm to 4mm per year, with data from the Meteorological Service Singapore in 2020 showing sea levels here have gone up by 14cm since pre-1970 levels.</p><p> Climate projections have shown that the mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by up to 1m by 2100. This could go up to 4m or 5m if other effects such as storm surges (abnormal rise of water from storms) - which occur two to four times a year - are taken into account.</p><p> A comparison carried out across coastal cities worldwide by the researchers showed that the fastest velocities of relative local land subsidence are concentrated in Asia, especially in South-east Asia.</p><p> To tackle these issues, governments can build up coastal defences such as sea walls, or tap nature-based solutions such as mangroves, said Ms Tay.</p><p> They should also tackle the root cause of the problem. If extraction of resources like groundwater, oil and gas is the main cause of land subsidence for a particular city, then tailored solutions for each jurisdiction would be needed as well, she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1087955</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66F4-1J81-JCF2-81BS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"553\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It has identified three potential sustainability-related research projects - one on biodiversity, ecosystems and ecosystem services; a second on human capital; and a third on human rights. A fourth potential project will explore integration in reporting. The ISSB has already launched its first two standards (the first covering general requirements and the second covering climate), which are expected to be finalised in June 2023. While the ISSB has adopted a \"climate-first\" approach, it is important to note that it is predominantly focused on the impacts of climate-related issues within an organisation.We are also cognisant of the launch of the new Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TFND) framework in September, and how that might compare with the existing Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and impact the implementation of ISSB.With the ISSB planning to develop additional standards in the future and as nature-based solutions as part of the next priorities, we will soon understand the alignment the ISSB has with TFND. </p><p>Jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific and South-east Asia have started to mandate disclosures in alignment with the TCFD recommendations in recent years. We expect that some regulators will continue to strengthen their regulatory requirements and mandate the ISSB standards in the foreseeable future.Over time, we anticipate that South-east Asia will continue to align mandatory climate disclosure requirements with major global markets, including the United Kingdom and the European Union, and that the ISSB standards will become a regulatory requirement. This will also help build further trust and credibility of the disclosure framework.A complex landscapeBusinesses are committing to measuring and reporting their climate and sustainability performances now more than ever. The pressure to provide more clarity on these measurements by increasing the scope of reporting comes from all stakeholders - customers, investors, and even employees.However, making the commitment towards providing more clarity has been difficult, given the disparate and complex global landscape of climate and sustainability reporting. To mitigate this challenge, IFRS launched the ISSB as an international body tasked with developing a consistent global baseline for sustainability-related financial disclosures.The ISSB was launched at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2021. Since its inception, the ISSB has been hard at work to create a universal reporting standard, with first exposure drafts of the standards released in April 2022. The proposed standards leverage the existing TCFD framework's four pillars of governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets.These draft standards require organisations to disclose the effects of climate-related risks and opportunities on their financial position, financial performance, and cash flows, along with how they expect their financial position and performance to change over time given their decarbonisation strategy.Historically, requirements have been complex and difficult to communicate across industries and sectors. The ISSB is designed to give stakeholders - particularly investors - clear, consistent, and comparable information about a company's sustainability and climate-related risks and opportunities. The ISSB has also proposed that this information be disclosed as a part of general-purpose financial reporting.South-east Asia steps upAs we have noted above, we anticipate that regulators in South-east Asia will strengthen their climate disclosure mandates over the next few years, and will likely include the ISSB standards as part of their mandatory ESG disclosure requirements for listed companies.Currently, several regulatory bodies have already expressed interest and support for the ISSB, although there are no current plans to mandate disclosures in alignment with the ISSB standards in the region.Existing frameworks may also influence South-east Asian businesses and country regulations, as more jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific and South-east Asia are mandating disclosures in alignment with TCFD recommendations.The TCFD is now mandatory for certain industries in several Asia-Pacific jurisdictions, including Singapore. Some businesses also practise voluntary sustainability reporting using the TCFD, while the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards are increasingly commonplace amongst larger listed entities. Larger companies are therefore better positioned to adopt the proposed ISSB standards.However, many - particularly smaller listed entities - are less well placed. Education, tools, and clear guidance will be required to upskill professionals in the region on the implementation of ISSB standards, and how that may affect their reporting procedures.Challenges in implementationSouth-east Asian countries and businesses based in the region will need to make some adjustments and modifications to any regulations, to ensure enforceability and ease of implementation. There are increasing expectations for climate-related issues to be reflected in financial statements, which organisations must adapt to.Data integrity, transparency and verification are also major challenges, not least when considering value chain and Scope 3 reporting. It will be challenging for companies to report comprehensive and high-quality data in alignment with the ISSB standards if organisations do not invest in and implement the right monitoring and reporting systems, along with new models and methods for data sharing.We also anticipate that businesses in the region may face issues with the preparation of ESG disclosures assurance. We predict that, over time, assurance over sustainability-related disclosures will become mandatory, starting with limited assurance, and eventually moving into reasonable assurance.Regulators across the region are closely watching the ISSB developments, and several have welcomed the new standards and their efforts to consolidate the climate reporting landscape to investors.Becoming ISSB-readyTaking tangible steps towards climate action should be a priority for all organisations. Besides working towards decarbonisation, there are some additional steps organisations can take for climate-led transformation.First, to commit to a climate change and sustainability target; second, to develop a climate change and sustainability strategy and to align this with their organisational goals. Organisations could also enhance organisational capabilities to deal with sustainability targets and finally, regularly monitor and report on the progress of these goals.Tackling climate change and sustainability issues will deliver significant benefits to an organisation, but it cannot be realised without re-allocation of capital and new investment. To become ISSB-ready, organisations need to focus on new priorities, starting with diagnosing and assessing the gaps and impact the draft ISSB standards will have on their existing processes. From there, they should put in place strategic plans and road maps to operationalise measurement and review. Finally, organisations need to communicate the implications of these standards to stakeholders, including the C-suite and board.By staying ahead of the regulatory curve and aligning with global best practices, organisations can become climate-resilient and invest in the economic opportunity of the global transition to the low-carbon economy - all while becoming ISSB-ready.Brian Ho is the sustainability and climate assurance leader at Deloitte Asia Pacific.

He also mentioned Singapore's efforts to transit to cleaner energy sources such as solar and hydrogen.</p><p> Prof Koh, a conservation scientist, envisioned a Singapore in 2050 where every building will have solar panels, every vehicle is electric, and streets are lined with even more trees.</p><p> With its waterways and coastlines showcasing world-leading technology- and nature-based solutions that offer optimal protection against storm surges and sea level rise, the country would be an international hub for climate and sustainability solutions, he described, while urging more effort to realise this reality.</p><p> Ms Carrie Tan (Nee Soon GRC) called on Singaporeans to reduce wasteful consumption.</p><p> \"In our daily lives, we currently have an increasing norm of online shopping where we can buy something for as cheap as $3 and have it shipped to our door in layers of boxing and packaging,\" she said, suggesting that swopping and sharing items be encouraged instead.</p><p> On the business front, Mr Derrick Goh (Nee Soon GRC) said that while Budget 2023 retains existing measures such as the Resource Efficiency Grant for Energy, as well as the Enterprise Sustainability Programme by EnterpriseSG, he was uncertain if these could help to push small and medium-sized enterprises to step up their green efforts sufficiently and in time.</p><p> With larger firms increasingly expecting their suppliers to be green, SMEs need help to move more quickly or risk being left out of tomorrow's supply chain, he added.</p><p> Conversely, businesses further along in their transformation should partner to create a credible regulatory framework for voluntary carbon credits in Singapore. These efforts will help establish Singapore as a growing and leading green hub, said Mr Goh. </p><p> Workers' Party MP He Ting Ru (Sengkang GRC) noted that rising temperatures will affect blue-collar workers, migrant workers and gig workers more than other groups, as she called for more measures to enable them to adapt to the effects of extreme heat.</p><p> At the same time, more needs to be done to sustainably cool down buildings here, said Ms He. She proposed more investment in better cooling infrastructure when building flats, especially rental flats.</p><p> MPs also called on the Government to strengthen Singapore's energy security. Dr Lim Wee Kiak (Sembawang GRC) noted the global problem of energy supply disruptions amid the Russia-Ukraine war.</p><p> \"It exposed our vulnerability due to our over-reliance on natural gas and oil for our energy needs. I suggest we need to urgently explore more ways to expand and ramp up our adoption of solar energy,\" he said.</p><p> He also raised the possibility of using nuclear energy.</p><p> \"It is time to make a bold decision on whether this is one of the best options for us to ensure our energy resilience,\" he said, noting that factors such as cost, technology and safety must be considered.</p><p> He suggested that Singapore could explore building such a facility on an offshore island, on a man-made rig in the sea, deep underground or even on the sea bed.</p><p> Noting that it normally takes 10 to 15 years to build a nuclear power plant, Dr Lim asked if the Government has a timeline in pursuing this energy option.</p><p> Ms Poh Li San (Sembawang GRC) questioned if Singapore has sufficient expertise in the area of green energy transition, and asked if the country should invest more to attract experts here and to develop local talent to focus on the solutions required in the energy sector.</p><p> She added that it is uncertain when and if green hydrogen-powered electricity is economically viable, and questioned how Singapore can ensure any import supply would be extended infinitely while keeping the cost of imported electricity affordable.</p><p> Imploring Singaporeans to play their part, Ms Carrie Tan said: \"The only way to avoid the crisis is to consume and produce in ways that are transformatively different from before. </p><p> \"If we do not start regenerating our Earth, we are consuming it to death and putting humanity on the trajectory to an era of war and destructive competition, which is already beginning to set in.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Nominated MP Koh Lian Pin envisioned a Singapore in 2050 where every building will have solar panels, every vehicle is electric, and streets are lined with even more trees.

The Republic has also announced its intention to see its planet-warming emissions reach net zero by 2050. </p><p> At COP26, countries agreed on a broad set of rules that would enable them to trade carbon credits to help meet their climate targets. For example, nations agreed that there would be no double counting of emissions -- meaning countries selling the carbon credits cannot count the savings under their own national targets. </p><p> The COP26 outcome meant that countries need no longer rely solely on what they can do to cut emissions within their borders to meet their climate targets. They can also collaborate with other countries, such as buying carbon credits from emissions reduction projects in other nations, to reduce their carbon footprint. </p><p> This can be done in two main ways. </p><p> Nations can establish bilateral agreements to buy carbon credits that meet carbon market rules. The source could be another country or private developers of carbon credit projects based in another country. </p><p> Alternatively, countries can also choose to buy credits from a centralised \"marketplace\" of carbon credits that will be set up and overseen by the UN. </p><p>Singapore's discussions with these more than 20 countries could help it buy carbon credits via the bilateral mechanism. </p><p> Said Mr Chia: \"Singapore is committed to advancing global climate action through international collaboration with like-minded partners.\"</p><p> Sources of carbon credits can include nature-based solutions, such as a reforestation project, or technology-based ones, such as capturing planet-warming carbon emissions from a fossil fuel plant and storing them underground. </p><p> Professor Koh Lian Pin, director of the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, said Singapore needs to build a diverse portfolio of carbon credits from various supplier countries to safeguard its \"carbon credit security\", just as the nation does for food and water security. </p><p> \"Our carbon credit portfolio should include different types of credits as well. For example, in terms of nature-based carbon credits, we should source for not only blue carbon from mangrove forests, but also green carbon from terrestrial forests and teal carbon from freshwater and peat swamp forests,\" he said. </p><p> Blue, green and teal carbon is carbon stored by marine, forest and freshwater habitats, respectively. </p><p> Ms Cherine Fok, a partner at KPMG ESG, the sustainability practice of professional services firm KPMG in Singapore, said having various sources of carbon credits will enable the country to reduce its carbon footprint and tap new economic opportunities in the global quest for new technologies. </p><p> \"Innovation and investment opportunities in green technology could be scaled up and extended to other areas, such as healthcare, food and energy security.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-E5OODI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66NY-3DC1-DYX4-01B1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"668\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
