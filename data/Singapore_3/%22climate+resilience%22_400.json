It has started deployment and announced funding rounds for companies such as MAKA Motors, Koltiva, Simplus, and Super Mum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It also aims to seek out more investments in Indonesia in fintech, e-commerce, health tech, MSME enablement, and climate space, with a particular interest in consumer space sectors.</p><p>\"We continue to believe that the demographics of Indonesia present the strongest investment case for the ASEAN region and that, more than ever, the ecosystem has reached a maturity level ripe for new generations of technology-enabled companies to thrive. We will continue finding the most promising entrepreneurs and businesses to work with and create societal and economic impact,\" writes Adrian Li, Founder &amp; Managing Partner of AC Ventures, in an email to e27.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/indonesia-will-soon-see-a-proper-credit-boom-for-businesses-consumers-ac-ventures-20220829/\">AC Ventures aims to drive positive societal change, economic impact in SEA</url></p><p>To understand more about how the VC firm aims to create an impact through their portfolio companies and Indonesian startups' standing when meeting ESG-related expectations, check out this edited excerpt of our interview with Li.</p><p>What is the most significant trend in the Indonesian startup ecosystem today?</p><p>In recent years, the Indonesian venture capital landscape has significantly shifted towards investing in startups with higher-quality business models, emphasising the ability to generate positive cash flow. This trend reflects a maturing market where investors are increasingly looking for businesses that promise high growth and demonstrate a clear path to profitability. This change in investment criteria is a move away from the earlier focus on rapid user growth and market share acquisition, with less immediate concern for revenue and profit.</p><p>From a sector standpoint, there is growing interest in startups addressing climate change and sustainability. This reflects a global trend of increasing awareness and concern over environmental issues, but it is particularly pertinent in Indonesia, given its vast natural resources and the challenges it faces in terms of environmental conservation and climate resilience. Startups in renewable energy, waste management, and sustainable agriculture are attracting attention, signalling a shift towards investments that promise financial returns and positive environmental impact.</p><p>Additionally, general consumer businesses continue to attract significant interest from venture capital investors. With Indonesia's large and growing middle class, startups in the e-commerce, fintech, health tech, and edutech sectors are seen as well-positioned to capitalise on the increasing digitalisation of consumer behaviours. These businesses often have clear revenue models and the potential for rapid scalability, making them attractive to investors looking for sustainable growth.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/merchants-selling-via-tiktok-shop-could-harm-indonesian-economy-ac-ventures-20231017/\">Merchants selling via TikTok could be harming Indonesian economy: AC Ventures</url></p><p>This evolution towards more financially sustainable and socially responsible investing reflects a broader understanding within the Indonesian venture capital community that long-term success is driven by more than just rapid growth. It signifies a deeper alignment with global investment trends that prioritise sustainability in business models and the broader impact on society and the environment.</p><p>Recently, more and more investors have taken ESG into consideration when assessing potential investments. How do Indonesian startups fare in this matter? Are they ready for this?</p><p>In response to the growing emphasis on ESG considerations among investors, Indonesian startups are gearing up for a more mature and resilient ecosystem. Early signs suggest that these startups are well-positioned for the shift.</p><p>Early-stage deals are expected to thrive, especially in emerging sectors such as electric vehicles, renewable energy, healthcare, and food and agriculture. Additionally, fintech, commerce, and support for MSMEs remain attractive investment areas.</p><p>We have always emphasised the importance of economic and social impact for our portfolio, and to track this, we have adopted ESG tracking for our portfolio from the start of our last fund. Working with IFC as well as using The Upright Project, a tech company based in Helsinki that measures impact according to Northern European standards, to create a Net Impact Score for our portfolio, we can see what areas they perform well in as well as areas they need to improve on.</p><p>With an internal ESG function, we can also work with our portfolio to guide them on improving ESG scores. It is also important to note that improvements in ESG metrics can improve bottom lines economically, not just ensure businesses have a lower environmental footprint.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/indonesia-needs-more-female-investors-willing-to-back-female-founders-helen-wong-of-ac-ventures-20230921/\">Indonesia needs more female investors willing to back female founders: Helen Wong of AC Ventures</url></p><p>How does AC Ventures help its portfolio companies balance ESG and profitability?</p><p>Within our portfolio, we run baseline assessments across the four key dimensions of 'environment,' 'health,' 'society,' and 'knowledge.'</p><p>The metric that guides our hand is the 'net impact ratio.' This percentage score quantifies how effectively a group of companies turns resources into positive impact. Per our latest measurements, our firm and portfolio's overall net impact ratio delivered an above-average +37 per cent, with our strongest areas being 'society' and 'health.'</p><p>The Nasdaq Small Cap Index (NQUSS) features an average net impact ratio of +29 per cent. On the environmental side, a few of our notable portfolio companies include electric motorbike manufacturing company MAKA Motors and sustainable farming and agriculture supply chain traceability platform Koliva. Another one is Indonesia's responsible waste management company, Waste4Change.</p><p>On the societal side, a big aspect that we try to understand is job creation and how many lives our portfolio companies are improving. Our portfolio at AC Ventures has improved the lives of millions of low-income and middle-income earners and MSMEs. Most of our portfolio companies are in second-and third-tier cities, creating hundreds of thousands of jobs.</p><p>A substantial part of this comes from our fintech portfolio, with names such as KoinWorks becoming category leaders in productive financing for Indonesia's MSMEs - of which there are more than 64 million that serve as the backbone of the nation's economy at large.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/wealthtech-insurtech-saas-fintech-are-the-new-hot-verticals-in-indonesia-ac-ventures-report-20230330/\">Wealthtech, insurtech, SaaS fintech are the new hot verticals in Indonesia: AC Ventures report</url></p><p>Is it true that environmental sustainability and profitability often go hand in hand?</p><p>Yes, it is increasingly evident that environmental sustainability and profitability are not mutually exclusive; they can and should go hand in hand.</p><p>Many businesses recognise the value of integrating sustainable practices into their operations for ethical reasons and as a strategic advantage. Efficient resource management, reduced waste, and a focus on environmentally friendly solutions often contribute to cost savings and operational efficiency, ultimately enhancing long-term profitability.</p><p>At AC Ventures, we have observed this synergy within our portfolio, where companies adopting environmentally sustainable practices demonstrate financial resilience and profitability.</p><p>-</p><p>Image Credit: AC Ventures</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/ac-ventures-investors-put-more-focus-on-esg-but-indonesian-startups-seem-well-positioned-for-this-shift-20240208/\">AC Ventures: Investors put more focus on ESG, but Indonesian startups seem \"well-positioned\" for this shift</url>  appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co\">e27</url> .</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/ac-ventures-investors-put-more-focus-on-esg-but-indonesian-startups-seem-well-positioned-for-this-shift-20240208/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG119314170737686138225876100018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8X-P6N1-JCMN-Y0HM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1316\"/><timeReceived>7:17 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>e27</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 8, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519290 WEB SEARCH PORTALS AND ALL OTHER INFORMATION SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>SE (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climate Tech &amp;

She used to grow some vegetables in her small garden in Bagong Silangan, a village in the city outskirts where shanties line the unpaved streets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But when her husband lost his job as a construction worker due to the lockdown, Ms Lilio knew she had to do more.</p><p> She signed up for the city's \"GrowQC\" food security programme in January 2021. Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte teamed up with the Department of Agrarian Reform to convert an empty lot located near Ms Lilio's home into the New Greenland Farm.</p><p> A year later, Ms Lilio is among the over 4,000 urban farmers working across 337 gardens and 10 farms in Quezon City. She earns about 1,000 pesos (S$24) a month selling vegetables. She says it is not much, but being able to grow food for her family makes a difference.</p><p> The farmers were trained to till the land and they harvest vegetables free of charge. The city government linked them with markets to sell their produce, a portion of which they could take home. \"This is such a big help for us because instead of having to spend for what we eat, we can just get them from our farms,\" said Ms Lilio.</p><p> GrowQC is a food security initiative designed to address three of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals within Quezon City: hunger, loss of jobs, and physical and mental health concerns.</p><p> The programme was the brainchild of Ms Belmonte when she was vice-mayor in 2010. Seed starter kits were initially given to residents. Ms Belmonte expanded the project when she became Mayor in 2019 and had to face the Covid-19 crisis a year later.</p><p> Establishing urban gardens producing nutritious food was the city's response to supply chains that were disrupted by the lockdown. Idle plots of land in the city were converted into farms. In villages where land was scant, residents were taught to repurpose discarded plastic bottles for container gardening and turn old tyres into tower gardens. Waste from public markets was turned into compost.</p><p> \"Communities started to see the relevance of having a garden or farm,\" said Ms Belmonte, who governs over 2.9 million people.</p><p> What the farmers do not take home or sell in markets are sold to the city government, which uses the harvest for other social welfare programmes like feeding and milk-letting projects.</p><p>     &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;&gt;4,000&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Number of urban farmers working across 337 gardens and 10 farms in Quezon City.</p><p>      \\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}ALL CONNECTED  What we have learnt from GrowQC is that people, food and the environment are connected. No matter how huge the task at hand, if we learn to collaborate and work together towards common goals, sustainable goals, anything is possible.</p><p>QUEZON CITY MAYOR JOY BELMONTE,   on Quezon City being \"on track\" to attain climate resilience and food security.  Moringa, jute leaves, spinach and sweet potato tops from Ms Lilio's harvest in end-August were given as incentives to lactating mothers at the nearby Sauyo village who volunteered to donate their milk to Quezon City's milk banks.</p><p> Beyond ensuring food security, Ms Belmonte said GrowQC also allows the city government to better protect residents against climate risks like heat, cyclones, floods and drought.</p><p> Excessive rainfall and strong typhoons are likely to damage crops from neighbouring provinces that supply food to Metro Manila. But the urban farms now allow the city to be food self-sufficient while also reducing transportation costs and carbon emissions.</p><p> GrowQC's climate resilience model has not gone unnoticed.</p><p> In October 2021, it won the prestigious Galing Pook Award, which recognises innovative practices by local government units in the Philippines.</p><p> In 2022, the Department of Health gave the project the Healthy Pilipinas Award (Healthy Philippines Award) for spearheading efforts to promote nutrition and physical activity, one of the department's priority areas.</p><p>Quezon City is also the only Philippine city under the C40 Cities Bloomberg Philanthropies Awards for innovative climate solutions. Winners will be announced on Oct 19.</p><p> Ms Belmonte said such recognition is a sign that Quezon City is \"on track\" to achieve climate resilience and food security.

They were primarily in A*Star research institutes, autonomous universities and relevant industries.</p><p> The Government's strategy to retain scholarship holders after graduation includes providing postdoctoral fellowships and awards to enable talented researchers to pursue impactful research in Singapore, said the ministry.</p><p> \"More broadly, RIE plans are focused on building up global peaks of research and translational excellence in Singapore, which is ultimately critical in anchoring research talent,\" it said.</p><p> It added that scholarship recipients who return to their home countries continue to be part of Singapore's research networks around the world, strengthening the capabilities and capacity of the R&amp;D ecosystem here through joint publications, collaborations and the provision of expertise to local researchers.</p><p> The Government's efforts in this sector also extend to growing a core of local enterprises that actively leverage R&amp;D and innovation as a source of competitive advantage, said the committee in its report.</p><p> It noted that local enterprises' business expenditure on R&amp;D increased from $1.1 billion in 2010 to $1.6 billion in 2020.</p><p> One start-up that has benefited from these improvements to the RIE ecosystem is Lucence, said the committee.</p><p> Lucence, founded in 2016 and spun off from A*Star in 2017, provides ultra-sensitive non-invasive cancer detection technologies.</p><p> Through collaborations supported by RIE funding, the start-up was able to access technologies, manpower, R&amp;D and equipment from A*Star and public healthcare institutions.</p><p> On healthcare expenditure, the committee had also inquired whether increases in spending are expected and what monitoring systems are in place to ensure prudent spending.</p><p> It noted that the ministry funded a wide variety of programmes, and recommended that it exercise prudence in ensuring cost-effectiveness and administrative efficiency, and avoiding waste.</p><p> This could include reviewing existing programmes to reduce any duplicate features, as well as to \"sunset\" programmes that are found no longer relevant, or incorporate them into other existing programmes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-2U5K9ML</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69RR-JT81-JCF2-801W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"952\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

In this case, a digital one. Introducing BuzzAR's newest development - digital humans. BAE (Buzz's Amazing Entity) is an AI-powered digital human with emotions and expressions, interacting with customers and clients naturally to provide assistance, recommendations, and just good conversation.</p><p>BAE aims to create a seamless and interactive end-to-end travel experience for tourists, providing navigational assistance and travel guides to local attractions, restaurants, hotels and events. Imagine a companion, always within reach of your fingertips, providing you contextualised and personalised recommendations and suggestions, while paying attention to your needs and preferences, that is also able to carry a casual conversation about the things you see and the things happening around you.</p><p>BAE makes use of OneMap APIs for navigation, routing and display of map-based information. During the development, it also made use of some of OneMap's open datasets, as well as recommendations from Singapore Tourism Board's (STB) Tourism Information &amp; Services Hub (TIH) platform. However a large bulk of recommendations from BAE come organically from OpenAI GPT4's wide knowledgebase. BAE is able to support tourism-related queries, including recommending and planning a customised tourist itinerary based on individual user profiles and preferences.</p><p>BuzzAR believes that the next wave of immersive digital experiences in tourism, hospitality and real estate start with these digital humans.</p><p>About Buzz ARVR</p><p>BuzzAR - digitizing people, places and payments, and transforming customer interactions.

This allows flexibility for issuers in more challenging areas, such as climate-related targets, industry-based metrics, and alternative disclosure during interim periods.</p><p>Issuers are subject to a higher level of reporting obligation based on TCFD, enhanced from \"comply or explain\" to a mandatory regime. With that, the HKEX has localised ISSB in certain areas to incorporate Hong Kong-relevant nuances. For issuers, adherence to the Code strengthens their resilience and adaptation capabilities, which are essential for businesses to remain competitive in the face of climate change.</p><p>On the investor side, the proposed Environmental, Social and Governance Reporting Code (the Code) will help to improve their understanding of how to integrate climate-related risks and opportunities into their investment decisions.</p><p>CFA Institute and CFA Society Hong Kong<url normalizedValue=\"chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https:/cfasocietyhongkong.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CFAHK-CFAI-Joint-Response-%E2%80%93-HKEX-Climate-related-Disclosure.pdf\">co-responded to HKEX's consultation</url>, expressing our appreciation for this comprehensive proposal, including the efforts to engage with end users of financial statements and understand market needs.</p><p>With the move by HKEX, Hong Kong will have the opportunity to be an early adopter and adapter of ISSB-aligned disclosures. Coupled with a comment period following the issuance of IFRS S1 and S2, this enhancement proposal has captured the attention of market participants and provided them with the opportunity to deliberate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Proposed requirements</emphasis></p><p>Below is a summary of the proposed climate-related disclosure requirements, across the four pillars of TCFD.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Governance:</emphasis></p><p>Current: board's oversight and governance on ESG issues, management approach, and strategies </p><p>Proposed: governance process, controls, and procedures used to monitor and manage climate-related risks and opportunities </p><p>The proposed disclosures will better communicate the issuer's oversight and control of climate-related issues. An added benefit is that issuers will be encouraged to develop a robust corporate governance framework, including the extent of the board's and management's involvement, skills and competency, accountability, and remuneration policy. Here, we suggest issuers disclose the identity of the designated key individual or chairman of the committee responsible for climate-related matters.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Strategy:</emphasis></p><p>Current: significant climate-related issues, management policies, and strategies</p><p>Proposed: material climate-related risks and opportunities, transition plans, setting of targets, climate resilience strategy, scenario analysis, financial impacts (current and anticipated)</p><p>The concept of 'materiality' is emphasised here when issuers are required to disclose material climate-related issues and their corresponding impacts. Materiality can be interpreted in different ways, such as financial materiality, double materiality, or dynamic materiality. We seek to clarify the definition of materiality in the Code. As an investor organization, we have long advocated for quality and science-based information reporting, and assessment of climate resilience based on scenario analysis commensurate with an issuer's circumstances.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Risk management:</emphasis></p><p>Current: processes of evaluating, prioritising, and managing material ESG related issues, and their effectiveness </p><p>Proposed: process to identify, assess, and manage climate-related risks and opportunities, and integration to overall risk management framework</p><p>We are happy to see a more comprehensive list of disclosure requirements, in particular the basis for risk prioritization, and the interaction between climate and the overall risk management framework. Meanwhile, the HKEX itself may also need to demonstrate the proportionality of the requirements and the need to prioritize climate-related risks over other types of risks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Metrics and Targets:</emphasis></p><p>Current: environmental KPIs, such as GHG emissions Scope 1 and 2, based on 'comply or explain' basis </p><p>Proposed: GHG emissions Scope 1, 2, and 3 with cross-industry metrics on physical and transition risks, climate-related opportunities, and capital deployment. Other metrics include linkage to internal carbon price, remuneration, and industry-based metrics (optional) </p><p>Carbon footprint, especially Scope 3 emissions, will be an effective metric to convey the transition risk faced by an issuer. The location of information also matters as it will determine the subsequent level of assurance. CFA Institute and CFA Society Hong Kong appreciate taxonomy-based and quantifiable metrics, as comparability is the lifeblood of investment analysis. We also appreciate the higher transparency on an issuer's mitigation and adaptation responses, i.e., capital deployment, linkage to remuneration, and internal carbon price.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oversight and Proportionate Approach</emphasis></p><p>When it comes to Appendix 27 of the Listing Rules, the proposed enhancement has made Hong Kong an early mover in climate reporting. The quality and relevance of the disclosures, however, will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/comment-letter/2020-2024/SEC-Climate-Letter-1.pdf\">highly dependent</url> on the issuers' oversight. The TCFD's own study of the application of its guidance also suggested weak compliance.</p><p>With HKEX's enhanced requirements, this will naturally improve, given the liability concerns that should be commensurate with the evolving nature of climate-related disclosure. However, to be decision-useful, the compliance element of the proposal will require persistent monitoring from HKEX and relevant authorities.</p><p>As a step forward or as an interim measure, we also suggest HKEX leverage the existing financial reporting mechanism and regulatory framework to require the issuers to disclose material climate-related risks and opportunities and related material information contained in the ESG report in their audited financial statements. This can impose a healthy level of assurance for the quality of relevant disclosures and enhance stakeholder confidence.</p><p>It is vital to balance climate ambitions with practicality. \u00a0More guidance and clarification on details help secure buy-in from a range of stakeholders. In particular, a proportionate approach to climate disclosure with differentiated requirements is needed for the GEM issuers, who are facing proportionality challenges.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A long journey ahead</emphasis></p><p>CFA Institute and CFA Society Hong Kong support disclosures based upon the global baselines ISSB and TCFD. IFRS S1 and S2 are important frameworks going in parallel for multi-period and multi-jurisdictional efforts towards improving the quality of climate-related disclosures. Therefore, we encourage the HKEX to place priority on aligning with IFRS S1, following the integration of S2 into Appendix 27 of the Listing Rules.</p><p>We also advocate for the HKEX to continue its efforts in broader engagement and assist issuers with capacity building. Apart from engaging with issuers to raise awareness and collect their feedback on implementation learnings, investor engagement is equally important, given that they are the audience of the reports and users of the proposed Code with respect to stewardship.</p><p>Lastly, we encourage the HKEX to continue offering capacity-building support, transitional reliefs, and incentives for upskilling on climate-related matters, while connecting with other markets in the region to participate in the global conversation and transition journey.</p><p>--</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Co-authored by Sivananth Ramachandran (Director of Capital Markets Policy, India at CFA Institute), Phoebe Chan (Capital Markets Policy Specialist at CFA Institute) and CFA Society Hong Kong.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">REGSIA-110231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">REGSIA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68WF-9S31-DXH6-C2D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1477\"/><timeReceived>10:41 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 inAsia Media Pte Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Regulation Asia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"08\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>August 6, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Contributed Article</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ESG / Sustainability</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Securities / Derivatives</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CFA Institute</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CFA Society Hong Kong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>climate reporting</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disclosures</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ESG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GEM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GRI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>HKEX</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>IFRS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ISSB</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>metrics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Risk Management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Taxonomy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TCFD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Scope of Duty to Disclose</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI0NDdGMTQzOEExNEJENTk5MDlBRTg1MDAxMkEwMDk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjUzNTZBOEYwQUE0NEJGNzlCRjc3NTMyNDU5Qzc2MUU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000011</classCode><className>ACCOUNTING STANDARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DONF</classCode><className>ESG FACTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DBLR</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE INVESTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000542</classCode><className>ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

Most of us barely give it a thought. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Yet, we depend on these grids to keep our lives ticking. They are set to expand rapidly as populations grow and economies use more electricity. They are also widening their reach to tap more green energy sources. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But what if these grids are increasingly likely to let us down'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Grids are at risk of being damaged by worsening climate impacts, especially more powerful storms and floods and more intense heatwaves and cold snaps. This can lead to outages. Without greater investment in resilience, they risk becoming a weak link. </p><p> A recent disaster in the Australian state of Victoria is a stark reminder. </p><p> On Feb 13, 2024, six high-voltage transmission towers collapsed during a powerful storm south-west of Melbourne. More than 500,000 homes and businesses lost power across the state. </p><p> The blackout was not a one-off. Similar collapses have occurred in recent years in southern Australia.</p><p> \"Climate change is increasing the risk of outages due to the increased frequency, severity and distribution of extreme weather events,\" said the International Energy Agency (IEA) in its Climate Resilience for Energy Security report released in November 2022.</p><p> \"Electricity networks are the leading cause of climate-driven outages in many countries and are considered the element of the power system most vulnerable to climate impacts,\" it says. And these outages are costly in terms of disruption to people, communications and businesses. </p><p> Grids comprise long-distance transmission lines that connect states within countries or cross national borders. The power is then channelled to the local distribution grid, which delivers power to customers. </p><p> The technology exists to make grids more resilient and is already being deployed, but it needs to be rolled out faster and at scale. The IEA says grid investment needs to double to more than US$600 billion (S$806.3 billion) a year by the end of the decade, a large portion of it in Asia. </p><p> \"There's an increasing imperative that we need to do this much faster because we just don't have time, both from a climate perspective and an ageing infrastructure perspective, which is being impacted by climate change,\" said Mr Scott Hamilton, senior adviser to Australia's Smart Energy Council, an industry-funded body.</p><p> Australia, like many nations, has to simultaneously upgrade ageing grid infrastructure as it builds thousands of kilometres of new transmission lines to connect scores of large solar, wind and battery storage projects around the country, many in rural areas, he said. It's an immense and costly challenge as the climate risks grow, bringing storms, flash floods and forest fires in their wake. </p><p> Storms, floods and fires\"These events are causing more of these impacts. It's only a matter of time until another one happens in Australia or another part of the world,\" said Mr Hamilton, an adjunct associate professor at Melbourne's Monash University.</p><p> About a quarter of global electricity networks are exposed to severe storms, and more than 10 per cent are exposed to tropical cyclones, particularly in North America, Australia and East Asia, the IEA says.</p><p> In January 2005, when storm Gudrun hit Sweden, outages in rural areas lasted up to 20 days because of damaged distribution lines, while those in urban areas with underground cabling lasted only a few hours, the IEA report said. </p><p>Swedish network operators lost around EUR250 million (S$365 million). But the broader losses to ordinary people and businesses due to the interruptions were estimated at EUR3 billion.  </p><p> Nearly half of global power networks are also exposed to fire weather conditions for more than 50 days a year -- and close to 18 per cent of the global electricity network sees more than 200 fire weather days annually, the IEA said. Australia, California and southern Europe are especially vulnerable.</p><p> Grid expectationsDespite the risks, investment in green power is charging ahead. </p><p> The United Nations COP28 climate conference in Dubai in December 2023 set the world a great green goal. Nearly 200 nations backed a target to triple the global renewable energy capacity by 2030.</p><p> Wiring up all this additional green power is going to require a lot of poles and wires. </p><p> The IEA said the world's electricity use needs to grow 20 per cent faster in the next decade than it did in the previous one to meet national climate goals. This means adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km of national grids by 2040, the equivalent of the entire existing global grid. </p><p> Rystad Energy, in a research note on Feb 15, 2024, said US$3.1 trillion of grid infrastructure investments is needed before 2030 if the world is to limit global warming to 1.8 deg C above pre-industrial levels. Under this scenario, an additional 18 million km of grid network would be needed to keep up with the growing electrification under way across cities and countries as economies expand, including new renewable energy capacity and the rapid adoption of electric vehicles and more electrical appliances. </p><p> Asia is set to contribute more than half of the global additions this decade, with China and India leading the way as the world's largest and third-largest power consumers, Rystad said. \"We predict global grid investments will reach US$374 billion this year, with China accounting for about 30 per cent of the total.\" </p><p> China is leading the world with record additions of solar and wind energy capacity and has been building long-distance transmission lines to bring that power to the heavily populated coastal hinterland. It added just over 38,000 km in each of the past two years -- that's nearly twice the distance around the planet at the Equator. </p><p> But worsening storms and floods present a growing challenge, especially at the local level. Record flooding in Zhengzhou in Henan province in July 2021 knocked out power and communications for days to the worst-hit parts of the city of 13 million people. </p><p> China has invested heavily in research and development of its grid, boosting interconnections and strengthening weather forecasting, among other key steps. </p><p> \"Electricity reliability is highly prioritised by China's government,\" said Beijing-based Ms Yujing Liu, principal, China power decarbonisation, for the Rocky Mountain Institute, a US think-tank. </p><p> But she added that more needs to be done to strengthen the much larger distribution grid at the local level, where development and investment are lacking. </p><p> In Europe, grid operators and European Union regulators are increasingly focused on climate-proofing the transmission network. The Renewables Grid Initiative (RGI), a collaboration of non-governmental organisations and European transmission system operators, is helping to promote a greener and resilient grid. </p><p> \"Over the long term, electricity grid infrastructure resilience measures can not only increase security of supply and reduce overall operation and maintenance costs, but also further contribute to climate change mitigation as the electricity grid integrates more renewable energy,\" said Dr Andrzej Ceglarz, RGI's director of energy systems. </p><p> Costs, though, remain a concern for grid operators, he said. </p><p> The EU's Trans-European Network for Energy Regulation sets out rules for cross-border energy infrastructure and promotes the integration of renewables. It also explicitly promotes the need for climate adaptation measures, which will increase the grid's resilience, Dr Ceglarz said.</p><p> For green energy investors and asset managers, a climate-proof grid is essential. Macquarie Asset Management, a major global renewable energy investor, says companies in its portfolio, including utilities, have been strengthening their networks, including using sensors, drones and geospatial technologies to anticipate and manage extreme weather events. </p><p> SolutionsOne key solution is burying power cables underground. Tokyo is doing this as part of its climate adaptation plan. </p><p>Singapore has gone one step further and built a cross-island network of transmission cable tunnels 60m below ground. Completed in 2019, the 40km network not only protects high-voltage power lines, but also makes it easier to repair and replace them. </p><p> In Finland, Elenia, the nation's second-largest power grid operator, has a long-term programme to put 90 per cent of its electricity network underground by 2036. By the end of 2023, nearly two-thirds of its 76,600km network had been buried. </p><p> This solution is generally more expensive and is not foolproof -- underground cables are vulnerable to heatwaves and construction accidents from road, telecoms and building construction. But burying power lines generally boosts reliability and reduces downtime. </p><p> Other steps include designing stronger transmission towers, more frequent visual inspections of power lines, especially those vulnerable to wildfires, and regular pruning of trees and branches as well as grass in fire-prone areas. </p><p> Traditional power lines carrying two to four wires are also vulnerable to high winds as the wires can touch each other, causing sparks. One solution is highly insulated cables that bundle the power cables tightly. </p><p> Building in redundancy is another way to reduce outages. Increasing interconnections between different parts of the grid gives operators greater chances to reroute power during emergencies. </p><p> There's another solution that means no grid connection at all: distributed renewable energy. </p><p> Power to the peopleThese are mini-grids, in which a community's electricity is generated locally from solar, wind or pumped hydro and is supported by battery storage. It's a solution for rich and poor nations alike, such as remote towns or remote islands -- or places that have never been connected to the grid. </p><p> Some Indonesian islands are shifting away from diesel-powered generation to renewable energy mini-grids, for example. </p><p> \"One of the real advantages of having a big investment in distributed energy, or community energy, is you don't really need to build these massive transmission lines,\" said Mr Hamilton. </p><p> One example is Yackandandah, a town of 2,000 people in north-east Victoria, which is close to achieving 100 per cent renewable energy generation from rooftop solar and community batteries. The project has been in development for several years and is widely supported by the community and the state government. </p><p> And it is just one of a growing number of similar projects in Australia in which communities are going green, cutting their power bills and aiming to be self-reliant for electricity. Distributed energy systems have the potential to reduce or avoid significant power network and generation costs in the years ahead, some experts say. </p><p> Missing linkFor now, though, grids will be needed to channel the energy from the many large solar, wind and battery projects being built or planned globally. These investments are a key part of cutting reliance on polluting fossil fuels that are driving climate change. </p><p> But for that to work, grids of the future must remain reliable and resilient and cope with everything that climate change can throw at them. </p><p> There's still a lot of work to do, says the IEA. </p><p> Governments need to prioritise grid investment and national adaptation strategies need to include clear action plans to strengthen the power transmission network. Weak grids will only hold back the global fight against climate change and prove very costly down the line. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Electricity transmission towers in the Gobi desert in Yinchuan, in China's northern Ningxia region.

Several northern Chinese cities, including Beijing and Tianjin, recorded historic high temperatures of over 40 deg C while the national weather bureau began issuing hot weather warnings in mid-June, two weeks sooner than usual. </p><p> Meanwhile, deadly rains in Beijing and the surrounding region over the past five days have resulted in at least 20 deaths, and hundreds of thousands of residents displaced. </p><p> Brought on by Typhoon Doksuri, the constant downpour was the heaviest in the city in 140 years since records began, said Beijing's weather service on Wednesday. </p><p> For a country used to natural disasters, having to deal with changing weather patterns has meant a shift by policymakers to focus more on areas such as food security, climate resilience and energy security. </p><p> For residents, this has resulted in a small but growing group who are trying to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle. </p><p> Increasingly popular are \"low-carbon weekend activities\", which generally involve bike rides or group workouts in the park. </p><p> Across the country, corporations are jumping on the bandwagon. Apps like Alipay, WeChat Pay and Baidu Maps have functions that gamify carbon offsets, rewarding users for walking a certain number of steps daily, while most coffee shops offer a small discount to customers who bring their own cups. </p><p> But in a country where conspicuous consumption is a way of life, being climate-conscious still has some way to go. </p><p> Housewife Miao Wenping, 36, said she uses plastics for convenience, despite understanding the harm they do to the environment. </p><p> \"There's plastic in everything these days, especially in takeaway food, but until they completely ban the use of plastic in this country, it's not really going to make a difference,\" she said. </p><p> Those working in the climate space agree that the gap between environmental consciousness and action needs to be bridged.</p><p> \"There was a tipping point about 10 years ago where people started becoming aware of air pollution and air quality issues, and this was very ground up,\" said senior policy adviser for Greenpeace East Asia Li Shuo. </p><p> It made the government crack down on polluting industries and brought the conversation about air quality into the mainstream.</p><p> \"So the big question is whether awareness about the climate is going to come from the ground up, or top down.\" </p><p> Beijing has ambitious climate goals, vowing to peak carbon emissions by 2030.</p><p> But there is pushback from within the country, insisting that as a developing country, China should be allowed to emit as much carbon as necessary to catch up economically.</p><p> For Ethan, seeing first-hand the impact on earth has made him more determined to spread the message of climate protection. </p><p> \"I'm not sure how much of an impact one person can make, but if I get my friends to join in and be more eco-friendly, maybe we can help to save Planet Earth,\" he said. </p><p> \"Our teachers have told us not to listen to fearmongers, but I'm scared one day it'll be too hot for us to go out.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1B3H9UV</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68VG-THR1-JCF2-854V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-08-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"590\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Recent estimates suggest that US$175 billion to US$459 billion in funding is needed per year for a sustainable ocean. </p><p> While the public sector and donor communities have been playing a critical role in preserving the ocean, there is still much work to do, given the pace and scale of declining ocean health, and private sector capital can play a catalytic role in addressing the funding gap. </p><p> Accelerating ocean actions around the worldLeaders around the world increasingly recognise our dependence and impact on the ocean. Oceans are one of the four key nature realms of the Taskforce on Nature-Related Financial Disclosures framework, established to factor nature into financial and business decisions. </p><p> We see global calls for renewed vigour in ocean protection via various initiatives, including the Ocean Action in 2023 statement, the creation of a Universal Declaration of Ocean Rights and the Global Plastics Treaty, which aims to end plastic pollution. </p><p> At the recent COP28 with the largest ocean pavilion to date, key positive commitments around sustainable oceans included the Joint Declaration on Ocean and Climate Action, which urges countries to consider ocean-based actions in their national climate goals and sustainably manage 100 per cent of the ocean under national jurisdictions. </p><p> This declaration complements the world's first \"Treaty of the High Seas\" signed by 84 countries as at Dec 18. This is a significant step towards protecting the high seas, which encompasses two-thirds of the world's oceans, and addresses the issue that only about 1 per cent has been under any protection protocol so far. </p><p> There were more than 50 announcements towards decarbonising shipping under the Green Shipping Challenge. At the COP28 Singapore Pavilion, there was a signing of a memorandum of understanding between Pacific International Lines and DP World to jointly develop initiatives to decarbonise their shipments' footprint, aligning with the Maritime Singapore Green Initiative. </p><p> Moreover, 21 countries formally endorsed the Mangrove Breakthrough to protect and restore 15 million ha of mangroves globally by 2030. The International Blue Carbon Institute, launched in Singapore in 2022, aims to protect and scale the blue carbon ecosystems, including mangroves, seagrasses, kelp and tidal marshes. </p><p> In Singapore, numerous steps have also been taken to strengthen its marine and coastal protection and blue economy alongside its Green Plan 2030, focusing on areas from harnessing ocean renewable energy, decarbonising the maritime industry and fostering a circular economy, to rejuvenating coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass. </p><p> An ocean of opportunities  for investors The blue economy continues to expand, buoyed by the above myriad of enabling factors. </p><p> Investors can consider taking a holistic approach by: </p><p> Investors can find opportunities in diverse sectors within the blue economy, ranging from transport, fisheries, aquaculture, energy, biotechnology, tourism, ecosystem management, waste and water management to the circular economy. An example of a scaleable marine renewable energy solution is the 5MW-peak system floating solar farm installation in Singapore, one of the world's largest, which can offset over 4,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year. </p><p> There is a variety of financial strategies in both the public and private markets to enable investors to support the blue economy, such as thematic ocean indexes or funds, blue bonds, ocean impact investment funds, direct private investments and blended finance vehicles. </p><p> Interconnectedness of ocean solutions and sustainable development goalsInvesting in the blue economy is more relevant than ever before, and it opens up new opportunities for the broader sustainability agenda. Research by the Ocean Panel indicates that US$1 invested in key ocean actions can yield at least US$5 in global benefits over the next 30 years.</p><p> We believe blue investments can enable investors to mitigate material risks and seek competitive risk-adjusted returns alongside positive sustainability objectives, from enhancing climate resilience, improving food security, advancing equality and spurring economic growth, to providing good health and well-being. </p><p> For example, investments into sustainable aquaculture can contribute to multiple sustainable development areas. This not only helps to tackle overfishing and protect ocean habitats and species by transforming the industry, but also supports food security and provides employment and livelihoods, which have follow-on contributions to end poverty and reduce inequalities. </p><p> Artificial intelligence-driven models that estimate the productivity of aqua farms can also enable financial inclusion as banks are able to use the data to identify higher-quality small fisheries, which previously had no access to credit or formal financial history. </p><p> There is an acceleration of global demand and industrialisation of seaweed due to its potential as a good source of food and nutrients, as an ingredient used for plant-based shrimp, for instance, as well as for biofuel and as cattle feed for methane reduction. </p><p> Research shows that the global seaweed cultivation market is worth around US$17 billion and is estimated to nearly double by 2025. Asia is the largest seaweed production region, accounting for about 97 per cent of global production in 2019. </p><p> The oceans have been under-researched and there is an urgent need to unlock ocean data via emerging real-time ocean data monitoring systems, which can benefit a wide range of stakeholders. </p><p> These new technologies can enable scientists to better understand ocean conditions and protect endangered species, allow governments to monitor fisheries and adherence to regulations, and equip meteorologists to better predict and prepare for extreme weather events. </p><p> Our ocean health has reached a tipping point. Let's turn the tide and put our capital and resources at work in a sustainable ocean, which generates myriad business opportunities with the ripple effect not just on profits, but also on our planet and people. </p><p> The writer is Citi Global Wealth's sustainable investing specialist for the Asia-Pacific.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Investors can find opportunities in diverse sectors within the blue economy, says the writer.

Key strategic measures to build a low carbon economy included quadrupling solar energy production by 2025; phasing out internal combustion engine vehicles by 2040; actively investing in low-carbon solutions; and promoting green financing through a US$2 billion Green Investments Programme.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The climate matter is of utmost importance not least because Singapore is heating up twice as fast as the rest of the world - at 0.25 degrees Celsius per decade - according to the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS). Projections by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore suggest that the city-state could experience an increase in daily mean temperature of 1.4C to 4.6C towards the end of this century.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate researchers have attributed Singapore's rising temperatures to both global warming and the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. Asphalt and concrete from urban development have replaced greenery and waterways, trapping more heat. The UHI effect (Singapore's Central Region has the highest mean UHI intensity according to research) increases energy costs due to a higher usage of air conditioning which in turn contributes to air pollution triggered by increased electricity consumption.</p><p>The UHI phenomenon reduces thermal comfort and discourages people from walking or cycling. Besides heat-related illnesses, other climate-related concerns include flash floods and sea level rise. As a low-lying coastal island, Singapore's mean sea level rise is estimated to be up to one metre by 2100. MSS data suggests that the average sea level around the island today is 14cm above pre-1970 levels. In view of these challenges, \"good\" climate education plays an important role in imparting climate resilience into our youth. At SMU, all undergraduates get some exposure to sustainability issues in the course of their university education, particularly via compulsory core curriculum courses such as Big Questions and Ethics &amp; Social Responsibility, various sustainability-related course initiatives (eg SMU's Lee Kong Chian School of Business offers a second major in Sustainability) and projects with industry.</p><p>Vision-driven learning outcomes in our own courses on communication, information systems and smart city management include effective climate change communication so that students understand climate change risks (and act on climate change); prototyping mobile applications (Apps) to calculate (and reduce) one's carbon footprint or food/water wastage in line with the 5Rs methodology (refuse, reduce, reuse, repurpose, recycle); and designing (executing) appropriate responses to protect oneself from negative climate change consequences.</p><p>Through guided educational trips to one of Singapore's waste-to-energy plants (with their huge waste storage bunkers), students also see for themselves how the incineration process works with real time exposure to national waste management issues such as the plastic pollution crisis. Without actionable climate literacy, climate change risk perceptions will remain low, and pro-environmental behaviours of students will run into the void.</p><p>MORAL PERSUASION DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK</p><p>While our youths are generally very obliging and eager to participate in actionable assignments such as measuring the total amount of greenhouse gases that are generated by their actions or explaining the role of carbon pricing in sustaining a green environment, translating concrete offsetting ideas - such as planting trees or mangroves - into reality is tough. Moral persuasion does not always work. Some of the barriers we have come across include competing priorities such as GPA concerns, no real acknowledgement that the climate catastrophe is indeed \"real\" (it seems inconceivable that the perennial Arctic ice cap has shrunk by more than a million square miles over the past half century), strong system trust in the ability of the government to take care of combatting urban warming, and lack of deep knowledge of local climate impacts and solutions.</p><p>Key climate change messages about the risk of global warming (even those formulated by expert panels) don't always work as intended for a number of reasons: one, humans suffer from confirmation bias, which is the tendency to seek out and interpret information in a way that confirms our pre-existing opinions, values and beliefs - it is one of the strongest biases we hold. Conversely, we have a tendency to disregard or ignore information that contradicts or challenges our opinions, values and beliefs. Another challenge is that our mental models have narrow temporal boundaries and focus on the short term. This short-term focus leads to judgment errors and biases in situations where the consequences of our actions span swathes of space and time.</p><p>What then can be done to enable Singapore's youths to better understand what lies ahead in an era of climate change, appreciate the limits of growth, and effect constructive change? Nudging them towards more eco-friendly behavioural habits (using fans rather than air-con; walking rather than driving; composting organic waste; harvesting of rainwater; reducing consumption; decreasing social media consumption etc) is arguably a feasible approach to build greater climate resilience.</p><p>Since Thaler and Sunstein's 2008 publication of \"Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness\", there has been great interest across public policy domains in what drives the behaviour and decision-making logic of individuals and groups. Instead of traditional compliance methods such as education, legislation or enforcement, nudging puts emphasis on reinforcement and indirect suggestions as influence strategies.</p><p>According to Thaler and Sunstein, a nudge is \"any aspect of the choice architecture that alters people's behaviour in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives\". Examples of nudges are the deterrent disease pictures on cigarette packs encouraging smokers to reduce cigarette consumption through emotional responses or the rumble strip on highways that let drivers know if they are drifting out of the lane.</p><p>In the context of urban climate change mitigation, nudging can be used to become carbon-neutral in support of sustainability and liveability goals. For example, commuters can be influenced to modify transport-related choices aimed at minimising carbon emissions and congestion through personalised \"active\" push notifications that nudge them to optimise personal (green) routes without getting stuck in traffic.</p><p>To be sustainable, successful climate education must be embedded into science-based, experiential teaching and learning approaches on site. Two useful preparatory resources are Al Gore's documentary film An Inconvenient Truth (2006) and the author videos featuring Dennis Meadows (emeritus professor of systems policy and social science research at the University of New Hampshire), co-author of the 1972 book \"The Limits to Growth\" with his concerns for the declining availability of energy, rising disruptions from climate change, falling agricultural yields from loss of arable land, growing costs of environmental services such as breathable air and survivable temperatures.</p><p>Relevant local sites for nudge-related excursions include the redeveloped Kallang Bishan waterway which transformed a concrete 2.7kilometre canal (Kallang River) into a 3km sinuous, natural river, with bio-engineered river edges using various plants and bedding materials; Cambridge Road Estate, a low lying site with a historical record of flooding and limited capacity to increase drain size any further (where several stakeholders including government bodies, citizens and design firms collaborate to build community resilience and blue-green infrastructure); Pulau Ubin's Chek Jawa Wetlands with its six natural habitats (sandy beach, rocky beach, seagrass lagoon, coral rubble, mangroves and coastal forest) and sea-based fish farms.</p><p>A weekend stay on a kelong to study the impact of shifting climatic patterns on traditional fish farming (the increase in water temperature can lead to more bacteria, viruses and microbiomes) combined with a boat trip to the new AI-powered Singapore Aquaculture Technologies' (SAT) smart fish farm (Aquaculture 4.0) or an excursion to Lazarus Island to see how its man-made sea walls with its \"rescued corals\" can reduce the loss of marine biodiversity, seem like attractive climate education and learning approaches. However, the empirical evidence base to come up with the \"right\" behavioural (nudging) interventions during such site visits is still very weak.</p><p>CLIMATE CATASTROPHE</p><p>Other nudging-related challenges faced by climate stakeholders include ethical implications (eg \"unacceptable paternalism\") and a lack of understanding of how to design effective technology-mediated nudges. With regard to digital commitment nudges towards more eco-friendly behaviour (an interesting example is Powerbar developed by Stanford ChangeLabs whose unique behaviour-changing interface design is aimed at reducing residential energy consumption), there is a need to skillfully manage the iterative behavioural design processes and systems testing for optimal behaviour-change purposes. While specialised behavioural design consulting firms and behavioural insights teams (= nudge units) will have the required competencies to alter people's behaviour in predictable ways, an open question is: to what extent do \"non-tech\" university instructors command such specialised competencies'</p><p>In view of the climate catastrophe (a \"hard problem\" which requires sacrifices now to reap benefits later, according to Professor Meadows), climate-related skills upgrading measures with an emphasis on earth science, climatology, behavioural science-informed technology interventions (nudging), human-centric design, systems thinking-inspired games relevant to climate-change communication, public-private-people partnership (4P) approaches, citizen science, volunteer conservation action etc are indispensable if we want to effectively support our youth in adapting to life in a changing climate and to engineer a new sustainable system.</p><p>The writers are from Singapore Management University (SMU).<br/>Thomas Menkhoff is professor of Organisational Behaviour and Human Resources (Education), Lee Kong Chian School of Business; Mark Chong is associate professor of Communication Management (Practice), at the School.

She expressed Singapore's commitment to support the LDCs' progress towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and called on the international community to support the LDCs in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals by: (a) supporting climate resilience; (b) closing the financing gap; (c) accelerating digital transformation; and (d) strengthening global partnerships. She also shared about Singapore's partnership with fellow developing countries to enhance capacity building under the Singapore Cooperation Programme. The transcript of SMS Sim's speech is appended.</p><p>National Statement by Senior Minister of State For Foreign Affairs and National Development of Singapore Sim Ann at the Second Part of the Fifth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries</p><p>Mr President, Excellencies,</p><p>1. Let me first convey Singapore's appreciation to the Government of Qatar and the United Nations for organising this important meeting.</p><p>2. When we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in 2015, we made the fundamental commitment to \"leave no one behind\". We have now reached the critical mid-point of our journey. There is great urgency to reaffirm this core commitment and step up our efforts to address the needs and priorities of the Least Developed Countries (LDCs).</p><p>3. In May last year, the UN Secretary-General warned that the \"very viability of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030\" is at risk. The LDCs are among those facing the greatest difficulties. They have been disproportionately impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical tensions, and the triple planetary crisis of climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss.</p><p>4. But there are also opportunities to \"rescue\" the SDGs as highlighted by the Secretary-General. This Conference is one such opportunity. We need to fulfil our commitment to the LDCs through concrete and collective action. Allow me to highlight four areas where we should focus our efforts: First, supporting climate resilience. The LDCs are the least responsible for climate change but are among the hardest hit. To help the LDCs build long-term resilience against the impact of climate change, we need to significantly scale up technical and financial support from the international community. In this regard, we strongly support the target of allocating 50 percent of climate financing to climate adaptation.</p><p>5. Second, closing the financing gap. Widening fiscal deficits and increased debt burden are hampering the ability of LDCs to eradicate poverty, respond to external shocks, invest in their people, and build inclusive societies. We must reform the global financial architecture to provide the scale and reliability of financing required to achieve the SDGs.</p><p>6. Third, accelerating digital transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the use of digital technology worldwide, but it has also laid bare the huge digital divide among and within countries. Only 25 percent of people in the LDCs use the Internet, compared to 80 percent in advanced economies. If we are serious about closing the digital divide, we will need to step up efforts to promote universal connectivity, enhance digital skills and training, and invest in digital infrastructure.</p><p>7. Fourth, strengthening global partnerships. Our experience with COVID-19 has shown that multilateral cooperation is the best way forward. Singapore strongly supports the Doha Programme of Action's call for a renewed and strengthened global partnership with South-South cooperation as an important pillar. Since 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme or SCP has been our platform for technical cooperation with developing countries. It originated as a way for Singapore to share our development experience and pay forward the assistance that we had received during our formative years. We have cooperated with UN agencies to deliver programmes in the Asia-Pacific and Africa. Our Third Country partnerships, including those with Chile, Japan, Qatar, Thailand, Trkiye, and the US, have facilitated North-South and South-South Cooperation. To date, we have welcomed close to 150,000 government officials as part of our SCP programmes, with more than 40 percent from the LDCs. This year, we will launch a three-year Sustainability Action Package to support capacity-building for all developing countries, focusing on resilience building strategies, green project management and financing, as well as carbon market development. We will continue to work with our partners to pool resources and expertise to better meet the needs of LDCs.</p><p>Excellencies,</p><p>8. As a global community, we must not leave anyone behind in our collective journey towards the SDGs. In line with the theme of this conference, \"From Potential to Prosperity\", let us work together to support the LDCs to realise their vast potential and achieve a prosperous future.</p><p>9. Thank you.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0060345552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67PW-6061-DXMP-K1HK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"971\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 6, 2023 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>N928120MM</classCode><className>STATE DEPARTMENTS &amp;

Santa has hit turbulence.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> So it must seem to many market watchers that the much-anticipated year-end Santa Claus rally hit a bit of tumult last week as market conviction about a Federal Reserve rate-hike pause weakened somewhat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial index ended the week flat at 36,247.87, while the broader S&amp;P 500 rose barely 0.2 per cent last week to its Dec 8 close at 4,604.37 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 0.7 per cent to 14,403.97 points as enthusiasm for artificial intelligence and tech-driven plays remained intact, though somewhat subdued.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> That said, all three major indexes were up by over 4.3 per cent for the week, giving Wall Street its longest weekly winning streak in almost three years.</p><p> In Singapore, the Straits Times Index edged up 0.7 per cent for the week to 3,110.73 points, though lacklustre volumes suggested that interest in local stocks remains subdued. With valuations looking compelling -- stocks are trading at under 12 times earnings, average 0.8 times book value, and offering a forward dividend yield of 5 per cent -- there is increasing concern within market circles about the need to resuscitate the moribund local bourse. </p><p> No one has an answer, though. Perhaps Singapore-based funds should be compelled to invest a portion of their monies in the local market? </p><p> The big market-moving news of the past week was the November US jobs data that showed unemployment falling to 3.7 per cent. This came just days ahead of the Fed's rate-setting meeting this week. The closely watched 10-year Treasury yield edged up slightly to 4.24 per cent by the close on Dec 8.</p><p> While some fear that the tightening jobs market could prompt the Fed to rethink the pace of monetary easing, many economists also welcomed it as a sign that the US economy remained robust, with no imminent signs of a recession.</p><p> As we get into the final three weeks of the year, all eyes (and ears) will be on the messages coming out of the United States, and, in particular, the Fed.</p><p> Many economists expect that with inflation pulling back from around 9 per cent in 2022 to about 3 per cent now, the US central bank will cut rates in 2024. But by how much'</p><p> More optimistic market experts, like ING's chief international economist James Knightley, reckon the Fed could make as many as six 25-basis-point rate cuts next year, adding up to 150 basis points. He also expects the interest rate cuts to extend into 2025 with at least four 25-basis-point interest rate cuts.</p><p> If so, the Fed funds rate would fall to below 4 per cent by the end of 2024, from the 5.25 per cent to 5.5 per cent range now, and to below 3 per cent by the end of 2025. This could have huge implications for equity and bond markets, given that there is over US$6 trillion (S$8 trillion) in funds currently earning risk-free returns in money markets deposits. These funds would seek out higher returns if interest rates start falling.</p><p> Mr Thilan Wickramasinghe, regional head of research at Maybank Securities, reckons the market will take a big bet against the Fed. </p><p> \"The fall in treasury yields is already pricing in five interest rate cuts for next year, with the first starting as early as March,\" he noted. \"Inflation is nowhere near the Fed's target range of 2 per cent. Plus, there is nothing in its recent communications to hint that it will deviate from this target. While the momentum created by peak interest rate optimism can continue for a while, we would keep a close eye on stretched equity valuations.\"</p><p> In short, while the optimism about rate cuts and falling inflation is justified, don't get carried away. </p><p> Going into 2024, a great deal also hinges on key commodity price movements, the health of the global economy and how geopolitics plays out. That said, this could be an opportune time to start thinking of building up portfolios for 2024 and beyond.</p><p> In its 2024 Global Outlook report released last week, US financial giant BlackRock advised investors to go beyond traditional building blocks and transcend traditional asset classes. It called for focus on \"mega forces\" such as digital disruption, the growth of artificial intelligence, the future of finance, the impact of ageing populations and the push towards climate resilience.</p><p> \"Mega forces are key drivers of the new regime, affecting the long-term growth and inflation outlook and creating shifts in profitability. We see them as a source of return now and far into the future,\" said the report prepared by its research unit, BlackRock Investment Institute.</p><p> In its recent market outlook pronouncements, Morgan Stanley said that as the Fed moves to pivot in 2024, high-quality bonds would outperform, the US dollar would remain strong during the first half, US equities would ride higher and commodities -- especially oil -- would likely remain range bound next year. It is advising clients to buy US Treasuries and investment-grade corporate bonds, and selectively add equities.</p><p> Within the Asia-Pacific ex-Japan, Morgan Stanley prefers Singapore, India, Mexico, Greece and Poland, while downgrading South Korea and the Middle East. </p><p> \"In Asia, we expect a recovery in semiconductors and also prefer energy and nearshoring-exposed industrials,\" Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson and team noted. \"We like financials in Japan, Singapore, India and Indonesia.\"</p><p> The best strategy would be to get back into the market gradually over the coming months, rather than try to punt or time the market. Diversification across asset classes is also important. But given the potential volatility and \"unknown unknowns\" (borrowing the words of former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld), active portfolio management is required.</p><p> In recent weeks, several banks, brokerages and investment houses have been offering advice on their Singapore stock picks for the year ahead. </p><p> Some of the names that have been repeated across some of these reports are CapitaLand Investment, ComfortDelGro, Singtel, the Singapore banks, Sembcorp Industries, Keppel Corp, Genting Singapore, Mapletree Industrial Trust, Raffles Medical, ST Engineering, Seatrium, Venture, Sats, CDL Hospitality Trusts, Far East Hospitality Trust, Food Empire, Frencken Group and Valuetronics Holdings. Another company worth watching is LHN, which will transfer from Catalist to the mainboard on Dec 13, a move which could potentially attract institutional interest.</p><p> The two biggest market-moving events of this week will be the November inflation numbers on Dec 12, with consensus at 3.1 per cent, down from October's 3.2 per cent. </p><p> On Dec 13, the Fed will meet for its December rate-setting meeting, with the market expecting it to keep its key rates unchanged for the third consecutive gathering. </p><p> Other data of interest will be US jobless claims, retail sales and manufacturing output.</p><p> Despite potential volatility, the market uptrend seems intact.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A now-hiring sign in front of a Pet Food Express store in San Anselmo, California.

So, we don't have time for anything that needs a long engagement [or] takes a long time because we are looking to service our clients immediately.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new platform by the New York Stock Exchange-listed index provider aims to contribute more meaningfully to sustainability research. In September, MSCI launched the MSCI Sustainability Institute, focusing on the role of capital markets in creating sustainable value and tackling global challenges like climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to MSCI, the institute will provide academic researchers and policymakers access to sustainability data, metrics and models that investors use to make decisions. It plans to collaborate with select academic institutions, including Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, to host training designed to help researchers and students.</p><p>MSCI charges its commercial clients \"a lot of money\" to access its data, which Fernadez proudly calls his \"intellectual property\". However, most researchers outside of the investing sector \"don't have the resources or the money to pay for that\", he adds. \"So, why don't we make it available to them under a contract, but either free of charge or at a very low fee, so that they can help the industry do research?\"</p><p>Advancing the clean energy transition and addressing long-term risks demands that leaders across the capital markets ecosystem work together, says MSCI. Speaking to The Edge Singapore, Fernandez says an example of relevant research is modelling asset allocation based on climate risk. \"A big part of asset allocation and climate risk is at what speed do you do [it] when de-risking? If you go too fast, you underperform and get in trouble. If you go too slow, you underperform and get in trouble. So, what should be the ultimate pace of de-risking your portfolio from climate risk?\"</p><p>The institute will also encourage capital market participants to pilot new data and approaches for measurement that provide insights on emerging topics in sustainable finance and inform capital allocation decisions, says MSCI.</p><p>This includes a framework for investment in climate resilience developed by the New York-based Global Adaptation and Resilience Investment Working Group (GARI), with analytical backing from the institute and financial support from the Bezos Earth Fund and ClimateWorks Foundation. In addition, the institute will curate a selection of academic studies investigating how sustainability factors interact with the value of financial assets.</p><p>Finally, the institute aims to offer a forum for debate, says MSCI, by bringing together leaders from across the capital markets ecosystem to exchange viewpoints on sustainability risks and opportunities. These are presented as articles on the institute's website.</p><p>With the launch, MSCI aims to expand the \"universe of tools available\" to reduce the climate risk of the world's portfolios, says Fernandez. \"If we do that effectively, the world will move faster [and] more assets will get decarbonised.\"</p><p>He also invites policymakers to the platform. \"What is the optimal role of policymakers versus the private sector? If policymakers dictate what to do in the private sector, it will be a problem. But if they don't help create the rules, that will be a problem, too. So, what is the right sort of combination of that?\"</p><p>Institute leaders</p><p>The institute is led by head and founding director Linda-Eling Lee, who most recently led global ESG and climate research at MSCI.</p><p>By design, the institute and MSCI ESG Research complement each other, says a spokesperson to The Edge Singapore. \"Both advance our firm's thought leadership on climate and ESG  MSCI ESG Research delivers insights designed to help investors inform and analyse asset allocation and portfolio construction decisions.\"</p><p>MSCI has appointed two heads of research to replace Lee - 13-year MSCI veteran Laura Nishikawa, now head of ESG research, and Oliver Marchand, former CEO and co-founder of Carbon Delta, as head of climate research. MSCI acquired the Zurich-based climate change scenario analytics firm in 2019.</p><p>Hiromichi Mizuno, who joined MSCI in August as a special adviser to the CEO, will advise the MSCI Sustainability Institute. He will help build the institute's advisory group, including leading investors, academics and other thought leaders.</p><p>From 2015 to 2020, Mizuno served as the executive managing director and chief investment officer of the Government Pension Investment Fund of Japan, the largest pension fund in the world, with approximately US$1.4 trillion ($1.88 trillion) in assets under management. Mizuno was also a special envoy of the UN Secretary-General on innovative finance and sustainable investments and director of the Tesla board.</p><p>Meanwhile, Rumi Mahmood is the institute's research director for Europe, the Middle East and America (EMEA). Based in the UK, he directs the institute's research into capital markets and applied finance and oversees collaborations with academia. He was previously head of ESG and climate fund research for MSCI ESG Research.</p><p>Mahmood's counterpart in the US is Umar Ashfaq. Based in New York, he was previously a lead analyst for the transportation and logistics industries with MSCI ESG Research.</p><p>While the two research directors have specific remits to cover EMEA and the US, an MSCI spokesperson says the institute is keenly focused on Apac. \"Among the institute's inaugural initiatives is a collaboration with the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) on research that will simulate the early phase-out of coal-fired power in 15 markets across the Apac region.\"</p><p>The report, published on Nov 21 ahead of COP28, underscores that the region accounts for more than three-quarters (78%) of current global coal-power generation and virtually all (96%) of the planned expansion of coal-fired power plants globally.</p><p>These plants, if not decommissioned before the end of their useful lives, would add roughly 215 gigatons (Gt) of carbon emissions to the atmosphere between now and 2050 and consume more than 40% of the remaining global carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.</p><p>All is not lost. According to the report, the 15 Apac markets analysed can potentially cut their emissions by between 39% and 95% between now and 2050 if the managed phase-out is successful. Together, the 15 markets could reduce their aggregate carbon emissions by roughly 160 Gt, with Mainland China (116 Gt), India (23.2 Gt) and Indonesia (5.9 Gt) as the biggest beneficiaries.</p><p>MSCI anticipates that the collaboration with GFANZ will be \"the first in a series of collaborations\" focused on the Apac region. \"Linda recently returned from the region, where she attended the Principles for Responsible Investment's Academic Network Conference [in Tokyo on Oct 4-5], which the institute had the pleasure of sponsoring. Much of her time there centred on engaging with academics from the region to introduce the institute's work, which provides climate data and models used by investors to sustainability researchers without charge to help align analysis with action.\"</p><p>Global challenges such as climate change cannot be solved by governments, corporations, NGOs or multilateral organisations alone, says Fernandez. \"The most meaningful solutions all require some type of cross-sector collaboration. Through the MSCI Sustainability Institute, we will bring together a wide range of thinkers with complementary strengths and expertise and help them turn data-driven ideas into real-world influence and action.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69T2-9DW1-DYX1-V002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1291\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

On the last day of Ecosperity Week 2023, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and the financial industry announced they would establish the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA will initially focus on initiatives to scale voluntary carbon markets, transition finance and blended finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) is leading the coordination and set-up of the SSFA. According to MAS, the SSFA will include representatives from financial institutions, financial industry associations, relevant corporates and service providers, such as environmental, social and governance (ESG) rating agencies.</p><p>Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, also chairman of MAS, says he does not see carbon taxes \"coming in time\" to meet global net-zero targets. \"If we don't have carbon taxes rising to adequate levels globally, without lots of free-riders, [then] we need financial regulation as a major public policy tool, and we must use it. Otherwise, the markets will be too slow.\"</p><p>Many of our banks are taking a forward-looking view, says Tharman, but there is \"a lot of unevenness\". \"The leading banks and financial institutions have to be provided clear guidance, so none of them has to move ahead of the rest and feel [a] competitive disadvantage. That's why we need guidance across the board.\"</p><p>The government is exploring how to develop a new vehicle to catalyse blended finance in Asia by working with regional partners, says Tharman. This ranges from collaborating with government agencies to Singapore-based infrastructure financing vehicles like Clifford Capital and Pentagreen Capital, as well as commercial banks and multilateral development banks like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the World Bank, he adds.</p><p>Along with other government agencies, MAS says it is collaborating with industry players to explore platforms to channel blended finance at scale into transition and green infrastructure projects in the region. \"MAS aims to bring together patient, concessionary capital from philanthropies, multilateral development banks, development finance institutions and donor partners. This will help crowd more conventional infrastructure financiers, including banks and institutional investors.\" MAS says further details will be announced, \"when the plans are more developed\".</p><p>Compared to the jam-packed conferences of years past, this year's edition - which wrapped on June 8 - was a quieter affair, until the end. Tharman, who gave the keynote address at the inaugural Financing Asia's Transition (Fast) Conference - held as part of Ecosperity Week 2023 - announced his intention to quit politics after the close of the main event on June 8.</p><p>He will resign from the People's Action Party and step down from his ministerial posts on July 7, to run for president in the upcoming election.</p><p>Private sector and climate resilience</p><p>There are US$7 trillion ($9.4 trillion) worth of benefits on the table if private sectors invest in climate resilience by 2030, but at this moment, only 7% of investments are channelled into adaptation and resilience, says Lauren Sorkin, executive director of the Resilient Cities Network.</p><p>At the same time, more than half the world's emissions come from Asia. This makes the region a core part of the problem and the solution, says Isabel Chatterton of the International Finance Corporation (IFC).</p><p>Panellists at Ecosperity Week agree that public-private partnerships have a huge potential in tackling net zero but cite the same hurdles in realising such collaboration.</p><p>Those in the financial sector looking to fund nature-based climate solutions say such ventures are still too risky, as there needs to be a consistent, comparable metric to link physical climate with financial risk. While there have been successful examples of using nature-based solutions to solve climate issues in cities, the industry needs more concrete data points to prove a solid business case for investing, say experts.</p><p>While there is much interest in funding new green technologies, the bigger challenge is getting money to flow into emerging markets and then scaling those solutions, which require much more capital, says Temasek chief investment officer Rohit Sipahimalani. He believes it boils down to stable regulatory policies and frameworks that can mitigate risks and give investors the confidence that what is being done can be delivered.</p><p>But not all governments have been completely transparent or open to adopting nature-based climate solutions, says Zoe Knight, group head of the centre of sustainable finance at HSBC. She says there are still difficulties in ironing out frameworks without more transparency from policymakers on how they might want to implement resilience and adaptation through nature-based solutions and ecosystem services.</p><p>William McGoldrick, regional managing director for The Nature Conservancy's Asia-Pacific division, says there is a \"bias, or some sort of psychological barrier to even begin thinking [of] or taking it seriously\". The goal is incredibly difficult, \"like trying to fix a Rubik's cube\", Claire Perry O'Neill offers. The former UK Minister for Energy and Clean Growth adds that the world cannot wait for a perfect solution to achieve zero-carbon cities. Instead, all players must experiment very quickly with different models at small city levels, which will eventually cascade into the future, says O'Neill, the sustainability advisor for Singapore-headquartered climate-tech venture Terrascope.</p><p>Fellow panellist Wang Tianyi, the former chairman of China Everbright Environment Group, summarises the partnership between public and private sectors, describing it as \"a lasting marriage, not a short wedding ceremony\".</p><p>Jakarta's big move</p><p>Without major policy announcements this year, much of the buzz at the conference came from Indonesia's leaders who attended in person. President Joko Widodo was the conference's headliner, and his speech on June 7 started light-heartedly: \"I would like to take the opportunity to ask you: Who will win next year's Presidential election?\" The 61-year-old will end his second and final five-year term in 2024.</p><p>Around the time Joko leaves office, Indonesia hopes to complete the first phase of its new capital city Nusantara in East Kalimantan, Borneo. About three times the size of Singapore, the project was announced three years ago and is reportedly estimated to cost IDR466 trillion ($42 billion). Joko started the project in his second term. The pilot stage is due for completion in August 2024.</p><p>Indonesia's government has committed to finance 20% of the project but will need other investors to fund the balance. Japan's SoftBank pulled out of the project in March 2022. \"Your investment in Indonesia will continue to be safe and also the continuity of the Nusantara new capital city,\" says Joko. \"Everything will be fine, don't worry.\"</p><p>His 11-minute speech and a separate panel discussion between Nusantara project chairman Bambang Susantono and Bloomberg's Haslinda Amin were dedicated to showcasing the new capital city's investment potential.</p><p>Bambang says five countries are in a \"serious due diligence process\" to invest in Nusantara: South Korea, Japan, China, Germany and the United Arab Emirates. Joko announced in July 2022 that South Korea has agreed to pledge a total investment of US$6.37 billion.</p><p>A first look at the new capital city may be ready next August, but Nusantara will only be fully complete by 2045, and Indonesia aims to house 1.9 million residents there. Between now and then, governments, laws and even the constitution will be changed, says Haslinda. How can Indonesia ensure the project reaches completion?</p><p>Bambang replies: \"The owner of the city is the one that moved there. The city's owner is the one that [is] also doing a lot of business there.\" He adds that investors of all sizes, even micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, will be the city's owners. \"They will be the one[s] that guarantee the city's sustainability in the future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68FR-DGN1-DYX1-T007-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-06-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1417\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Welcome to the launch of the Singapore Pavilion at COP28 in Dubai.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every COP is more important than the previous one, simply because with each passing year the world is running out of time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* According to the latest IPCC report, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels, this is what is necessary to keep temperatures from rising above the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* But greenhouse gas emissions are still rising not falling.</p><p>* Average global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>The negotiations that take place at COP to foster new climate commitments are thus critically important. But it is out here - in Pavilions like these - where commitments are turned into action, where individual contributions coalesce into collective impact.</p><p>The Singapore Pavilion aims to serve as a platform for such collective action to catalyse climate solutions. Later today, Singapore will co-host with Bain &amp; Co the inaugural Climate Leaders' Assembly. We have convened leaders from the private and people sectors to brainstorm ideas and develop initiatives.</p><p>Singapore is committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. But our contribution to climate action is not just to remove the 0.1% of global greenhouse gas emissions that we account for. More importantly, it is to collaborate with partners from around the world to galvanise resources and incubate and scale solutions for climate action.</p><p>And Singapore is well placed to do this.</p><p>* As an aviation and maritime hub, Singapore can play a role in developing the infrastructure and networks for promoting cleaner fuels and decarbonisation.</p><p>* As an international financial centre, Singapore can help to mobilise the financing necessary to support Asia's transition towards a low-carbon future.</p><p>* As an urban metropolis, Singapore can be a test bed for innovative solutions ranging from measures to reduce urban heat to fortifying defences against rising sea levels.</p><p>The Pavilion's programme will span these three big themes: decarbonisation, finance, and resilience.</p><p>Let me start with decarbonisation. As a major air and sea transportation hub, Singapore can play a key role in regional and global efforts to reduce emissions in the international aviation and maritime sectors.</p><p>In aviation, Singapore is taking a comprehensive approach to reducing emissions - across airport, airline, and air traffic management activities.</p><p>* We are reviewing the policies and support required for the adoption and production of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) in Singapore.</p><p>* This includes exploring mechanisms to promote the offtake of SAF at Changi Airport.</p><p>* Greater use of SAF will contribute towards the International Civil Aviation Authority's goal to reduce emissions in international aviation by 5% by 2030 through use of cleaner energy.</p><p>In the maritime sector, Singapore is promoting various clean marine fuels for bunkering.</p><p>* We are doing this through pilot trials and demonstration projects for fuels like bio-LNG, methanol, and ammonia.</p><p>* The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has been collaborating with other international ports and partners such as shipping lines, fuel suppliers, and research institutes, to promote Green and Digital Shipping Corridors.</p><p>- These Corridors support the transition to zero- and near-zero-emission fuels by building up the necessary supply, infrastructure, and regulations.</p><p>- MPA currently has two active corridors, with the Port of Rotterdam as well as the Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach.</p><p>* We look forward to sharing some of our learnings from these initiatives later this week at this Pavilion.</p><p>Next, finance.</p><p>Some US$3 trillion of financing is needed each year for the Asia-Pacific region to reach net zero by 2050.</p><p>As a leading international financial centre, Singapore can play an important role in mobilising this capital. Our blueprint for doing this is the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan launched by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) in partnership with the financial industry. Its aim is to mobilise finance to catalyse Asia's net zero transition.</p><p>The effort will require much innovation and collaboration. In the coming days, you will hear of two financing mechanisms that can play a key role in supporting decarbonisation solutions, particularly those which are marginally bankable or uneconomical today.</p><p>The first is blended finance.</p><p>* Blended finance is about bringing together various partners from the public and private sectors to contribute in different and synergistic ways to make green and transition projects bankable.</p><p>* Concessionary capital, coupled with technical assistance and regulatory certainty, can help to reduce risks and crowd-in multiples of commercial capital.</p><p>Second, carbon credits.</p><p>* Carbon credits generated from the verifiable reduction of emissions can improve the economic case for many transition projects.</p><p>* MAS has published a working paper with McKinsey that outlines how high-integrity carbon credits can be generated from future emissions reduction due to the early retirement of coal-generated power and replacement with cleaner energy sources.</p><p>* Such transition credits can potentially enable a broader market-driven financing mechanism and help to crowd-in private capital at scale.</p><p>We will be sharing concrete initiatives on scaling these financing mechanisms and announcing new partnerships to take them forward.</p><p>Finally, resilience.</p><p>With long coastlines and heavily populated low-lying areas, Southeast Asia is one of the world's most vulnerable regions to extreme weather and rising sea levels.</p><p>Singapore can play a useful role in pioneering and scaling urban solutions to build climate resilience. Let me highlight some examples.</p><p>To address rising temperatures, we have piloted the use of cool paint on flat facades to reduce the amount of heat they absorb in the day and emit at night. We are exploring the use of smart sensors to collect wind flow data for more robust environmental models which enables achieving cooler temperature with better ventilation.</p><p>To address sea-level rise and heavy rainfall, we are strengthening local capabilities and expertise.</p><p>* We have set up a Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institution (CFI) Singapore.</p><p>* This is a multi-institutional and inter-disciplinary research centre to advance domain knowledge as well as explore innovative solutions.</p><p>To address potential disruptions in food supplies due to climate change, we have taken steps to build a more sustainable and resilient agri-food system.</p><p>* For example, we have plans for a high-tech agri-food hub that can raise food production capacity to up to three times of current levels.</p><p>* This future hub will harness technology for efficient waste management and reduce water consumption by capturing rainwater for farming use.</p><p>In short, the Singapore Pavilion aims to foster active partnerships across businesses, research institutes, civil society, youth groups, and government agencies. It aims to connect across countries and sectors to drive change and create impact.</p><p>I invite you to be a part of this collaboration and wish you a fruitful experience at the Singapore Pavilion and at COP28.</p><p>Source: Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp;

V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].<br/><br/>2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.<br/><br/>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gas emission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.<br/><br/>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century<br/><br/>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.<br/><br/>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years, Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century.<br/><br/>Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier<br/><br/>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fall significantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every three years. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.<br/><br/>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise<br/><br/>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels.<br/><br/>Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change<br/><br/>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.<br/><br/>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient. Details of the Government's current climate adaptation efforts can be found in Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/latest-climate-projections-for-singapore-show-intensifying-urban-heat-and-more-wet-dry-extremes\">https://www.nea.gov.sg/media/news/news/index/latest-climate-projections-for-singapore-show-intensifying-urban-heat-and-more-wet-dry-extremes</url>).<br/><br/>11.MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.<br/><br/>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR) Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.<br/><br/>13. Government action alone will not be sufficient. Everyone - individuals, communities, and corporates - has a role to play to promote sustainability and mitigate climate change.

Pollution PodsTo help people safely experience the kind of air pollution in three of the world's most populous cities, a series of domes has been created to mimic the sight, feel, taste and smell of the air in Beijing, London and New Delhi. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The trio of Pollution Pods at COP28, created by British artist Michael Pinsky, contain a carefully mixed recipe that emulates the relative presence of ozone, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide and carbon monoxide that pollute these cities. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A fourth pod offers data on global air pollution and highlights some solutions to tackle the issue.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Air pollution in these cities comes from sources like the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, and from vehicle emissions.</p><p> Environmental organisation Clean Air Fund, which was behind the exhibit, said it hopes for more to be done on air pollution, to save lives and deliver other major benefits for public health and the climate. </p><p> 2. The Passage of Water To help people better understand and visualise the world's dwindling freshwater resources, this immersive exhibition brings to life the ways in which climate change has been impacting the earth's water cycle. </p><p> Done in collaboration with Google, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and Korean artist Yiyun Kang, the exhibition uses high-quality data from two of Nasa's satellites to showcase how droughts are causing Utah's Great Salt Lake to vanish, for example, and to illuminate China's parched Poyang Lake.</p><p> The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite, launched in 2002, tracks the movement of freshwater around the planet over the past two decades by monitoring changes in ice sheets, underground water storage and sea levels. And the Surface Water and Ocean Topography mission, launched in 2022, is conducting the first global survey of the earth's surface water.</p><p> Using the findings from the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change -- the United Nations' top climate science body -- the exhibition also showcases possible sustainable solutions to better manage water resources, such as desalination and rainwater harvesting.</p><p> 3. E-waste car Electronic waste is expected to reach a staggering 75 million tonnes globally by 2030, with less than 20 per cent being formally recycled. </p><p> This means the remaining 80 per cent will end up in landfills, contaminating soil and groundwater resources. </p><p> Envision Racing, a British team in the FIA Formula E electric car racing series, is showcasing a driveable race car made entirely from e-waste, such as phones, chargers, laptops, batteries and even single-use vapes, as part of its environmental responsibility campaign.</p><p> The race team recommends that people find different ways to clean up e-waste -- by repairing, donating, selling and recycling.</p><p> 4. Fossil of the Day Awards A staple of COP conferences is the daily Fossil of the Day awards, which call out countries with detrimental environmental policies. </p><p> Countries are given first-, second- and third-place awards by environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO) Climate Action Network for \"doing the most to achieve the least\" in terms of climate ambition. The pop-up awards ceremony was held daily from Dec 3 to 12. These were the first three \"winners\" of this dubious honour at COP28, given out on Dec 3:</p><p> 1st place: New Zealand  For announcing new plans to reopen the Aotearoa waters -- the sea around New Zealand -- for oil and gas exploration, New Zealand received first place for undermining a decade-long battle by indigenous people to keep these marine waters free from such endeavours. </p><p> \"New Zealand had been saying all the right things, listening to Indigenous voices, and championing a global phase-out of fossil fuels. </p><p> \"But with a new government in the driver's seat, they seem to have swerved off course and are undermining the Indigenous People-led struggle,\" said the NGO, referring to the country's centre-right National Party, which came to power in November.</p><p> 2nd place: JapanJapan's plans to extend the lifespan of fossil fuels by promoting their use with hydrogen and ammonia drew flak for greenwashing from Climate Action Network. </p><p> \"Japan's Prime Minister has been making a sales pitch through the Asia Zero Emissions Community initiative for South-east Asia to keep their coal and gas plants running using the hydrogen and ammonia co-firing technology.</p><p> \"This push to lock in fossil fuel-based energy across the continent is delaying the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, adding hurdles to achieving the global goal of tripling renewables,\" it added.</p><p> 3rd place: United States  The US came under fire for its priorities when it came to climate finance, after it pledged only US$17.5 million (S$23.5 million) to the loss and damage fund adopted at COP28. The fund will see developed countries, which are largely responsible for climate change, pay compensation to developing ones. More than US$790 million has been pledged so far. </p><p> \"We award this fossil for the US to look in the mirror and reflect on its allocation of funds,\" said Climate Action Network. </p><p> It called America's pledge paltry for the size of the country's historical emissions, and even more so compared with its military spending, with US$38 billion allocated to military aid to Israel, for instance. </p><p>US special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry, however, said at a press conference on Dec 6 that the figure was a starting point and the amount given could be subject to change in the future. </p><p> 5. Energy for Health About 912 million people worldwide are served by healthcare facilities that either have no electricity access or have unreliable electricity.</p><p> To tackle this, India-based NGO Selco Foundation has installed solar panels and efficient medical appliances in more than 4,000 healthcare centres in rural India, with a target to reach 25,000 by 2026. It presented its efforts in an exhibition that included a short film.</p><p> The move helps to build climate resilience, save energy and avoid wastage of vaccines and other critical resources. </p><p> Health has come under the spotlight at COP28, as warming temperatures bring more vector-borne diseases and health threats from extreme heat.</p><p> With the support of the World Health Organisation and the International Renewable Energy Agency, Selco is replicating its efforts with governments and civil societies in sub-Saharan Africa through knowledge-sharing and capacity-building.</p><p> Aside from bringing to light the importance of having sustainable energy for healthcare, the exhibition features a five-minute short film for viewers to understand the difficulties that people face in accessing healthcare facilities in rural areas, and the realities of having an unstable electricity supply.</p><p> 6. Stella McCartney's  Sustainability MarketIn partnership with British fashion designer Stella McCartney's parent company LVMH, this exhibition showcases \"the possibilities of current cutting-edge or soon-to-be available technologies\" that could transform the fashion industry.</p><p> McCartney is known for being a trailblazer in the sustainability and cruelty-free space for eschewing fur, leather and feathers. </p><p> The exhibition space was 3D-printed with Pure.Tech materials that absorb various greenhouse gases and convert them into environmentally friendly materials.</p><p> Innovative materials on show included bio- and plant-based alternatives to plastic, animal leather and fur, and traditional fibres. Among these was a grape-based alternative to leather by champagne house Veuve Clicquot, which McCartney used in bags seen on the runway at her Spring 2024 show in September. </p><p> Another is by Protein Evolution, which uses artificial intelligence and biology to produce raw ingredients of polyester from plastic waste instead of using fossil fuels.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The immersive Passage of Water exhibition brings to life the ways in which climate change has been impacting the earth's water cycle, to help people better understand and visualise the world's dwindling freshwater resources. photo: EPA-EFE</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-IE5UHNB</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69VR-5BK1-DYX4-00NK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1299\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This was the first time they met after Mr Sunak became the UK prime minister last October.Describing both nation's relationship as \"dynamic\" and \"comprehensive\" at all levels including trade and investment, defence and security, and science and technology, both leaders said in the joint declaration that mutual cooperation between the two countries reflected the \"like-minded\" and \"forward-looking\" nature of Singapore and the UK.This includes an unwavering commitment to free trade, international law and the rules-based multilateral system, as well as a shared commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific, said the declaration.\"This Joint Declaration on the Strategic Partnership heralds a new era in Singapore-United Kingdom relations, catalysing opportunities for our people to cooperate and strengthen linkages, for the common peace, stability and prosperity of our countries,\" both leaders said.WHY IT MATTERSThe latest \"strategic partnership\" upgrades the already strong bilateral relations between Singapore and the UK in more areas and comes after UK's accession to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) in July.Singapore is one of the members of the CPTPP, a free trade agreement among 11 members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation that was concluded in 2018.Previously, both countries had announced a \"Partnership for the Future\" in 2019 that covered four broad areas of cooperation, namely the digital economy, sustainable business and innovation, security and defence, as well as in education, culture and youth exchanges.Since then, the UK-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (UKSFTA) came into force in 2021, as well as the UK-Singapore Digital Economy Agreement (UKSDEA) in 2022, further enhancing economic cooperation between both nations.In terms of military cooperation, both nations are part of the Five Power Defence Agreement (FPDA) dating back to 1971, and which includes Australia, Malaysia and New Zealand. </p><p>Singapore and the UK also signed a Defence Cooperation Memorandum of Understanding in 2018 at the sidelines of the annual Shangri-La Dialogue -the first MOU on defencebetween the two countries.WHAT DOES THE NEW STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIP INCLUDE?ECONOMICBoth Mr Lee and Mr Sunak recognised that the security of both countries is built upon prosperity, and as such, \"will commit to deepening our economic relationship to strengthen the dynamism and resilience of our economies\", the joint declaration said.  To this end, both countries will seek to \"maximise the benefits and opportunities\" from the UKSFTA, UKSDEA as well as the UK's accession to the CPTPP. In general, all three trade and digital economy treaties promote tariff-free trade, lowers barriers to entry and facilitate market access between businesses of both countries.  Among other things, the declaration also states that Singapore and UK will commit to explore mechanisms to facilitate cross-border data flows, promote the adoption of \"interoperable digital systems through multilateral fora\".  The primary platform to monitor progress of such cooperation will be through an annual UK-Singapore Financial Dialogue, the joint declaration stated.  Singapore and Britain will also work together to scale green and transition finance, which will include \"bilateral pilot projects that support innovation and resilience\" in the financial systems of both economies, said both leaders.DEFENCE, FOREIGN POLICYBoth leaders pledged to contribute towards a free, stable and peaceful international rules-based order.  Singapore and the UK will expand their and reaffirm existing defence cooperations, such as the FPDA and the 2018 MOU on Defence Cooperation, the joint declaration stated.  Both countries will also deepen partnerships between their defence ministries, including in managing of threats in the digital and cyber domains.  Other areas in which Singapore and the UK will strengthen cooperation include dealing with maritime security issues and \"tackling of shared threats from illicit finance, economic and organised crimes\".SUSTAINABILITYMr Lee and Mr Sunak said the partnership between both countries will help to develop a green economy that achieves the goals of the Paris Agreement and Glasgow Climate Pact, besides strengthening climate resilience and create new jobs in growth sectors.  Singapore and the UK will reaffirm their commitment to multilateral environment agreements global climate action goals, such as to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.  Both nations will also contribute towards a sustainable economy by accelerating \"regional sustainable infrastructure and investment\" and developing the relevant talent pool and skillsets through a Green Skills Corridor.The joint declaration on Saturday stated that the foreign ministries of Singapore and the UK will \"regularly review\" progress in the implementation of the Strategic Partnership to ensure that the cooperation continues to be \"relevant and future ready\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-2250851</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694K-FKM1-DXPH-P002-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Today (Singapore) - Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 9, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>G20 summit</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Lee Hsien Loong</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

Important as these are, however, organisations ranging from McKinsey to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have highlighted that these massive projects don't -- inevitably -- have to be competitive.</p><p> The ADB, for instance, sees a regional infrastructure investment gap of some US$26 trillion in that area of the globe alone in the period to 2030. </p><p> To put this into perspective, even if China were to double the BRI's investment total in this period, it would still leave financial capacity for many multiples of the EU's Global Gateway scheme. The European effort aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros (S$434.7 billion) in public and private global investments in the period from 2021 to 2027.</p><p> Yet, despite these core facts, the primary lens through which the BRI and Global Gateway are often perceived is geopolitical. While the BRI has garnered massive media coverage over the last decade, Global Gateway has operated far more under the global radar screen, despite being widely seen as Europe's most significant response to BRI to date. </p><p> Outward lookingGlobal Gateway is politically led in Brussels, but it aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros in public and private funds by 2027 to finance EU infrastructure projects abroad. This total is based on national and EU resources from financial institutions and development banks, in the hope that institutional spending will unlock significant private capital too.</p><p> The role of the private sector is cemented in the EU scheme by the business advisory board which includes a wide range of firms, including in the energy, transport and digital sectors. </p><p> They are: AEE Power, ANDRITZ Hydro, EDL, Enel Group, Eramet, Getra Group, Iberdrola, Siemens, TotalEnergies, Turbulent, Veolia, Vestas Wind Systems, Aktors, Asseco Data Systems, ESET, Eutelsat, MIM Solutions, Nokia Digital, Orange Digital, PAIX Data Centres, Telecom Italia, Telefonica, Bayer, Merck, Royal Philips, Allianz, Danone, AP Moeller Maersk, Alstom, Deutsche Post, DHL Group, and Volvo Group.</p><p> Geographically, the project is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean; the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific; and Africa.

Important as these are, however, organisations ranging from McKinsey to the Asian Development Bank (ADB) have highlighted that these massive projects don't - inevitably - have to be competitive.The ADB, for instance, sees a regional infrastructure investment gap of some US$26 trillion in that area of the globe alone in the period to 2030. To put this into perspective, even if China were to double the BRI's investment total in this period, it would still leave financial capacity for many multiples of the EU's Global Gateway scheme. The European effort aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros (S$434.7 billion) in public and private global investments in the period from 2021 to 2027.Yet, despite these core facts, the primary lens through which the BRI and Global Gateway are often perceived is geopolitical. While the BRI has garnered massive media coverage over the last decade, Global Gateway has operated far more under the global radar screen, despite being widely seen as Europe's most significant response to BRI to date. </p><p>Global Gateway is politically led in Brussels, but it aims to mobilise up to 300 billion euros in public and private funds by 2027 to finance EU infrastructure projects abroad. This total is based on national and EU resources from financial institutions and development banks, in the hope that institutional spending will unlock significant private capital too.The role of the private sector is cemented in the EU scheme by the business advisory board which includes a wide range of firms, including in the energy, transport and digital sectors. They are: AEE Power, ANDRITZ Hydro, EDL, Enel Group, Eramet, Getra Group, Iberdrola, Siemens, TotalEnergies, Turbulent, Veolia, Vestas Wind Systems, Aktors, Asseco Data Systems, ESET, Eutelsat, MIM Solutions, Nokia Digital, Orange Digital, PAIX Data Centres, Telecom Italia, Telefonica, Bayer, Merck, Royal Philips, Allianz, Danone, AP Moeller Maersk, Alstom, Deutsche Post, DHL Group, and Volvo Group.Geographically, the project is focused on Latin America and the Caribbean; the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific; and Africa. These target regions broadly align with the EU's goal of diversifying its supply chains given the high dependence on several key countries, including China. At Wednesday's launch in Brussels, political leaders from more than a dozen developing nations attended, including Armenia, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Egypt and Georgia.While projects in Africa and Latin America have already been given significant media attention, what are perhaps less known are those in the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific. Given the intensifying geopolitical competition in these regions, the EU is stepping up its strategic engagement there too. The growing economic, demographic and political weight of these areas makes them key collaborators in shaping the rules-based international order and in addressing key global challenges such as climate change.Projects in Asia include an Asean Team Europe Initiative on Sustainable Connectivity, which would support Asean electric grid interconnections to improve access to renewable energy, invest in digitalisation, including in connectivity via submarine cables, as well as promote environmentally, economically, and socially sustainable value chains. There is also a Green Team Europe Initiative with Asean, to strengthen the EU's partnership with the region in areas such as environmental and biodiversity protection, clean energy transition, disaster resilience, prevention of illegal logging, wildlife trafficking, and air pollution.In the Middle East, meanwhile, possible projects include a water desalination scheme in Jordan for enhancing water security in a nation increasingly hit by the impact of global warming. There is also a potential digital project for businesses and universities in Egypt, plus several neighbouring nations to boost Internet speeds via a submarine optical cable.Beyond these examples, Global Gateway's areas of focus include climate and energy with investment in both mitigation and climate resilience, as well as in clean energy, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Key goals with this include helping deliver energy security, alongside global objectives such as the Sustainable Development Goals and Paris Agreement climate goals.Another Global Gateway area of focus is health, with a goal of strengthening capacity around the world. This will prioritise security of pharmaceutical supply chains and development of local manufacturing. The Covid pandemic revealed weaknesses of healthcare systems and the fragility of pharmaceutical supply chains. It also highlighted the wide discrepancy in medical manufacturing capacities around the world.Yet another example is transport, with a goal of creating sustainable, smart, resilient, inclusive and safe transport networks, including in Africa. There, the goal is to help enable the economic potential of an African continental trade area.Creating such strategic, sustainable, and secure transport corridors and supporting value chains, services and jobs will benefit industries in both Africa and Europe. The proposed strategic corridors through reliable networks and services will provide better, greener EU-Africa connectivity. These corridors will facilitate trade and mobility within Africa, as well as between Africa and Europe.One of these transport networks that the EU, alongside the US, is keen to develop is the Trans-African Corridor. Angola, Zambia and the DRC - all home to major deposits of cobalt, lithium and copper - had in July committed to the project, which will connect the mineral-rich Katanga province in the DRC to the Atlantic port of Lobito in Angola, through the copper belt in Zambia.At the G20 summit in India in September, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the goal of the Trans-African Corridor is \"not only to connect a landlocked region to the sea\". The partnership \"will also invest in local value chains, in clean energy and in skills for the local workforce. It is a whole new approach to large infrastructure investment. It is about shared prosperity. It is about real benefits for all partners\", she said.Taken together, the launch of the new Global Gateway strategy is only the latest signal of a new, geopolitical EU.

The Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), under the Meteorological ServiceSingapore, has released the findings of the Third National Climate<br/><br/>Change Study (V3[1]) today. V3 projects higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels for Singapore and Southeast Asia by the end of the century. This is consistent with the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6)[2].</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. V3 updates Singapore's national climate change projections from the previous study (V2) released by CCRS in 2015. Based on a carefully selected set of global climate models from IPCC AR6, V3 downscales[3] the projections to higher resolutions of 8km over Southeast Asia and 2km over Singapore using CCRS' customised Regional Climate Model. Compared to V2, the V3 projections incorporate improved representations and a wider range of physical processes in the global climate system, enabling more accurate simulation of our regional climate on a finer scale.</p><p>3. V3 uses three projected global socio-economic pathways affecting greenhouse gasemission levels to explore the possible range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the surrounding region by end century. These correspond to the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs)[4] used in the IPCC AR6. The low emissions scenario (SSP1-2.6) reflects a shift to sustainable development pathways with net zero targets achieved after 2050 while the high emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) is driven by energy intensive, fossil fuel-based development. The medium emissions scenario (SSP2-4.5) takes a middle-of-the-road pathway where historical patterns of development continue throughout this century.</p><p>Very Hot Days and Warm Nights the New Normal by End Century</p><p>4. Consistent with earlier projections, Singapore is expected to become warmer, with annual mean temperatures rising between 0.6 and 5 degrees Celsius by end century. Singapore's annual mean temperatures, which increased at a rate of 0.24 degrees Celsius per decade in the past 40 years, is projected to rise to 0.55 degrees Celsius per decade by end century under the high emissions scenario.</p><p>5. Very hot days will become more frequent. Singapore experienced daily maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celsius[5] 21.4 days per year on average in the last 40 years. By end century, we will see between 41 and 351 days per year on average of such high daily maximum temperatures. More warm nights where temperatures exceed 26.3 degrees Celsius are also projected. From an average of 76 nights per year in the last 40 years,<br/><br/>Singapore could experience such warm nights most nights in the year by end century. Rainfall Extremes to Intensify, Dry Periods to Get Drier</p><p>6. Singapore's rainfall is highly variable at seasonal time scales. By the end of century, total rainfall during the southwest monsoon dry season of June-through-August could fallsignificantly below the historical low of 314 mm (recorded in 1997) around once every threeyears. For the northeast monsoon wet season of November-through-January, the corresponding seasonal total rainfall is projected to exceed the historical high of 1507 mm (recorded in 2006) occasionally.</p><p>7. Extreme daily rainfall[6] is projected to increase across all seasons, with increases ranging from around 6 to 92 per cent in the inter-monsoon months of April and May. On the other hand, dry spells[7] could be more frequent and last longer, with Singapore experiencing<br/><br/>on average one dry spell every 10 to 60 months by end of century.<br/><br/>Mean Sea Level to Rise</p><p>8. The mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 0.23m to 1.15m by end century, and by up to around 2m by 2150 under the high emissions scenario. This increase from the previous V2 projections (around 1m by end century) is primarily due to a better understanding of the contribution of the melting of the Antarctic ice sheets to global sea levels Staying Resilient in The Face of Climate Change</p><p>9. Singapore's future climate depends on the world's shared socio-economic pathways. All countries will have to act collectively to fulfil their net zero commitments. Singapore is doing our part, with the Singapore Green Plan. We are committed to reach net-zero carbon by 2050.</p><p>10. In addition, the Government takes a proactive approach not just in mitigation, but also in adaptation planning to ensure that we are prepared for the impacts of climate change. The Government will take into account the range of possible climate outcomes, including the high emissions pathway, in Singapore's adaptation plans to ensure that we remain climate resilient. Details of the Government's current climate adaptation efforts can be found in Annex B(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mse.gov.sg/files/Joint%20Media%20Release%20-%20Singapore's%20Third%20National%20Climate%20Change%20Study%20(V3).pdf\">https://www.mse.gov.sg/files/Joint%20Media%20Release%20-%20Singapore's%20Third%20National%20Climate%20Change%20Study%20(V3).pdf</url>).</p><p>11. MSS will also be sharing the V3 data with ASEAN Member States at a later stage. In addition, MSS will be collaborating with international entities and the wider scientific community to undertake joint research using V3 data.</p><p>12. To deepen our understanding of the impacts of climate change, NEA today also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impacts Science Research (CISR)Programme[8] for new research proposals on food security, impacts on human health, water resources, sea level rise and impacts on maritime infrastructure and the transport sector. In December last year, eight projects were awarded under the Programme's first grant call. These projects will make use of V3 results to look into areas like the impact of climate change on vector-borne diseases in Singapore, changes in our tropical forest landscape, among others.</p><p>13. Government action alone will not be sufficient. Everyone - individuals, communities,and corporates - has a role to play to promote sustainability and mitigate climate change.

Her three-day visit, which ends on Friday, also coincides with the annual joint military drills conducted by Manila and Canberra. </p><p> \"We want a region that is predictable, that operates by agreed rules, standards and laws, in which sovereignty is respected. We want to work with the Philippines to support Asean's vital contribution to regional peace and security, including through maritime training,\" said Ms Wong. </p><p> The foreign minister on Wednesday visited the PCG's headquarters, where Filipino coast guard officers shared their experiences patrolling the South China Sea.</p><p> China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, which was invalidated by an international tribunal ruling in 2016. The Philippines is among the South-east Asian nations challenging Beijing's claim.</p><p> Ms Wong said Australia also plans to share information and provide technical assistance to the Philippine government to help the country deal with illegal fishing in its territorial waters.</p><p> Talks are still ongoing between the two countries to conduct joint patrols in the disputed South China Sea. Manila also has similar discussions with its other military allies, the United States and Japan. </p><p> Ms Wong said they are still discussing the \"best pathway to take this forward\". </p><p> Australia, one of Manila's only two treaty allies along with the US, has been boosting its defence and security assistance to the Philippines in recent months to help counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region. </p><p> Australia has consistently backed a 2016 international tribunal ruling that said the eastern parts of the South China Sea that fall within Manila's 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) belong to the Philippines. Filipinos call this area the West Philippine Sea.</p><p> China refuses to recognise this ruling and has, instead, ramped up its military and island-building activities in the South China Sea. Manila has also filed multiple diplomatic protests against the reported Chinese harassment of Philippine vessels and fishermen in the disputed waters. </p><p> From May 10 to 12, the PCG installed five additional buoys in the waters near Flat Island, Irving Reef, Loaita Island, Lankiam Cay and Whitsun Reef within the country's EEZ. Dozens of Chinese military vessels continue to swarm these areas. </p><p> \"We are committed to continuing Australia's longstanding presence in the region, including in the West Philippine Sea, South China Sea. We are open to cooperating with all our partners to exercise freedom of navigation and overflight, and the Philippines is a longstanding, important security partner for us,\" said Ms Wong. </p><p> Apart from maritime cooperation, Ms Wong said Australia's Official Development Assistance for Manila for 2023 to 2024 is at A$89.9 million (S$80 million). This will support programmes covering economic growth, education, disaster and climate resilience, as well as peace and stability in southern Philippines.</p><p> This is on top of the A$10.95 million that Australia has already pledged, to establish an immunisation information system as well as a laboratory network and surveillance system in the Philippines. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong during a joint press conference in Manila on Thursday.

Some 3.6 billion people live without safely managed sanitation, and 2.3 billion lack basic handwashing facilities at home. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Besides access, pollution is an issue. More than 80 per cent of wastewater is released without being treated or reused, pointing to the need for stringent regulations to ensure better management.</p><p> Water conservation is crucial as droughts could be the next pandemic. At the same time, climate change has worsened floods.

Last Monday (Mar 20), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) delivered what was widely viewed as the \"final warning\" on the climate crisis, urging policymakers to take action immediately to cut emissions or \"miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity\" to avert disaster.</p><p> Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is achievable, but would require a \"quantum leap in climate action\", United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Essentially, it's do it now or never -- efforts to develop climate resilience will become increasingly futile if global warming levels exceed 1.5 deg C and outright impossible in some regions once warming breaches 2 deg C. The desire to save the planet has spurred a growing number of consumers and investors to be more conscious of where they put their money in recent years. </p><p> It is heartening to see people increasingly want to ensure the companies they support are helping the environment, whether it involves clean energy, plastics or recycling. But this enthusiasm to be eco-conscious can also be easily exploited by corporates that want to further their own agenda or maximise earnings. </p><p> This could take the form of misleading claims or dubious solutions for environmental problems. Greenwashing, if uncovered, can lead to disenchantment among consumers and an erosion of trust towards corporations in general. In the long run, it could foster deep cynicism, causing people to give up on doing good for the environment if they start to believe their efforts are futile. Organisations that greenwash don't just deceive their customers, but are in fact doing a disservice to mankind.

Last Monday (Mar 20), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) delivered what was widely viewed as the \"final warning\" on the climate crisis, urging policymakers to take action immediately to cut emissions or \"miss a brief and rapidly closing window of opportunity\" to avert disaster.Limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is achievable, but would require a \"quantum leap in climate action\", United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Essentially, it's do it now or never - efforts to develop climate resilience will become increasingly futile if global warming levels exceed 1.5 deg C and outright impossible in some regions once warming breaches 2 deg C.The desire to save the planet has spurred a growing number of consumers and investors to be more conscious of where they put their money in recent years. </p><p>It is heartening to see that people increasingly want to ensure the companies they support are helping the environment, whether it involves clean energy, plastics or recycling.But this enthusiasm to be eco-conscious can also be easily exploited by corporates that want to further their own agenda or maximise earnings. This could take the form of misleading claims or dubious solutions for environmental problems. Greenwashing, if uncovered, can lead to disenchantment among consumers and an erosion of trust towards corporations in general. In the long run, it could foster deep cynicism, causing people to give up on doing good for the environment if they start to believe their efforts are futile. Organisations that greenwash don't just deceive their customers, but are in fact doing a great disservice to mankind. They should be seen and treated as saboteurs in humanity's ultimate fight to rescue the world.It is thus imperative for governments to strengthen regulation against greenwashing, alongside other measures to cut emissions and improve sustainability. On Mar 22, the European Commission took a step in this direction, unveiling a regulatory framework for environmental labels, which it said must be reliable and based on science. Green groups were quick to point out though that allowing companies to buy carbon offsets and tree-planting are akin to greenwashing since these actions are less effective than cutting emissions.Singapore is also studying developments on greenwashing in other jurisdictions, \"to assess if any specific guidance or regulations would be useful\" in the local context, as Minister of State for Trade and Industry, Alvin Tan, told Parliament recently.

The other half probably did pan out, but not exactly to the extent expected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Projections of China's economic recovery, expectations of a US recession and fears of a corporate earnings slump proved off the mark. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Instead, despite interest rates at 22-year highs, the global economy and corporate earnings were resilient. Oil prices remained subdued, the US labour market was tight, and consumer spending has been robust.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The biggest market-moving event of 2023 was the meltdown of four US regional banks and the near-collapse of Credit Suisse, which was subsequently taken over by rival UBS. The events shook investor sentiment. There was also the spectacular collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</p><p> Yet, global equities have risen by some 17 per cent in 2023, led by technology plays, in particular the \"Magnificent 7\" US big tech stocks comprising Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia and Tesla. </p><p> The MSCI Informational World Technology Index delivered a 46 per cent return in 2023, in sharp contrast to a 31 per cent dive in 2022.</p><p> The year-end Santa Rally remained largely intact, despite some scattered turbulence. The immediate outlook for equity and bond markets seems better than it has been for the last 24 months, thanks to expectations that the US Federal Reserve will stop raising rates in 2024.</p><p> With Wall Street indexes now at three-year highs, some strategists are projecting the US benchmark S&amp;P500 index to hit 5,400 points by the end of 2024, and 6,000 points by the end of 2025. It closed at 4,783.35 points on Dec 28 in New York, before this article was published.</p><p> Across the Pacific, the market rally has found stronger legs thanks to the Fed's announcement of rate cuts in 2024. The European Central Bank and others will likely follow suit.</p><p> Fed's rate cuts could boost markets, but risks aboundAt its December gathering, the Fed hinted there could be three cuts in 2024, bringing its key lending rate at midpoint between 4.50 and 4.75 per cent. That implies a 75-basis-point cut.</p><p> More optimistic market experts, like ING chief international economist James Knightley, reckon that the Fed could make as many as six 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2024, adding up to 150 basis points. He also expects the interest rate cuts to extend into 2025 with at least four 25-basis-point interest rate cuts.</p><p> This could have huge implications for equity and bond markets, given that there is some US$6 trillion (S$8 trillion) in funds currently earning risk-free returns in money market deposits. These funds would have to seek out higher returns if interest rates start falling, benefiting the equity and bond markets through much of 2024. </p><p> That said, 2024 is not going to be a trouble-free ride for the market either.</p><p> There are many uncertainties still hanging over the market: relatively tight credit conditions, heightened geopolitical risks and potential slowdown in key economies, including the US.</p><p> \"Gazing into the crystal ball for a glimpse into the outlook for 2024, it is clear that a great deal hinges on how inflation and the economy perform in the coming months,\" noted Mr Vasu Menon, managing director of investment strategy at OCBC Bank. </p><p> S&amp;P Global Ratings noted in its report, titled Credit Cycle Indicator Q1 2024: More Pain Before A Recovery in 2025, that relatively tight credit conditions for households and companies will not start getting better until 2025. </p><p> There is also the question of how inflation recedes. A disorderly and steep fall in prices could indicate a collapse in consumer confidence, which in turn, could precipitate a recession. </p><p> Investors are pinning their hopes on a soft landing scenario for the US economy, where a period of economic expansion slows down gradually without entering a recession.</p><p> Unfortunately, history has not been on the Fed's side on this count: All but five Fed tightening cycles since 1950 have ended in a recession.</p><p> Economists and analysts are crunching out their forecasts for growth and earnings for this outcome.  </p><p> \"We expect the US growth slowdown to be more apparent in the first half of 2024 with a technical recession, but a soft landing remains possible in our base case,\" said UOB in its latest Global Economics and Market Research report.</p><p> A technical recession is a phase when an economy experiences negative economic growth over a six-month period. </p><p> UOB expects US growth to slow to 1 per cent in 2024, after a projected 2.4 per cent in 2023.</p><p> While the Fed is expected to start cutting rates by mid-2024, it takes around a year for the full effect of rate hikes that have already been done to make their way into the economy.</p><p> Meanwhile, the 18-month tightening cycle has raised the marginal funding costs for businesses over the past two years. </p><p> With cost of capital expected to remain relatively high through 2024, companies must devote a significant share of their revenue to cover higher interest expenses as they refinance their debt at higher prevailing rates. </p><p> This could impact earnings. The question is how much corporate debt needs to be rolled over at high rates and the magnitude of the impact on earnings in 2024.</p><p> Banking giant BNY Mellon expects rates to remain volatile during the first half of 2024.</p><p> One of the more sober projections comes from BCA Equity Research, whose chief strategist, Mr Peter Berezin, in his 2024 Macro Outlook, predicts that a global recession will begin in the second half of 2024, just when most investors have concluded that a soft landing has been achieved. </p><p> BCA projects the equity rally could fizzle out in early 2024.</p><p> \"Our end-2024 target for the S&amp;P 500 is 3,500. US stocks will outperform their global peers during the next recession, but not by as much as in previous downturns,\" the report noted.</p><p> This, despite Mr Berezin and his team seeing aggressive second half 2024 cuts pushing down the Fed funds rate to 2 per cent, with the 10-year Treasury yield falling to 3 per cent next year. </p><p> Meanwhile, the elephant in the room is geopolitics.</p><p> Analysts say that the ongoing conflict in the Middle East has compounded geopolitical concerns for investors. This comes as the world is already dealing with the fallout of the Ukraine conflict.</p><p> Traders have been buying gold and oil as a potential widening of the Middle East conflict threatens to put upside pressure on oil prices, supply chains and contribute to another round of inflation. </p><p> As Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels lob missiles at commercial ships and oil tankers in the Red Sea, a waterway which accounts for 12 per cent of global trade, the impact of ships being forced to sail around Africa could ultimately show up supply chain-related inflation.</p><p> Global equities rally could continueStill, most analysts reckon that barring other unforeseen circumstances, the rally that began in November 2023 looks likely to gather momentum and broaden.</p><p> Much of the 2023 rally has been driven by the Magnificent 7. In fact, driven by artificial intelligence (AI)-related fever, these stocks accounted for almost two-thirds of the S&amp;P 500's lift during the year.</p><p> In a report, Citibank analysts reckon investors should ponder whether to continue favouring just big tech or add exposure more broadly. </p><p> \"As a group, the Magnificent 7 have overcome tighter financial conditions and higher interest rates by extending industry leadership and building upon their fortress balance sheets. They presently trade at nearly 30 times forward earnings. In comparison, the broader market is 40 per cent cheaper.\"</p><p> Financial powerhouse BlackRock reckons that investors should look at \"mega forces\" that will drive economies and markets in 2024 and beyond.</p><p> \"Mega forces are key drivers of the new regime, affecting the long-term growth and inflation outlook and creating shifts in profitability,\" it said in its 2024 Global Outlook report. \"We see them as a source of return now and far into the future.\"</p><p> BlackRock advised investors to go beyond traditional building blocks and asset classes, and focus on areas such as digital disruption, the growth of AI, future of finance, the impact of ageing populations and the push towards climate resilience.</p><p> Turning to geopolitics, BlackRock reckons there will be a rewiring of economic ties due to global fragmentation driven by competing geopolitical and economic blocs creating investment opportunities. Countries like India, Malaysia, Vietnam and Mexico stand to benefit.</p><p> Given the huge amount of liquidity sitting on the sidelines, the next 12 months could provide opportunities in both equities and bonds.</p><p> Morgan Stanley characterised its 12-month outlook for returns across major equity markets as \"comfortably positive\".</p><p> It is particularly upbeat on Japan equities, where it sees sustained reflation, rising productivity and improved corporate governance driving the market. </p><p> \"In Asia, we expect a recovery in semiconductors and also prefer energy and nearshoring-exposed industrials,\" Morgan Stanley strategist Michael Wilson and team noted in a Global Strategy report titled Threading The Needle. \"We like financials in Japan, Singapore, India and Indonesia.\"</p><p> Amid the optimism, look out for red flagsAll in all, there are good reasons for investors to be optimistic about 2024. </p><p> But hedge your bets. Despite all the positives, there are red flags to watch out for.</p><p> These include the lagged impact of tighter monetary conditions, a potential hard landing for the US economy, unexpected turns in geopolitics, the potential return of a Trump administration in the US, the abuse of AI and more extreme climate-related disasters.</p><p> Any combination of these could derail a market recovery.</p><p> The best strategy would be to get back into the market gradually over the coming months, rather than to punt or time the market. Diversification across asset classes is also important, given the potential volatility.</p><p> Active portfolio management is required.</p><p> As BlackRock warned: \"This is not a time to switch on the investing autopilot; it's time to take the controls. It's important to be deliberate in taking portfolio risk and expect to deploy more risk over the next year.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Macy's Santa Claus bringing cheer to the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange over Thanksgiving.

The strategy aims to accelerate decarbonization of the maritime shipping industry and achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. It includes coordinating decarbonization efforts, establishing consensus on green shipping best practices, improving access to technology and digital solutions, and leveraging networks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Highlights:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">* A study will be conducted to analyze trade flows and vessel traffic between Singapore, Los Angeles, and Long Beach to guide implementation of the GDSC.</p><p>* The ports and C40 Cities will engage stakeholders to onboard new corridor participants in 2024.</p><p>Original Press Release:</p><p>Dec. 6 -- Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore issued the following news release:</p><p>Today, at the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28/CMP18/CMA5 [1]), the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), Port of Los Angeles (POLA) and Port of Long Beach (POLB) unveiled a Partnership Strategy for a green and digital shipping corridor (GDSC) across the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>The release of the Partnership Strategy follows the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) by MPA, POLA and POLB during Singapore Maritime Week in April 2023. The MoU formalised the partnership, which is supported by C40 Cities, with the aim of establishing a GDSC connecting the three global hub ports.<br/><br/>The scope of cooperation through the Partnership Strategy and success indicators specified within build upon the MoU signed in April 2023 and reaffirm the corridor partners' commitment to drive global action to digitalise and decarbonise the shipping industry and improve efficiencies.<br/><br/>The GDSC Strategy outlines steps to accelerate decarbonisation of the maritime shipping industry by enabling first mover organisations to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the earliest feasible date, in support of the goals defined by the 2023 International Maritime Organization's Strategy on Reduction of GHG Emissions from Ships. The ports and C40 will work together and with value-chain stakeholders from the fuel and maritime sectors to:<br/><br/>*Coordinate decarbonisation efforts: GDSC partners will help to catalyse and coordinate efforts to enable ships calling at the Port of Singapore, Port of Los Angeles and Port of Long Beach to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by the earliest feasible date.<br/><br/>* Build consensus on green shipping best practices: GDSC partners will seek to establish consensus around green shipping best practices and standards.<br/><br/>* Improve access to and adoption of technology and digital solutions: To enhance supply chain efficiency, resilience and decarbonisation while reducing costs and improving reliability, GDSC partners will work to develop and deploy innovative technology and digital solutions.<br/><br/>* Leverage networks: GDSC partners will work with stakeholders involved in other green shipping initiatives, including those established by the three ports and other parties, to scale the uptake of zero and near-zero emission technologies, fuels and energy sources.<br/><br/>To achieve these aims, a partnership structure and governance mechanism have been developed to provide clarity on the roles and responsibilities of GDSC partners. The strategy also outlines processes for onboarding new participants, financial management, confidentiality and decision-making.<br/><br/>As next steps, the ports and C40 have commissioned a study to analyse trade flows and vessel traffic between Singapore, Los Angeles and Long Beach. The study will estimate the quantity of near-zero and zero-emission fuels required for this traffic, and guide implementation by identifying opportunities for collaboration to advance the development of the GDSC.<br/><br/>The founding partners will now engage stakeholders from across the shipping and fuel supply value chains that share the GDSC's vision and aims, with the intention of onboarding new corridor participants in 2024.<br/><br/>Mr Teo Eng Dih, Chief Executive of MPA, said: \"We are excited to see this partnership grow from strength to strength with the Green and Digital Shipping Corridor Partnership Strategy. We have embarked on evaluating the various digital solutions and zero and near-zero fuels options that could be trialled along the route between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay Port Complex. We look forward to the support of all the corridor stakeholders over the coming months to conduct trials and potentially scale them for wider adoption.\"<br/><br/>\"This Partnership Strategy document is the foundation upon which we'll build the future of maritime shipping,\" Port of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka said. \"Our success requires the resolve and dedication of the three partnering ports as well as our industry partners. Together, we will model the collaboration necessary to achieve our climate and efficiency goals.\"<br/><br/>\"Over the last two decades, we've learned that collaboration between maritime industry partners is the key to making meaningful progress in reducing emissions and cleaning the air,\"Port of Long Beach CEO Mario Cordero said. \"This trans-Pacific green shipping corridor takes this concept global. The strategies we develop here can be used as a roadmap by a larger network of seaports and supply chain companies to invest in programs, technologies, software and infrastructure to decarbonize international trade everywhere.\"<br/><br/>C40 Executive Director Mark Watts said: \"C40 is proud to support our port partners in delivering this Partnership Strategy. The advancement of this Green and Digital Shipping Corridor brings the shipping sector one step closer to a 1.5C-aligned trajectory. Green shipping is only achievable through collaboration because no one stakeholder can afford to move unless they know others are likely to follow. That's where C40 is delighted to help, bringing our network of world-leading cities, which include most of the world's largest and most forward-looking ports.\"</p><p>About the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA)</p><p>MPA was established on 2 February 1996 with the mission to develop Singapore as a premier global hub port and international maritime centre, and to advance and safeguard Singapore's strategic maritime interests.

As a city-state with limited land and natural resources, research and development in Urban Solutions and Sustainability continues to be a key national priority so that we can build a sustainable, resilient, and liveable city. This is especially so as we chart Singapore's long-term development.</p><p>2. At the Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS) R&amp;D Congress today, Guest-of-Honour Mr Desmond Lee, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, reaffirmed the importance of strong partnerships between the Government, Institutes of Higher Learning, research institutes and firms, to effectively translate research findings into applicable outcomes.</p><p>3. The USS domain is one of the four verticals under Singapore's Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan. It aims to challenges in sustainability, liveability, and resilience, through the transformation of our built environment. The USS domain has its roots as early as 2006 when the Science and Technology 2010 plan was developed primarily to address our energy and water constraints. In 2015, the scope of the USS domain was expanded to address other imperatives related to the sustainability and liveability of our future city. These include food, waste, urban design and mobility, as well as climate science.</p><p>4. This year, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has partnered the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE) to organise the event. This partnership underscores the growing collaboration across USS agencies and a stronger emphasis on environmental sustainability.</p><p>5. Themed \"Building Sustainable, Resilient and Liveable Cities of Tomorrow\", the Congress features more than 60 eminent speakers from various disciplines, across topics such as leveraging technology for resource circularity, climate adaptation, building cities that nurture citizens' health and well-being, and building resilience in the built environment sector through automation and digitalisation.</p><p>6. At the Congress, Minister Desmond Lee announced several key initiatives to support R&amp;D efforts within the USS domain:</p><p>a) Strategic Collaboration between URA and SUTD on urban planning research</p><p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) is working with the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) on a five-year strategic collaboration focusing on urban planning research. This partnership aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, support them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and uplift Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.

This will enable us to better understand the long-term impact of our City in Nature efforts and further enhance our existing greenery management strategies. The $1.82m project will be led by researchers from NTU, over a 3-year period. More details in Annex D (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url>).</p><p>7. Even as we build up scientific knowledge through research, today's competitive landscape with shorter innovation cycles requires us to actively proliferate innovative solutions to the market for wider adoption. To achieve this, the USS domain has provided funding platforms to fast track the innovation process, such as the Built Environment Technology Alliance (BETA), Built Environment Accelerate to Market Programme (BEAMP) and the Living Lab (Water) Funding Initiative. Together with the National Research Foundation, Singapore (NRF) and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), we have also set up the USS Innovation &amp; Enterprise Office (USS IEO), a national platform that aims to bring more impactful technologies from lab to market for the USS domain. The USS IEO does so by facilitating technology translation in partnership with the larger innovation ecosystem, which includes research performers, industry and agencies such as IPI Singapore.</p><p>8 The Government has also cultivated public-private partnerships through initiatives such as NEA's Innovating and Curating Better Automation and Technology for Environmental Services (INCUBATE) partnership programme. The programme offers a platform for the technology providers, service providers, and progressive premises owners to co-create innovative and productive solutions, conduct trials, and scale-up implementation to address market needs.</p><p>9 As the science and technology landscape is constantly evolving, the Government will continue to provide support though various RIE initiatives to strengthen the USS ecosystem, so that we can continue to build a more sustainable, resilient, and liveable home.</p><p>Issued by: Ministry of National Development, Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment</p><p>Date: 4 October 2023</p><p>ANNEX A (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url>) : URA-SUTD Strategic Collaboration</p><p>1. In October 2021, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) and the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) embarked on a strategic research collaboration. The 5-year cross-sector collaboration provides a sustained platform to develop R&amp;D solutions and capabilities through quick experimentation, test-bedding and implementation of joint research projects. Through this partnership, URA aims to enhance urban planners' decision-making processes, enable them to better address emerging trends and disruptions in a fast-changing and complex environment, and advance Singapore's competency in urban planning and design.</p><p>2. This is the first of several strategic research collaborations that URA has been discussing with Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) in Singapore.</p><p>3. Under the URA-SUTD collaboration, faculty members including PhD students contribute their expertise and lead research projects co-developed with URA officers. URA will support the funding of these research projects and programmes over the five-year period, which will also include knowledge-exchange and capability-building programmes.</p><p>4. One ongoing research project is titled \"Computational Modelling for Optimisation of Planning and Urban Design Parameters\", led by SUTD's Asst Prof Peter Ortner in collaboration with URA's Design &amp; Planning Lab. Tapping on SUTD's expertise in computational modelling, this project aims to develop a generative design and optimisation workflow for planners to simulate and test planning scenarios within a shorter timeframe, as well as formulate development control and urban design guidelines more efficiently.</p><p>a. Since its commencement in January 2022, the project has demonstrated prototypes that can procedurally generate land parcellation and residential development scenarios as well as optimisation techniques to evaluate and shortlist generated solutions that best fit development constraints.</p><p>b. The SUTD team is also developing a proof-of-concept web application which incorporates generative design and optimisation processes with interfaces tailored to the planning workflow. When implemented, this application has the potential to facilitate more efficient work processes for planners.</p><p>c. This research project is targeted to be completed in 2025. The outcomes will be progressively integrated within URA's ePlanner, an in-house geospatial web application that currently serves over 1,000 planners across 40 public agencies.</p><p>5. The URA-SUTD collaboration has demonstrated the benefits of adopting an inter-disciplinary approach to tackle challenges in urban planning. For instance, the use of mathematical algorithms for land parcel generation and optimising urban forms has introduced opportunities for productivity gains as well as new planning insights. As the Whole-of-Government Urban Planning &amp; Design Technology Centre of Excellence (URBEX), URA will continue to partner IHLs and research institutes to translate research outcomes into user-friendly tools that can improve the work of planning agencies across the government.</p><p>ANNEX B (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> Media Factsheet</p><p>MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE CENTRE FOR LIVEABLE CITIES AND SINGAPORE-ETH CENTRE IN KNOWLEDGE SHARING AND CAPABILITY BUILDING</p><p>1.

It will enable both parties to share knowledge, experience, tools, and methodologies on platforms such as at the biennial World Cities Summit, Science of Cities Symposium, and other workshops and conferences. Furthermore, agencies in the MND family and partners of ETH Zurich and SEC will be able to leverage each other's academic and professional networks to connect with experts globally and tap on subject matter experts to create and share new knowledge on the Science of Cities approach to support liveable and sustainable cities.</p><p>4 The scope of the MOU includes:</p><p>a. Capability Development and Training Programmes</p><p>b. Knowledge Creation and Knowledge Sharing</p><p>c. Academic and Professional Networking</p><p>ANNEX C(<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> NTU Singapore - French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE)</p><p>1. The proper management of electrical and electronic waste (e-waste) is aligned to the global drive towards circular economy, which contributes to the fight against climate change. E-waste recycling creates \"urban mining\" opportunities to recapture precious and critical metals that could replace primary raw materials such as gold, platinum, lithium, cobalt, manganese, and nickel. Singapore can play our part in the green economy in recovering critical, precious, and rare earth metals from e-waste to generate economic returns while enhancing the resilience of critical resources.</p><p>2. Through the Closing the Resource Loop (CTRL) Funding Initiative in RIE2025, NEA has pledged $17 million to support the NTU Singapore-CEA Alliance for Research in Circular Economy (SCARCE) to research on developing cost-effective and environmentally friendly solutions for recycling e-waste.</p><p>3. This fund enables SCARCE to build on the promising findings of their Phase 1 research (conducted from 2018-2023). The focus of Phase 2 is to integrate the developed processes into closed loop resource recovery solutions for test bedding, leading to their adoption at an industrial scale. SCARCE will also embark on new and innovative research areas, such as recycling of lithium-ion batteries, smart sorting and mechanochemical methods into achieving better material recovery yield.</p><p>4. Under SCARCE Phase 2, three research thrusts will be pursued as follows:</p><p>Disclaimer: Table can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow</url></p><p>ANNEX D (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):\">https://www.mnd.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/view/building-sustainable-resilient-and-liveable-cities-of-tomorrow):</url> Comparison of litterfall nutrient cycling between forests and urban green spaces in Singapore by NTU</p><p>1. Under the first RIE2025 Grant Call of Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar, the National Parks Board (NParks) is awarding its first project to the Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The project would kickstart the long-term monitoring of key ecosystem processes such as carbon and nutrient cycling within our forests and urban green spaces. This $1.82m project will be led by researchers from the Asian School of the Environment (NTU), over a 3-year period.</p><p>2. Plants take in and release nutrients throughout their growth and decomposition, and nutrient flows can serve as indicators of ecosystem health. This project aims to establish baseline rates of nutrient release from leaf litter and soil in Singapore's forests and urban green spaces, and to develop a protocol for continued long-term monitoring. This is key for understanding patterns of nutrient flows across different natural and urban landscapes, and detecting fluctuations due to weather, climate, and urbanisation.</p><p>3. Data from this project will enable predictive modelling of nutrient cycling rates under different environmental conditions and landscape management practices. These insights can then inform the enhancement of existing urban greenery management strategies to optimise urban nutrient cycles for improved climate resilience and ecosystem health. By contributing towards the long-term monitoring of ecosystem health, the project will guide our overall City in Nature efforts to conserve and extend our natural capital, and further integrate nature into the urban environment.</p><p>About Cities of Tomorrow's City in Nature research pillar</p><p>As one of the five key pillars under the Singapore Green Plan 2030, the City in Nature vision aims to further restore and integrate nature into Singapore's urban fabric, so as to strengthen our distinctiveness as a highly liveable city, while mitigating the impacts of urbanisation and adapting to climate change. To provide a scientific foundation to support these transformative efforts, the Cities of Tomorrow Research &amp; Development Programme set up a new City in Nature research pillar under RIE 2025, led by NParks. This new research vertical will build upon existing R&amp;D efforts in greenery and biodiversity, to strengthen our ecological and climate resilience, and will also seek to inform nature-based solutions for social resilience. The vertical has been allocated $17.9m in research funding from NRF's Urban Solutions and Sustainability domain, from FY21 to FY25.</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062616383</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:699X-17N1-DXMP-K0WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2997\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 4, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Initiative &amp;

Finally, bilateral restrictions on technology flows and collaboration could reduce the global availability of knowledge.</p><p> In response to these developments, third countries should prioritise their own market-friendly reforms, added the World Bank. </p><p> International agreements will also help, with third markets better off having trade deals with both sides \"rather than being left out of any agreement or being part of an exclusive trade bloc\".</p><p> Other challenges are rapidly ageing populations, resulting in smaller workforces but higher pension and healthcare burdens; and climate risks, partly due to dense populations and high economic activity in coastal areas.</p><p> \"However, promoting trade, addressing population dynamics, and enhancing climate resilience could strengthen growth,\" added Aaditya. </p><p> Taking a longer-term view, the lender noted that the region's rate of potential growth slowed to 6.2 per cent in the decade up to 2021, down from 7.7 per cent in the previous decade. </p><p> It is expected to decelerate further to as low as 4.7 per cent in the decade through 2030, driven mainly by slower potential growth in China.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Excluding China, developing East Asia and Pacific economies are expected to grow at a rate of 4.9% in 2023 -- slower compared with 2022, says the World Bank.

The bad news is that it is still quite high,\" he adds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global headline inflation averaged 5.6% in 4Q2022, compared to 6% in 3Q2022 - this has occurred in line with the sharp fall in food, energy and logistical costs. Nonetheless, inflation remains well above the average of 2.5% seen in the decade before Covid-19, from 2010 to 2019. However, expectations by some market participants that central banks may start easing are \"excessively optimistic\", says Menon.</p><p>\"Forward guidance by the advanced economies' central banks indicates further tightening to core inflation. Both the Fed and the ECB [European Central Bank] have reiterated their commitment to achieve their inflation targets of 2%. The key challenge facing most central banks, including MAS, is to secure a return to low inflation without incurring too large a cost to economic growth and in some cases to financial stability.</p><p>\"Thus far, the disinflation process has taken place in an orderly fashion, without much dislocation to the functioning of the global economy or financial markets. But continuing to get this balance right will be a challenge, especially if inflation gets stuck at too high a level,\" he adds.</p><p>That said, how fast core inflation can return to the central banks' target bands is contingent not just on monetary policy, Menon notes. The speed of disinflation is subject to three near-term uncertainties - labour market dynamics, China's reopening and the surge in food and energy prices.</p><p>Against this backdrop, investors will need to consider building greater resilience in their portfolios, says Menon. \"All said and done, inflation will eventually come down and interest rates normalise, though both are likely to be slightly higher than what we have been used to,\" he adds.</p><p>Effects to receding globalisation</p><p>Over the medium term, the key driver of returns and risks in the financial markets will be the effects of geoeconomic fragmentation. Rising tensions between the US and China have led to higher trade barriers, tighter cross-border investment restrictions and greater domestic production of critical goods deemed to be of strategic national importance.</p><p>On the trade front, slightly more than 60% of the trade between the US and China is subject to tariffs, notes Menon. The investment flows between the two economic giants have slowed amid tighter regulations by the US to safeguard national security and supply chains, while both countries have stepped up domestic industrial policies.</p><p>China has committed US$1.4 trillion ($1.9 trillion) over the next five years to augment domestic technology and digital infrastructure. Meanwhile, the US has passed the US$280 billion Chips Act to boost the semiconductor research and production capabilities in the US for the next 10 years.</p><p>Aside from reducing trade and investment, these measures have also reshaped broader shifts in global trade patterns and supply chains - most evidently in the electronics industry. The US' share in China's electronic exports fell by four percentage points between 2017 and 2021, while regional economies such as Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand gained market share.</p><p>Looking ahead, increased domestic capacity for electronics production in both China and the US will likely lead to a substitution of imports, says Menon. The US has proposed a Chip 4 Alliance with Taiwan, South Korea and Japan for semiconductor production, which could potentially divert trade flows away from countries that are not part of the arrangement.</p><p>\"The result of the geoeconomics fragmentation is most likely slower economic growth. Several studies show that the long-term effects of receding globalisation are costly,\" says Menon.</p><p>Citing an International Monetary Fund study, a scenario of limited trade fragmentation could reduce global GDP by 1.2%. Meanwhile, a World Trade Organization study found that under a more adverse scenario of a full technological decoupling from 2020 to 2040, the loss in GDP will be 8% to 12% in individual countries.</p><p>\"Fragmentation in the real economy will also have an impact on capital flows and financial markets. Geoeconomics fragmentation elevates financial market risk and disruption as capital flows become more regionalised and less global. Consequently, this reduces market liquidity and returns, and increases market volatility.</p><p>\"The impact of disruptions of cross-border capital flows again falls disproportionately on the less developed countries. No country will emerge unscathed amid rising geoeconomics fragmentation, with emerging market economies set to bear the brunt of reduced trade and capital mobility,\" warns Menon.</p><p>Building climate resilience</p><p>Climate change is possibly one of the most significant financial risks for investors over the long term, says Menon. This risk can materialise in two ways - first is the physical risks from climate change itself, which includes physical damage to properties and assets, disruption to supply chains, production stoppages and reduced agricultural yields which will reduce growth and push prices higher.</p><p>This is followed by transition risk, which comes from government policies, technological advances and shifts in demand patterns aimed at mitigating climate change and promoting sustainability. An example is the introduction of carbon pricing, which will change the earnings profiles of businesses, favouring firms within industries with cleaner technologies and lower carbon emissions, relative to more carbon-intensive firms and industries.</p><p>The effects of climate change on the global economy and asset markets are hard to predict, says Menon. There are inherent uncertainties in modelling climate outcomes and assessing its impact on the global economy. This is due to the limited historical data, potential non-linearities and tipping points in climate systems as well as the long horizons over which climate change materialises.</p><p>Hence, asset managers will need to build climate resilience into their portfolios, Menon highlights. They need to consider how climate change could affect the businesses that their portfolio is invested in; which firms within the portfolio have not made credible efforts to decarbonise their operations; as well as the investments that run the risk of being stranded assets in a net-zero world.</p><p>There have been significant policy moves on the sustainability front that will attract very keen invested interest in the years to come, notes Menon. In the US, the introduction of the Inflation Reduction Act will direct nearly US$400 billion in federal funding to incentivise low-carbon investments in areas such as clean energy generation and storage; electrical vehicle manufacturing; and carbon capture. In Europe, meanwhile, the REPowerEU act will mobilise up to EUR300 billion ($572.9 billion) of investment in areas such as renewable energy storage and energy efficiency to achieve the 2030 target of a renewable share of 45% in energy production.</p><p>There are also significant opportunities for sustainable investing in Asia. According to McKinsey's estimates, net zero by 2050 would require about US$9.2 trillion of investment per year, out of which about a third would be in the Asia Pacific.</p><p>\"Southeast Asia has high potential for climate action. Estimates from Bain &amp; Co show that five sectors - renewable energy, electric vehicles, forest conservation, built environment and sustainable farming - account for 60% of Southeast Asia's carbon abatement potential. For example, renewables such as solar and wind will reach an annual US$30 billion opportunity by 2030 while electric mobility will get an annual $50 billion opportunity by the same period,\" says Menon.</p><p>To meet these needs, blended financing should be catalysed, he adds. Catalytic or concessional capital from multilateral banks, public and philanthropic sources is also needed to improve project bankability and crowd-in private sector capital.</p><p>\"We need to also strengthen the financial ecosystem to deploy blended finance at scale. This involves looking beyond the financing of individual projects and moving to a portfolio approach where concentration risks can be reduced through a diversified pool of assets,\" Menon concludes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67SB-1N81-DYX1-T2HD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1458\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

available, is not easily accessible nor comparable,\" the JC3 said.</p><p>Following the publication of the Data Catalogue and Accompanying Report, the JC3 will focus efforts in 2023 on working with data providers to resolve data accessibility issues; improve the quality, comparability and consistency of existing data sources; and develop strategies to substantially reduce data gaps.</p><p>At its latest meeting, the JC3 also discussed plans to develop and launch several pilot programmes in 2023, and to actively seek out projects with high impacts on expanding sustainable and transition

The first, published in August, detailed the underlying science of climate change; the third will look at ways of reducing those impacts.</p><p> \"This (second part of the report) recognises the interdependence of climate, biodiversity and people and integrates natural, social and economic sciences more strongly than earlier IPCC assessments,\" Lee said. \"It emphasises the urgency of immediate and more ambitious action to address climate risks. Half measures are no longer an option.\"</p><p>Urgent action required</p><p> Claire Aubertin-Noel, Growth Markets Corporate Strategy and Sustainability Centre of Excellence lead at global professional services company Accenture, said the IPCC report is \"the ultimate wake-up call for global climate action\".</p><p> \"There has to be a sense of urgency; the time to act is now. While a multitude of companies have been publishing net-zero targets - which is a good first step, as they did not even exist a year ago - what will now drive progress is the pace of implementation.</p><p> \"Businesses need to walk the talk in addressing climate change, executing on their public commitments.\"</p><p> Aubertin-Noel pointed out that funding is available - US$130 trillion of assets, which the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero (GFANZ) has committed to being net zero by 2050 - while efforts are being made to harmonise global reporting standards for environment, social and governance (ESG)-related disclosures, which will bring transparency into what has traditionally been an opaque market.</p><p> \"So the challenge is now execution. Given the mounting pressure from all stakeholders - including regulators - ESG measurement is undeniably a top priority for all companies, and has moved from a CSR (corporate social responsibility) topic to a CEO (chief executive officer) agenda,\" she said.</p><p> Arjun Sethi, head of global management consulting firm Kearney's Apac region and vice-chair of Kearney's Digital Transformation Practice, feels the same sense of urgency; he said the IPCC's stark warning for all stakeholders reiterates the importance of direct and immediate action.</p><p> \"Businesses can no longer write off climate change as a problem for the next CEO; the status quo is falling away and there is a real cost to inaction, whether you are a government, global multinational or an SME (small and medium-sized enterprise),\" he said.</p><p> Jo Feng, senior vice-president, Asia area, at global biopharmaceutical business AstraZeneca, points out that \"the good news is that change is still within our grasp - but only if we all act swiftly and in every way we can\".</p><p> \"What we need to do now is focus on what changes can be made, through taking a science-driven approach, and how we mitigate the impact of climate change. Building resilience is key,\" she added.</p><p> Manish Pant, zone president, East Asia &amp; Japan, Schneider Electric, a global specialist in energy management and automation, believes climate change is a true challenge for humanity, and consumers, governments, and corporates all have a role to play in tackling climate change.</p><p> \"This includes rethinking approaches to energy and reducing carbon emissions drastically by establishing more sustainable practices,\" he said.</p><p>Efforts to adapt</p><p> But just as important as addressing the cause of climate change, through mitigation efforts such as decarbonisation, is the need to adapt to the effect of climate change - by changing the way we live.</p><p> Examples of climate adaptation include strengthening sea walls to brace for rising sea levels, managing forests to reduce the risk of forest fires and to prevent landslides, and planting crops that would be more resilient to weather extremes.</p><p> Adaptation solutions also abound in urban planning - an area in which governments and corporations can unite their efforts; these can take the form of climate-proofing infrastructure or greening buildings.</p><p> Climate adaptation efforts are crucial because weather extremes - such as increased heatwaves, droughts and floods - are already exceeding plants' and animals' tolerance thresholds, according to the IPCC's latest report; such events have also exposed millions of people to acute food and water insecurity.</p><p> Ambitious, accelerated action is therefore needed to adapt to climate change - at the same time as making rapid, deep cuts in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions - to avoid mounting loss of life, biodiversity and infrastructure, the IPCC added.</p><p> Feng says this means that scaling up investment in adaptation is no longer optional, given that the ability of nature and humanity to adapt to it will be outpaced without urgent action. \"There is no doubt climate change and our adaptation to it is one of the most complex issues that we face today.\"</p><p> Sethi agrees. \"We can't meet 2022 conditions and reach 2030 targets with a business model from 2015, whether you are a government or a private company,\" he said.</p><p> \"Scaling up investment in adaptation efforts will be useful to fund more effective initiatives in full, rather than half-measures, but without modernising climate strategies and incorporating effective metrics, these investments may have a limited impact.\"</p><p> Pant believes that governments worldwide must make a strong commitment to such efforts and take the lead in laying out the plans, implementing the relevant policy changes and regulations, and putting in place funding support to fuel the relevant adaptation strategies.</p><p> \"As the size and value of climate-related risks increase, corporates must also look at strategies to transform their business to adjust to the changing climate,\" he added.</p><p> Adaptation will be critical here in Asia, says Aubertin-Noel, given the region's contribution to GHG emissions, its population size - with the Asia-Pacific region representing 60 per cent of the world's population - and its growing economic heft.</p><p>COP27 and financing</p><p> So far, progress in adaptation has been uneven, says the IPCC: most observed adaptation is fragmented, small in scale, designed to respond to current impacts or near-term risks, and focused more on planning rather than implementation, with the largest adaptation gaps existing among the lower-income population groups.</p><p> Many will therefore be looking to this year's UN Climate Change Conference, COP27, to be held in Egypt in November, for governments' policy stances in this regard - and for indications on how poorer nations will be aided in their efforts.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel, citing a 2021 United Nations Global Compact-Accenture CEO Study on Sustainability, said the UN Environment Programme has estimated that adaptation costs will keep rising - reaching US$140 billion to US$300 billion a year in 2030, and US$280 billion to US$500 billion in 2050.</p><p> COP27 is likely to see financing efforts continue to push for adaptation strategies and solutions, especially to support those countries most at risk from climate change, Sethi said.</p><p> In Feng's view, the conference will be a welcome opportunity to build on commitments to achieve shared goals of reducing emissions and the impact of climate change, while also bringing a focus on funding for developing nations.</p><p>Partnerships</p><p> Pundits agree that concerted and coordinated action by various stakeholders will be needed to push through what has been deemed necessary by the IPCC to save the planet.</p><p> \"At every level of action,\" Sethi says, \"collaboration and cross-regional support hold the power to drive mutually beneficial sustainable efforts and create lucrative partnerships that benefit the environment, the people, and help a company survive the coming changes ... Regulation, technologies and initiatives must be implemented quickly for maximum impact.\"</p><p> Feng says greater collaboration through public-private partnerships is needed, along with genuine representation from developing countries most at risk of the consequences of climate change, to drive forward efforts to decarbonise. \"Science tells us it's time for everyone to do their part to limit the impacts of the climate crisis on our planet, and global partnership-driven initiatives play a crucial role in ensuring a secure future. No organisation, government, or institution can do it alone.\"</p><p> Pant believes that transformative policy change across more economies is urgently needed in order to decarbonise at the speed and scale required to achieve net-zero by 2050. \"This is because action from governments can accelerate even more action from companies,\" he said.</p><p> Aubertin-Noel agrees: \"Global companies can make an impact not only on the countries where they operate, but also on their ecosystem, such as the social and economic fabric, to influence consumers to make smarter, more eco-conscious choices.\"</p><p> Pant adds that technology will play a key role in aiding such efforts: digitisation, powered by the Internet of Things, can help companies create achievable targets for a greener future and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy, while technological solutions can also help rural communities to become more productive, efficient and increase their local revenues. \"Apart from efforts by local governments, corporates too have a vital role to play in enabling access to energy and allowing energy-poor populations to develop in a sustainable way,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A farmer walking among orange trees dried out by drought in Morocco's agricultural heartland in 2020.

The production plant consumes an average of 510 megawatt-hours of electricity a month.</p><p> Ms Fu noted that the building facade has also been designed to reduce heat gain to the building. A hybrid cooling system with air-conditioners, ceiling fans and thermal diffusers helps to optimise energy usage and improve air circulation and ventilation. </p><p> Takeda has 650 employees in Singapore.</p><p> Asked if there are any plans to convert the rest of its buildings to net-zero or energy-positive ones, the company said that the Woodlands site will serve as a blueprint for future site operations. </p><p> As to how it went from a net-zero building to an energy-positive one, a company spokesman said that this was the result of innovation, coming up with new ideas with its external partners, as well as automation and digitalisation -- which provided it access to the amount of energy the building produces and consumes.</p><p> Ms Fu said that companies like Takeda play an important role in the ongoing fight against climate change, especially with increasing evidence and data pointing to the fact that temperatures have been on the rise, and that countries must act immediately. </p><p> Senior vice-president and head of healthcare at the Singapore Economic Development Board Goh Wan Yee said that achieving positive energy sets a \"new precedent and standard\" for Singapore's biopharmaceutical industry, and is testament to the ecosystem's capabilities to support companies to go beyond net zero and contribute towards Singapore's sustainability targets. </p><p> Takeda's global manufacturing and supply officer Thomas Wozniewski said: \"The inauguration of our first positive-energy building is another milestone demonstrating how Takeda delivers on its commitment to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in our own operations before 2035.\" </p><p> The company said that it has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2040, which includes reducing its greenhouse gas emissions from its entire value chain, extending beyond its business operations, including shipping, research and development, as well as product packaging. </p><p> It is also investing in renewable energy and carbon offset projects to meet this goal. </p><p> As at 2021, Takeda has reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent compared with its baseline year of 2015. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Takeda's manufacturing support building is able to produce more renewable energy than it consumes, making it energy-positive and winning it the Green Mark Platinum Positive Energy award.

Its track record of sharing its developmental experience and undertaking humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations has been reinforced through efforts like the International Solar Alliance,  launched in 2015, and the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure in 2019. </p><p> In the Pacific, its efforts span initiatives such as the deployment of off-grid solar energy,  rolling out 4G telecom services, and giving assistance during the pandemic. </p><p> \"What India has to offer the Pacific Islands is what they really need,\" said Ms Cleo Paskal, a non-resident senior fellow at the Foundation for Defence of Democracies, a think-tank based in Washington. \"India has the ability to bolster real human security in areas like low-cost and reliable health, education, IT and transport, including at the village level.\" </p><p>India's democratic credentials add further appeal to its role as an alternate development partner in the region. Nauru's High Commissioner to India, Ms Marlene Moses, said: \"We are eager to strengthen our partnership with the most populous democracy.\" </p><p> \"India's longstanding policy of non-interference into the domestic affairs of their partners is a very welcome model for peace and cooperation in the region,\" she said in an e-mail to The Sunday Times. </p><p>India's gift of 10,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines in 2021 helped Nauru, with a population of 12,500, vaccinate all its adults. </p><p> Demonstrating the importance accorded to India by the PICs, PNG's Prime Minister James Marape will receive Mr Modi at the airport and leaders from all 14 FIPIC member countries will attend the summit. Mr Joe Biden was expected to join the Indian Prime Minister in a \"historic\" meeting with Pacific Islands leaders in Port Moresby but the United States President cancelled his trip to PNG, leaving India to take centre stage. </p><p> However, New Delhi has a lot of catching up to do, especially when it comes to rivalry with China in Oceania. Its bilateral trade with the FIPIC islands in 2021-2022 was valued at US$571.66 million (S$769 million), just about a tenth of China's trade of US$5.3 billion with the PICs in 2021. </p><p>India's diplomatic presence in the PIC network is also merely bookended by its two missions in PNG and Fiji, unlike China's wider presence in these island countries with its total of eight missions. </p><p> Challenges abound as well beyond the razzmatazz of high-profile announcements. Sustaining the momentum between such summits and delivering on commitments is not easy, because of overstretched government machinery and a poor understanding of what is actually needed on the ground in the Pacific, among other reasons. </p><p>Ms Paskal said India could appoint more honorary consuls across the region and even set up an \"Oceania House\" in Delhi to help the PICs build a presence in India. And like China, which has directed much of its Pacific outreach from the coastal Guangdong province, India too could designate a coastal state in South India to facilitate its engagement with the Pacific. </p><p> \"The kind of anti (beach)-erosion technologies that's useful on the coast of Kerala is also useful on the coasts of Tuvalu,\" she added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A banner in Port Moresby featuring Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister James Marape (left) and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi for the third summit of the Forum for India-Pacific Islands Cooperation.

This means any drastic heating or cooling of the earth brought on by climate change would likely spell doom for them.</p><p> In a study of more than 100 species of insects, an international team led by researchers at the University of Bristol found that for every 1 deg C shift in the environment's temperature, insects could internally adjust their survival temperature range by only 0.092 deg C when temperatures rise, and 0.147 deg C when the environment cools.</p><p> Ms Hester Weaving, a PhD student at the university's School of Biological Sciences and lead author of the study, said this means insects are physiologically unable to tolerate temperatures of a wider range.</p><p> As a result, many insects may have to migrate to places with temperatures that suit them or change their behaviours, such as being more active at night if it gets too hot in the day.</p><p> Ms Weaving said: \"Our comparative study identified some major gaps in understanding insect responses to climate change, and we urge more studies to be done on species in under-represented groups and locations.\"</p><p> Besides this, the study published in this month's edition of scientific journal Nature also reported that juvenile insects have a greater ability to acclimatise to temperatures.</p><p> This suggests that there may be critical periods of life when insects can better compensate for changes in temperature, which may improve their climate resilience later in life.</p><p> The study said: \"Insects fulfil diverse ecological roles as pollinators, agricultural pests and disease vectors, and there is global concern over recent, rapid declines in abundance of rare, ecologically or agriculturally important species and, conversely, spikes in pest outbreaks.\"</p><p> It added that how insects respond to climate change via their adaptability to temperatures remains an important topic of debate.</p><p> As a continuation of its research, the team is currently investigating how the reproduction of insects is affected by exposure to extreme temperatures. This may be important in predicting future distributions of insects.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1087377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66DP-3641-DYX4-0033-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"379\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

We reaffirmed the need to uphold international law and rules-based multilateralism while maintaining a strong defence to safeguard our sovereignty and security.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Original Press Release:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">March 7 -- Prime Minister's Office, Government of Singapore issued the following speech by Leader of the House, Minister Indranee Rajah:</p><p>Transcript of speech by Leader of the House, Minister Indranee Rajah at the conclusion of the Committee of Supply debates for Budget 2023 on 6 March 2023.</p><p>A Budget to Move Forward in a New Era</p><p>Mr Speaker, we have come to the end of the Committee of Supply (COS). It has been a long two weeks for Members, and not least for yourself, having somewhat less liberty than Members to move in and out of the Chamber.</p><p>Over the last two weeks, we had close to 70 hours of debate. 58 Members spoke over the two and a half days of the Budget debate. And we covered 661 cuts over seven days of Committee of Supply.</p><p>With the approval of the Government's fiscal policy for FY2023/24 and the estimates of expenditure in the Committee of Supply, and the passing of the Supply Bills a few minutes ago, this Parliament has taken an important step forward in positioning Singapore well for the post-pandemic future. The policies and strategies that we have debated and approved will help us navigate a world that is vastly different to the one we knew before the pandemic. A world that is much more complicated and unpredictable, characterised by slower growth, higher inflation, greater geopolitical contestations, fragmentation in the global economy, and a looming climate crisis.</p><p>Budget 2023 will enable us to adapt more nimbly to this changed world and to secure our future, anchored by a fair, sound and sustainable fiscal plan. Let me do a quick recap.</p><p>Against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions and an evolving world order, we reaffirmed the need to uphold international law and rules-based multilateralism while maintaining a strong defence to safeguard our sovereignty and security. Russia's invasion of Ukraine serves as a continuing reminder that Singapore's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity must never be taken for granted.</p><p>In the face of a looming climate crisis, this Budget builds on previous budgets, and reinforces our commitment to sustainability and strengthens Singapore's climate resilience. In Budget 2021, we unveiled the Singapore Green Plan 2030. In Budget 2022, we took bold steps to raise our national climate ambitions at a time when many countries are struggling to stay the course, including increasing the carbon tax. Budget 2023 continues our efforts to work with our businesses, communities, and individuals, with a view to achieving net zero by 2050.</p><p>Apart from climate resilience, we also discussed food resilience and how to diversify food imports, produce our own food, and keep food affordable in the HDB heartlands.</p><p>Developing our businesses</p><p>Members also spoke about the need for companies and workers to adjust to major structural shifts, including an accelerated green transition, digitalisation, greater economic nationalism and protectionism. This brings about both opportunities and challenges. This Budget focuses our efforts on helping businesses and workers ride the winds of change, while helping them tide through this period of weaker growth and higher inflation.</p><p>On the economic front, we endorsed our approach of:</p><p>a. Attracting high-quality investments and developing new growth sectors such as sustainability in the tourism and transport sectors,</p><p>b. Strengthening global and regional cooperation by forging new cross-border agreements with like-minded partners in overlapping areas of interest such as the digital economy and sustainability, to enhance market access and create new opportunities for our businesses,</p><p>c. And encouraging economy-wide innovation and extending the necessary bespoke support to help our SMEs grow into globally leading companies through various measures, including the Enterprise Innovation Scheme, SME Co-Investment Fund, and Singapore Global Enterprises initiative.</p><p>Supporting our workers</p><p>We recognised - as we always have - that the end goal of economic growth is to provide Singaporeans with good employment opportunities and wages.To that end, we supported the appointment of Jobs-Skills Integrators to better translate skills training into employment outcomes. To ensure no workers are left behind, we supported the Uplifting Employment Credit, the enhanced Enabling Employment Credit and Progressive Wage Credit Scheme. And we agreed to protect all our workers by keeping the workplaces safe and inclusive, and to safeguard their future by enhancing retirement adequacy.</p><p>In this Budget, we also rightly acknowledged the cooperation, hard work and sacrifices of everyone in our long fight against COVID-19, especially our healthcare workers who soldiered at the frontline of our pandemic response. We considered how to protect and better support our healthcare workers in their careers. We will apply the valuable lessons learnt to transform the Public Service and our healthcare system to serve Singaporeans better.</p><p>Strengthening our social compact</p><p>We approved additional support measures under the Assurance Package and enhanced the permanent GST Voucher scheme, with most support extended to the lower-income families. We also topped up the ComCare Endowment Fund to provide additional support to the lower-income families. Through our endorsement of these moves, we signaled to Singaporeans that they can be assured we will see them through this challenging period of rising inflation and cost of living pressures.</p><p>Families, marriage and parenthood took centre stage in this Budget, and aptly so, given that the Budget Statement was delivered on Valentine's Day. We increased the financial support for the early years of raising a child. We doubled Unpaid Infant Care Leave and Government-paid Paternity Leave, sending a strong signal to fathers of the need for paternal involvement when a child is born and to encourage greater shared parenting responsibilities. We would also better support parents in balancing their work and family commitments through Flexible Work Arrangements.</p><p>As Minister in the Prime Minister's Office helping oversee marriage and parenthood measures, I also want to add that these measures are just the beginning of an important shift, where the whole of society moves to become one that values family well-being and supports caregiving both for the young and the old, and acts accordingly.</p><p>We reaffirmed the critical role that early childhood education plays in a child's holistic development and agreed to close the gap in preschool enrolment rates. KidSTART will be scaled up nationwide and Government-supported preschool places will be expanded. We will strengthen the multiple progression pathways in our education system and in our society.</p><p>From babies and children, we looked to the other end of the age spectrum, and committed to refresh our approach to aged care, anchored on preventive care, to help our seniors age gracefully by staying healthy, active and engaged in their communities. We also topped up the ElderCare Fund and MediFund to provide targeted assistance for seniors with long-term care and healthcare needs.</p><p>Every year, there will be one ministry that receives intense interest and the highest number of cuts. This year was no exception. And this year, the distinction went to MND, not surprising with the high interest in housing issues. The Minister for National Development assured Singaporeans that we will continue to make public housing affordable and accessible, and that we will redouble efforts to deliver keys to those who have been waiting for their BTO flats. We will increase the supply of BTO flats and give additional priority to younger married couples and families who are trying to buy their first home.</p><p>Being a nature-loving nation, no animal was left behind either. From flats, we moved on to animated debate on rats, cats and cockerels. This year did not see the appearance of otters or wild boars but no doubt they will find their way into future budgets!</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>Mr Speaker as you can see, we have covered much ground in the last two weeks. Now it remains to put all our plans into action.</p><p>On this note, I would like to thank Members for their active participation and strong support over the past two weeks.</p><p>Mr Speaker, on behalf of this House, I would also like to express our appreciation to you and your deputies for presiding over the proceedings in a fair and even-handed manner, and ensuring the Standing Orders were observed.

Good morning, and welcome to Singapore. I am pleased to join you at the FIDIC 2023 Global Infrastructure Conference.</p><p>2. Today, as we come together to discuss sustainable strategies for a better world, it is fitting to recognise the journey of the International Federation of Consulting Engineers (FIDIC) over the last 110 years. Beginning with three members in 1913 to its current stature with more than 100 members from around the world, FIDIC has contributed much to our living environment. Allow me to extend my congratulations on reaching this milestone!</p><p>3. As a grouping for consulting engineers, FIDIC's role has expanded beyond its initial position as the international voice of the consulting engineering industry. It has become a beacon of innovation and sustainability, and a testament to the dedication and foresight of engineers who have helped to reshape our world.</p><p>Role of Engineers to Water Management in Singapore</p><p>4. We have much to thank the engineering industry for. In Singapore, engineers play an instrumental role in helping us navigate the unique challenges of our environment and circumstances, marked by our limited land space, highly built-up cityscape and tropical weather. Therefore, simply replicating measures from other countries would not suffice. Instead, we must adapt and fine-tune these approaches to align with our specific needs and unique circumstances, a task at which our engineers excel in.</p><p>5. Take, for example, our approach to managing water and energy needs in Singapore. Our engineers have to consider how to optimise land-use in Singapore, while tackling our water and energy needs. Our engineers have found ways to utilise the broad surface areas of our reservoirs by deploying floating solar platforms. Additionally, they have created more room for further urban development by freeing up 150 hectares of land previously occupied by water pumping stations aboveground. This was achieved by constructing underground sewers to convey used water by gravity to water reclamation plants. 150 hectares of land may not sound like a lot to many of you from larger countries, but Singapore is only a small island of 730 square kilometres, so 150 hectares saved from infrastructure to use more meaningfully is a huge saving.</p><p>6. But beyond devising innovative solutions in water management for land-scarce Singapore, we also need engineers - and the appropriate infrastructures - to help us keep pace with the increasing demands for water in a growing population and economy.</p><p>7. Currently, our daily water consumption is approximately 440 million gallons, equivalent to around 800 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Projections suggest that this demand will nearly double by 2065, with the non-domestic sector accounting for almost half of our total water consumption. To tackle this challenge, we are committed to collecting, treating, reclaiming, and reusing every drop of used water while expanding our water resources.</p><p>Building a Sustainable Future</p><p>8. This commitment takes on added significance in the context of climate change. Weather events that were once rare are now becoming more frequent. Aside from the increased risk of haze, the intensification of El Nio conditions - predicted to persist until the end of 2023 - could lead to more droughts and water shortages across the region.</p><p>9. This reality underscores the importance of long-term planning and investments in resilient infrastructure and sustainable practices to safeguard our communities. Engineers, as problem solvers and innovators, are not merely key players in building a sustainable future but also our protectors against climate change. For the many of you in our midst today, you play a pivotal role in addressing the unique challenges posed by climate change whichever country you are residing in. Whether it is addressing water scarcity or reinforcing coastal defences against rising sea levels, engineers are best placed to lead the global charge against climate change. In the search for alternative cleaner energy sources, engineers, again, play a very important role. To combat climate change, we need good engineering solutions to help us transit into a low-carbon future.</p><p>10. Building a sustainable future requires engineers to collaborate, not just among themselves, but more importantly across borders and geographies. International collaboration is crucial, as it allows engineers to pool resources and work together to find new ideas and solutions that transcend geographical boundaries. One avenue for engineers to effect change is through active participation in fora like the Conference FIDIC has organised today. Global initiatives such as international research partnerships and knowledge-sharing networks will help to catalyse innovative ideas and spark new innovations and bring about change. In doing so, engineers will have the opportunity to drive transformative change on both national and international fronts.</p><p>11. Through these efforts, engineers can become catalysts for positive change, leading the way towards a more sustainable and resilient future for future generations, echoing the legacy of our forefathers who had worked hard to make the world a better place.</p><p>Singapore's Commitment to Sustainability</p><p>12. Even as we find ways to tackle the existential threats that come with climate change, we must also prioritise minimising our impact on the planet. To that end, Singapore is fully committed to accelerating our sustainability efforts and transitioning toward a low-carbon future. In 2021, we launched our Singapore Green Plan 2030 as a nationwide movement to tackle climate change. This comprehensive plan charts bold and concrete strategies for Singapore to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p>13. The Green Plan not only focuses on decarbonising our economy and increasing the use of renewable resources, but also emphasises the importance of enhancing Singapore's climate resilience.</p><p>14. Integral to the Green Plan is the latest edition of the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, which was similarly launched in 2021. The Masterplan clearly outlines our ambitious sustainability goals for the Built Environment - to achieve \"80-80-80 in 2030\":</p><p>* 80% of our buildings to be green by 2030;</p><p>* 80% of new developments to be Super Low Energy (SLE) buildings from 2030;</p><p>* and 80% improvement in energy efficiency (over 2005 levels) for best-in-class green buildings by 2030.</p><p>15. The Masterplan creates significant opportunities for engineers to contribute to sustainability. Sustainable infrastructure projects not only fulfil critical societal needs, but also minimise environmental impact and enhance long-term resilience. In doing so, engineers can champion for a more sustainable future, where infrastructure serves as a cornerstone of both progress and our responsibility to the environment.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>16. Let me conclude. The progress of society at large is very much intertwined with the good work of the men and women in the engineering industry. While the challenges of climate change may not make your work any easier, they underscore the vital role you play in addressing the most pressing issues of our time.</p><p>17. You have the unique privilege and responsibility to venture into uncharted territories, question prevailing norms, and shape an enduring future. I am confident that the insights and connections forged today will serve as a wellspring of inspiration and progress.</p><p>18. Thank you, and I wish everyone a great day ahead.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp; Defense, Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062271721</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695D-4TB1-JB5M-W52D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1506\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 12, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Business &amp;

Good morning.</p><p>1. I am pleased to join you today at Grow Asia's Investment Forum 2023. I would like to thank Grow Asia for its continued efforts to strengthen and develop sustainable agriculture and reliable food supplies across Southeast Asia. This is a crucial area of work.</p><p>2. Our global food system is facing challenging times. Around the world, climate change and geopolitical tensions are causing significant disruptions to global food supplies. The war in Ukraine significantly disrupted grain and fertiliser export from the breadbasket of Europe. This fuelled inflation and prompted several countries to introduce export restrictions to protect domestic food supplies.</p><p>3. We are also increasingly seeing the impacts of climate change on food production yields. Last year saw multiple temperature records being broken, and extreme weather events such as floods and heavy rainfall impacting multiple regions. These are stark reminders of the vulnerability of the global food system, and even more so, the urgent need for a resilient and sustainable food system in Asia.</p><p>4. Food systems are not mere victims of climate change. It is also a cause of climate change. Through land clearing, loss of biodiversity, the irresponsible use of pesticides, fungicides impacting the environment, serious creation of greenhouse gases in the process of agriculture. It is really our responsibility to look at how we can make it good.</p><p>5. One thing is clear - that we must place food security as a priority. We need to transform our food systems to achieve better productivity, climate-resilience, and resource-efficiency. This will require more financing, innovation and collaboration.</p><p>6. And this is where the Grow Asia Investment Forum can play an important role. \"Investing in Food System Transformation\" can drive transformative change in our region through partnerships in blended finance, innovation in sustainable agricultural development, and collaboration to improve livelihoods of farming communities.</p><p>7. By leveraging climate finance through a public-private blended financing model, to the tune of US$1b, the GrowBeyond Fund has the potential of supporting over 200,000 farmers over the next 10 years to access finance and technical assistance. This model builds upon public private partnerships, by combining public and private funds to leverage the strengths of both sectors, to address the needs of food systems transformation.</p><p>8. It is estimated that with these investments, farms will see an increase in productivity of up to 30 per cent, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of up to 30 per cent. Such impact investments are what the world needs now. It will not only strengthen the region's food security but also contribute towards environment sustainability.</p><p>9. Technology and innovation will be a key enabler for the region's food system transformation. In Singapore, we are working with our agri-food industry to build our capability and capacity to produce 30 per cent of our nutritional needs in a sustainable manner by 2030.</p><p>10. To achieve this, we are investing in R&amp;D and supporting our farms in their take-up of productive farm systems. Under the Singapore Food Story R&amp;D programme, we have committed more than $300 million to fund innovative research projects that address key challenges of our agrifood industry. These include urban agriculture and aquaculture practices, future foods and food safety.</p><p>11 For instance, we have awarded two projects led by NUS and Republic Polytechnic to improve the shelf-life and nutritional quality of commonly consumed local vegetables such as kailan, bok choy and choy sum. Such translational R&amp;D efforts will also be relevant to agri-food industries in the region and help to enhance our collective food security.</p><p>12. We are supporting our farms in deploying technology to raise productivity, by co-funding farming infrastructure and systems. First through the Agriculture Productivity Fund (APF), and now with the S$60 million Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund.</p><p>13. Many farms have tapped on these funds to deploy technology and innovation. Take Green Harvest for instance, which had tapped on the APF for capability upgrading. They have invested in a new modern greenhouse and transformed from a soil-based conventional vegetable farming to a highly mechanised and automated, climate-controlled growing techniques without the use of pesticides, and with only 19 workers on-site. With a plot size of 2 hectares, they are expected to produce 700 tonnes per hectare per year. This is more than 5 times the average productivity of traditional farming methods.</p><p>14. Beyond research, we are supporting our industry by optimising land use through holistic land planning and innovative design. With less than 1% of our land set aside for agri-food production, we have to 'grow more with less'.</p><p>15. We are transforming the Lim Chu Kang region into a vibrant, productive agri-food cluster, with the active participation of our farmers and stakeholders. The region is being planned with possible features such as: infrastructure to support high productivity farming; shared services and facilities, such as solid waste treatment, packing facilities for farms to achieve economies of scale; and circular economy principles to optimise resource use.</p><p>16. How do we encourage farmers to pull resources together, allowing the waste stream of one entity to be used as input of another? Having that facilitation in a small area in Lim Chu Kang will reduce the logistical requirements, and the carbon footprint of the entire sector. That is really the vision of a highly productive, resource resilient and sustainable model of agriculture in Singapore.</p><p>17. We are also transforming our sea spaces to unlock the potential for sustainable fish farming. We are working closely with the aquaculture industry, academics, and nature groups to increase productivity in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>18. Collaboration is key in this transformation. I am glad this forum has brought together many like-minded stakeholders and senior leaders across various sectors. The transformation of our food systems will require more financing, innovation and collaboration. When we put our minds together and tap on the strengths and networks of other stakeholders, we can achieve far greater outcomes.</p><p>19. I encourage you to make full use of this forum to exchange knowledge, explore collaborations, and take steps closer to the solutions we need to strengthen our region's food security. There will be further platforms in Singapore to exchange knowledge and explore collaborations, such as the Singapore International Agri-food Week later this year. I would like to invite you to join us then.</p><p>20. Let me conclude. The challenges facing our region's food security are already at our doorstep, and we must act decisively to build the resilience of our food supplies. Yet, the challenges on hand are bigger than any single country alone. We must work together, tap on one another's strengths, and collaborate to ultimately achieve a win-win outcome.</p><p>21. Once again, thank you Grow Asia for inviting me to speak at this summit. I wish you all a fruitful forum ahead.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062271720</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695D-4TB1-JB5M-W52F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1425\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 12, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>Business &amp;

Rising sea levels are another threat since many power plants are sited near coastlines.</p><p> Recent disasters reveal how exposed power systems are.</p><p> In California, for instance, huge demand for air-conditioning this month has pushed the state's grid to the brink. Several large hydropower plants that provide power to millions in the western US are facing critically low water levels.</p><p> In Texas in February last year, a series of intense winter storms knocked out much of the state's power generation, causing widespread outages.</p><p> The risks are rising as demand for power is also growing, as economies in Asia and elsewhere consume more energy. For example, global residential stocks of air-conditioning could increase by another two-thirds by 2030, the IEA said.</p><p> Dr Zhong Sheng, a research fellow at the Energy Studies Institute (ESI) at the National University of Singapore, said: \"Due to heatwaves and droughts, there would be significant increases in cooling demand, in industrial, commercial and residential sectors, especially in those highly populated regions.\"</p><p> He added: \"The high demand in cooling in a short period of time leads to further pressures on power generation and can introduce uncertainties to power grids.\"</p><p> One of the top risks is water.</p><p> A record drought and weeks-long heatwave in south-west China has led to dozens of rivers and reservoirs drying up and slashed hydropower generation capacity in Sichuan province by half.</p><p> Hydropower is the biggest source of electricity supply in Sichuan, and it is also the second-largest source of electricity in China at 16 per cent. Coal is the top source.</p><p> In South and South-east Asia, hydropower accounts for 14.5 per cent of total electricity generation, the IEA said in a separate report on the region.</p><p> In some countries such as Bhutan and Nepal, hydropower accounts for over 90 per cent of total electricity generation.</p><p> The installed hydropower capacity is expected to grow further to meet the region's growing electricity demand and electricity export opportunities.</p><p> For example, Laos plans to build more dams to sell power to its neighbours and Singapore recently began trial imports of power from Laos via Thailand and Malaysia.</p><p> But the IEA noted that rising temperatures, extreme rainfall patterns, melting glaciers and floods pose serious challenges to South and South-east Asian hydropower.</p><p> The Straits Times, in a recent visit to Nepal, saw first-hand the destruction caused by a recent flood triggered by intense rainfall high in the mountains that carried vast amounts of debris downstream.</p><p> Similar floods are a huge and growing risk to the country's hydropower plants.</p><p> Large amounts of water are also needed for cooling and steam generation in nuclear, coal and gas power plants. The steam is needed to drive turbines to generate power.</p><p> This is why these plants are usually sited next to lakes and rivers or by the sea. But droughts, heatwaves and freezing conditions can disrupt access to water, causing plants to cut back on power generation or shut down.</p><p> Thermal power plants make up about 75 per cent of generating capacity globally.</p><p> What can be done to reduce the risks'</p><p> Burying power lines underground and using deep tunnels, which Singapore does, reduces the risks from hot weather and storms. Singapore has also integrated desalination plants and power stations, boosting water output.</p><p> More water-efficient cooling systems are another resilience measure. Globally, some plants use dry cooling, which involves fans pumping in large volumes of air and using less water.</p><p> The IEA said comprehensive climate risk and impact assessments, strengthening or hardening the design of power systems to better cope with future climate extremes, and broadening the types of power generation can also help.</p><p> Ms Ojasvee Arora, a research associate at ESI, said it is ironic that the power sector is vulnerable to climate change impacts while also being a significant contributor to the crisis - accounting for more than two-thirds of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> She noted that Asean is among the most climate-vulnerable regions in the world and that its electricity demand is also set to increase over the next decade, \"reflecting a true climate-energy paradox\".</p><p> \"Hence, it is important to identify appropriate pathways for the power sector that are more resilient, sustainable and able to meet the increasing electricity demand.</p><p> \"There is also room for further global energy cooperation to enhance climate resilience among Asean countries.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1081085</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6686-P8C1-JCF2-82KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"936\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It has been an engaging two days at this year's World Cities Summit Mayors Forum.</p><p>2. I would like to thank all of you - presenting cities and organisations, our two moderators, the WCS Young Leaders, and all participants - for actively participating and contributing to the Forum.</p><p>3. A special note of thanks goes to our friends from the Seoul Metropolitan Government, who worked diligently behind the scenes to organise this year's programme. We deeply appreciate your excellent arrangements and warm hospitality.</p><p>4. As we round up this year's Mayors Forum, allow me to briefly reflect on some key takeaways and I can do no better than what Greg and Aaron summarised, ten points of the richness of discussion running through the last few days.</p><p>Recap of ideas and initiatives shared during Mayors Forum</p><p>5. We discussed a wide range of topics over the past two days - inclusivity, the importance of heritage conservation, accelerating de-carbonisation and strengthening climate resilience; as well as promoting innovation and creativity.</p><p>6. Many mayors and city leaders shared about the creative programmes that they have implemented to empower the community to make your cities more liveable.</p><p>a. For example, Deputy Mayor Hamidreza from Tehran shared about the innovative \"I am the mayor\" plan, where citizens were asked on how the municipal budget should be allocated and which municipal projects should be prioritized. Many other city leaders such as Deputy Mayor Ristani of Tirana, echoed the transformative effect that participatory budgets can have.</p><p>b. Special Commissioner Agirrezabal from Bilbao shared that the city of Bilbao has set up centres where residents can get treatments for depression and anxiety caused by social isolation. This helps to remove the stigma behind mental health and empower the community to seek help.</p><p>7. Many Mayors also shared how they've identified vulnerable groups and ensured that policies are targeted in helping to level the playing field.</p><p>a. For example, Mayor Desmond Choo shared about Comlink, how the proactive, data-driven, and coordinated approach helps to integrate support across agencies and charities by putting low income families at the heart of what they do.</p><p>b. Another innovative initiative was the Seoul Learn project introduced by Mayor Oh Se-hoon. This project helps to improve equal access to educational opportunities by ensuring that vulnerable youths have access to high quality education materials through a shared online platform.</p><p>8. We've also heard about the different strategies that cities from different continents around the world have taken to conserve and even inject new lease of life into their cultural heritage, such as Gaborone, Sao Paolo, and Budapest.</p><p>9. There were also many innovative ideas on how cities can tackle climate change and its downstream effects.</p><p>a. Many cities have shared about how local governments have taken the lead in adopting new technology such as the use of green hydrogen in Vienna's district heating and cooling efforts, as well as green energy from innovative sources such as the floating panels in Singapore.</p><p>Call to action to try innovative new policies and to collaborate with each other</p><p>10. We also heard city leaders from Seoul and Tallinn speak about the importance of retrofitting old buildings to bring them up to speed on green building technology. We heard about Makassar, Dhaka South, Tallinn, and Antwerp talk about greening of waterways, cities and green spaces. I think all of us remember the Pollinator Highway in Tallinn and Big Link in Antwerp.</p><p>11. Many of you also spoke about the need to go beyond individual projects, to go central, to go district, to go regional - for example, in Vienna - as well as the Young Leaders who shared about how cities can collaborate through waste management and recycling. You also heard from Maputo about how industries can be made green through deliberate planning of industrial parks and deployment of EVs.</p><p>12. We heard about climate actions, we also heard about how Mayors incorporate innovation and creativity to make the lives of citizens better and to help enterprises flourish. We heard about the open-source data-driven approach taken by Taipei City Dashboard, we heard about construction productivity in Singapore, we heard about the whole range of start-up incubators and launchpad service in Singapore, and Brunei's iCentre. We heard about the support in Danang for SMEs as well as the innovation efforts to support startups in Sebarang Perai in Penang. In Antwerp, we saw how rainwater harvesting helps cities clean trucks and do their work while being more sustainable.</p><p>13. The use of innovation and knowledge can also help cities differentiate and level up on their competitive advantages. For example, the ambition of Vienna to be city of knowledge, not just in Europe, but also of the world, and how through apprenticeships that are very established in the German-speaking world had enabled a workforce of the future.</p><p>14. We also heard a heed of warning from Prof Lam Khee Poh from NUS, telling us that time is non-renewable - a very important point - and about innovation and technology. The young leaders also suggested more open engagements that can bring the private sector, social sector and people sector together to bring creativity and innovation into today's plans and designs that run our cities, while Isabel from the IFC shared very much about the benefits of technologies in cities. For example, InfraTech - how it leads services for model cities, how it reduces OPEX and CAPEX costs, and how it can bring climate and social impacts to bear positive gains to our cities.</p><p>15. I have not done justice in this very brief summary of all the discussions that have been made during the course of these two days. But, I think the important point is that while we have had very good sharing and discussion, the work of the Mayors Forum must not stop here. I hope that the discussions have inspired you to bring back some of these ideas to your own cities where you can study them, adapt them to your own local context and try them out.</p><p>16. After all, cities wherever we are in the world, share many of the same challenges, from the consequential effects of the pandemic, to other serious concerns like the climate crisis and disruptions brought about by digitalisation and AI. A solution that has worked in one city may have a good chance of success in another city, too. My advice is to learn what makes those projects succeed and adapt them to our local context.</p><p>17. If you were particularly interested in any of the shared initiatives, I hope that you have followed up with the speaker. In fact, one of the key objectives of the Mayors Forum is to build long-lasting networks and trust between different cities and city leaders, between city leaders and the young people and between city leaders and our enterprises, and for the learning and sharing of best practices to extend well beyond these two days. For example, you can organise cross-exchange trips to other cities to get a more in-depth look at how certain policies have been implemented.</p><p>18. In the upcoming editions of the World Cities Summit Mayors Forum, we look forward to hearing more about how mayors and city leaders have taken ideas shared in the Forum discussions as models to learn from and possibly even implement in their home city.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>19. As leaders and city representatives, we are well-positioned to galvanise stakeholders across people, public and private spheres of influence, to think long-term and implement innovative policies. I hope that the Mayors Forum has been helpful to all of you and it was useful to see policies put into practice right here in Seoul.</p><p>20. On that note, I invite all of you to next year's Mayors Forum and the World Cities Summit 2024 in Singapore from 2 to 4 June, and of course, the 2025 WCS Mayors Forum to be hosted in Vienna, Austria our 2020 Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Laureate, where we will take this conversation forward.</p><p>21. We look forward to seeing you all again. Thank you very much and I wish all of you a safe journey back home. May we meet again next year.</p><p>Source: Ministry of National Development, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0062510092</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:698D-6V31-JB5M-W14G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1512\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 26, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000DR88</classCode><className>METROPOLITAN BANK HOLDING CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC6029 COMMERCIAL BANKS, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MCB (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Mayors</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Qjc5QjBGQUU4M0Y4NDVEMEI4Njk1MUVGRjU1NzREMzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

This includes restoration of the coastal beach forest and a new Keppel Coastal Trail, which Keppel Corporation has pledged to donate S$1 million to through the Garden City Fund. The coastal beach forest and Keppel Coastal Trail will act as an important physical and ecological buffer for the adjacent coastal hill forest and enhance ecological connectivity, while allowing visitors to learn more about coastal habitats. Design and development of the Trail will commence in 2022. NParks' efforts to restore the habitats of Labrador Nature Reserve will strengthen its ecological and climate resilience, and allow the public to experience its nature while minimising impact to biodiversity, so as to safeguard and enhance it in the long term.</p><p>NParks also commemorated the 50th anniversary of the nation-wide Tree Planting Day this morning. To mark the occasion, Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee and members of the community planted 50 native coastal trees at Labrador Nature Reserve. In addition, at the event, NParks dedicated Heritage Trees to donors who have contributed to Singapore's greening and conservation efforts through the Garden City Fund, in acknowledgement of the important role that the community plays in transforming Singapore into a City in Nature, one of the key pillars of the Singapore Green Plan. Minister Desmond Lee presented the Heritage Tree plaques to these donors at the event.</p><p>Forest Restoration Action Plan for Labrador Nature Reserve</p><p>First introduced in 2019 for Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve and the Central Nature Park Network, the Forest Restoration Action Plan seeks to strengthen the ecological and climate resilience of our native forests by restoring ecological processes, and enhancing the biodiversity and ecological connectivity in these areas. This will improve the habitats for native biodiversity.</p><p>One of the rare and unique habitats in Labrador Nature Reserve is the coastal hill forest. The 10-hectare coastal hill forest houses plants that grow on land adjacent to the sea and are tolerant to salt exposure and poorer soil conditions, some species of which are now very rare. We are replanting its slopes with suitable native species, including the critically endangered Broad-leaf Fern (Dipteris conjugate). The edges of the coastal hill forest are also being extended through the planting of native coastal plants.</p><p>To further strengthen the ecological and climate resilience of this core habitat, we are restoring a coastal beach forest in the 2.5-hectare area between the coastal hill forest and the sea. This will provide a significant physical and ecological buffer for the coastal hill forest, as well as increased sources of food and shelter for the fauna of Labrador Nature Reserve and its surrounding environment. The area will be planted with native species suited to the coastal environment, and rustic trails and paths will be provided to allow visitors to experience this habitat.</p><p>Our habitat restoration efforts will extend beyond the terrestrial area into the sea. The other habitat which is rare and unique, and which characterises Labrador Nature Reserve, is the rocky shore, as it is the last remaining natural rocky shore on mainland Singapore. The rocky shore comprises coral rubble, sandy substrates and seagrass beds, with rich intertidal faunal diversity. NParks has conducted intertidal surveys of the rocky shore and the seagrasses in collaboration with partners in the nature community. The surveys have recorded a wide diversity of marine species, including Blue-spotted Fantail Rays, eagle rays, and Blacktip Reef Sharks. Long-term monitoring of the rocky shore will guide future enhancement efforts and ensure the continued health of the habitat.</p><p>In conjunction with the forest restoration efforts, compatible recreational uses will be relocated from the core areas to the buffers. There will continue to be opportunities for passive nature recreation, such as educational walks along nature trails, as well as for other recreational activities, at areas further away from the core areas such as the entrance area.</p><p>Keppel Corporation's earlier pledge of S$3 million will contribute to the planting of 10,000 trees as part of the OneMillionTrees movement, about half of which will be at Labrador Nature Reserve and will help to restore the coastal beach forest. Keppel Corporation is now contributing a further S$1 million through the Garden City Fund for a new Keppel Coastal Trail. The Keppel Coastal Trail will weave through the coastal beach forest and will be curated with information boards to allow visitors to learn more about coastal habitats, while providing views of the sea from vantage points along the trail.</p><p>50th Anniversary of Tree Planting Day</p><p>To kick-start the greening of Singapore, former Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had directed that a tree planting campaign be launched in 1963. On 16 June 1963, Mr Lee planted a Mempat tree (Cratoxylum formosum) at Farrer Circus to mark the start of Singapore's greening programme. This was followed by a mass tree planting all over the city - along new roads, on traffic circuses, in housing estates, schools and car parks.</p><p>To support these greening efforts, an annual community tree-planting activity was subsequently inaugurated on 7 November 1971. Then-Acting Prime Minister, Dr Goh Keng Swee, led the community in tree-planting on Singapore's first Tree Planting Day at Mount Faber Park. Island-wide tree-planting activities with the community were led by various Ministers and Members of Parliament in their constituencies. Tree Planting Day has since been included as part of the annual Clean and Green Singapore campaign. It continues to be a significant annual tradition for the community to come together to plant trees as it reflects Singapore's commitment to and support of our climate resilience efforts, the City in Nature vision and the Singapore Green Plan. These efforts have been intensified by the ongoing OneMillionTrees movement with the strong support from community.</p><p>To commemorate the occasion, 50 coastal trees comprising 25 native species were planted at Labrador Nature Reserve. The public can also be a part of this annual event by joining the upcoming OneMillionTrees webinar on Singapore's coastal forests on 13 November 2021 at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2021/11/one-million-trees-webinar-9\">https://www.nparks.gov.sg/activities/events-and-workshops/2021/11/one-million-trees-webinar-9</url>.</p><p>Heritage Trees around Singapore dedicated to donors</p><p>NParks' efforts in greening, research and conservation, as well as education and outreach, would not have been possible without support from the community.

Since the success of a coastal protection project at Pulau Tekong in 2010, NParks has continued to employ nature-based solutions for coastal resilience, with a recently completed project at Kranji Coastal Nature Park. An upcoming coastal protection project will be along approximately 2.2 km of the northern coastline at Pulau Ubin, complemented by a mangrove restoration project at Sungei Durian, located along Pulau Ubin's southern coastline. These projects exemplify NParks' strategies to build climate resilience through the City in Nature vision, a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p><p>In announcing details for the latest edition of the Singapore Red List, Minister highlighted that several species such as the Lesser Mousedeer and Sunda Slow Loris have improved conservation statuses. This is significant as it signals that the resilience of these species have improved in Singapore. This can be attributed to the biodiversity conservation efforts throughout Singapore, including habitat enhancement and species recovery efforts under the NParks Nature Conservation Masterplan as well as increased capabilities and support from the scientific and nature community. In addition, 13 plant and 13 animal species will be added to NParks Species Recovery Programme, bringing the total number to 80 plant and 40 animal species. This will contribute to NParks' new target to have 100 plant and 60 animal species under the programme by 2030.</p><p>Making these announcements at the 10th edition of the Festival of Biodiversity, which was also officiated by President Halimah Yacob, Minister thanked the community for their contributions towards conserving Singapore's natural heritage, including partners of the Biodiversity Roundtable, which has doubled in numbers since the first Festival of Biodiversity in 2012, and Aramco Asia Singapore for their support towards the Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme.</p><p>New CoralAID Mineral Accretion (CAMA) units and marine educational programme, supported by Aramco Asia Singapore</p><p>Under the Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme by NParks' registered charity and IPC, Garden City Fund, NParks will be assessing the efficacy of establishing CoralAID Mineral Accretion (CAMA) units in Singapore's waters to enhance coral growth, as coral recruitment and growth is a slow process. For the first time in Singapore, the new initiative will trial the use of mineral accretion technology to stimulate the growth of hard corals by subjecting them to low-voltage electricity. The trial is supported by an initial seed funding of around $200,000 by Aramco Asia Singapore through the Garden City Fund. In addition, Aramco Asia Singapore will support a new educational programme on local marine biology and marine conservation efforts for schools and the general public from 2021 to 2022. These new initiatives aim to strengthen the resilience of Singapore's coral reefs together with the community.</p><p>Festival of Biodiversity 2021 - 10 years of celebrating Singapore's natural heritage</p><p>Much of what Singapore has achieved in our push to become a City in Nature is due to the strong support of the larger nature community. The Festival of Biodiversity, organised by NParks in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable, is an annual event that showcases and celebrates the community's efforts to conserve Singapore's natural heritage. The Festival aims to deepen appreciation and build stronger ownership of our rich biodiversity among Singaporeans. The United Nations designates 22 May as the International Day for Biological Diversity to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. This year's theme, \"We're part of the solution\" is aligned with NParks' efforts to partner the community in protecting Singapore's biodiversity and enhancing ecological and climate resilience.</p><p>Since the first edition of Festival of Biodiversity 10 years ago, the number of partners who have helped organised the Festival has grown from under 30 to 67 today, including nature groups, schools, work groups comprising academics, individuals and other stakeholders, as well as members from the Friends of the Parks initiative. The number of citizen scientists has also grown from 470 in 2015 to over 9,000 in 2021, and they are part of NParks' growing volunteer base. As of 2021, NParks has more than 54,000 volunteers. NParks will continue to partner the community and enable more Singaporeans to become active stewards of our biodiversity and environment.</p><p>Source: National Parks Board of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0057033889</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PR-GP51-DXMP-K234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 25, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00093PJ</classCode><className>SWORDFISH FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS333316 PHOTOGRAPHIC &amp;

investments\" to help Pakistan recover from last year's devastating floods, saying it was \"doubly victimised\" by climate change and a \"morally bankrupt global financial system\". </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"No country deserves to endure what happened to Pakistan,\" Mr Guterres told an international conference in Geneva, which is seeking billions of dollars to support recovery from the disaster. </p><p> Mr Guterres opened the one-day event appealing to the world to help Pakistan bounce back from floods that submerged a third of the country, killing more than 1,700 people and affecting more than 33 million others. </p><p>Pakistan's Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, who attended with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, called the floods \"a climate disaster of monumental scale\". </p><p> Eight million people were displaced, millions of acres of agricultural land ruined, and around two million homes destroyed, while nine million more people were pushed to the brink of poverty.  </p><p> The United Nations chief hailed the way Pakistan and its people had responded to \"this epic tragedy with heroic humanity\", adding: \"We must match the heroic response of the people of Pakistan with our own efforts and massive investments to strengthen their communities for the future.\"  </p><p>Pakistan's Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework, which it will officially present during Monday's conference, will need US$16.3 billion (S$21.7 billion). </p><p>Pakistan has said the country should be able to cover half the cost, but is asking the international community to fund the rest. </p><p> \"This is the greatest climate disaster in our country's history,\" Mr Zardari said. </p><p> Mr Guterres said the international community had a particular responsibility to help Pakistan, which has been \"doubly victimised by climate chaos and a morally bankrupt global financial system\". </p><p> And he slammed a system that \"routinely denies middle-income countries the debt relief and concessional financing needed to invest in resilience against natural disasters\". </p><p> United States Agency for International Development deputy administrator Isobel Coleman said on Monday that Washington would provide an additional US$100 million in funding for Pakistan's recovery. </p><p> Around 450 participants from some 40 countries had registered for Monday's event. </p><p>French President Emmanuel Macron, his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan and European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen were also expected to address the conference via video link. </p><p> Ahead of the conference, Mr Achim Steiner, head of the UN development agency, described the floods as a \"cataclysmic event\", and said Pakistan would face \"an extraordinary amount of misery\" if the world did not step up and help. </p><p> \"The waters may have receded, but the impacts are still there,\" he told AFP. \"There is a massive reconstruction and rehabilitation effort that needs to be undertaken.\" </p><p> Millions of people remain displaced, and those who have been able to go back home are often returning to damaged or destroyed homes and mud-covered fields that cannot be planted. </p><p> Food prices have soared, and the number of people facing food insecurity has doubled to 14.6 million, according to UN figures. </p><p> The World Bank has estimated that up to nine million more people could be dragged into poverty as a result of the flooding. </p><p>Pakistan and the UN have stressed that Monday's event is broader than a traditional pledging conference, as it seeks to set up a long-term international partnership focused not only on recovery, but also on boosting Pakistan's climate resilience. </p><p>Pakistan, with the world's fifth-largest population, is responsible for less than 1 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions but is one of the most vulnerable nations to extreme weather caused by global warming. </p><p> The country \"is essentially a victim of a world that is not acting fast enough on the challenge of climate change\", Mr Steiner said.</p><p> AFP,

He ignored the wound and hoped it would heal on its own. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But it festered and he ended up spending a week in hospital when he got back to Singapore. He eventually recovered after taking a cocktail of antibiotics. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Such cuts can be a problem because the natural bacterial mix in coral also includes pathogens that are known to cause disease in humans. Dr Huang's encounter with the hidden world of coral microbes would not be his last. </p><p> Now an associate professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS), Dr Huang counts among his research interests a desire to learn more about the tiny things that most people do not see or immediately think about when they look at a coral reef. </p><p> \"Every organism is an ecosystem,\" said Dr Huang, deputy head of the NUS Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum. \"The microscopic life -- the microbes that live in the coral -- all contribute to the functioning of the ecosystem.\" </p><p> Among the most well known of coral microbes are zooxanthellae, single-celled algae that provide the coral with nutrition. But the coral microbiome comprises more than these photosynthetic organisms. For the coral, microbes are part of its defence against external threats, such as rising sea surface temperatures.  </p><p> In the human world, some relationships fall apart at the first sign of trouble. Yet in other matches, one helps the other through tough times. So too in the coral world do these fortuitous couplings exist, with specific pairings between coral and microbiome conferring the organism with more resilience against heat stress. </p><p> \"Depending on the association between the coral and its microbes, the coral can be more resilient to stress,\" said Dr Huang, who also leads the NUS Reef Ecology Laboratory.</p><p> What these pairings are is something that Dr Huang wants to find out. </p><p> With a research grant he received under the Marine Climate Change Science Programme, Dr Huang and his team will play matchmaker, looking for the best matches between coral and microbes which allow the holobiont (referring to both the coral itself and its microbiome) to survive in an ocean set to boil.  </p><p> The programme was launched in 2021 by the National Parks Board (NParks).</p><p> Dr Huang's research joins a host of other research projects taking off in Singapore that aim to look at how coral reefs can withstand the impacts of climate change.</p><p> Even the name of the programme his research is funded under provides a clue -- the Marine Climate Change Science programme, earlier known as the Marine Science Research and Development Programme. </p><p> This focus on climate resilience marks a new chapter in the story of Singapore's coral reef science journey, which previously had a large focus on how reefs can bounce back after loss or degradation due to coastal development. </p><p> \"This change is something that is reflected globally as well,\" said Dr Jani Tanzil, the facility director at Singapore's St John's Island National Marine Laboratory. </p><p> \"Coral reefs are still facing many local threats, like coastal development, urbanisation and sedimentation. But now they also have to deal with climate change.\" </p><p> Climate change, caused by an ever-thickening blanket of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, is a global problem. </p><p> Countries are gathering in Dubai from Nov 30 to Dec 12 for COP28, the United Nations climate change conference, to galvanise climate action and call on nations to taper down the use of fossil fuels to limit global warming. </p><p> But it may take some time yet for global politics -- and national policies -- to catch up with what the science clearly points to. </p><p> In the interim, research efforts that look into increasing the resilience of Singapore's remaining coral reefs, which are clinging on despite the odds, will be paramount if they are to have a fighting chance of survival in a warming planet. </p><p> A story of loss and hopeThe history of Singapore's coral reefs could, depending on how you look at it, be a tragedy or offer a glimmer of hope. Over 60 per cent of coral reefs in the city-state have been lost over the years due to reclamation and coastal development works. Yet life still persists.</p><p> NUS Emeritus Professor Chou Loke Ming, a pioneer in Singapore's marine science and conservation community, saw first-hand the impact of the country's early coastal works. </p><p> \"In the 1960s, the water was clear. Standing on the boat, you could look down and see corals all the way down the reef slope, to depths of 10m or more. I was so taken by their beauty,\" he recalled. Today, coral life is now found mainly in shallower waters, at depths not exceeding 5m.</p><p> In 1977, Prof Chou started the Reef Ecology Laboratory at NUS, and studied various types of reef life -- from tropical fish to nudibranchs (sea slugs). </p><p> The lab in 1989 started testing the feasibility of deploying man-made structures -- including hollow concrete cubes and tyre-pyramid modules -- to improve fish stocks. </p><p> It also conducted a number of reef surveys, with Prof Chou and his colleagues recording species diversity and abundance at various sites. But there was no standardised survey method then, making it hard to compare results across sites in Singapore or even the region, he said. </p><p> In the late 1980s, Prof Chou was among marine biologists from South-east Asia who took part in the Asean-Australia Coastal Living Resources Project. That effort resulted in the development of standardised sampling protocols.</p><p> For Singapore, it also resulted in a useful database of information on the Republic's coastal resources, including mangroves, coral reefs, and soft-bottom benthic (or bottom-dwelling) communities, which include worms and molluscs.</p><p> These developments laid the groundwork for the next phase of marine research efforts in the country: bringing a dying seafloor back to life.  </p><p> Healing a reef In Singapore, mitigation measures usually involve relocation of coral colonies away from sites due to be reclaimed to locations where they can, hopefully, take root and grow. </p><p> One of the earliest recorded efforts to do so was in the early 1990s, when the Nature Society (Singapore) called on over 400 volunteers to shift coral colonies from sites in the southern part of the country due to be reclaimed to Sentosa. </p><p> Barely 10 per cent of the translocated coral survived due to various factors, including an inappropriate choice of recipient site -- the area was often subjected to surge and heavy sedimentation -- and improper methods in securing fragments to substrate that caused the baby corals to be washed away. </p><p> That episode, however, had a silver lining -- it led to improvements in coral relocation techniques and subsequent mitigation projects.  </p><p> In the early 2000s, there was a global shift towards taking a \"gardening approach\" to reef restoration, said Dr Tanzil.</p><p> Inspired by the forest restoration efforts on land, the global coral community reasoned that a two-step protocol -- \"gardening\" small colonies in nurseries and then transplanting them to damaged areas -- could improve the chances of rejuvenating a reef. </p><p> In Singapore, too, the movement took off, with coral research coalescing around two parallel tracks: the development of artificial reefs for reef restoration, and the use of coral nurseries. </p><p> Dr Tanzil, also a senior research fellow at the NUS Tropical Marine Science Institute, started her career as a research assistant in Prof Chou's Reef Ecology Laboratory in 2004. By that time, she had been volunteering with the lab for two years and had been trained in various reef survey methodologies. </p><p> One of her first projects was to monitor coral recruitment on the reef enhancement units (REU) deployed in Singapore's southern islands under a collaboration between NUS and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). </p><p> That effort, which began in 2001 -- about a decade after Prof Chou's lab first deployed concrete modules and tyre pyramids in Singapore -- had a different focus. Instead of acting as fish aggregation devices, the REUs were being assessed on their ability to rejuvenate the coral reef to promote coastal tourism. </p><p> Prof Chou said that that project had focused on the natural recruitment of corals, although fragments were attached to the REUs if researchers came across them on the seafloor. Dr Tanzil mused: \"At that point, we had no nursery, we just took corals of opportunity -- what we called broken coral fragments on the seafloor -- and attached it to the artificial reef frame using epoxy.\" </p><p> But this was set to change. </p><p> By the mid-2000s, the coral gardening concept in Singapore was picking up steam. </p><p> The first coral nurseries were established in the southern waters to test if in-situ nurseries would be successful given the turbid conditions. Around that period, NUS was also involved in a project funded by the European Union to restore Indo-Pacific coral reefs in Singapore, the Philippines and Thailand, using the gardening approach. </p><p> Context in coral restoration is of the utmost importance, said Dr Karenne Tun, another protege of the Reef Ecology Lab under Prof Chou. Now the director of the terrestrial, coastal and marine branches at NParks' National Biodiversity Centre, Dr Tun said coral restoration techniques must be tailored to local contexts. </p><p> For example, in countries where the waters are clearer, coral fragments can be transplanted directly onto degraded reefs and thrive. </p><p> In Singapore, the chances of this being successful were lower due to the rubbly nature of the seafloor that made it difficult for the baby corals to gain a foothold. </p><p> The size that coral fragments should grow to before transplantation is also different in Singapore, she said. \"In other countries, nubbins (fragments) about 1cm or 2cm long can be transplanted and survive. But we found that in Singapore, fragments that grow to at least 10cm long stand a better chance of survival,\" Dr Tun added. </p><p> Eventually, the research paid off, with higher coral survival rates in subsequent translocation exercises.  </p><p> In 2013, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore funded a project to move corals from the Sultan Shoal, south-west of Singapore, to protect them from the impact of the Tuas Terminal development. Over 80 per cent of corals survived the move -- a marked improvement from the low survival rates from the effort in the early 1990s.</p><p> Sea change As the knowledge base of coral restoration science in Singapore accumulated, concerted efforts to protect the nation's marine biodiversity began to take shape. </p><p> Coral reef scientists in Singapore are continuing to push the frontiers of coral reef science, from growing corals on plastic toy blocks to maximise yield, to translocating nubbins to deeper, light-limited waters, where almost all corals have vanished. </p><p> At the same time, what was once an endeavour among academics gradually expanded to become more inclusive, involving government agencies, the private sector and civil society. </p><p> Ground-up \"blue plans\", developed by marine conservationists, scientists and volunteers, were published in 2001 and 2009, calling on the Government to protect Singapore's marine treasures. </p><p> In 2014, the country designated its first marine park -- the Sisters' Islands Marine Park -- which agent-based modelling had shown was Singapore's \"mother reef\" that seeds coral larvae to other marine habitats. </p><p> A community group, Friends of the Marine Park, was also established to promote stewardship and responsible use of the area. </p><p> The most recent edition of the blue plan -- which outlines six recommendations, including improved laws to protect marine environments and formalised management systems for these areas -- was published in 2018. </p><p> NParks also rolled out biodiversity impact assessment guidelines for marine spaces in 2020, helping to set minimum standards for such studies, which had previously differed among consultants. Previously, there was no locally standardised methodology for how such surveys should be conducted. </p><p> Most recently, in June 2023, NParks announced its most ambitious coral restoration plan to date: grow baby corals in nurseries and plant 100,000 of them at degraded coral reef sites or sites that could potentially support coral habitats over at least 10 years. </p><p> Since the 1980s, there has been a sea change in Singapore's efforts to bring its reefs back to life. </p><p> For Prof Chou, whose career charts the progress of coral reef science in Singapore -- from baseline mapping to artificial reef deployment and nursery development -- the current research frontier looks at how these important habitats can be made more resilient in the face of climate change.</p><p> This includes the work that Dr Huang -- who took over the reins of the Reef Ecology Lab when Prof Chou, his mentor, retired in 2014 -- is doing on the coral microbiome, as well as other projects looking into green-grey coastal infrastructure to protect the country from sea-level rise.  </p><p> In November 2022, Prof Chou was named an Asean Biodiversity Hero for his pioneering work on coral reef restoration and management. The award recognises passionate individuals in Asean who have dedicated their lives to protecting biodiversity. </p><p> Asked for his advice for the next generation of marine biologists, he said: \"Don't give up. You may feel like you are alone, fighting the system. But you are not alone, there are many people out there with you. Not all of them are scientists, but they are also with you in advocating for marine conservation.\" </p><p> Having watched the decline and resurrection of the country's reefs, Prof Chou remains optimistic about their future.</p><p> \"When I first started in coral reef research, many people were talking about how coral reefs are fragile, break easily, and (are) unable to handle large disturbances. But that's not the case for our reefs, and going forward, with new technology and new science, anything is possible.\"  </p><p> Audrey Tan is the science communications lead at the National University of Singapore's Tropical Marine Science Institute.

Building on the March 2022 meeting between U.S. President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. and Prime Minister of the Republic of Singapore Lee Hsien Loong, the United States and Singapore resolve to take bold new steps forward-as friends and strategic partners-to foster open, accessible, and secure technology ecosystems grounded in mutual trust, confidence, and a steadfast commitment to the rules-based international order.</p><p>Today, following up on the leaders' commitments, Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong delivered opening remarks at the inaugural U.S.-Singapore Critical and Emerging Technology (CET) Dialogue in Washington, D.C., chaired by National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, Acting Special Envoy for Critical and Emerging Technology Seth Center (on behalf of Secretary of State Antony Blinken), Minister for Foreign Affairs Dr. Vivian Balakrishnan, and Minister for Communications and Information and Minister-in-Charge of Smart Nation and Cybersecurity Josephine Teo. The United States and Singapore commit to upgrade our bilateral partnership to ensure that our combined endeavours at the frontiers of the scientific and technological enterprise continue to serve the global good. This includes our work at the forefront of combatting the climate crisis through the U.S.-Singapore Climate Partnership, established in 2021 and updated in 2023, to catalyze innovation around low- and zero-emission technologies, including in hard-to-abate sectors such as shipping and aviation, and drive broader regional efforts to decarbonize and deploy renewable energy.</p><p>The launch of the U.S.-Singapore CET Dialogue marks the first of several significant steps to build enduring collaboration across our business, scientific, and national security communities with an eye toward delivering benefits for the U.S. and Singaporean people and our partners in ASEAN and across the Indo-Pacific region. We will bolster scientific and research ties across our governments, industries, and university sectors grounded in a commitment to timely exchange of knowledge and information and scientific quality and rigor. We will also explore an appropriate bilateral agreement to expand our science and technology cooperation.</p><p>Our collaboration in this new high-level forum will also complement and accelerate key initiatives across a range of existing bilateral engagements, such as the U.S.-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation and the U.S.-Singapore Cyber Dialogue. It will support the ambitious agenda we are jointly driving in multilateral economic initiatives, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), to facilitate two-way trade flows, build resilient supply chains, facilitate the clean-energy transition, and combat corruption and enhance the efficiency of tax administration. Looking forward, the United States and Singapore intend to anchor the CET Dialogue and corollary lines of efforts in six main areas, each of which have significant bearing on our shared security and prosperity:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI):The United States and Singapore resolve to deepen information-sharing and consultations on international AI security, safety, trust, and standards development, while continuing to race ahead at the leading edge of responsible innovation. Acknowledging alignment in our approaches and our combined influence in the field of AI, we intend to launch a bilateral AI Governance Group focused on advancing shared principles and deepening information exchanges for safe, trustworthy, and responsible AI innovation, to complement theUnited States' Voluntary AI Commitments and a potential multilateral AI Code of Conduct. We welcome the completion of a mapping exercise between the U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework and the Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority's AI Verify, and will build on our shared principles through the launch of an AI Governance Group to complement the United States' Voluntary AI Commitments and potential multilateral AI Code of Conduct. Furthermore, we look forward to expanding bilateral research collaboration - including between the U.S. National Science Foundation and AI Singapore - with a focus on AI safety and security and to enhance workforce development efforts.</p><p>Digital Economy and Data Governance:The United States and Singapore will harness technology to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth. The two countries intend to develop a bilateral Roadmap for Digital Economic Cooperation that charts common principles and objectives on priority issues such as data governance, digital standards, digital inclusion, consumer protection, and ensuring small- and medium-enterprises can benefit from opportunities in the digital economy. We will also continue to work within the IPEF to make the digital economy more innovative and equitable. The United States and Singapore share an interest in facilitating trusted data flows with effective privacy protections. Through the existing Partnership for Growth and Innovation, the two sides commit to continued collaboration to promote these goals, including through the expansion of the Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules Forum. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Monetary Authority of Singapore will convene a meeting with relevant officials across our governments on both sides to explore how to strengthen our bilateral collaboration on digital payments, sharing information on our respective approaches with a view toward working together to shape international best practices. Finally, the United States and Singapore will seek to cooperate in a more concerted fashion in relevant regional and multilateral fora, and in international standards-setting bodies, to advance our shared digital economy objectives.</p><p>Biotechnology:The United States is committed to building strong security, privacy, and ethical standards around DNA sequencing data, storage, and research to ensure the use of these data are consistent with our norms and secure against cyber intrusion and other malign activities.The United States and Singapore recognize the vital importance of furtheringthe development of safe and secure biotechnologies, and their ethical use in line with internationally accepted principles and norms. The two countries intend to convene our science agencies to advance shared research and development priorities, including in synthetic biology, cell and gene therapeutics, and genetic delivery systems. We will also convene universities, research institutions, private sectors, and governance agencies to drive new talent exchanges and connect our start-up communities to exchangebest practices around commercialization, scaling, and R&amp;D translation efforts.</p><p>Critical Infrastructure and Technology Supply Chains:The two countries commit to advance focused collaboration toward promoting secure and resilient information and communications technology infrastructure-including telecommunications networks, undersea cables, and cloud computing-in the United States, Singapore, and partner nations. We intend to upgrade long-standing collaboration on smart cities with a focus on climate resilience, including under the U.S.-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership. The United States and Singapore look forward to deeper knowledge-sharing on how our cities canharness technologies to meet urban challenges in ways that strengthen livability, sustainability, and resilience.The two countries commit to establish a Smart Cities Program on AI through theU.S.-Singapore Third Country Training Program to deliver capacity-building to ASEAN and Pacific Islands Forum members. Finally, the two sides underscore the importance of strengthening cooperation, including under thePartnership for Growth and InnovationAdvanced Manufacturing and Supply Chain Pillar, and of exchanging information on domestic strategies for strengthening semiconductor supply chain resilience.</p><p>Defense Innovation:The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and the Singapore Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) look forward to expanding collaboration on critical emerging technologies and defense innovation. To wit, MINDEF and U.S. DoD's Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) intend to formalize a partnership that accelerates the use of commercial and dual-use technologies such as autonomy, digital technologies, and AI, to solve operational challenges for our militaries. This partnership will drive focused efforts toward better integrating our defense innovation ecosystems in service of stability in the Indo-Pacific and beyond.</p><p>Quantum Information Science and Technology:The United States and Singapore welcome each other's investments in our respective national quantum information sciences initiatives and intend to support our respective efforts to collaborate with trusted international partners.Toward this end, the United States and Singapore commit to expand government, academic, and private sector engagement and talent exchanges-through the State Department's International Visitor Leadership Program and/or other longer-term programs that enable more sustained exchanges between our technical experts-to lay the groundwork for deeper collaboration and mutual support in this crucial technology area.
