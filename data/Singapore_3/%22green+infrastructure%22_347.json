This week, we look at the increased interest in sustainable investing or that acronym alphabet soup called ESG</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Lee Su Shyan</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Do a quick Google search on unit trusts and investment funds and inevitably something with an ESG (environmental, social and governance) theme will pop up. It's not a particularly new theme, I would dare to venture, and is in most part a sensible approach to investing. The socially responsible have been shunning direct investments in \"sin\" stocks such as alcohol, gambling or tobacco firms for many years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;IMPORTANCE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Fast forward to 2022 and with extreme weather events happening more frequently, investors are more attuned to the impact of climate change or the \"E\" in ESG. But the \"S\" and \"G\" are making their way to the forefront of their consciousness too. \"Social\" includes areas such as the firm's gender and age-based diversity, employment turnover as well as its relationships with suppliers, customers and the wider community.</p><p> Governance metrics address topics such as board composition and the company's commitment to ESG, management diversity, ethical behaviour and alignment with industry frameworks.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;HOW TO TELL BETWEEN SUSTAINABLE INVESTMENTS'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;While comparing the profit levels of two companies is straightforward, evaluating which company performs better in the ESG stakes is where things get a bit fuzzy.</p><p> Eastspring Investments notes in its 2022 Market Outlook that data can be an obstacle in building ESG factors into an investment process. Different agencies use different standards and metrics; or there is insufficient data.</p><p> Some fund managers develop their own investment approach.</p><p> Schroders, for example, points out that \"E\" often takes centre stage because emissions is a criterion that is quantifiable and measurable. It cites the example of reviewing European wind turbine manufacturers, which naturally score highly for \"E\". But these may not be automatic choices for Schroders which takes a more rounded approach that also considers the social or governance practices such as the quality of the business' management teams.</p><p> For a retail investor, such an activist approach may yield higher returns from the fund manager getting up close and personal with the company but you have to understand these managers' methodologies to see if they gel with yours.</p><p> Investors can also opt for a more passive approach by investing in unit trusts or exchange-traded funds that track various indexes. These indexes will be screening firms based on criteria like the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> One benchmark is the FTSE4Good family of indexes. There are products available which track the FTSE4Good US Select Index for example.</p><p> For investors who want to focus on clean energy, there are products that track the S&amp;P Global Clean Energy Index, which has firms from developed and emerging economies operating in clean energy-related businesses, including Vestas Wind Systems and Enphase Energy.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SHORT-TERM VS LONG-TERM&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A company that lives by ESG principles and does good - champions climate change, pays its employees well and contributes to society positively - should perform better than one that does the opposite.</p><p> But investors are often sceptical about returns as in the short term, investing in positive practices costs money and could eat into profits. Take the issue of climate change and the phasing out of dirty fuels such as coal.</p><p> In many parts of Asia, a large existing stock of coal plants and mines continues to be a key source of energy and jobs. But much resources will be needed to build new green infrastructure or repurpose existing ones. In the short term, investing in such firms, even if they are in transformation mode, may not yield the requisite returns for the investor.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;COSTS AND RETURNS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Investors may want to look at one-, five-and 10-year returns to see if the fund does deliver both over the short and long run. Expense ratios are also important. Investors can usually start small with an initial investment although there may be costs for each additional tranche.</p><p> Digital wealth platform Endowus here has around 350 funds on offer which have both ESG and non-ESG focus, so there is plenty of choice for investors. For its core ESG portfolio, the return in 2021 would have outperformed the broader market if not for the recent surge in commodity and energy prices. Still, the portfolio has done well in the past few years. Endowus chairman Samuel Rhee is confident \"ESG funds and portfolios do not need to sacrifice returns and will add value over the long term\".</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;BOTTOM LINE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Many investors start off investing based on themes such as technology or real estate that they are more familiar with. Over time, they are likely to include ESG factors in their investing decisions because who doesn't want to feel they are doing good with their investments'</p><p> But it is also not just about feeling good as an investor. Paying attention to ESG metrics could well save your capital as it highlights the risk of remaining invested in a company that is doing well but is operating in an environmentally unfriendly sector, for example.</p><p> ESG may come across as a marketing tool, but it can protect your investment as well.</p><p> \u00b7 Do send comments, feedback and questions to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:sushyan@sph.com.sg\">sushyan@sph.com.sg</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1030956</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:651N-DHR1-DYX4-0187-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"870\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

While nature groups and environmental scientists have long pointed out the link between climate and biodiversity crises, climate solutions have neglected biodiversity in favour of renewable energy or green technology development. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The recent COP15 in Montreal ratified a new post-2020 Biodiversity Framework, with notable elements in setting aside 30 per cent of the earth's land and oceans for the protection of nature, and restoring at least 30 per cent of the world's degraded habitats. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This is particularly important for the majestic forests, rich coral reefs, wetlands and tropical peatlands in South-east Asia. But critical ecosystems need considerable human assistance to recover. Degraded habitats, particularly peatlands, emit a tremendous amount of carbon dioxide, which causes climate change, more volatile and extreme weather and consequently an increase in natural disasters such as landslides or flooding. </p><p> Healthy ecosystems, on the other hand, store unimaginably large amounts of carbon, buffering us against the dangers of climate instability. What's critical is a strategic approach to land management, integrating efficient agricultural production with the protection of healthy and diverse habitats, while degraded landscapes are being restored. </p><p> Currently, the mammoth task to restore habitats has highlighted how South-east Asia lacks a coordinated vision, with its initiatives scattered across the region. While an international mandate to restore degraded habitats is a laudable and necessary step, a strong framework and a mechanism to translate policy into meaningful action and outcomes are a must. </p><p> In this regard, the announcement in 2022 that the European Commission had tabled a Nature Restoration Law, which will impose binding targets on member states to facilitate the recovery of nature, offers policymakers in South-east Asia a formula to reflect on. </p><p> The law, which remains to be passed, creates a framework that will see EU member states restore a variety of degraded habitats including forests, peatlands, wetlands, grasslands and seagrass meadows. It will see them attempt to reverse the decline of pollinators, prevent net loss of green urban spaces, maintain a minimum level of canopy cover in European cities, increase farmland diversity, as well as improve the quality and flow of rivers. </p><p> There will undoubtedly be much discussion between the European Commission and member states on implementing these obligations nationally. The final result may well be an uneven tapestry negotiated in the back rooms of European politics rather than a legislative tour de force. Nevertheless, the proposed law is an instrument of laudable ambition and appears to embrace several key principles of environmental protection and governance. </p><p> First, traditional narratives on the co-existence of nature and development are replaced by a firmer and more holistic acceptance that nature plays a part in economic growth, climate resilience, food and water security, clean air and water, as well as physical and mental health.  In the wake of Covid-19, the law exposes the consequences from a rapacious relationship with nature, and is a clarion call for green recovery and growth. </p><p> Second, the law accepts that nature is in a state of crisis, and that restoration rectifies consequential maladies while seeking to deliver both ecological functionality and human well-being. </p><p> Third, it is premised on the benefits of a collective and coordinated approach across a political geography rather than a reliance only on well-meaning national initiatives. </p><p> Finally, it accepts that restoration must embrace a variety of carefully considered approaches and modalities that go beyond well-choreographed tree-planting initiatives. These potentially include giving nature the space to recover and incentivising those who facilitate recovery. Implicit in the law is also the notion that, if we pursue restoration as assiduously as we should, green jobs would follow along with economic growth. </p><p> Few would contest the validity and applicability of these principles to South-east Asia, where it is acknowledged that uneven weather patterns and natural disasters will increasingly impact economic growth and resilience, leaving the poor the most affected. </p><p> Can restoring biodiversity in South-east Asia be achieved within the framework of a far more conservative political instrument like Asean? It does not have the mandate to bind member states and enforce obligations. Non-interference in the internal affairs of states is a sacrosanct principle, and economic prerogatives are guarded fiercely. </p><p> With decisions taken by consensus, it's always challenging to achieve common understanding across a bloc where economic development is uneven, cultural experience more varied, and a more structured union is not envisaged. Yet, it is arguable that the principles that the law embraces can find a home within the unique vision that is Asean.  </p><p> Asean initiatives have already embraced the restoration pathway. The Asean Centre for Biodiversity, through the Asean Green Initiative and its Biodiversity Conservation Programme, is already well positioned to facilitate and coordinate the restoration of ecosystems. Asean has also come together in the context of the Asean Peatland Management Strategy to address the sustainable management of peatlands. </p><p> Although Asean cannot mandate or enforce, it can play a significant role to convene, influence and connect.</p><p> ConveneIn their respective countries, member states have organically fashioned solutions that can be utilised more broadly in delivering restoration agendas. </p><p>Cambodia has become a leader in securing nature through carbon financing. The Philippines has been the clearest in linking the benefits of restoration to poverty reduction, youth engagement and corporate responsibility through its National Greening Programme. Indonesia has offered insights into how restoration can take place at scale with its national peatland restoration strategy and its championing of Ecosystem Restoration Concessions, which envision the private management of landscapes to facilitate restoration. </p><p>Singapore has developed and implemented thinking around the greening of cities through the Centre for Urban Greenery and Ecology. Asean is well positioned to pull these threads together and orchestrate a collective understanding and conversation on the possibilities around restoration. </p><p> Influence Given that sustainable and green growth is contingent on a positive relationship with nature, Asean can encourage the scaling up of economic initiatives and growth trajectories that facilitate restoration. The Asean Catalytic Green Finance Facility and the Asean Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance already support this pathway. Other initiatives benefiting the Asean region offer replicable models that speak more directly to the restoration agenda.</p><p> In October 2021, the Asian Development Bank, backed by technical support from BirdLife International, launched a Regional Flyway Initiative employing the East Asian-Australasian Flyway as an organising principle for sustainable development. </p><p> The initiative, which includes South-east Asian countries such as Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos and Vietnam, envisages a blended finance approach of loans and grants to support nature-positive initiatives. This includes promoting coastal resilience and economic development of communities on the margins of wetlands. </p><p> Asean can influence multilateral development agencies and commercial banks to develop similar initiatives to finance green infrastructure and nature restoration in the region. </p><p> Asean could also lead efforts to properly value nature so that its role in delivering economic growth and climate resilience is mainstreamed in decision-making at the expense of counter-arguments focused on its exploitation.</p><p> ConnectAsean can facilitate and regularise the movement of conservation finance by connecting willing funders with nationally prioritised restoration initiatives. </p><p> For instance, the decision by automotive industry leaders BMW and Pirelli to support the improvement of rubber production, forest protection and livelihoods at the Hutan Harapan Ecosystem Restoration Concession in Sumatra complements the sterling efforts of the Indonesian government to encourage growth in the region and demonstrates the role corporate sustainability projects can play in augmenting restoration initiatives. It also recognises the importance of sustaining communities that ultimately guarantee the success of these initiatives.  </p><p> Additionally, Asean is well positioned to bring market visibility to initiatives that encourage local support for conservation and restoration. Rice farmers who support the sustainable management of wetlands used by the eastern sarus crane in Cambodia have been incentivised through the branding of their produce as sustainably sourced \"crane rice\". </p><p> Similar initiatives deserve to be amplified as part of a bigger Asean story around the role of local people in sustaining natural infrastructure, to ensure that purchasing decisions reward the restoration of nature. </p><p> The fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic had inspired narratives to restore the health of ecosystems as part of a green recovery. But the Ukraine war causing a spike in the prices of food and energy may see the convenient return to short-term gains, which have historically bedevilled efforts to develop a sustainable relationship with nature. </p><p> These factors make the role and imaginative vision of both the European Union and Asean more needed than ever, as nations seek to achieve the goals of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.</p><p> Shawn Lum is president of Nature Society (Singapore).

The final day involved the inaugural Singapore Sustainable Investing and Financing Conference (SSIFC), which was organised by BlackRock, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and Temasek.</p><p>One aspect of preparing for retirement is saving and investing, which should begin as soon as one enters the workforce, she remarked. \"This means that we must create suitable products for young investors, first-time investors, as well as for retirees and small investors,\" she continued, citing efforts such as the development of real estate investment trusts in Singapore or S-Reits and Temasek's private equity bonds for retail investors.</p><p>\"These diversify and reduce risks for the retail investors and socialise them to the world of PE (private equity) funds,\" said Ms Ho, adding that the state investment firm was also looking to \"open\" the equity component of PEs to retail investors.</p><p>On the issue of climate emergency and the warning that the planet will warm to 1.5 degrees Celsius in the next two decades, Ms Ho pointed to the world's top five carbon emitters that account for 60 per cent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions. China and the United States collectively account for 40 per cent of global emissions.</p><p>\"Carbon abatement needs government actions now, especially by these top five emitters. Investors and businesses must act too...,\" she said, as she described Temasek's own journey to reach zero carbon, which in the beginning drew some pushback and surprise but was eventually received with \"whole-hearted support\".</p><p>\"How did Temasek start our own journey towards zero carbon? Simple. We estimated our carbon emissions and dollarised it,\" she said.</p><p>\"Then came the hard part. We estimated the future carbon emissions of our portfolio in 2030. Our portfolio management team had a fierce and passionate debate on what it means to halve the carbon emissions of our portfolio (by 2030).</p><p>\"Again, we dollarised the value of carbon reduction that we need to deliver every year to 2030 and mapped that against a long-term incentive plan. For investment decisions, we now impute a carbon price of US$42 per tonne CO2 equivalent. We expect to raise this progressively over the decade.</p><p>\"We debated and decided not to divest emitters just to tick the box. This does nothing to help the world decarbonise and it isn't the right thing to do. Instead, we are prepared to do the hard work, to work with or even invest in emitters who commit to a clear transition plan for carbon reduction,\" she added.</p><p>After her closing address, Dilhan Pillay, who succeeds Ms Ho and will hold a dual role as CEO of both Temasek and its commercial arm Temasek International, presented Ms Ho with a painting done by Singaporean botanical artist Lucinda Law called The Giant Sequoia.</p><p>Also on Thursday, Temasek Trust announced that Ms Ho will be appointed to its board of directors from Oct 1. She will also succeed S Dhanabalan as chairman of Temasek Trust from April 1, 2022.</p><p>In a statement, Temasek chairman Lim Boon Heng said Ms Ho drove Temasek to play a key role as a \"champion of sustainability\" long before the word became synonymous with the firm's investment approach.</p><p>He added: \"Temasek is, in every sense, a changed organisation from the one Ho Ching joined in 2002, and also in every sense, for the better.\"</p><p>READ MORE: Ho Ching will be appointed to board of Temasek Trust;

While geopolitics has dampened sentiment, the worst seems to be over. With China's reopening, this offers many opportunities for investors. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Changi Airport passenger traffic has recovered to around 80 per cent of pre-pandemic levels. If Chinese tourists return in large numbers -- they formed the largest proportion of tourist arrivals to Singapore in 2019 -- it's possible we could see even higher numbers than before Covid-19 hit. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Overall, our Singapore market still offers opportunities as a value play. When tech stocks plummeted in 2022, the market here was stable as our tech stocks are mostly in the manufacturing sector. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Pay attention to: Investors have to look out for interest rates, which have been favourable to banks so far this year. </p><p> The biggest part of the increases is over now and people are less worried about inflation. However, one concern is that inflation could become sticky. If you look back to the 1960s and 1970s when inflation started to be high, expectations of inflation also became high. </p><p> Employment was very tight as well, so we could still have some tough times ahead. </p><p> Also pay attention to corporate earnings. Late last year, we were talking doomsday scenarios but that seems to have cleared up. While there is still talk of recession, those Singapore companies that have reported results have seen decent growth so far. </p><p> However, if margins shrink, this may affect corporate earnings. We will have to pay attention to this first quarter's earnings, going into the second quarter as well. </p><p> Security prices are forward-looking and they are the best predictor of the future we have. When there is new information, prices reflect this, so as to keep expected stock returns positive for investors.</p><p> Geopolitical risks may have implications for the real economy but, overall, security prices are doing a good job of reflecting this information.</p><p> Still, when we look at historical data, markets are not a perfect predictor. There may be noise in the data. Changing expectations, new news, and previously unknown events and so on can all change prices. Day to day, prices can and do change in unpredictable ways. </p><p> There is volatility associated with investing and you can go through periods where returns are disappointing for longer than you had anticipated. At times, value stocks may underperform growth stocks. But there is no reason to react to every single piece of news. </p><p> When we look at the US stock market over the past 40 years, it has usually bottomed out long before the experts declare the economy is in recession. Markets have already priced that there might be a rate hike in June or July.</p><p> Opportunities Given that, we see opportunities in global stocks, value stocks and stocks with higher profitability. We still believe in value investing and being broadly diversified. Over the past 2 1/2  years, value stocks have largely outpaced growth stocks. </p><p> Pay attention to: An inverted yield curve is saying that there aren't higher returns for longer-duration bonds. So pay attention to forward rates. A global portfolio of bonds can ensure good diversification.</p><p> The surprise decision by the Chinese government to reopen the economy last December after a long period of lockdown is a major tailwind for its economy and equity markets.</p><p> China's reopening after three years of global isolation is one of the most important developments for investors this year.</p><p> While we are neutral on global equities overall, given the uncertain outlook for inflation and monetary policy in the developed markets, we are overweight on Chinese equities which will benefit from China's renaissance. </p><p> Despite the strong rally over the past few months, Chinese equity indexes are still significantly below the February 2021 peak and valuations are not demanding.</p><p> This is especially since the earnings outlook is poised to improve, even as earnings forecasts in developed markets face the risk of more downgrades. </p><p> China's economy looks set to do well as consumer confidence improves and factory activity and supply are restored. China is poised to be the only major economy in 2023 to post improved economic growth.</p><p> The economy grew by 3 per cent in 2022, and we expect growth to pick up sharply to 5.2 per cent this year, higher than the government's target of 5 per cent. </p><p> OpportunitiesUnlike developed markets in the United States and Europe, inflation remains relatively tame in China, and the country's central bank is likely to be the only major central bank that will not increase interest rates this year. </p><p> More than that, the Chinese government has room for economic stimulus via fiscal and monetary policy, but we do not expect massive easing.</p><p> The overall tone at the recent National People's Congress was supportive of the economy and seems constructive for Chinese equities.</p><p> Key positives from the congress include the supportive policy stance towards domestic consumption; and Internet and platform, real estate and digitalised economy-related industries such as telecommunications, automation and software.</p><p> Pay attention to: There is more upside for Chinese equities, but the climb will not be linear. Investors must brace themselves for volatility, given policy and political uncertainties against the backdrop of US-China tension due to developments in Ukraine, Taiwan, and efforts by US politicians to curb China's economic threat. </p><p> Investors should not get carried away by Chinese equities and over-invest just because things are looking more upbeat. It is important to manage exposure to Chinese equities with a diversified portfolio of multiple asset classes, including equities from other countries and regions. </p><p> Those looking to invest in Chinese equities must have a strong risk appetite, take a strategic medium-term view and be prepared to ride out short-term and intermittent market volatility. </p><p> Perhaps a more balanced way to invest in Chinese equities is through funds that offer a diversified exposure to stocks instead of buying into individual names. Spreading fresh investments gradually over time instead of timing the market may also be a prudent strategy. </p><p> For those looking to buy directly into China-related companies, the reopening of the economy could benefit consumption-related firms and industries.</p><p> Companies in the technology space like Internet and platform companies could also benefit from the pickup in consumption-led recovery and an easing of regulatory restrictions. </p><p> Greater travel should also bode well for travel- and leisure-related companies. Other longer-term investment themes aligned with government policy priorities include renewables, green infrastructure, electric vehicles and industrial automation.</p><p> Overall, despite the scope for intermittent consolidation after a sharp rally in recent months, undemanding valuations and positive fundamentals offer a constructive backdrop for Chinese equities in 2023.</p><p> Over the past 30 years, many countries with high debt burdens generated economic growth via exports in a free and open globalised world. That avenue seems to be closing now.</p><p> The focus on \"friend-shoring\" and on diversifying supply chains is evidence that companies are making a concerted effort to eliminate over-dependency, even as they stay clear of domestic political pressures from governments or from customers. </p><p> For an indebted middle- or low-income economy, the range of options appears to be shrinking. Low unit labour costs are not a big enough draw, nor the promise of multi-year tax breaks, for investment in manufacturing. </p><p> We believe the short-term struggle will be in balancing higher interest costs with the need to invest more in defence, in the transition to green energy, and in pro-growth policies.</p><p> At a time when interest rates are higher and availability of finance is more constrained, the challenge of recalibrating these supply chains becomes even more complex.  </p><p> One set of winners is countries that can benefit from the recalibration of supply chains. They could be established, like Mexico, where unit labour costs are relatively low, the transport infrastructure is good and there is a sizeable pool of experienced workers as well as agile companies that can adapt quickly. </p><p> Another will be countries that have significant access to specific raw materials that are critical for semiconductors or electric vehicle batteries, and offer a stable base for manufacturing or processing. </p><p> Asean member Indonesia has the advantage of a significant consumer market. It has the fourth-biggest population in the world at 275 million. </p><p> Furthermore, with 15- to 24-year-olds representing nearly 16 per cent of the population, there is a demographic dividend in place.</p><p> At the company and sector level, companies that can address shortcomings in specialist infrastructure will do well.</p><p> The construction of liquefied natural gas terminals and short-distance pipelines, and modernising of industrial machinery for energy efficiency are some examples. </p><p> Defence companies stand to benefit in the coming decade. For those involved in the military-industrial complex, the top priority will probably be to invest in capacity expansion, providing even more scope for revenue growth in the specialist engineering sub-sector. </p><p> Pay attention to: We expect debt issuance to climb again this year, as governments seek to implement pro-growth policies and boost investment in defence, as well as deal with higher interest costs. </p><p> Currency weakness presents additional headwinds. Japan can sustain a debt-to-GDP ratio of 250 per cent, the United States could go to 150 per cent. </p><p> The key point here is that the high-income countries will be better able to deal with the service costs and continue to find a market for their issuance. </p><p> Nato membership is swelling, with neutral Sweden and Finland joining soon, and an energised political class is prioritising at least 2 per cent of GDP to be dedicated to defence. </p><p> This is not possible without issuing significant debt and, given the small production capacity in the military-industrial complex on both sides of the Atlantic, it is likely to be inflationary. </p><p> Add to this the turbo-charged drive to accelerate the green energy transition and the wave of industrial company capital expenditure to modernise industrial plants, and we see a series of inflationary waves coming over the next decade. </p><p> What the markets will struggle with is volatility of inflation and, consequently, of interest rates. </p><p> The traditional sources of long-term savings might be squeezed or even reduced over time as the working populations in mostly high-income countries shrink and their social costs increase. </p><p> Opportunities In the short term, it seems that asset prices have generally adjusted downwards, and there is optimism for economic growth. </p><p> Fixed income (such as bonds) is attractive again, but equity markets may have to temper earnings growth expectations, and inflation may remain higher than the traditional target of 2 per cent for several years.</p><p> Bottom lineInflation and concerns over an economic slowdown have not gone away entirely, but the mood among fund managers is more upbeat now. </p><p> Investment involves risk. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future performance or returns. </p><p> The value of investments and the income from them can go down as well as up, and you may not get back the full amount you invested.</p><p> If you are in doubt, you should consult your stockbroker, bank manager, solicitor or other professional advisers. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Shoppers in the Fuzimiao area of Nanjing, China, in February.

Each party has committed US$50 million (S$68.5 million) to the fund, which will invest in environmental, social and corporate governance-focused opportunities.</p><p> Singlife with Aviva has also appointed a company in Europe to provide a comprehensive view of its sustainability performance to help the insurer monitor the key environmental risks of its investments.</p><p> Ms Phau has a degree in economics and statistics from the National University of Singapore and is a chartered financial analyst.</p><p> She believes that money is ultimately an enabler: \"It gives us the tangible things we want and the intangible experiences we can enjoy.\"</p><p> But excessive wealth is not needed for happiness, she emphasises.</p><p> To this end, she has been actively promoting the Onefor10 x Share initiative, which is the Community Chest's monthly giving programme to support more than 100 social service agencies in Singapore.</p><p> \"I believe that those who have benefited from life's opportunities should look for ways to empower and help others,\" says Ms Phau, who is married with a 16-year-old son.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q What is in your personal portfolio'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A I have a diversified portfolio of investments across fixed income and equities, accessing them directly as well as via mutual funds. I also have an insurance portfolio which spans across all areas of protection and hospitalisation plans.</p><p> I adopt a balanced and diversified approach to investing. I typically build a portfolio across different investment tools for different viewpoints where I express my personal views on emerging themes over the long term and I do include some tactical asset allocation in the shorter term.</p><p> This approach allows me to stay invested over the long term, growing the value of my nest egg while at the same time allowing me to seize some opportunities in the near term.</p><p> At present, about half of my portfolio is in equities, with 10 per cent in bonds and funds, and 40 per cent in cash. My investments are fairly evenly split between the United States and Asia.</p><p> We have seen extreme volatility in the markets lately, which will dampen any portfolio's market value. That said, I believe in the conventional wisdom that time in the market trumps timing the market.</p><p> With this approach, I have managed to generate decent low to mid-teen returns on my portfolio over the last few years.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q What are your immediate investment plans'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A Given the extreme volatility in the market, I'm not looking to increase my exposure and am instead choosing to adopt a wait-and-see approach.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q How did you become interested in investing'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A Due to my early training as a banker, I've always felt the need to understand the dynamics of the market in order to invest in it.</p><p> Over time, it became very apparent to me just how important it is to plan for different life stages. With the increasing cost of living, inflation, escalating healthcare costs and potentially longer time spent in retirement, I realised that simply relying on simple savings and protection will not be sufficient, as the protection and wealth gap widens over time.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q What else is in your financial plan'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A It's critical to have clearly thought-out and discussed plans for legacy planning, including the use of the lasting power of attorney, wills and any advance medical directives.</p><p> This part of my financial plan is largely in place as I have seen many instances where a lack of planning has led to unnecessary grief, discord and prolonged disagreements between family members.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q How are you planning for retirement'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A Your expected retirement funds should be personalised according to your lifestyle needs.</p><p> I hope to be reasonably comfortable to maintain my current lifestyle. I believe the challenge here would be to keep one's mind and body healthy as we age gracefully. I do enjoy working as it keeps me challenged.</p><p> I hope to retire at 60 and would like to remain active as long as I can.</p><p> My other passion which I would like to pursue further is to continue to drive change within the social service sector.</p><p> Retirement to me is not about slowing down, but rather another phase of life we should take time to savour. It's important that we continue to find joy in the moments spent with those we cherish.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q Home is now...&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A A detached house in Holland Road.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q I drive...&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A A slate grey Porsche Cayenne.</p><p>     &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Worst and best bets&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;&lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q What has been your biggest investing mistake'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A After the global financial crisis in 2008-2009 and we were headed into a recessionary environment, high-yield bond markets had significant downgrades.</p><p> In the middle of 2010, there was also a significant drop in demand across several sectors and I had, at that point in time, significant exposure to high-yield bonds issued by offshore oil and marine companies.</p><p> The sector faced several headwinds, and one could argue that there was a contagion effect by the industrial disaster also known as the BP oil spill, which caused the bond markets to price in the probability of defaults. I suffered losses as a result.</p><p> This episode served as a reminder that when you make a large investment into one specific asset class, you need to recollect and fall back to the fundamentals of diversification and not be highly exposed to a specific sector or asset class.</p><p> Though diversification can be a cliche or an overused term in investing, it proves its worth when you need it at the point of market stress.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Q And your best investment'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A I had the opportunity to invest in various technology companies early, and to date, while the markets have fallen, my investment values are still positive.</p><p> I tend to stick with my long-term strategy on trends and try to strike a balance by investing regularly with a careful accumulation on dips while resisting the temptation to make any purchase when valuations are high.</p><p>Choo Yun Ting</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1076571</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6651-4JM1-JCF2-821Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1208\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

As a result, SMEs are looking for a trusted banking partner to scale their businesses and get faster access to working capital through digital banking and transformational solutions.Leading UK financial publication Euromoney recognised DBS for being exactly that when they named it the World's Best SME Bank and Asia's Best SME Bank just last month. Euromoney lauded DBS for being all about digital innovation, and for applying its technological advantage to benefit SMEs. Louise Bowman, editor of Euromoney, said: \"DBS has applied its customary digital innovation to the SME space with great success.\"\"DBS has applied its customary digital innovation to the SME space with great success.\" - Louise Bowman, editor of Euromoney Helping SMEs reap the dividends of digital innovationOne key benefit of having a best-in-class banking partner is the unparalleled convenience of accessing end-to-end digital solutions like account opening, collections, payments, working capital and other credit solutions. </p><p>DBS' industry-leading digital lending process \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the first in Singapore to be fully digital from application to disbursement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c has proved critical to SMEs looking to shore up their balance sheets to cope with economic headwinds.Ng Yee Jie, founder and CEO of Ordinary Kind, an omni-channel retailer in furniture and baby goods, recounted the difficulties he faced in getting a loan from other banks as he was grounded in Malaysia at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic. \"It would have been impossible for me to come down to Singapore to meet a banker and sign the necessary documents, given the border restrictions.\" However, DBS was able to approve and fulfil the loan remotely and digitally in what Ng described as \"not just a timesaver, but also a real lifesaver\".\"DBS' digital loan application, approval and disbursement process was not just a timesaver, but also a real lifesaver.\" - Ng Yee Jie, founder and CEO of Ordinary KindDBS has continued to improve its lending process to SMEs, and, today, access to working capital has been reduced to just a minute to apply, a second to approve and, in some instances, even instant disbursement. All these available within a single easy-to-use platform \u00e2\u20ac\u201c DBS IDEAL.As a result of the bank's robust credit processes and enhanced digital lending, DBS has approved more than 16,300 collateral-free loans totalling more than S$7 billion to SMEs in Singapore, with over 90 per cent of the loans going to micro and small enterprises since 2020. With cash flow as the lifeblood of SMEs, another key benefit of DBS' digital prowess is the proactive management of credit quality. Through the innovative use of artificial intelligence, machine learning and advanced data analytics, SMEs now receive early alerts of potential credit risks even before the problems present themselves. By putting these risks on their radar, DBS can now partner businesses to act pre-emptively and nip potential credit issues in the bud. Joyce Tee, group head of SME Banking, said: \"As SMEs emerge from the pandemic, they are walking into intensifying macro-economic headwinds, geopolitical tensions and supply chain turmoil. In all operating environments, we will continue to partner our SMEs to proactively manage their cash-flow and liquidity needs while cheering them on to keep up the momentum of their digital transformation and business expansion journeys.\"Strong regional ecosystems to supercharge SMEs' growthSMEs are increasingly looking beyond working capital solutions and increasingly value banking partners that can offer regional insights and networks to power their growth. SMEs looking to tap the potential of Asia's economic engines including China, India and Indonesia \u00e2\u20ac\u201c South-east Asia's largest economy \u00e2\u20ac\u201c often name DBS as their partner of choice, given the bank's deep expertise in those markets.SMEs are also benefiting from DBS' early moves to embed itself in regional ecosystems partnerships. DBS offers client programmes and has 15 platform partnerships where DBS' products and solutions are embedded into the large corporate client, or anchors, or the platform partner's ecosystem. An example is a collaboration that DBS has forged with JD Logistics (JDL) in China and Hong Kong. Via an integrated one-stop solution on JDL's platform, merchants can view their available limits, outstanding loan amounts and initiate financing requests where funds will be automatically disbursed into their bank accounts. Transforming SMEs into businesses for impactWith sustainability now a top priority for the business community, SMEs are also looking for a banking partner that can catalyse their transformation into businesses that have a positive environmental and social impact even as they manage the day-to-day operations of their businesses.Since last year, SMEs have been supported by more than S$100 million in green financing to scale businesses in sectors such as clean energy, green infrastructure, and clean transportation. Singapore-based Terrenus Energy received such a loan from DBS which enabled it to install 40,000 portable solar photovoltaic panels in Singapore. Furthermore, DBS will be offering green renovation loans to encourage SMEs to undergo sustainability retrofits for their commercial and industrial properties.SMEs looking to transition towards more sustainable business models can also tap the new DBS Foundation SME Grant Programme, which provides grants of up to S$100,000 to support such moves. This is in addition to the support that DBS has extended to social enterprises around the region since 2014.DBS has supported over 800 social enterprises through capacity-building programmes and awarded more than S$10 million in grants to some 90 social enterprises. Singapore-based Magorium, which builds roads made from recycled plastic waste, is an example of how DBS is nurturing the next generation of businesses for impact. With the help of a grant offered by the DBS Foundation Social Enterprise Grant Programme, Magorium is well on track to processing up to 200 tonnes of unrecyclable plastic waste to construct eco-friendly roads in Singapore.\"Beyond the grant support, we were connected with mentors who provided valuable guidance in areas such as financial modelling.\" - Oh Chu Xian, founder and CEO of MagoriumA committed and experienced SME partnerIn further validation of DBS' commitment to partner the region's SMEs through thick and thin, Hong Kong-based The Asset has similarly named DBS as both the Asia-Pacific's and Singapore's Best Bank for SMEs.Tan Su Shan, group head of institutional banking at DBS, said: \"We do not take these accolades from Euromoney and The Asset lightly and are grateful for the trust that SMEs in the region have placed in us to deliver on their banking and digital transformation needs. We believe that when SMEs do well, the broader economy does well, and it is this greater sense of purpose that drives us to go the extra mile for our SMEs.

But how do you value the benefits and costs of Mother Nature'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> One example of the challenges in doing this is the Cross Island MRT Line, originally slated to pass through the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, home to an abundance of species.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> After feedback from non-governmental organisations and conducting an environmental impact assessment, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) found that having the line going under the reserve, rather than passing directly through or skirting around it, was the most socio-economically and environmentally sensible option.</p><p> However, although scientific details of the impact of the MRT line's construction were well-researched and presented, one possible shortcoming is the rigour of economic valuation.</p><p> Economic valuation of biodiversity looks at what people are willing to trade off to conserve natural resources.</p><p> Attention is usually paid to the outcome of an environmental impact assessment - but that only reveals the physical impact of a proposed project on the environment. In our view, it is much more important for the process of valuation in the long run to ensure the consistency and quality of future assessments.</p><p> Here are some suggestions about considerations to note in putting a value on biodiversity and how to go about it.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SINGAPORE'S TRADE-OFFS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;We need to first understand and clearly delineate the functions and services of Singapore's ecosystems, as well as the various trade-offs involved.</p><p> Which biodiversity type to conserve and how much of it, against what are the forgone gains from employment, income, development, housing and even recreational pursuits from parklands are crucial to understanding these trade-offs.</p><p> Only by successfully decoupling and classifying these natural processes, as well as finding appropriate ways to reconcile scientific frameworks and findings with economics, should we then proceed with the valuation of biodiversity.</p><p> For a start, due to Singapore's unique circumstances, valuation of biodiversity attributes here may be quite different compared with other developed countries.</p><p> Since its early years of development, Singapore has faced stark trade-offs, such as economic expansion involving land reclamation versus preserving or restoring ecosystems, a costly process in itself.</p><p> To mitigate this trade-off, it is important to understand how biodiversity can coexist with green infrastructure in Singapore such as rooftop greenery, parks, gardens, wildlife corridors, canals and seawalls.</p><p> Factors to consider include the optimal size and connectivity of such infrastructure for biodiversity conservation, and how wildlife population sizes and species composition vary with the constraints and economic activities associated with the infrastructure.</p><p> There are also trade-offs between the different types of benefits that ecosystem services provide. For example, allocating resources away from improving recreation parks to investment in coral reef research and conservation programmes.</p><p> However, as our consumer goods and raw materials are largely imported, the trade-off involving the extraction of resources from Singapore's natural ecosystems at the expense of nature's own ways of regulating the environment may be less problematic.</p><p> A trade-off also exists between reducing environmental pollution and an increase in demand for ecosystem products. For example, solar panels require forest fragmentation to obtain minerals for construction. However, Singapore imports solar panel materials from abroad for local manufacture.</p><p> The question then is, whether we should confine our valuation of biodiversity to a local setting only, or include biodiversity elsewhere that may be indirectly affected because of our high import dependency.</p><p> In addition, it is possible that Singapore's progress in green finances, carbon markets, climate mitigation and adaptation technologies may reduce or offset our dependence on nature in other areas, such as for recreation.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SO HOW SHOULD WE VALUE BIODIVERSITY'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;A common technique in cost-benefit analysis is to study individual choices in existing markets related to the ecosystem service to be valued.</p><p> For example, travel expenses can be taken as a proxy for the price that people pay to visit such ecosystems. The higher the travel cost, the lower might be the demand to go there. In this way, a demand curve can be derived for an ecosystem and its value estimated.</p><p> Another way is to attribute and isolate differences in property prices to individuals' preference for biodiversity elements within their neighbourhood. Properties near vibrant ecosystems might command a premium compared with those which are not.</p><p> It is plausible that Singaporeans value managed urban vegetation such as parks and gardens more highly - due to their direct recreational benefits - than unmanaged vegetation or urban wildlife.</p><p> For example, when wild boars, otters, hornbills and monkeys venture into residential areas, they cause disruption and often are unwelcome.</p><p> To capture the non-user intangible benefits associated with biodiversity, surveys can find out the willingness of individuals to pay for enhancement or simply accept their degradation.</p><p> The biodiversity values of vulnerable or critically endangered species in Singapore such as hawksbill turtles, Sunda pangolin and Raffles' banded langur could be more highly weighted so that conservation efforts are prioritised for these species.</p><p> Care should also be taken to ensure that the benefits of biodiversity accrued to both present and future generations are fairly distributed.</p><p> Due to the complex nature of biodiversity and ecosystems, valuation studies are at times fraught with uncertainty and challenges. It is difficult to quantify the links between species richness and ecosystem functions, and between the latter and the services they provide.</p><p> Typical valuation approaches estimate only the marginal changes in the quantity or quality of ecosystem services, without clearly acknowledging the ecosystem's threshold state where it will collapse if it continues to be overused.</p><p> There is also a risk of double counting benefits. This can result from overlap of ecosystem services, such as water purification and water supply, or recreation and culture. Demand for ecosystem services inferred from travel patterns and market prices may also overlap, especially for a dense urban biodiversity setting like Singapore.</p><p> People may be unfamiliar with valuing scientific aspects of biodiversity, such as species and functional composition, that vary across space and time compared with easily identifiable ecosystem goods such as wetlands and nature reserves.</p><p> There may also be differences between how people feel towards hypothetical and actual environmental changes. For example, they might be concerned about having to pay higher taxes to finance conservation projects.</p><p> The bottom line is that valuing biodiversity requires both ecologists and economists to work closely together and to refine existing valuation techniques to account for the complexities of biodiversity, adapted to the Singapore context.</p><p> Accounting for, and protecting against, biodiversity losses requires more than just an environmental impact assessment. A monetary valuation of the trade-offs required and the use of cost-benefit analysis are needed too so that informed decisions can be made.</p><p>\u00b7 Euston Quah is Albert Winsemius chair professor of economics and director of the Economic Growth Centre at Nanyang Technological University.

Infrastructure sectors in EMDEs raised more than US$500 billion in loans and bonds in 2021. That's from the financing side. In EMDEs, total investments in fossil fuel-based infrastructure (from oil and gas to conventional power generation) amounted to US$210 billion in 2021 and US$1.24 trillion since 2015. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These are based on open-source data in the marketplace, and do not include spending obscured by non-market fiscal subventions or subsidies towards fossil fuel sectors (which are substantial). Conversely, total investment in renewable energy sources amounted to US$45 billion in 2021 only, and US$235 billion since 2015. </p><p> Furthermore, there is also a prevailing stance in many EMDEs that the state-owned companies continue to invest and hold fossil fuel-related infrastructure as critical national assets, while renewables like solar or wind power development are carried out by the private sector through public--private partnerships (PPPs). The financing advantage the state typically enjoys is thus not fully channelled towards renewables. </p><p> Hence, on the one hand, many policymakers highlight the large financing gaps for net zero transition. On the other hand, we see the large financing capacity of EMDE firms (including many state-owned enterprises) and the channelling of investments into fossil fuel sectors. It is as much a financing gap as it is a financing trap. This paradox can only be understood in the context of insufficient reallocation of economic resources towards net zero.</p><p> The double externalitiesThere are two related issues with the same root cause. First, the continued lack of carbon price to drive reallocation of economic activities. Carbon pricing fixes several externalities at one go. It reduces waste of existing energy use by businesses and households and encourages them towards use of cleaner energy. Carbon pricing also creates pressures for the most pollutive firms in each industry to change or to exit, ceding market shares to the more productive ones. These important reallocation dynamics do not work well otherwise. </p><p> Second, and perhaps less articulated, is how the lack of carbon price hampers the innovation processes towards net zero. It is well known that firms underinvest in innovation because they often do not capture the full economic benefits of their innovation. Studies have confirmed that one innovation often leads to spillovers to benefit other innovators, in other geographies and sectors. </p><p> To put things in an even starker perspective, fossil fuel companies are not standing still, they too are innovating to produce at lower costs. One only has to recall that fracking technology in the past two decades has added large supplies of gas to the market. Today, the high energy prices mean that there are strong incentives, even if unspoken, to innovate and produce more. </p><p> To be fair, fossil fuel companies have also innovated in areas towards cleaner production of fossil fuels (eg reducing methane flaring and saving energy used in production). But this is at best an interim stage towards net zero. Better production of fossil fuels would still lead to climate damage. </p><p> Clearly, a lot of new technologies like battery and storage, green hydrogen, carbon capture would have to be technically and commercially viable to make a net zero economy possible. Innovations that that help solve the intermittency problem for renewables will also reduce policymakers' concerns around energy security. Incentives towards innovation and adoption of green technology need to be sharpened.</p><p> The unpriced nature of greenhouse emissions thus creates not one but a double negative reinforcing externalities -- one at the production and consumption end, and the other at the innovation end. Incentives towards net zero remain underpowered in EMDEs as a result.</p><p> Risk of losing competitivenessThere is another hidden long-term risk for EMDEs in falling behind in the net zero transition -- the loss of competitiveness and innovation capacity in important green sectors. Many advanced economies have implemented a carbon price or stringent regulations. This has compelled companies to innovate and adapt more quickly towards net zero. The majority of net zero related patents (eg renewables and waste management) are still filed by companies in major advanced economies, in terms of both volume and patent market value. The incentives and pressures are arguably less in EMDEs. </p><p> Yet within a few short decades, all production and international trade will have to be consistent with net zero. Green infrastructure and production will become the basis of international competitiveness. Falling behind in critical innovations and business processes would mean having to import these technologies or goods later, or risk begin priced or regulated out of the global marketplace. Hence, getting an early momentum in net zero transition is important to allow for the accumulation of knowledge and know how.</p><p> A road map for a low carbon economyImposing a carbon price with the backdrop of high inflation will not be easy. One might even argue that a high energy price arising from the war in Ukraine already acts like a carbon price. Except that it is not equivalent. While a high price will curtail fossil fuel demand, we must again realise that this reallocates resources into fossil fuel sectors -- opposite of what a carbon price seeks to achieve. It leaves windfall profits at the hands of fossil fuel companies rather than as taxes for the state. A high fossil fuel price is a poor substitute for an actual carbon price. </p><p> A carbon price can be implemented in stages. One way is to first impose a shadow carbon price on all state-owned companies, essentially requiring them to plan and invest as if a carbon price is already there. It can also start with large polluters first. There should be also a plan to exit select industries that no longer fit the context of a low carbon economy. </p><p> Imposing annual limits on banking or bond financing that can flow into fossil fuel sectors would bring about a shadow carbon price through finance, allowing constraints to kick in without hitting headline inflation at one go. Of course, over time, a transparent carbon price should be set for the price signal to guide the needed reallocation rather than ad hoc administrative policies. </p><p> Many EMDEs have in the past encouraged FDIs into key sectors to jumpstart economic development, participate in global value chains, and benefit from knowledge diffusion. This can be a key part of the strategy towards a low carbon economy. Again, starting early will avoid large capacity gaps from developing later and with it, the loss of competitiveness. EMDEs will need to act fast. </p><p> The writers are from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change,\" said President Joe Biden, who convened the two-day virtual summit attended by 40 heads of state and dozens of corporate executives and other leaders.</p><p>\"All of our nations must stand together...to help the world's most vulnerable nations and those bearing the least responsibility for the climate crisis cope with the devastating impacts of the climate crisis,\" he added during a session on financing climate solutions.</p><p>Mr Biden announced that the US will double, by 2024, its annual public climate finance to developing countries based on its levels during the later years of the Obama administration.</p><p>The US will also triple public financing for climate adaptation \u00e2\u20ac\u201d measures to help countries adapt to the impact of climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u201d in developing countries by 2024. </p><p>In addition, the US launched a plan laying out its vision for financing the world's response to climate change, in recognition of the urgency of the climate crisis and the sharp drop in American international climate finance during the Trump administration. </p><p>The plan will also seek to end international investment in fossil fuel projects and steer capital towards \"climate-aligned investments\".</p><p>US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry highlighted the need for governments to team up with private investors and international financial institutions in the world's quest to switch fully to non-carbon energy sources.</p><p>\"Governments alone cannot possibly find all the necessary investment,\" he said. \"There's no government in the world that has enough in their fiscal budgets to be able to provide what we need to make this transition.\"</p><p>Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her department would throw its weight into figuring out the best ways that public climate finance could be channeled into mobilising the greatest private sector investments.</p><p>\"Past efforts to support private investment have not achieved anywhere near the scale needed to green the global economy\", she said.</p><p>She added that the Biden administration, on its part, will work with multilateral institutions and has requested US$1.2 billion (S$1.6 billion) for the Green Climate Fund, US$485 million to support multilateral climate initiatives, and more support for development banks in its 2022 budget.</p><p>Earlier, developing countries including India and South Africa had called on developed countries to do more to help them meet their climate targets.</p><p>\"We call on developed economies, which historically bear the greatest responsibility for emission, to meet their responsibilities to developing economies,\" said South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.</p><p>He said that aid on climate change should be provided separately and should not be part of conventional development assistance, adding: \"When it is given in the form of loan financing, the debt burden of developing countries is worsened.\"</p><p>International Monetary Fund head Kristalina Georgieva called for an international carbon price floor among the members of the G-20, arguing that \"a small group of large emitters can facilitate an agreement covering 80 per cent of the global emitters\".</p><p>Setting a \"robust\" minimum price could help reduce global emissions, she said, saying that current schemes were inadequate.</p><p>But the average global carbon price, which is currently at US$2 a ton, needs to rise to US$75 a ton by 2030 to curb emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, said Ms Georgieva.</p><p>\"A mix of steadily rising carbon prices and green infrastructure investment could increase global GDP by more than 0.7 per cent per year over the next 15 years, and create millions of new jobs,\" she added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>US

Policy-making has been top-down, with high-level directives guiding the overall development of the market. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In 2016, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), China Banking and Insurance Commission and several ministries issued the Guidelines for Establishing the Green Financial System, which have served as the major policy framework for green finance initiatives in the country. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The multi-layer characteristics of China's green finance system is evident in the high-level guidelines. The system consists of green loans, green bonds, environmental, social and governance (ESG) funds, green insurance, green leasing, green trusts and carbon trading. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> According to China's definition, the green finance business focuses on 6 green industries, namely energy-saving and environmental protection; cleaner production; clean energy; eco-environment; green infrastructure upgrades; and green services.</p><p> Regulatory dynamicsFrom a supervisory standpoint, banks' green finance businesses have been included in the macro prudential assessment since May 2021. Twenty-four major banking institutions will be subject to the quarterly assessment, where the total and relative scale of green credit, as well as business growth, will be reflected in the quantitative indicators. </p><p> To encourage banks to lend green, the PBOC gave them several direct financial incentives. For example, the PBOC accepted green assets as eligible collateral for its relending facilities, providing low-cost funding to banks for green projects. Green loans are now accepted as part of the standing lending facilities, and green bonds with at least AA ratings are accepted as collateral in medium-term lending facilities.</p><p> The PBOC also provided lower cost funding support to projects either facilitating carbon emission reductions or the efficient and cleaner use of coal, through the carbon emission reduction tool or its 200 billion yuan (US$29.9 billion) re-lending facility. Going forward, there may be preferential risk weighting treatment given to green credit in banks' capital ratio calculation, similar to what the PBOC has done for inclusive loans for micro and small enterprises when it applied a 75 per cent risk weighting.</p><p> Growth potentialPresident Xi Jinping's recent pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 will likely be a significant boost to green finance's development. There will be immense financing demand during China's greener economic transformation. </p><p> UBS estimates that up to US$2 trillion in annual investment will be needed in 9 sectors directly linked to the net-zero target in the coming 40 years. Similarly, the National Development and Reform Commission estimated a total of 487 trillion yuan in financing will be needed in green areas during 2020-2050E.</p><p> Among all the green finance products, green loans and green bonds are the major forms of green financing, whose balance stood at 15.9 trillion yuan and 1.1 trillion yuan at the end of 2021, accounting for 8.3 per cent and 0.8 per cent of the system's total. In our base case, we expect the market for green loans and green bonds to reach 62 trillion yuan and 8 trillion yuan by 2031E, growing at a 10-year compound annual growth rate of 14.5 per cent and 22.2 per cent. </p><p> Green finance could be a major revenue driver for Chinese banks in the coming decade, generating a potential revenue pool of 1.4 trillion yuan and contributing to 15 per cent of the banking system's total by 2031E.</p><p> The profitability outlookIn our view, green lending is a profitable business, with potential 1.3 per cent return on assets and 16 per cent return on equity, which is higher than the general corporate banking business. The higher margin is mainly boosted by lower credit costs at present. </p><p> According to PBOC disclosures, the nonperforming loan ratio for green loans was 0.33 per cent at the end of 2020. However, lower loan yields and deteriorating asset quality may be downside risks for profit margins. The national service risk of lower loan pricing to shore up green industries may weigh on the net loan spread, particularly for the \"Big Four\" state-owned banks, China's major green lenders. </p><p> Currently, it is common practice for state-owned banks to offer cuts of 30 to 50 basis points (bps) off the interest rates of green loans, from our discussions with banks' senior management. </p><p> A potential downside risk is that regulators might continue to guide on banks to lower the loan pricing to support the green industries. </p><p> To assess the asset quality risk, we conducted a debt-at-risk analysis. Our results indicated that green bond issuers likely have higher debt repayment capabilities than general corporate bond issuers. </p><p> However, a list of narrowly defined green companies tended to have higher debt-at-risk ratio than A-share listed companies in general. </p><p> At present, almost half of the green loans went to finance green upgrades of infrastructure. These projects are very likely to be backed by the local government. Hence, default risk could be low. That said, credit costs might come up if government no longer provides extensive supports to green industries, such as ending subsidies.</p><p> Obstacles to developmentTo further grow the green finance business in China, we believe some obstacles may need to be addressed. To begin with, to gradually align China's definition for green industries and green finance with international standards will be a big step forward. </p><p> Currently, China's definitions of green loans and green bonds are markedly different from international benchmarks. For example, in the green loan area, China recognises much narrower categories of eligible green projects. </p><p> The Green Loan Principles (issued by the Asia Pacific Loan Market Association and the Loan Market Association) adopt a non-exhaustive approach by explicitly recognising several broad categories of green projects with the objective of addressing key areas of environmental concern. </p><p> To prevent the risk of greenwashing, the PBOC only recognises green projects in 12 areas. A broader definition could further boost China's green finance development.</p><p> Next, expanding the scope of the carbon trading business by allowing financial institutions to participate in the market. Individual and institutional investors are currently prohibited from trading on the national carbon exchange, the China Carbon Emission Trade Exchange (CCETE). </p><p> On top of this, the CCETE allows for a much narrower scope of trading products than the EU Emissions Trading System, which launched carbon financial derivatives, such as carbon emission spot, forward, futures and option products in 2005. </p><p> These financial derivatives could reduce the volatility of carbon prices, and are thus conducive to the emission cost control of enterprises and enhanced market liquidity, in our view. </p><p> We believe financial institutions' participation in the carbon trading market could facilitate innovation in the carbon finance area and better satisfy companies' carbon financing demand.</p><p> Last but not the least, banks should incorporate more advanced risk modelling and management into their green finance businesses. </p><p> China's banking system does not have a clear responsibility mechanism for environmental accidents and liabilities. As a result, most banks are not conducting comprehensive environmental stress tests. </p><p> Even though the PBOC conducted the first round of climate risk stress tests in late 2021, the scope of testing was limited and only 23 large banks participated. There is still a long way to go to develop more advanced modelling, in our view.

When completed in the 2040s, Tuas Port will be the world's largest fully-automated terminal, with a handling capacity of 65 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs), almost double the handling volume of 37.3 million TEUs handled in 2022.</p><p>2. Development of Tuas Port is over four phases. Reclamation works for Phase 1 commenced in February 2015 and were completed in November 2021. Reclamation works for Phase 2 commenced in March 2018 and is currently about 60% completed. When the berths in both phases are fully operational, Tuas Port will reach an annual handling capacity of more than 40 million TEUs.</p><p>3. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA) has started planning and design works for Tuas Port Phase 3. Reclamation works for Phase 3 is expected to be completed in the mid-2030s.</p><p>4. To improve Tuas Port's accessibility for its workers and users, MPA will collaborate with port operator, PSA Singapore, government agencies, industry partners and unions to form a tripartite committee in 2023 to co-create various transportation options for port workers and users.</p><p>Maritime 5G</p><p>5. To further maritime digitalisation and the development of future concept of operations, MPA and Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) in August 2022 to provide full maritime 5G coverage in our major anchorages, fairways, terminals and boarding grounds by mid-2025.</p><p>6. Twelve maritime 5G base stations will be set up to complement the onshore 5G communication infrastructure. Three of the base stations will be ready by 2023 to support testing and development of new digital applications, such as remotely assisted pilotage advisory, digital bunkering, delivery drones, and telemedicine. The remaining nine base stations will be set up by 2025.</p><p>Next Generation Vessel Traffic Management System</p><p>7. To further strengthen vessel navigational safety and efficiency of the port as we continue to grow our hub port, MPA is developing an artificial intelligence-enabled Next Generation Vessel Traffic Management System (NGVTMS) to replace the existing Vessel Traffic Information System (VTIS).</p><p>8. With data analytics and machine learning to identify traffic hotspots as well as advanced algorithms to predict potential collisions, the NGVTMS will allow MPA to provide Ship Captains with more accurate and timely information to take early actions for navigational safety. Secured and reliable data transfer between ship-ship and ship-shore for NGVTMS can be facilitated through various connectivity platforms such as the VHF Data Exchange System (VDES) and the maritime 5G network.</p><p>9. The NGVTMS will be developed in three phases.</p><p>i. Phase 1 - Innovation Programme [2018- 2021]: MPA completed a three-year Innovation Programme in 2021 to develop and test new operating concepts and technologies to enhance navigation safety and efficiency of vessel traffic management.</p><p>ii. Phase 2 - Prototyping [2023 - 2024]: MPA will start to develop a system prototype in April 2023 to test various vessel traffic management applications such as the Smart Collision Detection and Proactive Traffic Management in a real-time sandbox operating environment. This will enable MPA to gain insights on potential new capabilities and scope the requirements and specifications for system implementation.</p><p>iii. Phase 3 - System Implementation [2024-2027]: The final phase will consist of design, development, installation, testing, and commissioning of the NGVTMS. The system will be deployed from 2025 for 24/7 operations.</p><p>Phase 2 of digitalPORT@SG(TM)</p><p>10. With the successful implementation of digitalPORT@SG(TM) Phase 1 as a one stop portal for port entry and departure in 2020, MPA will roll out Phase 2 of digitalPORT@SG(TM) in 2023.</p><p>11. Phase 2 will provide port stakeholders with real-time information to facilitate just-in-time vessel arrivals to terminals, help vessels access marine services such as bunkering, supplies and repairs, as well as an Active Anchorage Management System to optimise the usage of anchorage spaces. This will enhance port efficiency, reduce ship turnaround time, and cut greenhouse gas emissions by minimising ships' idling time at anchorages.</p><p>Singapore Trade Data Exchange Pilot Data Sharing Initiative</p><p>12. MPA will work with Singapore Trade Data Exchange (SGTraDex), Jurong Port and their partners to pilot a data sharing initiative under SGTraDex's ship supplies and lighterage optimisation use case that focuses on supplies procurement, fulfilment and lighterage logistics. The pilot aims to help large and small businesses optimise their ship supplies operations by digitalising their ship supplies operations, and encouraging data sharing between supply chain stakeholders in the ship supplies sector.</p><p>Maritime Cyber Assurance and Operations Centre</p><p>13. As maritime systems become increasingly digitalised, Singapore must also be prepared with the right tools to manage the risk of cyber incidents that could disrupt the flow of vessels and cargo at our ports.</p><p>14. MPA will establish the Maritime Cyber Assurance and Operations Centre (MCAOC) by 2025 to provide real-time security monitoring and disseminate information to mitigate cyber threats, advise on system recovery and measures to take following an incident, and facilitate cyber threat information-sharing among maritime stakeholders such as port and terminal operators, shipping lines and marine service providers with digital systems.</p><p>15. The MCAOC will enable maritime stakeholders to pool financial and manpower resources, and create economies of scale, to tackle cyber threats in the maritime sector.</p><p>16. Equipped with analytics capability, MCAOC will strengthen operational responses to evolving cyber threats by providing insights to maritime stakeholders on advanced malware and modes of attack. MCAOC will also offer training and conduct cybersecurity exercises for the maritime industry.</p><p>(B) Reducing carbon emissions in Maritime Singapore</p><p>Decarbonising Domestic Harbour Craft and Pleasure Craft</p><p>17. MPA will set the target for the harbour craft and pleasure craft sectors to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 in support of Singapore's 2050 national net-zero target. To achieve this transition, from 2030, all new harbour craft operating in our port waters must be fully electric, be capable of using B100 biofuel, or be compatible with net-zero fuels such as hydrogen.</p><p>18. To help the industry meet the 2030 requirement, MPA encourages the industry to consult with MPA on the owners' electric, B100 or hydrogen compatible harbour craft designs early. The consultation process will be a compulsory requirement from 2027.</p><p>19. MPA will support the development of electrification technology through the following initiatives:</p><p>Disclaimer: Table can be viewed at: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mpa.gov.sg/media-centre/details/strenghtening-singapore-s-competitveness-as-a-hub-port-and-international-maritime-centre\">https://www.mpa.gov.sg/media-centre/details/strenghtening-singapore-s-competitveness-as-a-hub-port-and-international-maritime-centre</url></p><p>Pathways for Alternative Fuels</p><p>20. To prepare Singapore for a multi-fuel bunkering future, MPA has developed the world's first marine biofuel provisional standard in consultation with the industry and researchers for biofuel blends of up to 50% or B50. This standard will be updated progressively as trials for biofuel blends of up to 100%, or B100 are carried out, and is expected to be completed by 2025. Singapore's Maritime Energy and Sustainable Development Centre of Excellence will also be releasing the findings of its compatibility study on various biofuel types and percentage blends for our harbour crafts by end March 2023.</p><p>21. Aside from biofuels, MPA is exploring the use of hydrogen and ammonia to support the decarbonisation of international shipping. In December 2022, MPA and the Energy Market Authority launched an Expression of Interest (EOI) to build, own and operate low or zero-carbon ammonia power generation and bunkering solutions on Jurong Island. The EOI is open until end April 2023.</p><p>Green and Digital Shipping Corridors</p><p>22. In August 2022, MPA signed a MOU with the Port of Rotterdam to establish the world's longest \"Green and Digital Shipping Corridor (GDSC)\". The corridor will pilot the deployment of digital solutions, support investment in green infrastructure, and develop enablers to accelerate low and zero carbon shipping.</p><p>23. Singapore is actively engaging other like-minded ports and country partners to establish more corridors. Recently, MPA, Port of Los Angeles, Port of Long Beach and C40 Cities started discussions to establish a GDSC between Singapore and the San Pedro Bay port complex.</p><p>(C) Future-Ready Maritime Talent</p><p>24. MPA has put in place several schemes to attract and develop a steady pipeline of maritime talent, who are equipped with the right skills and expertise as the industry transforms.</p><p>Internships, scholarships, and pre-employment training for undergraduates</p><p>25. Global Internship Award: Established by MPA in 2013, the Global Internship Award aims to help undergraduates better understand the international nature of the maritime industry. The 12-week programme gives selected undergraduates an opportunity to gain on-the-job experience working in a leading maritime company. It sponsors the undergraduate for an overseas attachment of up to six weeks in the overseas office of the company. More than 300 undergraduates have benefitted from the programme in the last ten years.</p><p>26. Scholarships: In 2022, 54 MaritimeONE scholarships, worth about S$1.7 million in value, were awarded. Since the launch in 2007, 524 recipients have received the scholarships. Additionally, 12 Tripartite Maritime Scholarships (TMSS) valued at about S$1 million were awarded in 2022 to seafaring cadets. Since the launch in 2002, more than 240 TMSS have been given out.</p><p>27. Work-Study Programmes: There are currently three maritime-related Work-Study Post-Diploma Programmes targeted at fresh Polytechnic graduates conducted by Singapore Polytechnic (SP), and a Work-Study Diploma by the Institute of Technical Education (ITE). The programmes provide graduates with a head-start in their careers and deepens their skillsets in various roles including seafaring, port operations, cargo operations, and shipboard operations.</p><p>i. Port Management and Operations by SP</p><p>ii. Seafaring Deck Officer by SP</p><p>iii. Seafaring Marine Engineer by SP</p><p>iv. Work-Study Diploma-Maritime Business Management by ITE</p><p>Career conversion and mid-career development</p><p>28. Career Conversion Programme: The Career Conversion Programme (CCP) for Sea Transport Professionals and Associates provides maritime and non-maritime mid careerists with skills conversion opportunities, to enable them to take on roles in Port Operations and Services, Shipping, and Maritime Services. Close to 220 Mid-Careerists have benefitted from the Career Conversion Programmes for Sea Transport since 2018.</p><p>29. Maritime Leadership Programme: Since its launch in 2021, more than 40 maritime professionals have attended the Maritime Leadership Programme (MLP). The MLP aims to hone participants' leadership skills, build global perspectives on key maritime issues, and strengthen business networks locally and abroad.

Not only for Denmark, but also for Europe and the rest of the world,\" said Climate Minister Dan Jorgensen during a presentation of the project in February.</p><p> The project has been budgeted at (EURO)28 billion (S$44 billion) and it will be built in stages, with construction expected to start in 2026. The government expects the turbines to be operational from 2033.</p><p> The exact location of the island has not yet been determined, but it will be on a shelf west of the harbour town of Thorsminde.</p><p> Each windmill is expected to produce 15 megawatts - three times the power produced entirely by the first offshore wind farm off the island of Lolland, which was opened in 1991.</p><p> In the first stage of development, 200 windmills will be built in the sea at a depth of 25m to 30m. The energy island will supply 3 gigawatts of electricity in its initial phase. That is almost twice as much as the current output of all Danish offshore wind turbines.</p><p> Around 450 more turbines will be built, until a capacity of 10 gigawatts is reached - enough for 10 million households.</p><p>Denmark has only 2.8 million households, and a population of 5.8 million. This means the country will be an important supplier of electricity to Germany, its big industrial neighbour to the south.</p><p> Usually, such mega projects are expected from bigger countries such as China, and not from a small country.</p><p> \"It is important that Denmark leads the way,\" said Mr Jorgensen. \"Only if we inspire others and develop new green solutions that they will use, can we seriously do something about climate change.\"</p><p> The country aims to achieve an ambitious 70 per cent reduction in carbon dioxide by 2030, compared with 1990. This cannot be achieved without abandoning fossil fuels.</p><p> \"We'll manage on sun and wind alone,\" said Professor Jacob Ostergaard, founder and head of the Centre for Electric Power and Energy at the Technical University of Denmark in Copenhagen.</p><p> With 110 employees, he is researching smart solutions which do not unnecessarily store electricity in resource-guzzling and expensive batteries.</p><p> \"Right now, we need 4.6 gigawatts of electricity in the whole country on an average morning,\" said Prof Ostergaard. That is only a third more than what the energy island will supply in its first development stage.</p><p> \"In fact, we will multiply energy production and consumption in the future. The wind potential in the North Sea is huge,\" he said, adding that 180 gigawatts lie fallow there.</p><p> However, the turbines in the stormy sea could produce far too much electricity for the power grid.</p><p> Prof Ostergaard has the solution ready: Produce liquid fuel at sea whenever the turbines produce too much electricity. \"We will also need liquid fuel in the future for industry,\" he said.</p><p> The splitting of water into oxygen and hydrogen using the process of electrolysis consumes a lot of electricity, he explained. The hydrogen can then be processed into aviation petrol and other fuels for climate-neutral aircraft and container ships.</p><p> That is why the energy island needs such a large area: There has to be space for a hydrogen factory.</p><p> However, engineers are also trying their hand at another revolutionary idea: producing hydrogen directly in or near the towers of the windmills, which will be piped to the energy island and then to the coast.</p><p> \"The main point is to create flexibility everywhere in the energy system,\" said Prof Ostergaard.</p><p> That means, for example, building new and better cable lines to other seaboard countries.</p><p> \"There is almost always wind in the North Sea. When it dies down off Denmark, there is a fresh breeze off the Netherlands, or vice versa,\" he said.</p><p> There has hardly been any opposition to the Danish mega-project, with all the main opposition parties in Parliament in favour of it.</p><p> Mr Sune Scheller from the Greenpeace environmental group is also positive about it. \"Of course, plans and construction must stand up to environmental impact assessments. But if we criticise anything, it's mainly that it's not happening fast enough,\" he said.</p><p> The bidding process is being prepared, and the tender is to be processed next year.</p><p> So far, two Danish-dominated consortia are vying for the contract. One is led by Orsted, the world leader in offshore wind power. Its competitor is Vindo, a consortium of pension funds, a utility company and green infrastructure investment company Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners.</p><p> In early 2023, it will be announced who will co-finance, build and operate the island. What is known so far is that the Danish state will hold 51 per cent of the project.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-860240</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:641K-FXT1-DYX4-01TH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 8, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

China, which has embarked on its Belt and Road Initiative, has been involved in African mining and other developments for several decades already.</p><p>As for climate change, G-7 leaders once again reaffirmed their support for a green revolution to create jobs, cut emissions and limit the rise in global temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius.</p><p>\"We commit to net zero no later than 2050, halving our collective emissions over the two decades to 2030, increasing and improving climate finance to 2025; and to conserve or protect at least 30 per cent of our land and oceans by 2030,\" they said.</p><p>The G-7 promised to end international funding for coal projects by the end of 2022, unless these projects include technology to capture and store carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>They also promised an \"overwhelmingly decarbonised\" electricity sector by the end of this decade.</p><p>The G-7 wants to encourage businesses \"to use electronic transferable records in order to generate efficiencies and economic savings\".</p><p>They intend to take \"further steps to improve Internet safety and to counter hate speech, while protecting human rights and fundamental freedoms, including free expression\".</p><p>The G-7 also backs the underpinning of wider digital and communications infrastructure to promote secure, resilient, competitive, transparent, sustainable and diverse digital, telecoms, and infrastructure supply chains.</p><p>Despite critics pointing out that the G-7 missed the boat in making legally binding and detailed financial commitments, British officials said over the weekend that these are more likely to be made at either the G-20 meeting in July or at the UN climate change summit in November.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>US President Joe Biden at the G-7 summit.

Shockingly, less than 10,000 of the 400 million companies are measuring their carbon emissions globally. Grace Sai and her team started Unravel Carbon in 2022 to bring a transformation. </p><p><br/>Based in Singapore, Unravel Carbon helps companies track and reduce their carbon emissions, specialising in Scope 3, focusing on Asia-Pacific. (Scope 3 emissions are the result of activities from assets not owned or controlled by the reporting organisation but that the organisation indirectly impacts in its value chain) <br/>An AI-powered decarbonisation platform, Unravel Carbon converts any company's accounting data into full supply chain carbon data in seconds, provides detailed emissions analytics, generates climate solutions, and auto-populates regulatory disclosure reports. It serves companies within the food &amp; agriculture, tech, fashion &amp; footwear, and built environment sectors \u2014 which account for more than 60 per cent of global carbon emissions. <br/>We recently interviewed Grace Sai, who spoke about climate change, the company's resolve to tackle it, and the climate tech space. She also talked about the significance of offline events likeEchelon Asia 2022[1], where she will speak about climate change. <br/>Why are climate-tech solutions like Unravel Carbon's crucial in this era? <br/>The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for 60 per cent of global emissions, and we house 70 per cent of supply chains worldwide. The burden of responsibility is on us, but many companies who want to take action have to go through the rigmarole of manual data collection. This process takes six to nine months and typically involves external consultants. <br/>Unravel Carbon converts accounting data into carbon data in seconds. We want to make decarbonising painless \u2014 by switching around the effort/impact ratio, companies can now use their time on what really matters \u2014 implementing strategies to reduce their emissions. <br/>Also Read: 'Economic crises become less important when investing with a longer-term mindset': Qin En Looi[2] <br/>Climate tech solutions are critical to enabling accelerated and aggressive action to limit global warming. We have a mission to decarbonise 1 Gt CO2-e by 2030, totalling 5 per cent of global carbon reduction goals. The power of computing makes this possible and is crucial, especially in an era of climate emergency. <br/>While many companies are now emerging in climate tech, the space is yet to get its due attention. Is it because the world hasn't fully realised the magnitude of the problem? <br/>Public awareness of climate change has increased in recent years, especially with the rise of intense climate-related disasters. Regardless of whether society acknowledges it, the impacts are already at our doorsteps and felt by many. <br/>I've observed that while there has been an increase in companies setting net zero targets, the urgency in achieving these climate goals is lacking \u2014 40 per cent of them don't even have a target year to achieve these commitments yet. <br/>With the era of pledges behind us, the next critical decade must focus on pathways. Platforms like Unravel Carbon suggest these pathways and keep companies accountable for achieving them. <br/>The amount of funds flowing into this space is also relatively low <br/>The investment focus for climate tech has seen significant growth in recent years in terms of fund allocations. We were told that we had raised the largest seed round for a climate tech platform in Asia's history. The Y Combinator cohort we were part of (W22)[3] had the most climate tech companies in YC's history. Paul Graham, the founder of YC, even tweeted about that. <br/>There are multiple reasons here, but we love the coming together for regulatory and personal reasons. Inflexion points happen when a multitude of motivations come together at the same time. It may take decades to reach there, but once that is reached, it accelerates in impact and magnitude. We believe climate tech is just at that inflexion point. <br/>Also Read: 'Events like Echelon are important during tough times because there's strength in unity'[4] <br/>Emerging regulations such as the EU's Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) catalyses companies and investors to revise their business strategies. Similarly, under the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) March 2022 climate-related rule proposal, public companies must disclose their Scope 3 emissions. Thousands of companies have now made pledges to net zero or set science-based targets. <br/>There is, however, still a lot of room for growth \u2014 according to estimates from BNEF and McKinsey, to reach net zero by 2050, the world will have to invest anywhere from US$3 trillion to US$9 trillion per year on average. Following this, we can expect climate tech investment figures to increase exponentially in the coming years. <br/>As per a Bloomberg report[5]of August 2022, carbon and climate startups have attracted record investments at a time when other industries are struggling to tap funds from venture capitalists.Buoyed by corporate and government pledges to cut greenhouse gas emissions, a record US$1.4 billion poured into climate and carbon-focused startups in the second quarter of this year. <br/>How can companies like Unravel Carbon and VCs collaborate with governments to educate the market? <br/>Companies like ours bring the power of digitalisation to solving the climate crisis \u2014primarily in the lack of data and good user interfaces for companies, both large and small, to be part of the solution. <br/>In many countries, governments can be powerful in driving digital adoption through their fiscal and legislative policies. The government also has the most expansive reach when it comes to the millions of SMEs that constitute a significant component of most economies. Governments working with the private sector represent the best of both worlds. They can represent a robust working model to educate the market that can affect real change amongst businesses on the importance of addressing climate change. <br/>This public-private engagement model would marry the tools, know-how, and mission of a company like Unravel Carbon, with the reach and policymaking power of the government. VCs would play a powerful enabling role where their capital would provide the firepower needed to scale the deployment of climate tech solutions through the broader economy. <br/>What is the role of governments here? <br/>Presently, 140 countries have announced or are considering net zero targets, so we will see increases in climate legislation in the coming years as governments start applying pressure through regulation or policymaking. For example, implementing carbon taxes, setting standards or bans, introducing subsidies or public finance mechanisms, and green infrastructure investment. <br/>This will drive accountability in the private sector as governments signal clear expectations and eliminate any ambiguity that might lead to inaction. <br/>Why are offline events like Echelon important in tough times like economic slow-down? What do you expect from the event? <br/>Offline events are a key component of a vibrant and healthy startup ecosystem. Not only do they propagate valuable thought leadership and ideas to the startup community at large, but these events provide a crucial avenue for networking and collaboration between entrepreneurs, investors, mentors, corporates, and other stakeholders. <br/>Also Read: Nothing can truly replace the offline element of community building: Yinglan Tan[6] <br/>During tough times, increased connectivity within the ecosystem from face-to-face engagement can create significant economic value. These events are also versatile in offering multiple value offerings to different stakeholders. <br/>For example, we hope the event will give Unravel Carbon more visibility amongst attendees, as greater awareness about our primary product positively impacts our vision and mission. <br/>\u2014- <br/>Echelon 2022 aims to provide intimate and focused discussions on key topics and business matching services to facilitate business-driven connections during the two-day event.e27will curate and invite key stakeholders of startups, investors, corporates, and ecosystem enablers to drive towards fruitful business outcomes at Echelon. <br/>Here's the full list of the speakers for the 2022 edition[7], which will be co-located with SWITCH at Resorts World Sentosa from 27 to 28 October 2022.Learn more here[1]. <br/>The post 'There's a lack of urgency among companies in achieving net zero targets': Unravel Carbon's Grace Sai[8] appeared first on e27[9]. <br/> [ 1]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon/asia/\">https://e27.co/echelon/asia/</url> [ 2]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/interview-with-qin-en-looi-echelon-2022-20220919\">https://e27.co/interview-with-qin-en-looi-echelon-2022-20220919</url>/ [ 3]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/unravel-carbon\">https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/unravel-carbon</url> [ 4]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/events-like-echelon-are-important-during-tough-times-because-theres-strength-in-unity-20220926\">https://e27.co/events-like-echelon-are-important-during-tough-times-because-theres-strength-in-unity-20220926</url>/ [ 5]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-17/carbon-tech-draws-record-vc-funding-as-investors-hunt-for-impact?leadSource=uverify%20wall\">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-08-17/carbon-tech-draws-record-vc-funding-as-investors-hunt-for-impact?leadSource=uverify%20wall</url> [ 6]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/nothing-can-truly-replace-the-offline-element-of-community-building-yinglan-tan-20220912\">https://e27.co/nothing-can-truly-replace-the-offline-element-of-community-building-yinglan-tan-20220912</url>/ [ 7]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon/asia/agenda/\">https://e27.co/echelon/asia/agenda/</url> [ 8]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/urgency-to-achieve-net-zero-targets-is-lacking-unravel-carbon-20221004\">https://e27.co/urgency-to-achieve-net-zero-targets-is-lacking-unravel-carbon-20221004</url>/ [ 9]: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co\">https://e27.co</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-ETSG119314166486715045025976100010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66J1-N6D1-F03R-N2BF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1569\"/><timeReceived>7:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>e27</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 4, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climate Tech &amp;

During the transition process, it is important that it does not result in friction.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Heng, who is also Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies, was responding to a request for elaboration on a point he had raised in his keynote speech earlier - that competition between the US and China is a challenge faced by the region and the world.</p><p>He had earlier said that while tensions are unlikely to abate for the foreseeable future, the key to stability for South-east Asia and the world, is for the two major powers to focus on expanding common ground while preventing tensions from boiling over.</p><p>\"For Asean, we do not expect to change the course of the strategic competition, but we must do all that we can to keep the region open and inclusive,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our region must remain firmly anchored in Asean's own interest, and continue to build a regional architecture that is open, transparent, inclusive and rules-based.\"</p><p>He also noted in his speech that even as Asean and China deepen their economic relationship, it is important to manage friction and disputes well.</p><p>He cited, for example, the competing claims in the South China Sea and concerns over environmental degradation in the Mekong region.</p><p>\"The key is to manage these disputes in a rational manner, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law... and with guard rails to ensure that tensions do not escalate out of control,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Heng also identified a number of ways for Asean and China to strengthen the foundational building blocks while creating new building blocks of cooperation at the forum, themed \"Elevating Asean-China Economic Collaboration in the 'never normal\". The foundation of existing partnerships that can be fortified include the Asean-China Free-Trade Agreement (FTA).</p><p>\"Let us work toward upgrading this agreement to reduce non-tariff measures and address new priorities, especially for the digital economy.</p><p>\"As we prepare to resume cross-border travel, we should rebuild our aviation links and further liberalise the Asean-China Air-Transport Agreement to boost our region's connectivity,\" he said.</p><p>He identified digital collaboration and sustainable development as two building blocks to work on.</p><p>One way to strengthen digital collaboration is to pilot more city-to-city projects, similar to the Smart-City Initiative between Singapore and Shenzhen.</p><p>The panellists at the forum agreed that Singapore will continue to play a key role between China and Asean.</p><p>Helen Wong, group chief executive at OCBC Bank, noted that many multinationals choose to anchor their management teams and banking relationships in Singapore, even as they look to set up second or even third production points within Asean as part of their China+1 strategy.</p><p>Liu Jin, vice-chairman and president of the Bank of China said: \"As China and Asean work more closely, Singapore is no doubt expected to play a greater role.\"</p><p>Citing Singapore's reputation as a regional and global hub for business and commerce, he said the city-state can \"act as a bridge\" for businesses in China and Asean. \"The fintech boom in Singapore can also serve to enhance the financial connectivity between China and Asean,\" he said.</p><p>The other building block Mr Heng named in his speech, that of sustainable development, can be catalysed by investing in buildings that are more energy-efficient and exploring cleaner-energy sources such as solar and wind.</p><p>A \"Green BRI\", similar to China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) will be a major step in catalysing green infrastructure, he said, adding that Singapore is contributing to the green recovery effort through Infrastructure Asia, with up to US$15 billion in green bonds for public infrastructure projects.</p><p>Carbon sequestration, the long-term capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is also key. To support this, common standards must be set up, traceability has to be improved, and vibrant exchanges for the trading of carbon credits established, he said.</p><p>Singapore is launching one such financial exchange - Climate Impact X - to be jointly set up by the Singapore Exchange, DBS, Standard Chartered and Temasek, by the end of this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat (centre) and OCBC group CEO Helen Wong were part of a panel discussion at Monday's FutureChina Global Forum.

The city-state has previously said it would achieve net-zero emissions \"as soon as viable in the second half of the century\". It also pledged to peak emissions around 2030, and halve them by 2050.</p><p> While the country is disadvantaged given its lack of natural renewable energy sources, green technologies have been improving rapidly and alternative low carbon solutions like carbon capture, utilisation and storage as well as hydrogen are starting to look more plausible.</p><p> \"We will therefore raise our ambition to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century,\" Wong said.</p><p> To achieve the new net-zero ambition, Singapore will raise the carbon tax in several steps, with a view to reaching S$50 to S$80 per tonne by 2030.</p><p> Businesses will be able to use carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of taxable emissions, while households will get support such as utilities rebates.</p><p> The coming decade would see a greening of traditional sectors of the economy such as aviation, energy and tourism, said Wong.</p><p> \"At the same time, emerging green sectors like green finance and carbon services will grow in prominence. Millions of new green jobs will be created around the world and demand for talent with green skills will increase.\"</p><p> Moving quickly, Singapore will be able to build on its competitive advantages and capture new opportunities.</p><p> \"We can become the go-to location in Asia for expertise in carbon services and the trusted regional marketplace for carbon credits. As a key node for international air and sea transport networks, we can become a frontrunner in the development of sustainable aviation and marine fuels,\" he said.</p><p> Green finance is one of the fastest growing segments in the financial services sector. Singapore accounts for close to half of the Asean green bond and loan market.</p><p> \"We aim to do more so that banks and financial institutions will use Singapore as a base to develop their capabilities and to develop innovative green financial solutions to service their customers all over Asia and the world.\"</p><p>Singapore aims to issue up to S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects.This is up from the S$19 billion of green bonds announced in last year's Budget. It will include bonds issued by the government and statutory boards.</p><p> The government will also publish a Singapore green bond framework and issue inaugural green bond data this year.</p><p> Apart from green financing, Singapore also aims to be at the forefront of green technologies, where new innovations are developed, scaled up and eventually exported to the rest of the world.</p><p> Wong said Singapore intends to \"work hard to grab the first mover advantage and develop new engines of growth in the green economy\".</p><p> As part of its green plan, which will see the phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles by 2014, Singapore will further accelerate electric vehicle (EV) adoption by building more charging points. The infrastructure upgrades will be funded by green bonds. EV's market share was 4 per cent in 2021, compared to 0.2 per cent in 2020.</p><p>Singapore's new green target is widely lauded by the industry.</p><p> Sharad Somani, partner, head of infrastructure advisory, KPMG in Singapore, said the five-fold hike in carbon tax by 2030 is a \"brave move\", and \"lends further credibility to Singapore's goal of bringing forward the net-zero target to around mid-century\".</p><p> \"We should expect a lot more international collaborations as well as research and development investments on cutting edge technologies covering carbon capture, energy efficiency, alternate fuels and clean energy infrastructure,\" Somani said.</p><p> Irene Tai, partner, tax at PwC Singapore said the move reflects Singapore's seriousness about its commitment to the Paris Agreement and signals its intention to become a green economic hub, despite the challenging economic environment.</p><p> \"We look forward to seeing the carbon tax revenues reinvested to support companies' efforts to achieve their low carbon transition ambitions,\" Tai said.</p><p> Fang Eu-Lin, environmental, social and governance (ESG) leader at PwC Singapore, said the plans to issue up to S$35 billion in green bonds by 2030 will help to create jobs across the value chain, from sustainable finance, sustainable infrastructure and assets, ESG professionals, and further direct capital towards green projects to combat climate change.</p><p> \"It gives further certainty to the transitions that are going to have to take place, for example, infrastructure for EVs and phasing out of internal combustion engine vehicles,\" she said.</p><p> However, to be in the forefront of a green finance hub, it will require an ecosystem including green projects, demand from investors and the expertise, from designing the right jobs to skills to carry these ambitions, Fang said.</p><p> Abhi Bhuchar, head of Consumer and Industrials, Southeast Asia, and Energy, Asia Pacific, at Oliver Wyman, believes the progressive increase in carbon tax will increase Singapore's attractiveness as an investment hub.</p><p> \"The government has given certainty in an uncertain path to decarbonisation, which will certainly attract capital. In addition, this will spur carbon market development and all the investments that go with it. For example, in the aviation and shipping sector, it would drive investments in more fuel efficiency and the development of sustainable fuels.\"</p><p> Timothy Colyer, partner, Financial Services, at Oliver Wyman, said the hike in carbon tax will inspire laggards to invest in transition technologies.</p><p> It also provides support to Singapore's role as a regional financial centre for carbon credits, and should be welcomed by the Asian subsidiaries of multinational companies with net-zero commitments.</p><p>KEY POINTS</p><p>Net-zero goal brought forwardGovernment to issue up to S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-388542</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64TJ-FY71-JCF2-82T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1030\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This is the Budget that will not only take Singapore out of the pandemic with confidence, but also one that we hope will set the country on course for the future in a world marked by constant fast-paced changes and uncertainties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We do expect that in this future, sustainability will underpin business and living, with Singapore potentially taking the lead regionally in green initiatives and financing to cut down on carbon emissions. Amid ongoing uncertainties on the global front, including how the new international tax rules will take shape, Singapore will also have to be at the forefront of these developments to seize new opportunities.</p><p> Emerging from the pandemic, Budget 2022 lays out the steps that Singapore should be taking in the medium to long term. Three priorities mentioned in the Budget speech are worth highlighting: (1) Driving an environmental, social and governance (ESG) agenda for Singapore; (2) Strengthening Singapore's value proposition as a regional hub of choice for businesses; and (3) Upskilling our workforce and attracting talent for a digital-led world across industries.</p><p> These will be crucial for Singapore to catch the next economic sunrise and aligns with KPMG in Singapore's 3C framework for Budget 2022 where we outline how Singapore can \"Catch the Sun\", \"Chart New Orbits\", and \"Strengthen our Core\" to emerge as a resilient, purpose-driven and growth-oriented economy.</p><p>Driving the regional ESG agenda</p><p> In his Budget speech, Wong reaffirmed Singapore's commitment to the Singapore Green Plan and expressed his bold plans for Singapore to achieve net-zero emissions by or around mid-century.</p><p> One of the measures that will have significant impact on businesses will be the hike in carbon tax. Singapore is set to raise its current carbon tax of S$5 per tonne to between S$50 and S$80 per tonne by 2030. Businesses would need to take major steps to decarbonise and tap the government support during this transition to ensure that their competitiveness will not be severely impacted from the increased carbon taxes.</p><p> Key to moving the green agenda as well would be green finance and green energy. This will be crucial in positioning Singapore as the go-to location in Asia for sustainability services. To develop a robust green market, Singapore will look at issuing up to S$35 billion in green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects. To further drive green innovation and tech adoption, a green energy investment fund could be mobilised to drive Singapore's and Asia's net zero ambitions.</p><p>Strengthening Singapore's value proposition as a hub of choice for businesses</p><p> Certainly, emerging from the pandemic, Singapore businesses will continue to need help to tackle immediate concerns. The government will set aside S$500 million for the Jobs and Business Support Package. This includes a Small Business Recovery Grant for small and medium-size enterprises that have been most affected by Covid-19 restrictions over the past year, such as those in the food and beverage, retail, tourism and hospitality sectors.</p><p> However, the country will also have to keep its sights on global developments as they unfold. While the net impact of the global tax rules remains to be seen, Singapore said it will be exploring a top-up tax called the Minimum Effective Tax Rate. This is to get the effective tax rate of affected multinational groups up to 15 per cent in Singapore.</p><p> Reassessing the balance between tax and non-tax measures will be crucial in attracting multinational companies to continue to locate their offices in Singapore, if not their headquarters (HQs).</p><p> At home, an area where we see the potential for transformation is in incentivising and anchoring \"factories of the future\" in Singapore. This is especially since more Singapore enterprises are adopting cutting-edge technologies to improve their manufacturing processes and produce high-value products.</p><p> As for non-tax incentives, Singapore will need to step up efforts to attract internationally trained and experienced human capital. A highly skilled workforce remains a critical value driver for Singapore into the future. Sector-specific talent will be needed for enterprise to grow and compete, and these should be considered as part of the national manpower strategy, with policies on specialised talent to meet immediate and long-term needs.</p><p>Attracting talent for a digital-led world across industries</p><p>Singapore is in a much better position today than it was two years ago, when the pandemic hit the economy and led to its worst decline since independence. With Budget 2022 charting an even stronger future for Singapore, enterprises will have to hire the best talent, even as the country continues to invest in Singaporeans.</p><p> It is important to note that the Minister for Finance has emphasised in his speech that Singapore will continue to stay open and welcome talent from around the world.</p><p> About S$600 million will be set aside to expand the range of available solutions under the Productivity Solutions Grant, while larger local businesses will be supported by a new initiative called the Singapore Global Enterprises, which will provide bespoke assistance tailored to the needs of promising local enterprises.</p><p> As companies large and small adopt a more permanent hybrid work model, they will need to continue to digitalise their operations across critical areas, while grooming a new generation of talent in a technology-led future. The gaps in the workforce and society will have to be bridged, with Singapore providing accessible sources of \"digital knowledge\" for all ages, as it grows an adaptable, innovative, and resilient workforce.</p><p> The government has announced an additional S$200 million to build the digital capabilities of businesses and workers. This will go a long way in empowering firms to be bold as they embrace the digital economy and aim for the international market.</p><p> The outlook for enterprises shines bright, with optimism back in the boardroom. About 9 in 10 Singapore CEOs are bullish about the growth potential in Singapore and on their companies' earnings over the next three years, according to KPMG's 2021 CEO Outlook Survey. It will be a pivotal year as many transform their business, engagement and sustainability strategies, and Budget 2022 has laid the foundation for this new economic horizon.</p><p>The writer is managing partner, KPMG in Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Reassessing the balance between tax and non-tax measures will be crucial in attracting multinational companies to continue to locate their offices in Singapore, if not their headquarters.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-388560</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64TJ-FY71-JCF2-82TP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1089\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Some of this has to be recouped.</p><p>Singapore's Net Investment Returns Contribution brings in the equivalent of some 3 per cent of gross domestic product to government coffers. Taxes fund Singapore's recurrent expenditures. In future, funding of infrastructure projects is likely to be done via borrowings, ostensibly by issuing bonds.</p><p> Beyond shoring up public finances, the tax system has to also take into consideration emerging challenges like rising inequality, an ageing society and climate change. It also has to ensure Singapore's competitive advantage remains intact.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GST&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;It is a given that the goods and services tax (GST) will be raised.</p><p> The question is over whether it will be a full 2 per cent at one go, and the timing of its implementation.</p><p> Both from a business planning and tax administration perspective, it might be simpler if it is introduced in one shebang.</p><p> But GST can be a regressive tax. While the burden of a tax on final consumption will hit the entire population, young and old, its impact on the low-income segment of the population will be relatively heavier.</p><p> No doubt it will also capture income from overseas visitors when they start returning and spending in Singapore.</p><p> The government is committed to addressing the unequal impact via GST rebates and vouchers, which could soften the blow on lower-income Singaporeans for the rest of this decade.</p><p> Still, some ask whether this is the right time to institute a 9 per cent GST? We are currently experiencing high inflation. Could a GST hike be delayed two or three years down the road when economic growth is more robust or inflation subsides'</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;WEALTH TAX&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Another potential tool in the tax toolbox to tackle revenue need and inequality is wealth tax and estate duty.</p><p> What form these could take remains to be seen.</p><p> Some form of wealth taxes already exists now in the form of property tax, stamp duties, additional registration fees on vehicles and such. In financial year 2020/21, some 14 per cent of total tax revenue came from stamp duty and property tax.</p><p>Singapore abolished estate duty in 2008 because it impacted the middle-and upper middle-income disproportionately.</p><p> The problem with crafting wealth tax lies in the fact that wealth is often mobile. So are the talent who own the wealth.</p><p> Wealth in the form of art, jewellery, antiques and cash can be easily moved to different locations around the world.</p><p> It is this mobility that has enabled Singapore to become a major wealth management hub. Political stability and policy consistency have also played a big role in making Singapore a pan-Asian financial powerhouse.</p><p> Meanwhile, places like Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Malaysia encourage investors to hold assets there and promote themselves as attractive trust and asset management locations.</p><p> That said, countries around the world are getting together to cooperate in tax enforcement to address base erosion and profit shifting.</p><p> Much of the wealth in Singapore, and Asia, is tied to property. So could such taxes target gains on high-end fixed assets? Should new taxes related to property be tiered, so that the tax falls on larger properties and bigger transactions'</p><p> Also, should there be an inheritance tax for wealth transfers exceeding a certain amount, say over $10 million? In developed economies, such tax can be as high as 40 per cent. But wealthy families can use trust structures and private investment vehicles, as well as family offices, to circumvent such taxes.</p><p> The rich have the benefit of private banks and trust advisers to structure wealth such that such taxes are minimised or avoided.</p><p> So how should one craft this tax to be \"progressive\", but without damaging Singapore's wealth management status or hitting the middle class'</p><p> Also, while wealth taxes may send a nice signal, they may not really move the needle on the tax revenue front. Many big asset transactions need to take place to make a substantial dent on the tax revenue stream.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CARBON TAX&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Climate change is real and small island nations like Singapore will bear the brunt of rising sea levels as global warming intensifies.</p><p> Any tax which provides disincentives for use of fossil fuels and carbon effluence and encourages sustainable green practices must be welcomed.</p><p> Here again, the question of fairness and equity arises.</p><p> The issue is how heavy a carbon tax can be imposed in an economy where access to \"green\" alternatives is somewhat limited at the moment. Singapore does not yet have the infrastructure to produce enough renewable energy.</p><p> It will take time and significant capital expenditure before the economy gets to a position where there is sufficient green infrastructure and access to a sizeable pool of renewable energy.</p><p> The fact that Singapore has a huge petrochemical industry must also factor into any carbon tax consideration.</p><p> Whatever the taxes that may be announced on Friday must be driven by considerations such as maintaining Singapore's competitive position while enhancing its reputation for financial prudence.</p><p> Will higher taxes reduce Singapore's competitiveness in comparison with places like Hong Kong and Switzerland which are the Republic's rivals for global financial hub status'</p><p> While raising taxes may be an immediate imperative of the Government, should there also be more tax incentive schemes to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, especially in areas where Singapore lags behind other developed and developing nations'</p><p> Fairness and sustainability will be key objectives.</p><p> Will the new tax regime reduce the gap between the rich and the poor'</p><p> If taxes on the rich are punitive, will Singapore still be able to attract entrepreneurs and global investors to live and work here, creating jobs and opportunities to contribute to a more vibrant economy in Singapore'</p><p> There is a fine balance to be achieved in increasing tax revenues, reducing social inequality and maintaining social harmony, while also sustaining Singapore's competitiveness and expanding its appeal as a global destination for investors and entrepreneurs.</p><p> Finding the right mix for Singapore's tax regime is no easy matter even for the most hardened economists and policymakers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1019727</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64SP-K3K1-JCF2-828T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1133\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Mr Summers has come under fire for his work as a top economic official in the Obama administration, including for being too favourable to big banks during the financial crisis.</p><p>He downplayed his role in the Biden campaign in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Friday, saying he is \"one of many, many people\" the campaign consults and that he doesn't have a formal role.</p><p>Mr Biden said future stimulus packages should include more aid for states and cities and a green infrastructure Bill that includes investments in light rail, clean drinking water and electric vehicle chargers.</p><p>He also repeated his call for addressing some of the structural issues in the economy that he says have long been ignored. Coronavirus, he has said over the past few weeks, presents an opportunity to address some of these longstanding problems.</p><p>\"I think there's going to be a willingness to fix some of the institutional inequities that have existed for a long time,\" he said. \"Milton Friedman isn't running the show anymore.\" He was referring to economist Milton Friedman, who popularised the notion of shareholder primacy and pursuit of profit.</p><p>In the interview, Mr Biden also contrasted his oversight of the Obama administration's US$800 billion Recovery Act with President Donald Trump's leadership. He said the administration is \"wasting a hell of a lot of money\", and criticised Mr Trump for firing the Pentagon inspector general who was tasked with overseeing the Cares Act.</p><p>\"Right now, there's no oversight,\" he said. Mr Trump, he added \"made it real clear he doesn't have any damn interest in being checked. The last thing he wants is anyone watching that US$500 billion going to corporate America, for God's sake.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Joe Biden said future stimulus packages should include more aid for states and cities.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YS5-NGN1-JCF2-818P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"524\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 26, 2020 (LOAD-DATE)</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC0001UJF</classCode><className>WELLS FARGO &amp;

Even if local firms are willing to tender, being able to win is a different matter.</p><p>Instead of direct loans, agencies could have a public-private investment programme, investing in selected local firms to groom them as global champions, said the report.</p><p>\"This will provide local companies with the ability to focus on innovating the business, without having to take on more debt in the current Covid-19 period.\"</p><p>The report also suggests setting up a Singapore EXIM bank to provide added financial backing, as had been considered back in 2010.</p><p>\"EXIM banks can provide attractive financing to help companies and developers bridge financing gaps and attract better-quality partners, which is particularly important when moving into a new foreign market for the first time,\" said the report.</p><p>It noted that while South Korea, Japan, and China provide subsidised financing to national consortiums to help them win overseas projects, \"there is currently no entity in Singapore's infrastructure scene that is playing this role\".</p><p>Mr Loh suggests that tax incentives should be given to local construction firms who are able to export their services outside of Singapore.</p><p>The report drew upon industry research, international benchmarking, feedback from the SBF Infrastructure Committee, and focus group discussions with 17 companies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>For Singapore's infrastructure sector to grow at home and succeed overseas, more intervention and support are needed, a joint report by the Singapore Business Federation (SBF) Infrastructure Committee and KPMG has recommended.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-356234</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6309-85S1-DYX4-035F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"06\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>June 24, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0002MJ2</classCode><className>KPMG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000DD4S</classCode><className>KORI HOLDINGS LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS541211 OFFICES OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>SIC8721 ACCOUNTING, AUDITING, &amp;

Each brand owner has its own way of selling a car, and this will lead to more complicated financing needs for the EV industry.</p><p> Under the battery-as-a-service model, for example, EV makers allow customers to lease batteries as a separate component from the cars. There are also options where the vehicle is packaged with home EV chargers.</p><p> In Singapore, buyers can purchase the car together with the battery, or opt to set up an EV charging point at home. But moving forward, more options will be available for buyers as EVs become more affordable and the supporting infrastructure evolves.</p><p> The Land Transport Authority expects the cost of buying an EV and ICE vehicle to be similar by the mid-2020s, and has set a target of 60,000 EV charging points by 2030.</p><p> Mr Silalahi said: \"With EVs, it is no longer one solution fits all, like now. This will change the way the financing of this ecosystem works. We need to evolve to meet new demand and new ways of selling by adjusting the way all this is financed.\"</p><p> Last month, UOB launched U-Drive, its first integrated green financing plan for the EV ecosystem in Singapore.</p><p>  NO ONE-SIZE-FITS-ALL SOLUTION With EVs, it is no longer one solution fits all... We need to evolve to meet new demand and new ways of selling by adjusting the way all this is financed.</p><p> MR BONAR SILALAHI,  UOB's head of industrials and consumer goods.  Aside from EV financing, UOB this month also launched financing plans for energy-efficiency projects for buildings and homes in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia. The platform - called U-Energy - will start off with nine energy service companies to help customers cut at least 20 per cent in energy consumption on average. Brand owners launching business models such as battery-as-a-service, car dealers planning to expand inventory, or charging point operators procuring and installing infrastructure can tap these green facilities for working capital needs.</p><p> Businesses or individuals can also tap green financial solutions for their purchases of EVs and charging equipment.</p><p> UOB is pioneering the U-Drive solution with Hong Seh Evolution, authorised distributor of commercial EVs from China's Dongfeng Sokon Automobile and dealer of the Chinese-made BYD T3 electric vans in Singapore.</p><p> Aside from EV financing, the bank this month also launched financing plans for energy-efficiency projects for buildings and homes in Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.</p><p> The platform - called U-Energy - will start off with nine energy service companies to help customers cut at least 20 per cent in energy consumption on average, UOB said.</p><p> The U-Energy partners can support common energy efficiency projects such as improving chiller and air-conditioning efficiency, installing solar panels on rooftops, switching to LED lights, optimising energy and power management systems, and changing the building facade to reflect direct sunlight for reduced heat absorption. The move comes at a time when electricity costs are expected to rise on higher gas prices.</p><p> Said Mr Tjuradi: \"U-Energy is designed to connect various energy efficiency ecosystem players, from building owners, energy service companies to mechanical and electrical contractors.\"</p><p> Building owners can opt for a direct purchase of the energy-efficient equipment or systems with UOB's green financing. They can also opt for the energy-as-a-service model where the bank will provide green loans to U-Energy partners at no upfront cost to building owners.</p><p> Competition among the banks is intensifying as interest in green and sustainability-linked financing increases. UOB's local rivals, DBS Bank and OCBC Bank, are also launching financing plans tailored for EVs and other green projects.</p><p> In March, OCBC rolled out its Eco-Care car loan package at a preferential pricing of 1.68 per cent per annum for the purchase of EVs, after DBS earlier said it would offer loans at similar rates to all customers purchasing new and used electric and hybrid vehicles.</p><p> Both DBS and OCBC have also rolled out green renovation loans.</p><p> On Oct 3, Enterprise Singapore launched the Enterprise Financing Scheme-Green, under which the Government will provide a 70 per cent risk-share for loans made by participating financial institutions, including the three local banks.</p><p> The funding is for local firms that fall under several categories: project developers, system integrators, and technology and solution enablers from the sectors of clean energy, circular economy, green infrastructure and clean transportation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-853887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63WB-9KS1-JCF2-84HH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"917\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 19, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Business &amp;

These developments are of growing concern to many countries in the region.</p><p>In particular, Asean has articulated on many occasions the necessity of shaping a regional security architecture based on a rules-based international order, rather than the formation of blocs and military alliances.</p><p>By definition, this makes Asean a natural partner of the EU.</p><p>Top investor</p><p>The EU is the top investor and leading provider of development cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. Our annual trade reached 1.5 trillion euros in 2019 - S$2.35 trillion, based on today's exchange rate - before Covid-19 hit in early 2020.</p><p>The French overseas territories make our regions further intertwined. The EU has a vested interest in the stability and sustainable development of a region which has become the world's strategic and economic centre of gravity.</p><p>The EU has its own vision, interests and instruments to promote them. The bloc's inclusive approach forms the basis of our action. We aim to foster solutions to common challenges and play our part in enhancing peace and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific, in dialogue with nations in the region.</p><p>At the same time, we will continue to protect our essential interests and promote our values.</p><p>In this spirit, we wish to cooperate further with Asean and its member countries. As trade and development partners, we not only recognise and support Asean centrality, we also keep on building relations benefiting both sides.</p><p>We are convinced that we share the same commitment to a multi-dimensional approach, combining trade, development cooperation, global challenges and security, in order to strengthen the rules-based order. Together, we can send a powerful signal and develop a common agenda in favour of effective multilateralism.</p><p>Priority areas</p><p>France, Germany and the Netherlands already contribute actively to the implementation of the EU Strategy in the priority areas it sets out - sustainable and inclusive prosperity, green transition, ocean governance, digital governance and partnerships, connectivity, security and defence, and human security.</p><p>In 2021, Singapore will have seen at dock or off its coasts two frigates, one helicopter carrier and a nuclear-powered submarine deployed by our nations - in addition to the 12 ships based in French overseas territories.</p><p>Under the EU Strategy, EU member states will enhance coordinated naval deployment to combat piracy, protect freedom of navigation and enforce United Nations sanctions.</p><p>Our multifaceted engagement in the region aims to tackle global challenges.</p><p>The EU was at the forefront of vaccine multilateralism through the Covax facility, and our countries have delivered millions of effective vaccines to countries of the Indo-Pacific in this framework.</p><p>Mitigation and adaptation to climate change are also important drivers of our action. The rise of the oceans, the increase in natural disasters and the loss of biodiversity affect our populations and economies.</p><p>By supporting initiatives such as the Asean Catalytic Green Finance Facility to generate investments in green infrastructure, we address these issues concretely.</p><p>The strategy of the EU for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific pertains to a larger effort to build Europe's strategic autonomy: the EU's capacity to formulate its own strategy, set its own priorities and act accordingly, while forging partnerships when and wherever possible.</p><p>In the past few years, important steps have been taken in this direction, such as the drafting of a Digital Services Act in 2020 to better protect consumers against illicit content and to promote transparency of online platforms, or the creation of the European Defence Fund in 2021 to further develop our defence industrial base.</p><p>While the EU endeavours to build its strategic autonomy, it will not be done at the expense of others. Rather, it makes it a more credible partner for countries and regions which are themselves seeking to preserve their freedom of action in an increasingly polarising world.</p><p>Strategic partners</p><p>The elevation of the relationship between Asean and the EU during the German EU Council Presidency in December 2020 to a Strategic Partnership was a milestone, as this step recognises both the depth of the relationship and heightens its ambition.</p><p>It paved the way for increased cooperation between the two regions attached to a rules-based multilateral order.</p><p>As France will take over the EU Council Presidency in the first semester of 2022, it will actively contribute to creating a momentum in favour of the swift implementation of the EU Strategy for the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>Marc Abensour is France's ambassador to Singapore; Norbert Riedel is Germany's ambassador to Singapore, and Margriet Vonno is the Netherlands' ambassador to Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-371182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63VC-YX71-JCF2-82J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"919\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 15, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DIYD</classCode><className>ASEAN COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002017</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY &amp;

The Framework details the Singapore Government's (i) intended use of green bond proceeds, (ii) governance structure to evaluate and select eligible projects, (iii) operational approach to manage green bond proceeds, and (iv) commitment to post-issuance allocation and impact reporting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Key Features of the Framework</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. In line with the Singapore Government's commitment to ensure that the green bonds issued by public sector agencies [1] adhere to market best practices, the Framework has been designed with the following principles:</p><p>a) Alignment with internationally recognised market principles and standards: The Framework is developed and structured in alignment with the core components and key recommendations [2] of the International Capital Market Association (ICMA) Green Bond Principles 2021[3] and the ASEAN Capital Markets Forum ASEAN Green Bond Standards 2018 [4].</p><p>b) Stringent governance and oversight of project selection and allocation of proceeds: The Second Minister for Finance chairs the Green Bond Steering Committee [5], which assumes overall responsibility for proper governance and implementation of the Framework. The Singapore Government commits to annual post-issuance allocation reporting and impact reporting on environmental benefits and, where possible, social co-benefits of the Eligible Green Expenditures. This provides transparency and accountability for investors and other interested parties.</p><p>c) Technical screening to evaluate and identify green projects: The eligibility criteria for the Green Categories have been developed with reference to internationally recognised market principles and standards such as the ICMA Green Bond Principles and the Climate Bond Initiative (CBI) Taxonomy and Sector Criteria.</p><p>3. Proceeds from green bonds issued under the Framework will be used to finance expenditures in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030. This facilitates the transition to a low-carbon economy in Singapore, and advances the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The following are the categories of Eligible Green Expenditures:</p><p>a) Renewable Energy</p><p>b) Energy Efficiency</p><p>c) Green Building</p><p>d) Clean Transportation</p><p>e) Sustainable Water and Wastewater Management</p><p>f) Pollution Prevention, Control and Circular Economy</p><p>g) Climate Change Adaptation</p><p>h) Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management of Natural Resources and Land Use</p><p>4. MorningstarSustainalytics, an independent ESG research firm, has completed an external review (Second-Party Opinion) on the green credentials of the Framework, and is of the view that the Framework is credible, impactful and aligns with internationally recognised market principles and standards.</p><p>5. Second Minister for Finance Indranee Rajah said at the Singapore Sustainable Investing and Financing Conference 2022, \"We are committed as one Government to taking bold and decisive actions to tackle climate change, finance sustainable infrastructure, and catalyse the green economy. The publication of our Singapore Green Bond Framework is yet another important step forward in this regard\".</p><p>6. DBS Bank served as adviser to the Singapore Government on the development of the Framework. DBS Bank's Global Head of Fixed Income, Clifford Lee, said, \"As a leading financial hub with an AAA rating, Singapore is well-placed to lead the development of the Green Bond Framework, which will serve as a good reference point to help further develop, grow and deepen ESG financing in Asia. We are heartened to support the Singapore Government in the structuring and development of the framework which will provide a robust foundation for Singapore to further cement its position as a global green finance hub, and drive more high-quality public and private green bond issuances to fuel the nation's climate ambitions.\"</p><p>7.

To support Singapore's transition to a low-carbon economy and spur Singapore's development as a green finance hub, the Singapore Government has announced at Budget 2022 that the public sector will issue up to S$35 billion of green bonds by 2030 [6]. This will include bonds issued by the Singapore Government as well as its Statutory Boards, to finance public sector green infrastructure projects.</p><p>9. The Singapore Government will be issuing its inaugural sovereign green bond under the SINGA in the coming months. Known as Green SGS (Infrastructure) bonds, these bonds will be used to finance nationally significant infrastructure[7] which meet the green criteria under the Framework. Such infrastructure projects are expected to provide long-term environmental benefits to both the current and future generations.</p><p>10. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) will undertake the issuance and management of SGS on behalf of the Government. The MAS will provide more details about the upcoming issuance of the Green SGS (Infrastructure) bond closer to its issuance date.</p><p>About Ministry of Finance</p><p>The Ministry of Finance aims to advance the well-being and development of Singapore through Finance. The Ministry strives to achieve a balanced budget through prudent and sustainable fiscal policies, foster a regulatory environment conducive to business and enterprise, ensure prudent investment of the Government's reserves and other public funds, and sets policies for government procurement, customs regulation, accounting standards and business regulation.</p><p>We achieve this together with our departments (Accountant-General's Department, Singapore Customs and Vital), and statutory boards/bodies (Accounting &amp; Corporate Regulatory Authority, Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, Tote Board and Singapore Accountancy Commission).</p><p>For more information, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mof.gov.sg\">www.mof.gov.sg</url> .</p><p>About Monetary Authority of Singapore</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is Singapore's central bank and integrated financial regulator.

This ensures that the Statutory Boards' respective green bond frameworks will also be aligned with best practices in the international markets.</p><p>[2] The ICMA Green Bond Principles are a set of voluntary guidelines that recommend transparency and disclosure, and promote integrity in the development of the green bond market. The ASEAN Green Bond Standards are aligned with the ICMA Green Bond Principles, and aim to provide more specific guidance on how the ICMA Green Bond Principles are to be applied across ASEAN in order for green bonds to be labelled as ASEAN Green Bonds. The four core components of the ICMA Green Bond Principles and the ASEAN Green Bond Standards are (i) Use of Proceeds, (ii) Process for Project Evaluation and Selection, (iii) Management of Proceeds, and (iv) Reporting.

We need to ensure that the financing will be there, both public and private, to meet the moment on climate change,\" said President Joe Biden, who convened the two-day virtual Leaders Summit on Climate attended by 40 heads of state and dozens of corporate executives and other leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"All of our nations must stand together... to help the world's most vulnerable nations and those bearing the least responsibility for the climate crisis cope with the devastating impacts of the climate crisis,\" he added during a session on financing climate solutions on Thursday.</p><p> Mr Biden announced that the US will double, by 2024, its annual public climate finance to developing countries based on its levels during the later years of the Obama administration.</p><p> The US will also treble public financing for climate adaptation - measures to help countries adapt to the impact of climate change - in developing countries by 2024.</p><p> In addition, the US launched a plan laying out its vision for financing the world's response to climate change, in recognition of the urgency of the climate crisis and the sharp drop in American international climate finance during the Trump administration.</p><p> The plan will also seek to end international investment in fossil fuel projects and steer capital towards \"climate-aligned investments\".</p><p> US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry highlighted the need for governments to team up with private investors and international financial institutions in the world's quest to switch fully to non-carbon energy sources.</p><p> \"Governments alone cannot possibly find all the necessary investment,\" he said. \"There's no government in the world that has enough in their fiscal budgets to be able to provide what we need to make this transition.\"</p><p> Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said her department will throw its weight into figuring out the best ways that public climate finance can be channelled into mobilising the greatest private-sector investments.</p><p> \"Past efforts to support private investment have not achieved anywhere near the scale needed to green the global economy,\" she said.</p><p>  &lt;q&gt;Good ideas and good intentions aren't good enough.

Good Afternoon. I am pleased to open the inaugural Singapore-International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) (pronounced as \"EYE-REE-NAH\") High-Level Forum, held in conjunction with the 14th Singapore International Energy Week. I would also like to offer my appreciation to all Ministers, representatives of international organisations and industry leaders who have accepted our invitation to be part of this inaugural Forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. The theme for this Forum is \"Investing in an Inclusive and Just Clean Energy Transition\". This comes at a timely moment for the region and the world. The rise in gas, coal and electricity prices in recent months have brought to the fore various challenges in navigating the energy transition. Today's Forum presents a good opportunity for policymakers and industry leaders to come together to discuss how we can channel investments towards a timely energy transition.</p><p>3. There is an urgent need to mobilise investments to boost the energy transition. The IRENA's 2021 World Energy Transitions Outlook (WETO) highlights that the world will need more than a two-fold increase in energy sector investments to support the global energy transition - from USD 1.8 trillion in 2019 to USD 4.4 trillion per year by 2050. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), investments in clean energy must triple by 2030 if we hope to effectively combat climate change. In addition, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that Southeast Asia alone would require US$3.1 trillion of green infrastructure investments by 2030.</p><p>4. Singapore is doing our part to invest in the energy transition.</p><p>a. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS)'s Green Finance Action Plan supports efforts to scale up finance to meet Asia's low-carbon transition needs. Initiatives include schemes to support the mainstreaming of green and sustainable financing, the establishment of green finance centres of excellence, and \"Project Greenprint\" to harness technology and data to support the green finance ecosystem.</p><p>b. We are also working towards the development of carbon market initiatives in Singapore. One such initiative is Climate Impact X - a joint initiative by Temasek, DBS, SGX, and Standard Chartered Bank.</p><p>c. The Singapore Government has set aside S$55 million (equivalent to about US$40 million) for the Low-Carbon Energy Research (LCER) Funding Initiative (FI). This initiative supports Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&amp;D) projects in low-carbon energy technologies such as hydrogen, and carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) through 2025 to reduce Singapore's carbon emissions.</p><p>5. While countries seek to accelerate the energy transition, we need to ensure that this transition is inclusive and just. This means we do not lose sight of creating good jobs for our people and equipping them to seize these opportunities, especially in the clean energy sector.</p><p>6. For Singapore, we currently rely on natural gas, the cleanest form of fossil fuel, for 95% of our power generation. Given our limited access to renewable energy, natural gas will continue to be an important energy source in the energy transition for Singapore, until alternative low-carbon generation technologies are commercially feasible.</p><p>7. Today, many of our workers in the energy sector have backgrounds in electrical and power engineering, and possess technical skillsets which are transferable from traditional power generation to renewable energy or low-carbon technology projects. This positions our workers well to take on new challenges in these sectors, as part of an inclusive energy transition where no worker is left behind. We will also continue to equip our workforce with the necessary skills to access good job opportunities through various manpower development initiatives. In particular, the industry-led centralised training institute for energy professionals, the Singapore Institute of Power and Gas, or SIPG, offers relevant courses to help workers upskill and reskill to meet the evolving demands of the sector.</p><p>8. Finally, it is crucial that we continue to harness technology as a key enabler in accelerating the clean energy transition. Technology advancements open up new possibilities, especially in terms of renewable energy potential.</p><p>9. In Singapore, recent developments in geothermal technology, such as advanced geothermal systems (AGS) which harness heat from deep dry rock, may allow Singapore to harness geothermal energy at greater depths, with minimal impact to environment and safety. With support from the National Research Foundation of Singapore, the Energy Market Authority of Singapore is working closely with the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and various agencies to study and determine the geothermal resource potential in Singapore. NTU and the agencies aim to establish preliminary findings by end-2022. If deemed viable, Singapore could potentially adopt geothermal energy and further lower our power sector's carbon emissions.</p><p>10. Advancements in technologies, coupled with the declining costs, have enabled policymakers and industry leaders to significantly advance the role of renewables in the global energy systems. According to the IRENA, in the past year alone, 260 gigawatts (GW) of renewables-based generation capacity had been added globally - four times more than the capacity added from other fossil fuel-based sources. Singapore is keen to accelerate the development and deployment of emerging low-carbon alternatives, such as hydrogen and CCUS to support the energy transition. I look forward to gathering more insights on these issues from participants at today's Forum.</p><p>11. Director-General La Camera, Deputy Director-General Singh, Honourable Ministers and Excellencies, today's Forum is a step in the right direction towards \"An Inclusive and Just Clean Energy Transition\". In particular, we are appreciative of IRENA's strong support in ASEAN's energy transition and many capacity building initiatives under the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation or APAEC. Over the last few years, ASEAN and IRENA have deepened energy cooperation significantly since the signing of the ASEAN-IRENA Memorandum of Understanding in 2018 in Singapore.</p><p>12. Building on the success of this inaugural Singapore-IRENA High-Level Forum, I am pleased to note that both Singapore and IRENA will work towards (i) hosting the second edition of the Singapore-IRENA High-Level Forum at SIEW next year, and (ii) convening a special edition of the IRENA Investment Forum in Singapore, likely in 2023. Through these platforms, we aim to foster more robust high-level discussions towards strengthening access to renewable energy finance and low-carbon solutions across Asia.</p><p>13. I am confident that today's Forum will provide excellent thought leadership on the clean energy transition, and also contribute to the upcoming COP26 Conference in Glasgow. With that, may I now invite Director-General La Camera to give his opening remarks.</p><p>14. Director-General La Camera, please.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Trade and Industry, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0057241161</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63Y4-SB21-DXMP-K1MN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1215\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 26, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>CC00028B7</classCode><className>ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0005JEZ</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK ZIMBABWE LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00064QT</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK (THAI) PCL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC000DFWM</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED BANK NEPAL LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00080WB</classCode><className>STANDARD CHARTERED AUSTRALIA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>SIC6081 BRANCHES &amp;

Hence, there is an urgent need to mobilise private capital to sustainable projects, says Indranee Rajah, minister at the prime minister's office; and second minister for finance and national development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To that end, Indranee unveiled the Singapore Green Bond Framework at Ecosperity Week 2022. Temasek's annual sustainability event was held from June 7-9 at the Sands Expo &amp; Convention Centre. The second edition of the Singapore Sustainable Investing and Financing Conference (SSIFC) 2022 - jointly organised by BlackRock, International Finance Corp (IFC) and Temasek - was held on the last day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First announced in February, the framework sets the stage for Singapore's first sovereign green bond to be issued in the coming months. To qualify, projects must first be classified \"nationally significant\" under the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act, or Singa. Green bond issuances must then meet the criteria stated in the new framework.</p><p>Speaking at the keynote address of the SSIFC 2022 on June 9, Indranee says green projects will facilitate Singapore's transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>\"Through these high-quality issuances, we hope to deepen market liquidity for green bonds, attract green issuers, capital and investors, and catalyse sustainable financing in the region,\" adds Indranee.</p><p>Proceeds from green bonds issued under the framework will be used to finance projects in support of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, say the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).</p><p>These include projects in renewable energy, energy efficiency, green buildings, clean transportation, sustainable water and wastewater management, pollution prevention, climate change adaptation, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable management of natural resources and land use.</p><p>The Singapore government, along with statutory boards, will issue $35 billion in green bonds by 2030 to fund public sector green infrastructure projects, announced then-finance minister Lawrence Wong in Budget 2022.</p><p>At least US$980 bil more needed</p><p>Eight out of 10 Southeast Asian countries now have a net-zero target. Two new countries - Singapore and Indonesia - are piloting carbon taxes.</p><p>According to the 2022 edition of Bain &amp; Company and Temasek's Southeast Asia's Green Economy 2022: Investing behind new realities report, US$15 billion ($20.5 billion) in cumulative investments have been deployed since 2020, mostly in renewables and the built environment.</p><p>Private equity and venture capital investments into sustainability have also tripled between 2020 and 2021, reads the annual report, authored with contributions from Microsoft.</p><p>However, current investments are still far from realising the projected US$1 trillion in economic opportunities within Southeast Asia's green sector by 2030.</p><p>\"Southeast Asia needs to move from promises to action and bridging the gap between opportunities and results will be a key milestone. We remain bullish on the US$1 trillion economic opportunities in Southeast Asia, but we need to step up as a region to strengthen the investable market and increase green capital flows,\" says Dale Hardcastle, partner at Bain &amp; Company.</p><p>Corporate investors have been the main engine, says the report, driving 70% - or US$11 billion - of total investment. Of this figure, at least US$6.6 billion went towards solar and wind energy.</p><p>Yet, a large emissions gap of 2.6-3.2 gigatons (Gt) still exists compared to 2030 targets, based on latest Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and planned policies projections.</p><p>Despite bolder new ambitions, most Southeast Asia countries need more concrete roadmaps as well as incentives and climate financing plans, reads the report. Current investment levels are below US$20 billion, which falls short of the estimated US$1 trillion-US$3 trillion required to close the emissions gap.</p><p>\"Evolving macro challenges lie ahead for national governments,\" notes the report, \"as they grapple with competing priorities including energy security amid the Ukraine conflict, Covid-19 recovery and inflationary pressures.\"</p><p>'Uncomfortably short' decades</p><p>Climate change is not just an environmental issue, but a capitalist concern, says Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock.</p><p>In his pre-recorded opening address at SSIFC 2022, Fink says it is BlackRock's fiduciary responsibility to understand how global developments will impact clients' investment outcomes. \"This includes the pandemic, deglobalisation, the war in Ukraine, climate change, and, of course, inflation.\"</p><p>Nations are fast approaching various goals and targets set for the future. \"We need to take a long-term view, thinking not in terms of quarters or even years, but in terms of decades. And as we approach 2030, or even 2050, decades can start to feel uncomfortably short,\" says Fink.</p><p>\"So, I come to this conversation not as an environmentalist, but as a true capitalist,\" he adds. \"I remain today an optimist; I believe in the power of capitalism and how it can act as a powerful catalyst for change.\"</p><p>Part of the \"dynamism, opportunity and promise of Asia\" comes from outperformance, and Fink believes decarbonisation can be a key engine of economic growth. \"The pace of change will be very different in the developing and the developed countries. But all markets will require unprecedented investment in decarbonisation technology.\"</p><p>To that end, Temasek announced on June 6 the launch of GenZero, a wholly-owned company dedicated to decarbonisation investments. Temasek also committed an initial amount of $5 billion into the subsidiary.</p><p>GenZero will invest globally across three focus areas: technology-based solutions, nature-based solutions and carbon ecosystem enablers.</p><p>The new company will be led by Frederick Teo, who is currently the managing director of sustainable solutions at Temasek International. Teo will take up the role as CEO of GenZero on July 1.</p><p>According to Teo, GenZero currently employs some 20 staff. \"We are looking to build to perhaps about 30 or 40 within a year or two,\" says Teo.</p><p>\"GenZero is driven by the common purpose to decarbonise for future generations. Recognising the importance of immediate action, we will focus on investment opportunities that can deliver positive climate impact by 2030,\" he says.</p><p>Speaking at a media conference on June 6, Teo set out his team's aim to balance \"climate impact with long-term sustainable financial returns\". \"In terms of financial returns, we definitely want to exceed our cost of capital, and then try and strike a good double bottom line.\"</p><p>A '45-minute city'</p><p>Indeed, companies can no longer solely focus on short-term returns, as shareholders, executives and even employees will demand more sustainable practices. Companies that refuse to adapt will lose out in the long term, says Teo Chee Hean, senior minister and Singapore's coordinating minister for national security.</p><p>\"First-movers will capture upsides while laggards may be written off as doing too little too late  Questions will be asked about your company's strategies to avoid stranded assets. Some legacy lines of production may be rendered obsolete,\" Teo said in his opening address at Temasek's Ecosperity Week 2022 on June 7.</p><p>At home, Singapore aims to phase out all internal combustion engines (ICE) by 2040. But this is just a part of achieving sustainable urban transportation, said Teo. \"It's not just about replacing all internal combustion engine [ICE] vehicles with electric vehicles. If we do that, we will convert our traffic jams with ICE vehicles today to traffic jams with electric vehicles.\"</p><p>Instead, the more fundamental solution is to minimise the need for cars, said Teo, with a \"comprehensive public transport system\". \"Since 2018, [we have] implemented a zero-growth policy for [our] vehicle population. We aim to be a 45-minute city in 2040, where nine out of 10 trips between homes and workplaces will take less than 45 minutes on our public transport network, even during peak hours.\"</p><p>The \"45-minute city\" was mooted in 2019 as part of the Land Transport Master Plan 2040 by the Land Transport Authority. \"Today, we are already two-thirds there,\" said Teo.</p><p>Surbana Jurong announced last week that its upcoming global headquarters will house Southeast Asia's largest electric vehicle (EV) charging hub. In an agreement with SP Group, the Surbana Jurong Campus will eventually allow up to 250 drivers to park and charge their vehicles.</p><p>At launch, Surbana Jurong and SP will install a mix of nine \"fast and slow charging points\", which will grow to 36 charging points within 18 months. Upon completion of the initial 36 charging points, the two parties agree to install more chargers \"in tandem with market demand\" for EVs.</p><p>The campus is designed to meet Singapore's Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Platinum (Super Low Energy) building certification, including onsite photovoltaics generating over 300MWh of solar energy annually.</p><p>Sustainable transport also extends to the sky. The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), Singapore Airlines (SIA) and Temasek announced last week the sale of Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) credits in July 2022.</p><p>The sale of the SAF credits is part of a CAAS-SIA-Temasek pilot announced last November. A total of 1,000 SAF credits will be available for sale. These are generated from the 1,000 tonnes of neat SAF which are blended, delivered and uplifted from Changi Airport and are expected to cut carbon dioxide emission by 2,500 tonnes.</p><p>According to the three parties, each credit purchased will help to reduce 2.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>From 4Q2022, all SIA customers will be able to purchase a mix of SAF credits and carbon offsets. SIA will also partner Climate Impact X (CIX) - the carbon exchange established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange (SGX), Standard Chartered and Temasek - to introduce a \"bundled portfolio\" consisting of SAF credits and carbon credits.</p><p>Mikkel Larsen, CEO of CIX, says: \"The current lack of incentives for the adoption of green fuels has meant that prices continue to remain high and economically unviable. SAF credits can help to spur adoption by enabling competitive price discovery, and channelling finance towards projects that can drive the use of sustainable fuels at the scale necessary to support decarbonisation in the aviation sector.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65TB-5Y51-DYX1-T0MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1737\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Edge Publishing PTE.

It pared some gains on Thursday and is up 8 per cent since the start of the year.</p><p>The post Covid-19 recovery of China has been extremely bullish for the metal. China accounts for more than 50 per cent of global copper concentrate treatment and refining.</p><p>One sign of tightening copper concentrate supply, said S&amp;P Global Platts senior editor of non-ferrous metals Han Lu, is that the treatment charges (TC) paid by miners to smelters for converting copper concentrate to copper cathode, the raw material to make wires and cables, have fallen by half from pre-pandemic. (TC is the amount to be deducted from the total price of a cargo of copper concentrates, and is designed to cover refining costs. A lower TC generally implies tighter supply of copper concentrates).</p><p>The upbeat narrative for copper is also being led by the prospects of green infrastructure stimulus, although Ryan McKay, a commodity strategist at TD Securities, said green spending is unlikely to materially impact the red metal in the near-term.</p><p>The regulatory support for electric vehicles (EVs) have also boosted demand. More EVs mean the need for more charging stations, and those require lots of copper cables.</p><p>Notably, iron ore and steel have rebounded as well, even though these two metals are hardly related to green technologies. This suggests that the sentiment component should not be underestimated in explaining the recent rally, said Julius Baer next generation research head Carsten Menke.</p><p>The supply squeeze in copper is nothing to sniff at. Mr Gore said overall mine production disruptions in 2020 is estimated at 7 per cent, the highest since 2008.</p><p>More recently, high swells in Chile - the world's largest copper producer - caused some northern ports to be closed for 21 days in January, resulting in shipment delays to buyers. A resurgence of Covid-19 cases disrupted logistics in the world's second largest copper producer Peru. This is on top of Australian concentrate exports to China having dwindled to historically low levels.</p><p>Also, there have been very few significant copper deposit discoveries in the past decade.</p><p>ING head of commodities strategy Warren Patterson said the price environment for copper in the last two years or so was likely a bit low to attract the necessary investment to meet future copper demand. However, he expects current price levels to woo investment on the supply side \"assuming prices manage to hold onto these gains\".</p><p>Just this week, Citi Research upgraded its zero to three month copper point price to US$9,000 per tonne and six to 12 month point price to US$10,000 per tonne on the premise of a \"deep deficit\" this year and low inventories \"for years to come\".</p><p>It added that the strong decarbonisation-led demand for copper thus makes the prospects for a \"super cycle\" in the industrial metal \"real\".</p><p>Mr Menke, however, disagrees with the notion of another commodity \"super cycle\". He reckoned that the copper rally, like that of other industrial metals and oil, is driven by the turning economic cycle amid a recovery from the coronavirus crisis. In this regard, he said China's economy has already reached pre-crisis levels.</p><p>\"As China is set to continue its transition from investment-driven to consumption-driven growth, we believe that demand dynamics in the metals markets should soften, both in the short term and the longer term,\" he said, adding that this could offset the positive impact on copper from the emergence of clean technologies.</p><p>\"We thus do not see a big longer-term demand boost for industrial metals. Bearing this in mind, we don't think the current rally will be sustainable in the long run.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mine production disruptions in 2020 are about the highest since 2008.

Knowing that I'm making a change makes me happy,\" said the Secondary 4 student from Tampines Secondary School.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Her school is one of the four pilot schools in the Ministry of Education's Eco Stewardship Programme, which aims to nurture a culture of sustainable habits across all aspects of daily life in the next generation.</p><p> This is done in part through school-based initiatives and lesson packages to teach students about environmental sustainability.</p><p> For instance, the humanities, science, and character and citizenship education (CCE) curricula now include sustainability concepts.</p><p> The other three schools are Mee Toh School, Elias Park Primary School and Commonwealth Secondary School.</p><p> These schools have developed resources which either feature sustainability initiatives or are integrated with green infrastructure, such as solar panels and energy-efficient LED lights to reduce net carbon emissions.</p><p> Tampines Secondary, for instance, has installed energy-saving fans and used heat-reflective paint on east-and west-facing facade walls, so less energy is needed to cool the building.</p><p> MOE plans to work towards reducing net carbon emissions from the schools sector by two-thirds by 2030, and aims for at least 20 per cent of schools to be carbon-neutral by then.</p><p>     &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;Start small: How parents can support kids' green efforts&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Miss Eleanor Quek, Mee Toh School's environment education adviser, suggested starting with simple, small steps.</p><p> \u00b7 Reuse water used to wash vegetables and rice to water your plants.</p><p> \u00b7 Take along your own containers to buy food.</p><p> \u00b7 Recycle right - clean plastic bottles before recycling and sort out recyclables.</p><p> \"As long as you take the first step, the other, bigger steps are easier,\" she said.</p><p> Mrs Preeti Bhart Sheri, Tampines Secondary's head of character and citizenship education, reminded parents that little habits, collectively, contribute to a greener Singapore.</p><p> \u00b7 For instance, do not buy a new mobile phone for the child when the old one is still usable, and do not encourage the child to take a taxi when public transport will do.</p><p> \u00b7 Take kids for nature walks or plant something. The more kids are exposed to gardens or the growing of vegetables, the more they will want to protect nature.</p><p> \u00b7 Where possible, use fans instead of air-conditioning and keep the temperature no colder than 25 deg C.</p><p> \"Sometimes, people don't start because they think they must do something big. We want to say it's about that movement. A vegetarian meal once a week or once a month is a movement. It's more sustainable in the long run,\" she said.</p><p>    &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SUSTAINABILITY CONCEPTS AND LIFELONG HABITS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;In Tampines Secondary, environmental sustainability concepts are woven into the school curriculum.</p><p> For instance, in Secondary 1 science lessons, students learn about what Singapore is doing in the area of renewable energy and how solar energy is harnessed.</p><p> In food and consumer education, teachers talk about food waste in Singapore, and get students to think about how much food is thrown away and the carbon footprint it involves.</p><p> Chemistry students learn about the harmful gases that are released into the environment as a result of human activities.</p><p> As part of CCE, Secondary 3 students delve into the topic of e-waste by discussing how the incineration of e-waste is toxic to humans. This is followed by an e-waste drive in which the items collected can be upcycled or disposed of correctly.</p><p> Mrs Preeti Bhart Sheri, head of CCE at Tampines Secondary, said she hopes that the concepts reinforced over four years will help achieve a shift in mindset for these teenagers, who can then influence their family or neighbours.</p><p> Apart from the structured curriculum, students sort out the trash in their classrooms every day. Two green ambassadors in each class are in charge of ensuring the items that can be recycled are disposed of in the correct container and later brought to a common recycling bin.</p><p> Mrs Sheri, who teaches geography and social studies, said she hopes these daily practices will help youth form lifelong habits.</p><p> \"I'm very heartened when I see them taking pride in separating their trash. All these habits will amount to something because it is not one-off - it is a routine.\"</p><p> She makes it a point to remind her students that individual efforts contribute to a cleaner, greener world.</p><p> \"It is easy for us to think we are a small country or one individual, but we want them to learn that their individual eco-friendly habits do make a difference. Culture-building takes time,\" said Mrs Sheri.</p><p> The school also has an environment-related co-curricular activity, Maker Faire, in which students upcycle discarded materials into usable products such as a foosball table or standing lamps.</p><p> \"When they experiment with things, it gives them knowledge and skills to put into practice for an environmentally sustainable society. This may make them more passionate about future green jobs,\" said Mrs Sheri.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;MAKING ENVIRONMENT EDUCATION COME ALIVE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Environment education starts the moment a child enters Primary 1 in Mee Toh School.</p><p> Pupils at every level are involved in the weekly recycling programme, in which they take their recyclables from home every Wednesday.</p><p> Two environment ambassadors from each class then sort the recyclables into different categories such as plastic, paper or aluminium drink cans at the recycling station in the school foyer.</p><p> As part of the school's applied learning programme in environmental education, Primary 2 pupils learn about biodiversity and to appreciate nature and the environment by making posters and doing presentations.</p><p> Through a farm-to-table programme in Primary 3, they learn about food security and learn firsthand about the hard work that goes into growing food.</p><p> They plant vegetables hydroponically and grow mushrooms, with half the harvest sold in the canteen and the other half donated to an old folks' home.</p><p> Not only does this programme integrate subjects such as science, mathematics and social studies, but pupils who experience the process of growing their own food also become better advocates for less food wastage, said Miss Eleanor Quek, 35, the school's environment education adviser.</p><p> \"We saw students appreciating food better because they eat what they grow in the canteen,\" said Miss Quek, who is also subject head for total curriculum.</p><p> The school aims to walk the talk. So, as teachers teach Primary 4 pupils about water conservation, pupils see it come to life, as the school has its own rainwater collection tank where rainwater is collected and used to wash the school grounds.</p><p> Primary 6 pupil Dawn Tan, 12, said she has become more aware of environmental issues.</p><p> Dawn is head of her school's \"environment champions\" - a group of about 50 student leaders from Primary 4 to Primary 6 who lead projects for environmental causes.</p><p> \"We do projects like creating posters or decals, we encourage our peers to be more environmentally conscious or we make announcements to share facts about the environment,\" she said.</p><p> At home, Dawn's family has a recycling corner where items are sorted by material.</p><p> She said her mother had exposed her to simple recycling projects and that she has now learnt more from school to share with her mother.</p><p> \"Once, I saw her about to throw away a plastic bottle and reminded her to reuse it two to three times before recycling, and not just throw it away,\" she said.</p><p> She is happy that her school is doing its part for the environment.</p><p> \"I think it's a good thing we are training more people to be more environmentally friendly, and they will train more people. I hope that global warming will slow down through all these efforts,\" she said.</p><p>    It is easy for us to think we are a small country or one individual, but we want them to learn that their individual eco-friendly habits do make a difference.

As we work hard to overcome the pandemic, we cannot afford to lose sight of the much greater threat to our economic, developmental and societal gains as we know them: climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Covid-19 has undermined the foundation for many companies and industries. It has turned our daily lives upside down. But despite the upheavals, the virus outbreak has brought about two positive consequences.</p><p>The first is a taste of the air that we could breathe in a low-carbon future. Clearer skies, disappearing smog and thriving ecosystems have given us a glimpse of how the environment may come to life when consumptions are balanced and emissions reduced. In a sense, we are rolling out the largest pollution experiment right now - and it is working.</p><p>Covid-19 has been kind to the environment. As we seek to recover and rebuild, this is an opportunity to use public investments to address the potentially much more devastating effects of climate change. Now is a chance to build back better and greener.</p><p>The second gain lies in the power of unity. The pandemic has taught us that national solutions will not solve global challenges. It has reminded us of the importance of international collaboration in combating global risks. In many ways, it gives us a clearer vision of what it will take to save the planet. Multilateralism is essential. Covid-19 has shown us that people are ready to fundamentally change their behaviour if they see that the threat is imminent and serious enough.</p><p>ISLANDS OF OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>While the pandemic's economic aftermath will undoubtedly squeeze public budgets as well as lead to higher national debts and competing priorities, it has provided us with even greater opportunities to act.</p><p>Just before the circuit breaker, Denmark's Minister for the Environment Lea Wermelin visited Singapore to conclude a five-year commitment on green, environmental collaboration with her counterpart, the then-Minister for Environment and Water Resources, Masagos Zulkifli. It was an important and timely visit that cemented Singapore and Denmark's joint way forward on the circular economy, green infrastructure, climate adaptation and sustainable development. None of our commitment will change despite the setback of Covid-19.</p><p>Singapore, as a hub with the capabilities, the experience and the talents to push for green recovery, is a key actor in Asia's efforts to build back better and greener - as is Denmark in Europe. But being small economies accounting for only 0.1 per cent of the world's emissions, neither of us can push the needle alone. Instead, we can ensure that green recovery is a race to the top and a guiding principle out of the crisis by taking leadership and utilising our innovation abilities to seek green opportunities.</p><p>A couple of months back, Denmark reinforced its green ambitions in a new climate package. This included committing S$60 billion to build two energy islands in our biggest single infrastructure investment.</p><p>The offshore wind project has the potential to expand to 12 gigawatts (GW) over time, which is more than double Europe's current offshore wind capacity alone. Also known as power-to-X, the technology could lead to a breakthrough in decarbonisation by allowing us to store and convert renewable energy into green electro-fuels for heavy-duty vehicles, shipping and aviation.</p><p>It might be a moonshot, but so was wind energy when we identified it as a key renewable source more than 40 years ago.</p><p>These energy islands present an opportunity to test out designs and technologies that have long been studied, but never built in real life - and so does the Singaporean-Danish green cooperation.</p><p>We seek to take on green innovations through strong public-private partnerships with academia, startups, inventors and environmental enthusiasts, not because it is the easiest injection to immediately boost our economies, but because it is the only right remedy for lasting progress and sustainable growth.</p><p>LEADERSHIP COMES FIRST</p><p>As with most other challenges throughout history, leadership comes before technical hurdles.</p><p>In this run-up to Singapore International Energy Week, I am greatly optimistic that this partnership, which blends Singapore and Denmark's strong government support to spur innovation for greater good, will inspire others to lead cohesive change.</p><p>As energy professionals, government representatives, policymakers and business leaders from all over the world gather in Singapore for this event, one thing stands clear: no country survives in a dying world. Green growth is the only sustainable way out of the current crisis.</p><p>The writer is ambassador of Denmark to SingaporeREAD MORE: Green energy drive: Singapore plans trial import of Malaysian electricity\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}\\x{200b}</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-320273</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6154-8471-JCF2-835K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"811\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 27, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>Business &amp;

The country's zero-Covid policy has been a social and economic experiment without precedent: a vast public health campaign that mostly kept the disease at bay; Xi Jinping's pride and joy; and, by the end, a waking nightmare for many of China's 1.4 billion people.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Armies in white hazmat suits have been deployed to collect tens of billions of throat and nasal swabs. Millions were quarantined or hauled off to fever camps, often arbitrarily. Fear of isolation sent people fleeing from offices and factories where cases were found. Amateur videos captured residents leaping to their deaths from apartment blocks after weeks of seclusion. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In major cities, daily life stood still for months on end. A cosmopolitan class of young, wealthy Chinese was forced to come to grips with a life without international travel. Foreign entrepreneurs and executives were barred from returning to their homes and businesses in the country.</p><p> Before vaccines were available, officials could argue this approach was needed to save lives. By the end, the experiment offered a bleak existence at an extraordinary cost. </p><p> China's gross domestic product (GDP) probably grew by less than 3 per cent in 2022, well below the official target of around 5.5 per cent -- a shortfall of about half a trillion US dollars. Tough restrictions on movement snarled the world's most advanced supply chains. In November, profits generated by industrial firms fell by 9 per cent year on year. </p><p> Meanwhile, exchanges between China and the outside world fell to their lowest in decades. Few foreign students remain in the country. Overseas tourism has collapsed. Xi himself has only recently resumed foreign travel after remaining in China for two-and-a-half years.</p><p> Persistence is historyZero-Covid lasted longer than anyone initially expected, then collapsed faster than anyone could have imagined. In a matter of weeks, China has gone from having some of the world's strictest restrictions to almost none. </p><p> For the population at large, fear of lockdowns and quarantine has vanished. After a period of turbulence, economic activity is likely to rebound sharply. Increased demand for energy and commodities will be felt around the world. Investors and multinational executives can hope to visit colleagues and factories, after a painfully long pause. The great reconnecting of China with the outside world marks the end of an era: that of the global pandemic.</p><p> Normality will not arrive immediately. By one estimate, 37 million people a day are now catching Covid in China. Hospitals are overwhelmed. So are crematoriums. </p><p> Officials acknowledge few deaths -- and face an immense challenge keeping production lines running. Tesla, an American carmaker, halted operations at its factory in Shanghai on Christmas Eve. Local officials may seal off towns to keep cases down, worries one executive. The economy could contract in the first three months of opening up, says Tommy Wu of Commerzbank. </p><p> But the recovery will also arrive earlier than analysts had expected. Many think that the period of extreme volatility will draw to a close by the end of March. At that point, a recovery will begin that should gain strength as the year progresses.</p><p> Li Pengfei, until recently a product manager at an industrial software firm in Beijing, is among those desperate for things to get back to normal. Li lost his job last February when restrictions made basic duties, such as travelling to meet clients, near impossible. He spent part of last year living with his sister, but was forced to return home to Jilin province in China's far north-east, where economic prospects were dismal even before the pandemic. \"Things seem so volatile that even the big companies are downsizing,\" he says.</p><p> Elsewhere in the world bosses worry about a \"great resignation\", with workers quitting jobs or dropping out of the labour force altogether. It is less of a concern in China. Unlike in America, the government did not hand out stimulus cheques willy-nilly during the pandemic. People who lost their jobs, such as Li, will return to work quickly when the opportunity arises, economists believe, helping to steady factory output.</p><p> Consumption will rise, too. Incomes have fallen, but zero-Covid also squashed spending, as people avoided travelling and eating out. All told, households saved one-third of their income last year. This year many will be getting back on their feet after job losses, stagnating pay and declines in the value of their homes, meaning the splurge will be limited. </p><p> But Jacqueline Rong of BNP Paribas, a bank, reckons household consumption will grow by about 9 per cent in 2023 -- a big improvement on the previous year's growth rate, if not full retribution for the enforced abstemiousness of recent years.</p><p> Reopening will also benefit China's troubled property sector, though quite how much depends on political decisions. In November, as Covid restrictions were relaxed, policymakers eased property developers' access to financing. That should help stronger firms avoid default and finish building flats they have already sold to homebuyers. At China's Central Economic Work Conference in December, policymakers promised to support \"fundamental demand\", as opposed to speculative purchases. To that end, they may make further cuts to mortgage rates and down-payment requirements.</p><p> There is a wide range of forecasts for the performance of the property sector, broadly defined to include construction, services and furnishings. Activity could grow by 3 per cent this year, says Jing Liu of HSBC, another bank -- enough to add 0.9 percentage point to China's GDP growth rate. </p><p> A more optimistic scenario has it expanding by 5 per cent, she thinks, adding 1.5 points to growth. Some households might decide that now is a good time to \"buy the dip\", before prices revive, or regulatory restrictions on home purchases return.</p><p> Beyond the borderThe economic implications of reopening extend farther afield. Zero-Covid kept a lid on China's demand for global goods, services and commodities. During the lockdown of Shanghai in the first half of last year, for instance, the country's oil demand fell by two million barrels per day. </p><p> In the past, such drops in Chinese spending would have deprived the world economy of a crucial engine of growth. The Covid downturn has been different. It coincided with an overheated economy in America and an interrupted supply of energy across Europe. \"At least this time China isn't contributing to inflation,\" says Louis Kuijs of S&amp;P Global, a rating agency.</p><p> China's recovery will lift global growth for the simple reason that China is a big part of the world economy. HSBC reckons that one year from now, in the first quarter of 2024, China's GDP could be as much as 10 per cent higher than it will be in the first three troubled months of 2023. According to our rough calculation, a recovering China could account for two-thirds of global growth in that period.</p><p> Over a longer period, however, China's recovery might have unfortunate side effects. In other big economies, the binding constraint on economic expansion is monetary policy, as central banks raise interest rates to suppress inflation. If China's reopening looks like raising global demand and therefore price pressure to an uncomfortable degree, central banks will tighten policy to offset the threat. In such a scenario, the impact of China's reopening on the rest of the world might show up not in higher growth, but in higher inflation or interest rates.</p><p> China's most direct channel of influence is via commodities. It consumes almost one-fifth of the world's oil, over half of refined copper, nickel and zinc, and more than three-fifths of iron ore. On Nov 4, the mere rumour of a reopening caused a 7 per cent increase in the price of copper by the end of the day. </p><p> As the rumours are realised, China's demand for metals, crops and energy will help exporters of commodities, hurt importers and give the world's central banks another headache in their fight against inflation.</p><p> China's demand for metals remained strong during zero-Covid, as the government encouraged spending on electric vehicles, renewable energy and green infrastructure, all of which require lots of aluminium, copper and other metals. But buyers lacked the confidence to stock up: inventories of copper fell to their skimpiest in 15 years. </p><p> Reopening will encourage restocking. In November, Goldman Sachs, a bank, reckoned the price of copper would increase to US$9,000 per tonne within 12 months. Now it thinks the price will reach US$11,000.</p><p> Demand for energy proved much less resilient, particularly towards the end of zero-Covid. China's imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG) fell by about one-fifth in the first 11 months of 2022, compared with the same period of the previous year. This allowed Europe to increase purchases to make up for the loss of gas from Russia. Thus, China's zero-Covid policy acted as a counterweight to Russia's invasion of Ukraine -- one blunder helping to save Europe from the other.</p><p> Analysts assume a modest rise in Chinese LNG imports this year, based on the contracts buyers have already signed and their reluctance to buy LNG when prices are high. If imports recover faster, Europe could feel the pinch. In a recent stress test, the International Energy Agency (IEA), an official forecaster, assumed Chinese demand would increase by about one-quarter in the year ahead, returning to 2021 levels; Russia would cut off piped gas to Europe entirely; and winter would start punctually. </p><p> In such a scenario, Europe would face a shortfall of 27 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to 7 per cent of annual demand, even after its current efforts to increase supply are taken into account. The IEA warns that if nothing else is done, Europe may be forced to introduce rationing.</p><p> The impact on oil could also be significant. If China's economy makes a full recovery in 2023, it will gradually increase crude imports throughout the year until it has added an average of one million barrels a day, reckons Soni Kumari of ANZ, a bank. This will compensate for reduced demand in Europe and America, both of which are courting recession. </p><p> Indeed, Goldman Sachs forecasts that China's increased appetite could push up oil prices by about US$15 per barrel. The price of Brent could exceed US$100 again in the third quarter of this year, it reckons, making the global battle against inflation still more difficult.</p><p> Higher commodity prices will be a boon to exporters such as Chile and Brazil, but hurt China's energy-importing neighbours. For India, the loss from higher prices may cancel out gains from increased exports to the mainland. Other countries, more tightly enmeshed in China's manufacturing supply chain, seem better placed to benefit. </p><p> But raw statistics can be deceptive. Although Taiwan's merchandise exports to the mainland were equivalent to more than 15 per cent of GDP in 2021, many were components for products that are ultimately sold to customers outside China, and may thus be unaffected by the change of policy.</p><p> The biggest boost to neighbours will come not from selling goods to China, but from selling tourist destinations to Chinese citizens. Ni Na, a mother-of-two from Shanghai, travelled overseas about five times a year before the pandemic, often spending three or four months a year outside the country. She attempted to travel once within China in 2022, only to give up in the face of restrictions. When inbound quarantine requirements are lifted, Ni will get back on the road. She has renewed her passport and her two sons' travel documents in anticipation.</p><p>Thailand, a popular destination, could enjoy a three-percentage-point boost to growth once China has fully reopened, reckons Goldman Sachs. That would remove the uncertainty that weighs on local asset prices, including the currency, says Arup Raha of Oxford Economics, a research firm. That, in turn, would reduce pressure on Thailand's central bank to raise rates -- welcome freedom in a country where output is still below potential. </p><p> But the biggest winner from reopening will be Hong Kong. Increased exports, which include tourism, could boost its GDP by almost 8 per cent after full reopening. The city used to attract more than four million mainland visitors a month. Without them, it has felt roomier but poorer.</p><p> Xi sells a U-turnThe Communist Party is deft at rewriting history to suit its needs. Yet Xi will struggle to shake the damage done to his reputation in 2022. The clumsy enforcement of zero-Covid, followed by its hasty abandonment, will go down as an error for the ages. </p><p> Many investment houses adjusted their risk assessments for China and will allocate less to the country over the next three years unless they are compensated for it. About US$18 billion of foreign exchange flowed out of China in November, up from US$11 billion in October. These outflows are expected to reverse when China's economy stabilises in 2023, but a swift return to the type of inflows witnessed prior to the pandemic is unlikely.</p><p> Deep damage has been done to parts of China's supply chain. A Covid outbreak, followed by protests, at a plant that makes Apple's iPhone 14 in central China has delayed orders for the product. For foreign firms, the crisis was the first time that central policy interfered with local officials' commitment to keep factories running. Many companies are now willing to pay higher costs to manufacture elsewhere. </p><p> Take the process of launching new products, which requires an almost continuous flow of researchers and scientists between headquarters, usually in the West, and plants in China. </p><p> The Covid years made this dance impossible. Engineers stopped visiting, and fewer new products were launched in the country. Multinational firms have been forced, often reluctantly, to launch elsewhere.</p><p> After three years of zero-Covid, executives have become comfortable with this move away from China. Inbound investment in new \"greenfield\" factories has slowed sharply, according to some measures. At the same time, the number of firms deciding to relocate operations outside of China has jumped, says Alex Bryant of East West Associates, a supply-chain consultant. Most of the relocations Bryant's firm has assisted with over the past year have been outbound. He thinks the reopening of China is unlikely to lead to an immediate turnaround in the direction of traffic.</p><p> Policymakers are waking up to the danger. Delegations of officials and businesspeople from Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Sichuan, Zhejiang and elsewhere are planning overseas trips to \"grab orders\" and win back investors, according to a state media report. \"A meeting is worth a thousand e-mails,\" it said. </p><p> In early December, China's leaders announced a focus on attracting foreign money, emphasising that local governments should prioritise finding investors. </p><p> Such language has not been used at a Politburo meeting in many years, notes Robin Xing of Morgan Stanley, a bank. \"They clearly want to keep their place in the global supply chain,\" he says. </p><p> Nevertheless, making up for the chaos of 2022 will require an awful lot of meetings. </p><p> (C)2023 The Economist Newspaper Limited.

But not anymore.</p><p>Last year, Beijing came down hard on over-leveraged property developers. With its \"3 red lines\" policy, property developers are no longer able to exceed 15 per cent leverage, compared to a high leverage of 20 per cent to 30 per cent before.</p><p>Greg Hyland, CBRE's head of capital markets, Asia-Pacific, said: \"Unsurprisingly, there's weaker interest in real estate debt as an alternative investment sector this year, despite it traditionally being a popular choice among investors across the region in the past.</p><p>\"With US$55 billion in Chinese corporate real estate debt set to mature this year, we are seeing strong intentions to sell among China-based investors as the real estate market continues to deleverage. There will likely be a substantial volume of disposals of non-core assets this year.\"</p><p>He reckoned that with the policy stance remaining firm that \"housing is for living in, not for speculation\", and the \"3 red lines\" policy to curb excess speculation and overleveraging, China's era of residential real estate-led growth might well be over as the sector experiences weaker growth and enters a consolidation phase.</p><p>Martin Wong, Knight Frank's director and head of research and consultancy, Greater China, said that there has been a significant slowdown in new overall property sales after the crackdown on the sector. \"Buyers have been more prudent and developers have been more cautious in acquiring land and launching new projects.\"</p><p>But although there is an overall decline in transaction activity, Knight Frank's Wong noted that residential sales volume has seen positive growth, with an increase of 9.3 per cent year on year.</p><p>Meanwhile, office property sales went down by 3 per cent and retail property sales fell by 2.2 per cent year on year.</p><p>Underlying demand for housing - whether for sale or for rent - remains strong. In Knight Frank's recent Global Buyer Survey, 57 per cent of respondents indicated a desire to move to the city.</p><p>\"Despite the government's objective in controlling home prices, there is solid demand coming from end-users along with a higher rate of urbanisation,\" Wong said.</p><p>Matthew Yao, head of China at PGIM Real Estate, said that while China has tightened its policy for developers, it has recently loosened the funding for home buyers. This may offer more opportunities for investors.</p><p>\"There will likely be less competition from local developers on various investments. At the same time, local developers may also start to offload assets from their balance sheet or seek capital partners for interesting investment opportunities,\" he added.</p><p>PGIM Real Estate owns and operates a co-living apartment in Shanghai. Other investors in this segment include Warburg Pincus and KKR.</p><p>According to Yao, PGIM Real Estate has not prioritised the residential for-sale sector in recent years because of the numerous regulatory changes and tightening measures. Instead, it has focused more on commercial real estate and in particular, the logistics sector.</p><p>As China enters the next stage of urbanisation where cities get even more crowded, experts see a strong demand for industrial Internet such as 5G infrastructure and public cloud, as well as green infrastructure, to support the new lifestyles of smart megacities.</p><p>Macdonald said that the government's commitment towards an innovation-driven economy in the medium to long term has resulted in the commercial real estate market maturing rapidly in areas such as logistics properties, data centres, life sciences facilities, research and development hubs, and business parks - all historically undersupplied sectors which have good fundamentals and are backed by the government.</p><p>However, making strategic shifts is not without challenges.</p><p>He explained: \"It is hard for large developers to shift strategy swiftly to, say, the commercial sector, as this will tend to require significant amounts of capital to be tied up for longer unless there is a capital partner or a purchaser lined up, as well as building asset management teams, etc.</p><p>\"Some firms have been gradually deploying more capital into this area over the last decade, but it is typically a long-term transition.\"</p><p>It would be better for large developers to focus on \"core competencies, bring on equity partners or dispose of fringe assets, monetise where possible, conserve capital and reduce costs where possible\".</p><p>Despite regulatory upheavals, Singapore developer Ho Bee Land remains confident of the long-term prospects of the China market. The group, which has footprints in Australia, the UK and Germany as well, said it would \"continue to seek growth opportunities within our geographical focus, which is in line with our diversification strategy\".</p><p>Before CapitaLand Investment was formed in Sep 2021, CapitaLand said that it plans to grow its exposure to new economy assets in China to S$5 billion over the next few years, up from S$1.5 billion as at end 2020.</p><p>The group, which entered China in 1994, has made several acquisitions in the new economy sectors, including its first hyperscale data centre campus in Shanghai, and sees strong potential to expand its data centre portfolio to other cities such as Beijing and Shenzhen.</p><p>CapitaLand China Trust made its maiden foray into China's logistics sector last year, buying a portfolio of 4 prime logistics properties across Shanghai, Chengdu, Kunshan and Wuhan.</p><p>And although Keppel Corp unit Keppel Land divested its residential project China Chic in December, it said that this was in line with Keppel's Vision 2030 asset monetisation plans to unlock capital which can be channelled towards new growth opportunities.</p><p>\"We look forward to further collaboration with like-minded partners to continue investing strategically in China, which is a key market for Keppel Land,\" said a Keppel Land spokesperson.</p><p>In August 2021, for example, Keppel Land China entered into a joint venture with leading Chinese developer Topchain Group to jointly manage investment properties, mainly offices and business parks, with potential for asset enhancement initiatives in China.</p><p>\"This joint venture will allow Keppel Land China to better seize opportunities in the sizeable urban renewal market which is growing in China due to rapid urban development and land constraints in major cities, and offer platforms for the application of Keppel Land's smart building solutions in China.</p><p>\"As we work towards Keppel's Vision 2030, Keppel Land China will continue to push the envelope of digitalisation and sustainability to bring innovative, smarter solutions to our portfolio and realise Keppel Land's vision to be a leader in redefining urban spaces for a sustainable future,\" added the spokesperson.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"With US$55 billion in Chinese corporate real estate debt set to mature this year, we are seeing strong intentions to sell among China-based investors as the real estate market continues to deleverage,\" says CBRE's Greg Hyland.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-382935</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64H7-KW11-JCF2-82D9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 11, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0003G2B</classCode><className>KNIGHT FRANK LLP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS531190 LESSORS OF OTHER REAL ESTATE PROPERTY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>SIC6519 LESSORS OF REAL PROPERTY, NEC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00096KO</classCode><className>HOUSING MARKET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp;

In it were nature corridors - park connectors for wildlife - not seen in previous plans. Insight examines the implications of these corridors on the country's future development.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>Ng Keng Gene</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">About three decades after Singapore's first park connector opened along the Kallang River in 1992, the country now has an islandwide plan to connect green spaces, not for the sake of humans, but for wildlife.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The plan was based on a study that sought to understand the ecological links between the island's green spaces, and identified routes that wildlife could take to get from one green patch to another.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Known formally as the ecological profiling exercise, the study led by the National Parks Board (NParks) was conducted in tandem with the Urban Redevelopment Authority's (URA) review of Singapore's long-term land use plan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> While the plan's strategies and concepts that have been showcased since Monday in an exhibition at the URA Centre are meant to guide development over the next 50 years and beyond, the NParks study - which began in February last year and was completed earlier this year - has already affected development plans, such as those for Dover Forest and the Springleaf area.</p><p> In February, the Housing Board said it plans to retain a 6.4ha nature park in a future housing estate in Yishun's Miltonia Close, based on findings from the NParks study.</p><p> This decision followed \"careful consideration of competing land uses\", said the board, which added that the park is about 2.5 times the original park space allotted in URA's masterplan. As a result of the bigger park, the authorities had to find an alternative site for a school that was to be in the area.</p><p> NParks on Monday said that the upcoming Miltonia Nature Park will be part of a new Khatib Nature Corridor - an outcome of the NParks study and one of seven corridors that form a blueprint to create a network of green spaces here.</p><p> Each corridor links key habitats for wildlife using forested patches, parks, park connectors as well as tree-and shrub-lined routes known as nature ways. Most are connected to Singapore's green lung and largest nature reserve, the 2,000ha Central Catchment Nature Reserve. Parks between core habitats act as buffers to protect them, and as stepping stones between them for animals.</p><p> Nature Society (Singapore) president Shawn Lum said access to more habitats increases the effective population sizes of wildlife, and also gives them more food sources and more mates to choose from, which increases their chances of survival.</p><p> A larger effective population size lowers the risk of genetic disorders through inbreeding.</p><p> Besides this, nature corridors also allow redistribution and prevent overpopulation in Singapore's nature reserves, and increase the survival of animal-dispersed plant species, he added.</p><p> People can also benefit from nature parks and nature ways that are established in ecological corridors, said Dr Lum, as they \"offer the best educational and recreational spaces\".</p><p> The National University of Singapore's (NUS) Centre for Sustainable Asian Cities director Heng Chye Kiang said the green network may help to minimise human-animal conflicts within urbanised areas, if animals utilise corridors to move from one forest patch to another instead of wandering into built-up places.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CHANGING APPROACH TO GREENERY&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Observers and those from the nature community said the NParks study and the establishment of nature corridors mark a shift in approach towards the conservation of Singapore's green spaces - an urgent task as much of the country's land has been developed.</p><p> Conservationist Ho Hua Chew said that in the past, the authorities were largely focused on the sustainability of wildlife habitats within their designated boundaries, but the long-term future of ecosystems in a particular area is now considered alongside its wider ecological landscape. The shift is in line with developments in the field of ecology, he said, adding that connectivity is critical for Singapore's increasingly fragmented and isolated natural habitats.</p><p> Urban policy researcher Woo Jun Jie said that besides scientific advancements, there has been a shift in policy thinking about nature conservation, reflected in Singapore's changing strategies for greenery over the years - from \"Garden City\" to \"City in a Garden\", and the present \"City in Nature\".</p><p> Dr Lum, a Nanyang Technological University (NTU) botanist, said establishing nature corridors following the NParks study is Singapore's \"best and last chance to build green infrastructure that will give habitats and wildlife a chance at long-term viability\".</p><p> The corridors closely follow conservation principles of protecting what one can, and connecting what is left, he said.</p><p> He said that in addition to building on land set aside for development, the Government is beginning to value \"spontaneous forests\" that have grown on them, and how they are part of a wider green network, before development decisions are made.</p><p> That conservation attention has shifted to these smaller pockets of nature is a result of the intensification of land use in Singapore over the years, said geographer Harvey Neo, as large green tracts similar to the Central Catchment area can no longer be found.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GREEN NETWORK'S IMPLICATIONS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Experts said that while the islandwide connectivity map NParks' study has produced does not confer legal protections on any green spaces, planning around nature corridors and developing in a manner sensitive to nature will have effects on developments to come.</p><p> Citing Dover Forest, where the authorities put off plans to develop its western half for about a decade as the study showed it could form part of a nature corridor, Professor Heng said brownfield sites - land that has already been developed - may need to be redeveloped more intensively so that ecologically sensitive areas can be protected.</p><p> Mammal scientist Marcus Chua of NUS' Lee Kong Chian Natural History Museum said that the network helps planners to prioritise which green spaces to conserve, and also removes guesswork when nature corridors are designed.</p><p> Dr Woo, who is a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said that when green plots along identified corridors need to be developed, conducting environmental impact assessments and extensive consultation over the development and rezoning of green spaces will most likely cause some delays in development and construction, which can be costly.</p><p> \"Even efforts to rezone or integrate green spaces into urban developments will incur additional development and construction costs,\" he said.</p><p> On the other hand, urban development and building construction may not sufficiently price in the costs of environmental degradation that may occur when green spaces - which are carbon sinks and help to mitigate urban heat - are developed, said Dr Woo.</p><p> \"The costs incurred in conserving these spaces should therefore be thought of as an investment in Singapore's future and a contribution to our fight against climate change,\" he said.</p><p> Dr Neo, a senior fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities, said he hopes the wildlife corridors will make developers more attentive to environmental impact studies before development. This could persuade them not to develop, or to proceed with modifications to their plans, he said.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;ROOM TO IMPROVE CORRIDORS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;While nature corridors may facilitate the movement of some species, conservation experts said that not all will be able to use them, and the needs of such species will have to be considered as well.</p><p> NTU adjunct research fellow Ngo Kang Min said the best way to assess if corridors will work is for those designing them to put themselves in the place of an animal and understand its life history and behavioural traits.</p><p> Pangolins, for instance, spend most of their time in the forest and rarely venture out, she said. So even if a thin nature way has been spruced up by multi-tiered vegetation near a busy road, it is unlikely that a pangolin, which tends to be affected by road vibrations and sounds of traffic, would use it.</p><p> Dr Lum said that while the NParks study has given the authorities a good sense of which animals may use corridors, it is worthwhile studying which species will not utilise them, so that other provisions can be made for their conservation if necessary.</p><p> He said that for the corridors identified, the quality and placement of nature ways should also be scrutinised. How nature ways are designed, what plant species are planted in them and how areas with breaks are connected will affect their effectiveness as corridors, said Dr Lum.</p><p> While acknowledging that the public and stakeholders are now consulted much earlier than in the past for potential developments, Dr Ngo noted that the approach to conservation is still top-down, and said she hopes details of the study will be made available so researchers can provide their feedback and help by contributing data to refine it.</p><p> Mr Chua said modelling done in the land study can be strengthened using empirical data from genetic tests on wildlife to study existing gene flow, or by fieldwork to determine if animals are using the corridors as intended.</p><p> Dr Ho said that where established corridors are long, it will be good to safeguard forested areas along them that will act as a resting point and feeding ground for animals before they arrive at their destination. Besides serving local wildlife populations, these stepping stones will be a wintering haven for migratory birds, he said.</p><p> For its part, NParks has said that ecological profiling is a continuous and iterative process, and its plans will be refined when needed.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Three decades since Singaporeans started using park connectors, the park connector network is today more than 300km long, and there are plans to bring this figure to 500km by 2030.</p><p> Like this network, building a network of wildlife corridors, establishing nature parks, and restoring Singapore's habitats where feasible will be a long-term endeavour, said Dr Lum.</p><p> \"Nature gets richer over time, and the work we are doing now may not be enjoyed by our children or even their children, but by the generations to come,\" he said.</p><p>    FOR A BETTER FUTURE  Nature gets richer over time, and the work we are doing now may not be enjoyed by our children or even their children, but by the generations to come.</p><p>    NATURE SOCIETY (SINGAPORE) PRESIDENT SHAWN LUM </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1056924</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65NC-1121-DYX4-01CJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1717\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Countries in general and Asean in particular have sought to recalibrate their postures and policies as a function of the BRI's ongoing evolution. Such calculations are further complicated by competing initiatives, such as the US Build Act, which also seeks to support infrastructure opportunities in the region as part of the US Indo-Pacific strategy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The BRI is at once an aspirational idea and a development platform, offering both abstract hope for a better world and a host of concrete commercial opportunities. The BRI is a repository for many of the world's emerging development goals, ranging from the digital economy to sustainable infrastructure, and more broadly, frictionless trade and the narrowing of wealth gaps. It offers the promise of a new development paradigm, but one that must be seized with nuance and sophistication. For Asean, this means sifting through the opportunities to advance regional goals while preserving Asean centrality.</p><p>The path towards implementing the BRI and realising its promise has not been linear. Early BRI projects engendered criticism regarding unsustainable financing practices and the insufficient involvement of the local labour force. Such criticism resulted in the Second Belt and Road Forum of 2017 reaffirming the need to adopt global best practices and giving rise to the mantra \"open, clean and green\" to capture the need for transparency and sustainability in BRI projects.</p><p>The pandemic has constituted another bump in the road, resulting in work stoppages, a raft of legal claims and an environment rife with uncertainty and unpredictability. Still, the obstacles wrought by Covid-19 have a positive side, offering parties an enforced time-out to rethink the types of projects and commercial terms to be proposed as a function of their suitability for local conditions.</p><p>EXPLORING OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>Moreover, even as large-scale infrastructure projects encounter difficulties, commercial parties have scope to explore other opportunities linked to the digital economy and the health field, both of which find expression in the BRI's proposals for the companion Digital and Health Silk Roads. The Covid-induced pause gives parties the opportunity to rethink the scale of their projects and to incorporate notions such as \"glocalisation\" that capture the need to \"tame\" globalisation in a way that yields benefits for local communities. The BRI will be international in scope and spirit, but local in planning and implementation or it will not be.</p><p>The world, Asean, and the BRI are at an inflection point at once pregnant with promise and peril. The pandemic must be managed; the promise and commercial opportunity of the BRI must be seized. The former requires sensible health policies and collective discipline, both of which are manifesting themselves in the region. The latter requires an astute assessment of the region's strengths and weaknesses measured against a world economy in a state of structural flux and transition.</p><p>In a September 2020 report by McKinsey &amp; Company entitled Reimagining Emerging ASEAN in the Wake of Covid-19, the following areas were identified as levers of growth: manufacturing; green infrastructure; digitisation; reskilling and redeployment; and high-value food production. Specific Asean jurisdictions have comparative advantages in one or more of these fields. All of these strategic capabilities and sectors are thus in play, with their importance having been further amplified by the fallout from Covid-19 and the opportunities for restructuring presented by the BRI. Moreover, Asean and its professionals are ideally placed to lead the way armed with both international and local knowledge and benefitting from a highly strategic location.</p><p>The Asean Economic Community, the Master Plan on Connectivity 2025, and the recently released Digital Master Plan, anticipated this macro-restructuring and the related changes in the nature of work and production. The Singapore Manufacturing Federation has further identified 3D printing as a priority area that will doubtless respond to issues of \"glocalisation\" and local participation in the fruits of development by rendering manufacturing more flexible.</p><p>All of the above dovetail with the BRI's focus on enhanced connectivity and the establishment of stable supply chains. There is thus an unprecedented opportunity to join the global development platform of the BRI with regional and local goals even amidst the chaos wrought by the pandemic.</p><p>ASPIRATION AND REALISATION</p><p>The bridge between aspiration and realisation will be the professionals designing and implementing the projects to be carried out under, or in conjunction with, the BRI umbrella. Sensitivity to the global environment and to local conditions, due regard to social and sustainable development, and an eye on regional priorities will allow Asean's professionals to make a difference. Professionals in Singapore are particularly well-placed to participate in the region's economic uplift with support from specialised agencies, such as Infrastructure Asia, established through the joint efforts of the Monetary Authority of Singapore and Enterprise Singapore.</p><p>Every crisis has two sides - the disruption and the eventual return to equilibrium. The BRI, if properly joined to regional priorities, can offer a path forward to be shaped collectively by both public and private parties in the crucible of structural economic change and with due regard to mutual economic interest and benefit.</p><p>The writer is a member of the Bars of New York State and Washington, DC and a former Associate Professor (Practice) at the Singapore Management University's School of Law.

The new goal brings forward our net zero timeline by up to 50 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Singapore takes these commitments very seriously,\" says Wong. \"We are on track to achieving our 2030 target. We have since reviewed our longer-term plans. With advances in technology and new opportunities for international collaboration in areas like carbon markets, we believe we can bring forward our net zero timeline.\"</p><p>Wong also unveiled a headline figure for Singapore's green finance sector. By 2030, Singapore's government and statutory boards will issue up to $35 billion in green bonds to fund public sector green infrastructure projects.</p><p>The government will publish a Singapore Green Bond framework and issue its inaugural green bond later this year.</p><p>The first such bond by a statutory board here was announced last August. Then, the National Environment Agency issued a $3 billion multi-currency medium-term note and green bond framework, with proceeds going to sustainable infrastructure development projects like the Tuas Nexus, Singapore's first integrated water and solid waste treatment facility.</p><p>The move to issue green bonds is welcome, but investors are becoming more critical of such schemes amid claims of greenwashing, says Yu-En Ong, head of Singapore at Norton Rose Fulbright. \"Investors are demanding more transparency and diligence to ensure that this financial product meets the sustainability criteria,\" says Ong.</p><p>Carbon tax 'too aggressive'?</p><p>In addition, Singapore will raise its carbon tax rate in stages from now till 2030, growing up to 16 times the current rate of $5 per tonne of emissions.</p><p>The rate will first rise to $25/tonne in 2024 and 2025, before hiking further to $45/tonne in 2026 and 2027. By 2030, Singapore's carbon tax rate will reach between $50 and $80 per tonne.</p><p>Singapore's carbon tax applies to all facilities producing 25,000 tonnes or more of greenhouse gas emissions in a year. This covers some 30 to 40 large emitters, like oil refineries and power generation plants, which contribute 80% of Singapore's greenhouse gas emissions. By putting a price on emissions, companies are incentivised to reduce their carbon footprint.</p><p>The move is \"very bold\", says Selena Ling, head of treasury research and strategy at OCBC Bank. \"It may even be seen as too aggressive from members of industry and companies.\"</p><p>From a societal point of view, however, it is the right thing to do, adds Ling. \"What's important is that the additional carbon tax revenue will be channelled into solutions. So, the focus is to invest in costly low-carbon infrastructure, green the aviation and tourism industries and capture economic opportunities in areas such as green finance.\"</p><p>Even at its 2030 peak, however, Singapore's carbon tax rate will still pale in comparison to that of other countries.</p><p>Ireland, for example, charges about EUR41 ($62) per tonne, while Sweden has the highest carbon tax rate of about SEK1,200 ($173) per tonne. Singaporean investment company Temasek has an internal carbon price of US$42 ($56) per tonne.</p><p>Carbon pricing varies wildly around the world. Yet, the global average emissions price is only US$3 per tonne, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>Last June, the IMF proposed an international carbon price floor, divided into three tiers. To address such inconsistencies, each tonne of emissions should, by 2030, cost a minimum of US$75, US$50 or US$25, depending on whether the emission is in an advanced, high- or low-income market, says the IMF.</p><p>Singapore must be prepared to review its carbon prices regularly, says Cherine Fok, director of sustainability services at KPMG in Singapore. \"We have to be conscious that the new pricing of [carbon] is estimated based on the current projections around the urgency and scale of climate transition. It is also pegged to carbon regimes across the world.\"</p><p>She adds: \"Whether the revised pricing and the timing of the revisions remain fit  for an open economy like Singapore remains to be seen. As a nation, we must be prepared to review our plan of action regularly to ensure its effectiveness.\"</p><p>Cushioning the blow</p><p>With a higher carbon tax, household utility bills will rise in tandem, says Wong. At a rate of $25/tonne, for example, a household living in a four-room HDB flat will see an increase of about $4 per month in utility bills.</p><p>Wong says in his Budget speech: \"I should clarify that I do not expect to derive additional revenue from this increase in the carbon tax.\"</p><p>\"Some of the revenue will be used to cushion the impact on households and businesses,\" adds Wong. \"A large part of the revenue will be used to support a decisive shift towards decarbonisation through investments in new low-carbon and more energy-efficient solutions.\"</p><p>To that end, the government will give households additional U-Save rebates to cushion this price hike, and more details will be announced in next year's Budget.</p><p>From 2024, the government will allow businesses to use \"high-quality, international carbon credits\" to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions. \"This will create local demand for high-quality carbon credits,\" says Wong. A carbon credit is a permit that allows a company to emit one tonne of greenhouse gas.</p><p>The carbon tax rate hike is not about increasing revenues for the government, says Saravanan Rathakrishnan, associate at law firm RHTLaw Asia. Rather, it will contribute to the greening of Singapore and its economy, \"which puts it in good stead for green finance and ESG-related investments - a new frontier for growth\".</p><p>While there may be temporary increases in costs of doing business in Singapore, these will be largely transitory as firms learn to adapt, Rathakrishnan tells The Edge Singapore.</p><p>Higher carbon taxes will also force landlords to upgrade old buildings to become more energy-efficient, says Tay Hong Beng, partner and head of real estate at KPMG in Singapore.</p><p>\"The progressive increase in carbon tax will eventually lead to an increase in utility prices, and landlords may seek to pass on the increase to their tenants. However, increasing utility costs will make older, less energy-efficient buildings unattractive to tenants,\" says Tay.</p><p>Tay adds: \"To maintain occupancy levels, landlords of older buildings will eventually need to invest in making their buildings more energy-efficient. As retrofitting projects take time to implement, landlords may discover that it makes economic sense to undertake improvements sooner, rather than wait for the further increases in carbon tax, which we know will happen.\"</p><p>The increase of Singapore's carbon tax will \"decisively\" move the needle on Singapore's decarbonisation roadmap, says Tan Wooi Leong, senior director, energy and industrial, Surbana Jurong.</p><p>\"At this revised carbon tax rate, mid- to heavy-duty transport sectors may accelerate their electrification or even adopt hydrogen as fuel. Industries in petroleum and chemicals, iron and steel, cement and other major greenhouse gas emitters will see more value in adopting renewable energy, electrifying their processes and/or introducing new energy alternatives in their operations,\" adds Tan.</p><p>This will affect nearly all sectors in Singapore. Says Tan: \"Major logistics firms have begun to study the feasibility of decarbonising entire trucking fleets. Real estate developers are exploring low carbon construction materials and energy-efficient solutions for their developments.\"</p><p>More EV charging points</p><p>Singapore aims to be a \"car-lite\" city, and will maintain its zero growth rate for private vehicles alongside plans to phase out internal combustion engines by 2040.</p><p>While public transport is still the cleanest mode of transport, Singaporeans have embraced electric vehicles (EVs), says Wong. The share of EVs among new car registrations here has jumped from 0.2% in 2020 to 4% last year.</p><p>Singapore will further accelerate EV adoption by building more charging points, with such infrastructure financed by green bonds.Satya Ramamurthy, partner at KPMG in Singapore, says: \"Accessibility of EV charging infrastructure nationwide will be critical to the continued growth momentum in Singaporeans' adoption of EVs.\"</p><p>The green initiatives announced at Budget 2022 are \"a bold but welcome statement\", says Sharad Somani, partner and head of infrastructure advisory at KPMG in Singapore. \"Budget 2022 proposes a robust, three-pronged approach to increase carbon tax, innovate low-carbon technologies and turbo-charge the green finance ecosystem in Singapore. This will help local companies not only make bold investments towards cleaner fuel and reduced emission targets, but also help organisations develop new skills and capabilities in the area of green economy.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64WX-88W1-JCF0-3530-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1527\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Edge Publishing PTE.

In Southeast Asia, we are battling new waves of the virus. We must be prepared to live with an endemic COVID-19 for years to come.</p><p>Before the crisis, no one could have predicted the length and devastating trajectory of the pandemic. Nor how COVID-19 has accelerated structural shifts, and created new ones. The global switch to digital is dramatic, with many activities moving online like today. COVID-19 has also reminded us of the urgency of addressing global challenges like climate change. But of even greater concern is that the pandemic has accentuated geopolitical tensions, especially between US and China.</p><p>We are living in a world of growing uncertainty, with changes occurring ever more swiftly. So the theme of today's conference - that we are in a state of \"never normal\", is most appropriate. We cannot predict the future, but we can, and must, seek to create a better future. How do we do so? The top priority now is to tackle COVID-19 together, through continued vigilance and sustaining the momentum on vaccination. Beyond COVID-19, we must tackle the structural challenges that are reshaping the global economy, seek new sources of growth, and forge new collaborations.</p><p>Three Decades of ASEAN-China Relations</p><p>This year, we mark three decades of ASEAN-China Dialogue Relations. a. Thirty years ago, economic cooperation was minimal. But as China's 'reform and opening up' policy accelerated, China's trade with the world, and especially with Southeast Asia flourished. Trade has boomed, growing by more than 60-fold. ASEAN and China are now each other's biggest trading partners.</p><p>While COVID-19 has set back the global economy, the fundamentals in the region remain sound. There are 2 billion people in Southeast Asia and China, with one of the fastest growing middle classes in the world. There is large potential for catch-up growth, as most parts of Asia are still emerging. Beyond catch-up, we must seek to ride on the fourth industrial revolution. But to realise the region's potential, each country must undertake the difficult task of economic restructuring, and find new ways to complement one another.</p><p>New Building Blocks for Regional Prosperity</p><p>Looking ahead, we must fortify the foundations of existing partnerships, and nurture new areas of complementarities. One important way is to strengthen the rules-based multilateral framework for trade and investments. The ASEAN-China FTA is a cornerstone agreement that has benefited all members. Let us work towards upgrading this Agreement, to reduce non tariff measures and address new priorities, especially for the digital economy. As we prepare to resume cross-border travel, we should rebuild our aviation links and further liberalise the ASEAN-China Air Transport Agreement to boost our region's connectivity.</p><p>Beyond ASEAN and China, we must maintain the momentum for global trade liberalisation, and build confidence in multilateralism. RCEP, which was signed between ASEAN Member States, China, and four other major trading partners is an important next step. Covering one-third of the world's population and one-third of global GDP, this is the biggest trade agreement in history. When the RCEP comes into force, it will further strengthen economic integration in the region. And we look forward to welcoming India to join the RCEP when they are ready. Closer economic integration in Asia will better enable us to realise the potential of the region, and contribute to global economic development.</p><p>Beyond FTAs, we should explore new building blocks to strengthen cooperation, to seek new sources of growth and address global challenges. Let me cite two - digital collaboration and sustainable development.</p><p>Digital collaboration will be a key building block for the future. COVID-19 has accelerated the global shift to digital, and we must move swiftly to respond to this shift. Let us further strengthen collaboration. One way is to pilot more city-to-city projects. The Smart City Initiative between Singapore and Shenzhen is an example, where we are digitalising end-to-end trade financing. We welcome collaboration with more interested partners. At the country level, we can establish Digital Economy Agreements. Singapore concluded such agreements with Australia, Chile, and New Zealand. We look forward to signing more. Over time, these agreements can contribute towards the development of common global frameworks and standards. This will ensure that cross border transactions and digital exchanges, including e-payments and data flows, are safe, secure, and efficient. This will enable us to better reap the potential of the digital economy.</p><p>Besides digital collaboration, a second key building block for the next phase of ASEAN-China cooperation is sustainable development. Climate change is an existential challenge. I hope that the 26th UN Climate Change Conference, or COP 26, later this year will achieve good global outcomes. Both ASEAN and China understand the urgency of the challenge - we have designated 2021 as the ASEAN-China Year of Sustainable Development Cooperation. As we seek to emerge from this crisis, we can focus on catalysing a green recovery - from investing in buildings that are more energy-efficient, to exploring cleaner energy sources such as solar and wind. Given the large infrastructure funding needs, we will need to improve the flow of cross-border capital and crowd in private funding. China's Belt and Road Initiative or BRI is an important initiative, and a 'Green BRI' will be a major step in catalysing green infrastructure. Within ASEAN, the Catalytic Green Finance Facility was established to provide loans and technical assistance for green infrastructure projects. Singapore is also contributing to this green recovery effort through Infrastructure Asia to facilitate the flow of funds and expertise to bridge the infrastructure gap. We will also be issuing up to US$15 billion in green bonds for public infrastructure projects. Besides reducing carbon emission at source, we must also explore carbon sequestration - the long-term capture of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Nature-based solutions can provide one-third of the global mitigation necessary to stabilise warming to below 2 degree Celsius. With more than one-third of the world's mangroves and up to 120 million hectares of land for re-forestation, Southeast Asia has significant potential to contribute to nature-based solutions for carbon capture. Again, to realise this potential, we need to catalyse investments. One important building block is to set common standards, improve traceability, and create vibrant exchanges for the trading of carbon credits. Singapore will be launching one such global carbon exchange - \"Climate Impact X\" - later this year. This will allow large-scale, high-quality carbon credits to be sold through standardised contracts, and crowd in more investment.</p><p>To realise the promise of these building blocks, all stakeholders - governments, businesses, workers and communities - must be part of this effort. Business China has a valuable role, by providing platforms and opportunities for stakeholders to deepen collaborations, and forge new partnerships. If we can all work together, the ASEAN-China economic relationship will continue to deepen and broaden.</p><p>Managing Differences Constructively</p><p>But ASEAN-China relations are not confined to economic relations. There is a broader strategic context. Even as we deepen the ASEAN-China economic relationship, we must also manage the friction and disputes well. Otherwise, the progress could be undermined.</p><p>Relations between neighbours are often more complicated than relations between distant countries. Beyond specific issues, tensions and anxieties are often exacerbated by the disparity of size. These dynamics are further accentuated when Southeast Asian countries are concerned about being caught up in the intensifying strategic competition between the US and China.</p><p>Relations between all countries - big and small - must be conducted within the framework of international law. And this includes the resolution of disputes. There are important issues to be resolved between China and some Southeast Asia nations. These include competing claims in the South China Sea, and concerns over environmental degradation in the Mekong region. The key is to manage these disputes in a rational manner, in accordance with universally recognised principles of international law, including the 1982 UNCLOS, and with guardrails to ensure that tensions do not escalate out of control.</p><p>As much as we have made good progress on trade, we can make similar progress to resolve difficult issues. For instance, the South China Sea dispute is difficult to resolve, as various stakeholders are locked into entrenched positions. But we can and we must do all we can to reduce the risk of miscalculations. I am glad that ASEAN Member States and China are in negotiations on a Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, with the second reading of the Single Draft Negotiating Text underway.</p><p>Within ASEAN, we must also continue to forge stronger unity and stability. a. ASEAN has made good progress since its founding in 1967. But the continuing crisis in Myanmar is a grave problem. It is disappointing that the Five-Point Consensus that was secured at the ASEAN Leaders' Meeting in Jakarta in April this year has not been implemented expeditiously. We continue to call for an immediate cessation of violence by all parties, the release of all political detainees, and meaningful negotiations and dialogue amongst key stakeholders to achieve a durable political solution that is in the interest of Myanmar's people. ASEAN must stand ready to help and to support mediation if possible.</p><p>Open and Inclusive Regional Architecture</p><p>I have touched on the new building blocks of ASEAN-China cooperation, and the importance of managing differences that may arise.</p><p>But just as importantly, stability and prosperity in Asia depends on our continued openness and engagement of all major partners.</p><p>Asia has prospered because of the favourable strategic context underpinned by US presence in the region after the Second World War.The US provided the foundations for global trade to flourish - through its efforts to champion an open, integrated, and rules based global order. Its security presence also contributed to regional security, ensuring that sea lines of communication remain safe and open. American companies have invested extensively in the region, bringing with them not just capital, but ideas and technology. This has benefited the region as a whole, including Southeast Asia and China.</p><p>US presence in the region will continue to be an important stabiliser. We welcome the US' renewed focus on Asia under the Biden Administration. The TPP would have further strengthened the US's ties with the region. Their withdrawal was regrettable, but we welcome the US to re-join the CPTPP when it is possible to do so.</p><p>It is not just US or China that have significant influence in the region. Japan has made major contributions, and stepped up in pushing for the completion of the CPTPP after the US withdrew. India too has been an engine of growth for the region, with its large market and fast-expanding middle class. Australia, New Zealand and South Korea also have important roles to play, as do European countries such as France, Germany, and the UK.</p><p>So even as we create new building blocks between ASEAN and China, we must bear in mind that - an open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based region ultimately benefits all countries - ASEAN, China, US and all major trading partners.</p><p>But the biggest challenge that the region faces is the strategic competition between US and China. Relations between the two major powers have become less volatile under the Biden Administration, but the underlying tensions remain. In the US, there is a strong bipartisan consensus, backed by growing public support, that China is the US' main strategic competitor. The US has rallied its allies and partners by re-energising its ties with the G7, NATO in Europe, and the Quad in Asia. On China's part, it wants to stake its rightful position in the world. The Chinese Communist Party celebrates its centennial this month, a significant milestone. Next year, it will hold the 20th Party Congress. We can expect that China will continue to take a firm stance on issues that it deems as its \"core interests\", such as Taiwan.</p><p>For the foreseeable future, tensions are unlikely to abate. But despite their differences, it is in the interest of both the US and China to cooperate on common challenges. For a start, there is common interest between both parties to tackle COVID 19, coordinate global economic recovery, and address the long-term challenge of climate change. I am glad that both sides have acknowledged that there are areas of shared interests that they can work on together, and have stepped up bilateral exchanges. The key to stability for Southeast Asia and the world is for the two major powers to focus on expanding common ground while preventing tensions from boiling over, as they settle into a new modus vivendi.</p><p>For ASEAN, we do not expect to change the course of the strategic competition, but we must do all that we can to keep the region open and inclusive. It is not a question of choosing sides, but of retaining our ability to make choices for ourselves, to advance our collective interest, and do what is best for our peoples. Our region must remain firmly anchored on ASEAN's own interests, and continue to build a regional architecture that is open, transparent, inclusive, and rules-based.</p><p>This is what ASEAN Centrality is about. I am glad that both the US and China have expressed their support for ASEAN Centrality. This shows an appreciation for the notion that a strong and stable ASEAN is not just good for ASEAN Member States, but also good for the world. We should also look out for areas where ASEAN can collaborate with both the US and China, especially in areas where we all have common interest.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>In conclusion, Southeast Asia's relationship with China has come a long way since formal dialogue relations began three decades ago.</p><p>To further deepen this relationship, we should continue to strengthen the foundational building blocks of our relationship, such as the ASEAN-China FTA, whilst creating new building blocks of cooperation, in new areas such as digital collaboration and sustainable development. At the same time, we must manage any differences in a constructive manner. And even as we strengthen ASEAN-China cooperation, the region must remain open to all partners.</p><p>In this way, I am confident that our region will continue to remain a vibrant node of economic activity, and key engine of growth for the world for years to come.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0056509163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634G-JNC1-JB5M-W1RV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2568\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 12, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp;

At this stage of the pandemic, the additional policy supports and accelerated vaccine rollouts in advanced economies have improved their near-term recovery prospects. These economies could start policy normalisation earlier than expected. Long-term interest rates in some advanced economies have already risen on positive outlooks and inflation concerns, rattling global financial markets.</p><p>A return to more normal interest rates could trigger another \"taper tantrum\" among Asia's emerging markets, including those in Asean. To address this, we should reinforce regional financial safety nets such as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation to cushion any possible spillovers from global shocks.</p><p>The pandemic has also shown how fragile global trade and supply chains can be. While I believe globalisation will eventually return, it will take a different shape, requiring our renewed commitment to regional cooperation and integration by deepening regional trade and diversifying supply chains.</p><p>REDUCING BOTTLENECKS</p><p>The reconfiguration of global supply chains offers Asean economies a great opportunity to establish themselves as reliable new suppliers and to attract investment. To enhance competitiveness, Asean economies should reduce behind-the-border bottlenecks such as non-tariff barriers and restrictive regulations, continue improving trade logistics and efficiency, and promote paperless trade.</p><p>We also need to reduce health vulnerabilities and lift regional health security.</p><p>ADB supports the Asean Strategic Framework for Public Health Emergencies and the establishment of Regional Reserves for Medical Supplies - which will help the region better respond to future disease outbreaks and pandemics.</p><p>ADB will use its US$9 billion Asia Pacific Vaccine Access Facility, or APVAX, to support Asean's Vaccine Security and Self-Reliance. The region already has strong vaccine manufacturing capacities in Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam, which can facilitate swift and fair distribution of Covid-19 vaccines despite near-term global supply bottlenecks.</p><p>The second key issue is improving domestic resource mobilisation. This will be indispensable as a foundation for lasting recovery. It can be achieved by strengthening tax systems and closing loopholes through international tax cooperation, deepening local currency bond markets, and catalysing green finance.</p><p>The pandemic pushed many economies into fiscal deficits and higher debt, making domestic resource mobilisation a top policy priority for sustained post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>The average 14 per cent tax-to-GDP ratio in Asean is low compared to the average for developing Asia and the OECD, leaving room for improvement in boosting revenue generation and strengthening tax collection in Asean. Appropriate tax policy measures will be needed to strengthen the tax base and improve tax compliance once the region is on track to full recovery.</p><p>International tax cooperation can also help fight tax avoidance and evasion. The rise of the borderless digital economy makes it easier for multinationals to shift profits to low-tax jurisdictions and exploit tax loopholes. With the increase in multinational investments in growing Asean markets, we need to ensure that all parties pay their fair share of taxes.</p><p>To date, six Asean countries - Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam - are members of the Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, under which more than 130 developed and developing economies are collaborating closely to tackle the issue of tax avoidance.</p><p>Eight Asean countries - Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam - are members of the Global Forum, which is committed to the automatic exchange of information critical to combatting tax evasion.</p><p>The second key measure to enhance domestic resource mobilisation is to foster local currency bond markets. Local currency bond markets are an effective funding source for increased fiscal spending, while also providing central banks an additional avenue for injecting liquidity into markets and cash-strapped businesses to safeguard financial stability.</p><p>Asean's local currency bond markets have expanded significantly over the past two decades. In particular, thematic bonds, such as green, social, and sustainability bonds can help finance green infrastructure and inclusive recovery. While they remain a small fraction of the total market size, thematic bonds outstanding increased six-fold since 2017. ADB is committed to working with Asean to reinforce this trend.</p><p>SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE</p><p>Finally, a green and innovative financing mechanism can help Asean countries to effectively mobilise financial resources and increase investment in quality, climate-resilient infrastructure.</p><p>The Asean Catalytic Green Financing Facility, or ACGF, under the Asian Infrastructure Fund, is owned by Asean countries together with ADB and receives administration support from ADB. Launched in 2019, ACGF aims at scaling up green projects in the region by mobilising public and private resources. Through US$1.4 billion in support from six partners including ADB, ACGF will make projects less risky by reducing the cost of equity and debt. By doing so, we make the projects more bankable and attractive for private investors.</p><p>ACGF is not only a source of financing, but also of knowledge. Through ACGF, ADB is providing technical assistance to support Thailand, Indonesia, and the Philippines in issuing green, social, and sustainability bonds.</p><p>Stronger regional cooperation and more effective domestic resource mobilisation will help Asean economies recover and rebuild for a greener and more resilient future.</p><p>ADB is committed to supporting Asean in forging a strong, inclusive, and sustainable recovery.</p><p>The writer is president of the Asian Development Bank. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Attendees of the Asean Summit standing for a photograph during the opening ceremony in Singapore in April 2018.

This is not only a question about gazing into the future and faraway. Steps are already being taken to adapt to the changing circumstances, and these initiatives should be recognised and encouraged.</p><p> Take local food operators for instance. They suffered drastically in the circuit breaker and, again, will be impacted by the current measures that curtail dining in. Yet this time around, many more of them are ready to accept orders online or by SMS, and have arranged for delivery options. This transition is taking place not only among the big boys and upper-end establishments, but also includes hawkers and coffee shops.</p><p> This is but one example of how the online economy is becoming everyday and for everyone. Retailers and other sectors now realise that going online is no longer a choice but a necessity. The digital economy was given a significant boost by the pandemic, and can only grow bigger and broader.</p><p> A much larger transformation of our industries and supply chains can be supported with technology, combined with more resilient and reliable logistics to get physical goods to their final destinations, not just in Singapore but across the region and beyond. This is one of the implications of the task force's recommendation that Singapore should be a \"virtually unlimited\" economy.</p><p> CONNECTING TO THE WORLD The task force has also said that Singapore should continue to be relevant as a hub for business, work and leisure, resuming travel safely through the use of technology. Some will protest that this flies in the face of current facts.</p><p> The World Economic Forum has just cancelled its much-touted plans to hold its annual meeting here. Attempts to establish travel bubbles, for instance with Hong Kong, have repeatedly collapsed. Some of the surge in current cases in Singapore can also be traced to Changi Airport and the harbour, precisely at the interconnections between Singapore and the world.</p><p> Yet there is truth in that Singapore has always gained from being open to the world and must again seek ways to do so, safely and securely. Indeed, there is a case to be made that being able to reopen can create an even greater premium for Singapore. To support this, there must of course be sufficient reserve capacity in our testing, tracing and treatment for Covid-19.</p><p> The potential role for Singapore goes beyond the pandemic. The ongoing Sino-American rivalry will have major repercussions for trade and supply chains, and may also fragment the digital economy.</p><p> If Singapore can be a vital node that cooperates with both great powers, as well as other major economies like the European Union and Japan, this would again multiply our current and future value proposition. In this context, the task force's call for Singapore to resist the forces of anti-globalisation and protectionism by remaining open is correct.</p><p> There is a need to foster a reservoir of confidence, trust and goodwill among the people for Singapore to be open and serve as a hub. Understanding and buy-in from the public about the benefits will be necessary. If Singapore is to remain open, in good times and especially in these present trying circumstances, more must be convinced that this is our past, present and future role.</p><p> GREENING THE REGION A third area to consider is Singapore's steps forward on sustainability and climate action. The task force's recommendation is that Singapore should establish itself as a carbon trading and services hub, including the development of a carbon market with the ancillary capacity for companies to measure, mitigate and offset their carbon footprints.</p><p> Take this in the context of the Green Plan detailed during Budget 2021, a landmark undertaking by five ministries and the Government as a whole. There is considerable momentum in R&amp;D and green finance to support this effort and enable adoption by the private sector in Singapore.</p><p> Yet while the starting point is at the national level, Singapore's capabilities in technology and finance will have greater positive impact and be more commercially attractive when we look across our region. Identifying and enabling regional opportunities sets the context for the task force's recommendations for sustainability. Other initiatives that become more viable and impactful at a regional scale include energy transitions, the development of green infrastructure, and even nature-based solutions to carbon emissions and climate concerns. There are other and additional steps that may bear discussion, particularly on sustainability and Singapore's regional engagements.</p><p> There is much else in the task force's report that merits consideration and response, not only by the Government and corporations but also by workers and citizens.</p><p> When the Singapore Institute of International Affairs served as a knowledge partner for the task force, we were heartened that its co-chair, National Development Minister Desmond Lee, acknowledged that the task force does not have a \"monopoly of ideas\", and that it hopes to tap \"collective wisdom\" in Singapore. This is the right frame to read the report - as an impetus to consider what is happening, and what could happen next, for the better.</p><p> The situation may be uncertain and tense for now, and discussion often huddles around urgent risks and immediate actions. Yet one clear lesson from times of crisis is the need to also anticipate what may come next. New realities and trends are already emerging amid the pandemic and will not wait for the tardy. Those who can respond quickly, and then evaluate and prepare for that emerging future, will be well placed to prosper.</p><p>\u00b7 Simon Tay is chairman of the Singapore Institute of International Affairs, where Aaron Choo is senior assistant director.

If nothing is done, the economic impact of climate change will be profound - estimated GDP per capita loss for Asean members range from 0.7 per cent to 8.5 per cent by 2100. And this doesn't even take into account societal or environmental impacts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> However, as we emerge from the pandemic, there's an opportunity to build back better and help reboot our economies by moving away from high-emission pathways and changing the behaviour of businesses and people.</p><p> To achieve this, Asean governments must be both tactical and structural in their approach. Doing this provides immediate changes while building long-term structural frameworks that will lure institutional investment and shift behaviour at every level of society. In short, a complete rewiring of the economy.</p><p> How do we go about this'</p><p> Governments must first take a tactical approach to their economic recoveries.</p><p> The Asean Comprehensive Recovery Framework (ACRF) is the region's \"exit strategy\" from the Covid-19 crisis and sets out seven priorities under the broad strategy, including promoting sustainable finance, to building green infrastructure and facilitating the transition to sustainable energy.</p><p> Asean should link the ACRF and its implementation plan with their climate change and sustainable development agendas. This will act as a catalyst for change across the board; with governments setting the agenda, the private sector will be in a better position to mobilise.</p><p> This will stimulate institutional and foreign direct investment to fund the green transition.</p><p> According to the United Nations, countries are falling far short of what is required to achieve the targets set out in the Paris Agreement.</p><p> Covid-19 acts as the opportunity for governments to recharge their approach to climate change, but in order for these climate pledges to make long term and broad-based change, much of the economic activities that have been built up over the last century and a half must be rewired to fundamentally alter their emission trajectories.</p><p> Asean governments can focus on three key areas of structural change which have far-reaching impact in recalibrating economies:</p><p> 1. DEVELOPING AN ASEAN TAXONOMY The ACRF identifies green finance as a key mechanism to \"contain\" the drop in other sources of financing caused by the pandemic.</p><p> To generate broad-based use of green finance, a unified language in the form of taxonomy is needed to ensure that all participants work towards the same environmental objectives.</p><p> Asean has seen pockets of development on this front. Singapore recently issued a consultation paper on a green and transition taxonomy for financial institutions. Malaysia's Bank Negara will soon enforce its own taxonomy that sets out a common language to categorise economic activities based on their impact on climate change.</p><p> But overall, Asean still lacks cohesive definition on what is considered green or in transition, which will deter institutional investment in much-needed infrastructure.</p><p> Asean should leverage and align with ongoing global efforts to harmonise taxonomies.</p><p> 2. A FRAMEWORK FOR ESG RISK ASSESSMENT Institutional investors are hungry to invest in sustainable infrastructure, which can offer stable, long-term returns. Recognising this, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Singapore's Infrastructure Asia inked a cooperation pact in 2019 to help regional governments develop bankable and sustainable infrastructure projects.</p><p> But project participants - banks, developers, investors and governments - need a common framework to assess environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks.</p><p> Asean governments must work together to develop such a framework. The International Finance Corporation's Environmental and Social Performance Standards and the ADB Safeguard Policy Statement are a good starting point.</p><p> 3. THE POWER OF SOVEREIGN DEBT Infrastructure investment will drive economic recovery following the pandemic, and the Green Social and Sustainability (GSS) bond market has a significant role to play in financing the transition to a low-carbon, climate resilient economy.</p><p> Given that sovereigns make up almost half of the volume of the global bond market, their leadership role is critical and the ball of change lies in their court.</p><p> South-east Asia has had some success in this regard. Indonesia issued its first sovereign green sukuk in 2018, and the Singapore Government has just announced its intention to issue green bonds to spark infrastructure investment. But the rest of the region still lags behind.</p><p> Increasing the number of GSS issuance among Asean members should be a key objective for governments, central banks and development finance institutions.</p><p> Sovereign GSS bonds attract investors and in turn demonstrate investor demand.</p><p> Public policy globally is clearly taking a green turn. Our economies must start the transition if we are to have a sustainable future.</p><p> If Governments choose to take both a pragmatic and long-term approach, they can prompt a shift in the behaviour of every level of society - from statutory boards, to corporates and consumers.</p><p> Financial institutions have a significant role to play too. For example, HSBC is proposing several new climate resolutions at its upcoming AGM, including phasing-out the financing of coal and publishing annual progress reports.</p><p> It's a delicate balance. A balance that Asean must achieve as we emerge from this pandemic. What's needed is coordination, collaboration and pragmatism.</p><p> Climate change is a threat we can no longer ignore. The time to act is now.</p><p>\u00b7 The writer is the head of corporate sustainability at HSBC Singapore.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A worker checking cables on a solar power farm.

They reaffirmed the excellent ties between Singapore and China, and welcomed the good progress made in bilateral cooperation despite the COVID-19 pandemic, including in traditional areas of cooperation ranging from trade and investment to financial cooperation.</p><p>With the pandemic accelerating existing structural shifts, DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han agreed to explore new areas of collaboration, in particular in digital economy and green development. DPM Heng also highlighted the importance of restoring connectivity for post-pandemic economic recovery, as well as resuming regular people-to-people exchanges, including by our businesses and students. DPM Heng noted that the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), together with Singapore Airlines, were working with the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), to ensure smooth charter flight operations for the Beijing Winter Olympics which China would host in February 2022. Such cooperation demonstrated the value of working together to facilitate safe cross-border travel. Vice Premier Han expressed support for the safe resumption of cross-border travel between Singapore and China, and for officials on both sides to intensify discussions on this front.</p><p>DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han reiterated their commitment to free and open trade, and looked forward to the entry into force of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) next month, which will further deepen regional economic integration. Both sides also pledged to achieve high standards of trade and investment liberalisation through upgrading the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement (CSFTA). DPM Heng also welcomed China's application to the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), in accordance with the CPTPP's rules and procedures, and welcomed China's bid to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).</p><p>17th JCBC saw 14 Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) and agreements announced</p><p>The 17th JCBC meeting reviewed bilateral cooperation in the following areas: Belt and Road Initiative (BRI); economic, trade and sustainability; finance; innovation; public health, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges; as well as the China-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City, which is a state-level bilateral cooperation project. To seize the opportunities of the digital age, both sides agreed to include innovation cooperation as a new pillar of collaboration this year, covering the digital economy, smart cities, and science and technology innovation cooperation.</p><p>DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han affirmed that both sides should leverage existing bilateral projects and cooperation platforms to pursue our common interest in creating innovation-led, sustainable and inclusive growth. These were also areas of priorities highlighted in China's New Development Paradigm and Dual Circulation Strategy. DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han agreed that both countries were well positioned to unlock new growth opportunities in green development, including circular economy, renewable energy, green finance and green infrastructure. They also welcomed the good momentum in legal and judicial cooperation. Our Supreme Courts signed an MOU on Cooperation on Information on Foreign Law, which would further develop the legal infrastructure in support of the Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han agreed that Singapore and China should continue to deepen cooperation in areas such as finance, smart cities, public health and epidemic response, human resource and talent development, social governance, nature conservation, education and cultural and tourism exchanges.</p><p>DPM Heng reiterated the importance of restoring people-to-people links for deepening mutual trust and fostering collaboration. Both sides agreed that they should continue discussions and seek progress on the safe resumption of cross-border travel between Singapore and China, as well as the mutual recognition of digital health certificates.</p><p>Fourteen MOUs and agreements were announced at the JCBC:</p><p>(a) Cooperation Plan on China-Singapore (Chongqing) Connectivity Initiative - New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor (CCI ILSTC);</p><p>(b) MOU on Urban Governance, Urban Planning and Management;</p><p>(c) MOU on Knowledge Sharing;</p><p>(d) 9th Executive Programme on Cultural Cooperation (2022-2024);</p><p>(e) MOU on \"Single Window\" Interconnection Consortium Blockchain;</p><p>(f) Joint Paper on pursuing Green and Low-Carbon Development;</p><p>(g) MOU on Cooperation in Competition Law;</p><p>(h) MOU on Nature Conservation;</p><p>(i) MOU on \"Garden City\" Project in the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco City;</p><p>(j) MOU relating to Electronic Certificates for Ships and Seafarers;</p><p>(k) MOU to Support the Establishment of the SIP International Business Cooperation Centre (Singapore);</p><p>(l) Cooperation Agreement to establish the National University of Singapore Guangzhou Research Translation and Innovation Institute;</p><p>(m) MOU to establish an exchange-traded funds (ETF) Product Link; and</p><p>(n) Announcement of collaboration on commodity derivatives.</p><p>DPM Heng and Vice Premier Han jointly unveiled the name of Le Le ( ) - the first Giant Panda cub born in Singapore. The cub was born on 14 August 2021 to Kai Kai and Jia Jia - the pair of Giant Pandas which arrived in Singapore in 2012 as part of a collaboration between Wildlife Reserves Singapore and the China Wildlife Conservation Association on conservation and research.</p><p>22nd SIP JSC Meeting</p><p>The 22nd SIP JSC meeting noted that the SIP was in its third decade of collaboration, and highlighted the importance of continuing to reorient the SIP's pathfinder role in Singapore-China collaboration, taking into account our shared interests. Both sides looked forward to enabling greater two-way cross-border services and investments by supporting Chinese companies' internationalisation efforts and Singapore professional services firms' expansion into China. Both sides noted the scope to deepen biomedical cooperation through the SIP and committed to strengthen people-to-people ties via two-way software exchanges.</p><p>13th SSTEC JSC Meeting</p><p>The 13th SSTEC JSC meeting commended the Tianjin Eco-City (Eco-City) for its continued achievements as a leading demonstration of green and smart development in China. The Eco-City was a pathfinder, setting standards in areas including zero waste management and the use of technology to lower carbon emissions as well as enhance public amenities and services for residents. Both sides would strengthen cooperation, aim higher and elevate the Eco-City's high quality development in support of China's national environmental and development objectives. This would be done, for example, by pushing boundaries to further enhance the integration of nature with the built environment as a \"Garden City\", and nurture community stewardship of the Eco-City's natural environment. The meeting also highlighted the joint efforts by both sides in the replication promotion efforts and sharing the Eco-City's experience with other cities in China and internationally.</p><p>5th CCI JSC Meeting</p><p>The 5th CCI JSC meeting reaffirmed the CCI's role connecting Singapore and Chongqing as mutual hubs in our respective regions, and its complementarity with China's latest development strategies. Both sides noted the good progress made in the four priority areas of collaboration (financial services, aviation, transport and logistics, and information and communications technology) as well as the opportunities for collaboration arising from synergies across these areas. Both sides also welcomed the endorsement of the CCI-ILSTC Cooperation Plan and discussed ways to focus on new projects that were commercially viable and of mutual interest.</p><p>On the Singapore side, the JCBC and related JSC meetings were attended by Minister (Foreign Affairs) Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister (Trade and Industry) Gan Kim Yong, Minister (Transport) and Minister-in-charge (Trade Relations) S Iswaran, Minister (Education) Chan Chun Sing, Minister (Finance) Lawrence Wong, Minister (Communications and Information) and Second Minister (Home Affairs) Josephine Teo, Minister (National Development) and Minister-in-charge (Social Services Integration) Desmond Lee, Minister (Culture, Community and Youth) and Second Minister (Law) Edwin Tong, Minister (Manpower) and Second Minister (Trade and Industry) Dr Tan See Leng, Senior Minister of State (Communications and Information) (Health) Dr Janil Puthucheary, Minister of State (Culture, Community and Youth) (Trade and Industry) Low Yen Ling, Minister of State (Home Affairs) (Sustainability and the Environment) Desmond Tan, and Minister of State (Culture, Community and Youth) (Trade and Industry) Alvin Tan.</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office Singapore</p><p>[Category: Partnerships and Alliances]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0057660156</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64DJ-YFH1-JB5M-W02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1638\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 29, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000CYFG</classCode><className>SUZHOU INDUSTRIAL PARK HESHUN ELECTRIC CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000C41S</classCode><className>SUZHOU NEW SEA UNION TELECOM TECHNOLOGY CO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC00025ZB</classCode><className>SINGAPORE AIRLINES LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS335313 SWITCHGEAR &amp;

China and the US together account for 40% of global emissions. China leads with 27%, over a quarter of the global emissions. This is followed by the US at 13%. The next three are the EU at 8%, India at 7% and Russia at 5%,\" says Ho.</p><p>Since 2005, the EU has cut its emissions by a \"creditable\" 30%, Ho adds, followed by the US with a 12% reduction.</p><p>Meanwhile, China's emissions over the same period grew by over 60%, while India's more than doubled. \"Carbon abatement needs government action now, especially by these top five emitters. Investors and businesses must act too,\" says Ho.</p><p>World's largest carbon market</p><p>In July, China's national carbon trading programme, the emission trading scheme (ETS), went live. Credit Suisse expects this to become the world's largest carbon market, with more than twice the market size of the EU's ETS.</p><p>China's carbon trading volume in 2019 and 2020 comprised less than 1.4% of its total emissions in the same period. David Murphy, Credit Suisse's head of CQi, says: \"The scale of China's carbon market is set to grow rapidly and cover a larger portion of the nation's emissions over the next five to 10 years, thereby opening the door for greater international collaboration on cross-border trading.\"</p><p>Nonetheless, there remains a very significant task ahead for China, says Credit Suisse. Even if China manages to achieve peak emissions by 2030, it will only have a 30-year runway to achieve carbon neutrality. By comparison, many European countries enjoy a longer timeframe than China to achieve their zero-carbon goal.</p><p>Moreover, as China approaches peak emissions, its \"growth at all costs\" strategy will be increasingly called into question.</p><p>Most developed countries are dependent on low-carbon sectors for economic growth. In contrast, China plans to retain its traditional industrial capacity and is unlikely to be able to tap offshoring of manufacturing capacity to ease carbon emission rates - as seen in Europe and the US - as it seeks to reduce its carbon output to transition to a lower-carbon economy.</p><p>Carbon pricing from China's trade destinations will also gnaw at its future growth. For one, Credit Suisse highlights the EU's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM).</p><p>The CBAM is an import customs tariff on carbon-intensive production outside of the EU. Exporters with less strict climate policies and higher emission content will pay a carbon price pegged to the EU ETS.</p><p>Here, Credit Suisse believes exporters of steel, aluminum, cement and fertilisers may face material risks.</p><p>At the country level, China and Russia have uniquely high exposure as the largest suppliers of iron and steel and aluminum. China produces over 1,050 million tonnes of steel, 2,300 million tonnes of cement, 35 million tonnes of aluminium, and 7 million tonnes of copper annually, contributing to 58%, 57%, 57% and 39% of global production respectively.</p><p>\"The vast production of energy-intensive commodities creates an enormous demand for energy consumption and unfortunately generates huge amounts of carbon dioxide as well,\" says Edmond Huang, Credit Suisse's head of China and Hong Kong securities research.</p><p>If the cost of CBAM is passed through, steel and aluminum prices per tonne will increase by 8% and 21% respectively against EU spot prices. Chinese steel would be 10%-11% more expensive in 2026, which would accelerate a decarbonisation in Chinese steel, adds Credit Suisse.</p><p>Phineas Glover, head of ESG research for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, points to the CBAM as a \"polluter's dilemma\". \"It serves to both enforce the so-called polluter pays principle, and, through the power of market access, overcome what has been the prisoner's dilemma of global climate policy.\"</p><p>\"However, it will also create big investment opportunities in China,\" adds Glover. \"In particular, we expect to see an accelerated deployment of renewables and, as carbon prices increase, an increase in coal-to-gas switching within industrials. We also foresee an increase in electric arc furnace-made steel, hydrogen and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) investment.\"</p><p>Global green trends</p><p>According to Credit Suisse, China is well-positioned to achieve technology independence and leadership in key sectors, given its dominance in the solar, wind, EV and battery supply chains.</p><p>Chinese suppliers now control over 80% of the effective capacity in most of the segments across the global solar supply chain, while Chinese wind turbine makers had 45% of the global market share in 2019.</p><p>According to industry data and CQi's estimates, Chinese companies accounted for 42.2% of EV sales and 48.3% of EV battery installation globally last year.</p><p>\"While these large shares of the global market may trend down over time with other countries building their own capacities to reduce reliance on China, the very strong global demand will likely see China's exports of green products continue to grow over the next few decades,\" says Credit Suisse.</p><p>Within the transportation sector, Credit Suisse foresees new energy vehicles (NEVs) and renewable energy as the major beneficiaries of the replacement of traditional internal combustion engine cars and fossil fuels.</p><p>The Chinese government uses the term NEV to designate plug-in electric vehicles eligible for public subsidies. These include battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs).</p><p>Compared to traditional cars, NEVs are expected to cut CO2 emissions by 35% during their lifecycle. China is already the world's largest NEV market with a 38% global market share and the highest NEV sales volume.</p><p>The auto industry is strategic to China's economy, with its 4% GDP contribution and 10% employment contribution.</p><p>Huang thinks the Chinese government has shown strong policy support for the adoption of NEVs. \"Looking ahead, Credit Suisse forecasts a 25% 10-year CAGR in China's NEV volume and a 43% NEV penetration rate by 2030. The NEV market is expected to create a level playing field for Chinese auto companies to fulfil a more prominent role in the global auto industry.\"</p><p>As ambitious as the world's green plans may be, the lingering economic effects of the pandemic are likely to weigh down on China's near-term progress, says Credit Suisse. \"The lagging vaccination progress in much of the developing world and the risk of new virus variants have cast a shadow over universal normalisation in the global supply chain and business activity.\"</p><p>As a result, the Chinese government may have to take a more cautious approach in pushing high-carbon industries to cut production this year and in 2022, says Credit Suisse.</p><p>\"While China's path to carbon neutrality is not without challenges, Credit Suisse believes that there will continue to be opportunities and benefits in paying close attention to China's economy as the nation strengthens its position as a leading innovator, global climate change collaborator and strong investor.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63WJ-SY71-JCF0-3180-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Edge Publishing PTE.

A very good morning to our distinguished speakers and Roundtable panellists, and to all the viewers who have joined us via Zoom this morning. I am excited today to be here to deliver the keynote speech at the 36th ASEAN Roundtable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. This year's theme is Braving the Storms: ASEAN in Crisis Mode. Indeed, it has been a difficult time for us all, with COVID-19 posing new and unforeseen challenges to countries all over the world. The ASEAN region is no exception, as we grapple with not just the current global public health crisis, but also with fundamental shifts in the international order and our place in it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Current Geopolitical Developments</p><p>3. In the past few years, we've seen rapid shifts in the global geopolitical landscape, with new partnerships formed, old alliances renewed, and increased concerns of greater polarization.</p><p>4. Relations between the US and China have become tense, with reverberations across the region. Amidst the uncertainty, there has been an increased global focus on the Asia-Pacific region, including ASEAN. Notwithstanding these tensions, in recent years, ASEAN's volume of trade flows with both the US and China have increased. Amidst the pandemic, China and the US were ASEAN's largest and second-largest trading partners in 2020, with two-way merchandise trade growing by 1.8% and 4.6% respectively. The US and China are also stepping up their engagements with the region, with both US and Chinese senior officials visiting ASEAN countries recently and seeking to strengthen cooperation in economic, digital, public health and other spheres. ASEAN has constructive and positive relationships with the US, China and other partners. We will always welcome engagement with all stakeholders and hope that our partners will continue to contribute constructively to the peace and stability of the region and complement the existing ASEAN-centric regional architecture.</p><p>5. As we continue to face an uncertain international geopolitical environment and an evolving geopolitical landscape with the emergence of new arrangements, ASEAN Centrality and unity continues to be key, to safeguard our autonomy and ability to make decisions in our best interests. ASEAN Member States must work together to maintain ASEAN Centrality and unity in the region and preserve our autonomy to collaborate with our partners outside ASEAN.</p><p>ASEAN Strategies for Post-Pandemic Recovery</p><p>6. Amidst the dynamically changing geopolitical backdrop, regional cooperation is critical to address one of ASEAN's most pressing concerns, which is the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. The immediate public health impact of the disease and the economic implications continue to unfold and affect our people and economies.</p><p>7. ASEAN has banded together to promote recovery and emerge stronger from the pandemic. Last year, we launched the ASEAN Comprehensive Recovery Framework, which focuses the region's post-pandemic recovery efforts on five broad areas of enhancing public health, human security, regional economic integration, inclusive digital transformation and sustainability. ASEAN's partners have also expressed commitment to supporting its implementation and bolstering regional post-pandemic recovery.</p><p>8. To cite another example of our cooperation, at the height of the pandemic last year, ASEAN and its FTA partners signed the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, or RCEP. The RCEP is the world's largest FTA, comprising 30% of global GDP and a third of the world's population. Singapore and our RCEP Partners are working towards the entry into force of RCEP by early 2022. When implemented, it will strengthen ASEAN's economic ties with the broader region. These efforts speak to the importance of working together for post-pandemic recovery through further integration of our economies.</p><p>Long-term economic transformation</p><p>9. However, ASEAN is also looking beyond crisis mode towards longer-term resilience. Beyond the short-term disruptions, ASEAN is also actively seeking to harness the benefits from global megatrends. Let me name three.</p><p>10. First, digitalisation has increased exponentially during the pandemic. There were 40 million new Internet users last year, resulting in 70% of the region's population now being online. [1] The use of e-commerce has become a key channel for businesses to seek new growth opportunities and for consumers to better access digital services. The industry is set to grow further. By 2025, e-commerce in the region is expected to expand by 23% to US$172 billion from US$62 billion in 2020.[2] It will be important for ASEAN to leverage this momentum to promote an equitable and inclusive economic recovery.</p><p>11. To that end, the ASEAN Economic Ministers recently adopted the Bandar Seri Begawan Roadmap[3] on digital transformation, which highlights key needle-moving initiatives towards a single digital economy in ASEAN. As part of this Roadmap, ASEAN has agreed to start negotiations on an ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement by 2025. This will promote the seamless and secure flow of goods, services and data in the region, underpinned by enabling rules, regulations, infrastructure and talent.</p><p>12. Second, the pandemic has accelerated long-term shifts in supply chains. Businesses are increasingly pursuing resilience in supply chains, on top of efficiency considerations. In a region closely connected by value chains, ASEAN is striving to strengthen our value proposition as a regional production and manufacturing hub. We are enhancing efforts to promote trade facilitation within the region, including by addressing non-tariff measures and expanding the ASEAN Single Window through link-ups with our FTA partners.</p><p>13. Third, ASEAN is embarking on the transition towards a green recovery. We recently finalised the Framework for Circular Economy for the ASEAN Economic Community, which outlines the region's strategic commitment to sustainable development. The Framework will galvanise the implementation of concrete initiatives towards sustainable and inclusive growth for our people, economies and societies. One such initiative is the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility[4], or the ACGF, which provides loans and technical assistance for green, bankable infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia. In March 2021, ACGF, with financing support from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Green Climate Fund (GCF), launched the Green Recovery Programme. The Programme will support over 20 green infrastructure projects worth more than US$4 billion across Southeast Asia, and is expected to create 340,000 green jobs in key sectors such as sustainable transport, renewable energy and low-carbon agriculture over a 30-year period.</p><p>14. These initiatives will help ASEAN emerge stronger and greener, and entrench ASEAN's position in the international economy in the 21st century. We look forward to continuing to work with our ASEAN counterparts, as well as with our partners from around the world.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>15. Over the next two days, a variety of issues and challenges that affect ASEAN as a region and institution will be discussed by leading scholars and commentators. I hope that the viewers will enjoy listening to the discussions and that you will find them interesting and enriching.</p><p>16.

Tax policy is crucial to raising revenue for the significant investment needed from governments and to direct the private sector in the right direction,\" says Chris Woo, tax leader, PwC Singapore.</p><p> Allen Tan, principal and head of the tax, trade and wealth management practice at Baker McKenzie Wong &amp; Leow, believes that tax policy can potentially play a very significant role in getting businesses and the community to internalise the cost of the emissions they generate, either directly or indirectly.</p><p> \"This will also incentivise them to reduce energy consumption such as by developing and maintaining greener buildings and adopting more efficient and sustainable appliances and machinery.\"</p><p> But this would need to be balanced with appropriate government support to assist in the transition to a greener and more sustainable economy, he adds.</p><p> Having green elements embedded in broadbased incentives also drives home the message that all corporations ought to undertake a certain level of green activity, says Toh Shu Hui, partner, tax services, at Ernst &amp; Young Solutions LLP.</p><p> \"This can catalyse green activities across a wider spectrum of industries, and in time to come, build up a green ecosystem within South-east Asia,\" Toh says.</p><p> \"Furthermore, this green emphasis will complement corporations' efforts in future-proofing business expansion plans in light of the various sustainability developments globally, such as the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism that potentially affects the competitiveness of goods imported into Europe unless low-carbon technologies are adopted.\"</p><p>Singapore carbon tax</p><p> In Singapore, the Budget on Feb 18 is expected to include an announcement of an increase in the carbon tax rate for 2024 and beyond. \"The real question (is) the quantum of the increase,\" says Tan of Baker McKenzie Wong &amp; Leow.</p><p> \"Given the government's acknowledgment that the effects of climate change are intensifying and there is a significant increase in global momentum to combat the looming climate crisis, we would not be surprised to see the carbon tax rate rise to more than S$15 per tonne of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (up from the current S$5).\"</p><p> However, Tan adds that he believes any change in the carbon tax regime will be phased in over time, to allow businesses to adjust and transition to become more energy-efficient.</p><p> \"The government may also enhance or expand existing grants to encourage more businesses to invest in more efficient machinery or refitting their factories to improve power efficiency,\" he says.</p><p> Carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes (ETS) are generally expected to become more commonplace around the world, as governments recognise the utility of such mechanisms when it comes to influencing climate-related behaviour.</p><p> Mark Addy, partner, energy &amp; natural resources, KPMG in Singapore, says the \"general consensus\" among the scientific community is that carbon prices and carbon tax rates are currently far too low, and need to be significantly increased if the world is to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.</p><p> Like Tan, Addy believes that the rate increases in Singapore and around the world will be gradual, to give businesses - particularly, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) - time to adapt, so as not to slow broader economic progress.</p><p> \"At the same time, governments may look to introduce a range of incentives to accelerate the adoption of environmentally friendly alternatives, such as lower taxes and duties on electric vehicles, or tax rebates for properties which meet energy efficiency targets,\" Addy says.</p><p> Ajay Kumar Sanganeria, partner and head of tax at KPMG in Singapore, said that while he expects carbon tax rates to grow in the coming years, he also believes governments will introduce incentives to complement carbon pricing regimes - to encourage both businesses and individuals to switch to greener alternatives.</p><p> PwC's Woo says that the Singapore government recognises the need to support companies on their decarbonisation journey using revenue from the carbon tax, including incentivising the adoption of energy-efficient processes and other worthwhile abatement projects; he notes that additional funds have been channelled towards research and development for low-carbon technologies and urban solutions.</p><p> Simon Yeo, EY Asean climate change and sustainability services leader, points out that, presently, voluntary carbon credits cannot be used to offset obligations under Singapore's current carbon tax system. \"Creative and effective use of compliance and voluntary carbon schemes will be instrumental in achieving Singapore's net zero ambitions. The government may consider allocating S$10 million to S$20 million over the next three years for co-funding research, setting standards and establishing a complementary set of policy and market-based instruments to support this net-zero timeline.\"</p><p>Incentivising private finance</p><p> Equally important in the battle against climate change is the role that private finance can and will play - and tax policies can do much in directing financing to the desired avenues.</p><p> \"When evaluating the risks and rewards of potential investments, businesses will take into account, among other things, the financial payoff including the impact of any available fiscal schemes. Hence, tax policy can send a strong signal to businesses so that they adopt measures that are consistent with the nation's sustainability goals,\" Woo says.</p><p> \"It can also help correct certain inefficiencies in resource allocation by the market, for example, under-investment in research and development. Tax incentives such as additional capital allowances or additional tax deductions could be used to encourage the growth of a sustainability-centred business ecosystem in Singapore.\"</p><p> Woo adds that the measures could be along the lines of: grants or double tax deductions to encourage companies, especially SMEs, to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint; tax deductions for contributions to funds or projects set up by companies to reduce carbon emissions or wastage; and super tax deductions for the cost of acquiring carbon credits issued by such funds or projects should also encourage the voluntary use of such carbon credits as a means to offset their carbon footprint.</p><p> Tan agrees, detailing a host of other measures, such as additional tax depreciation for investment in more energy-efficient machinery, tax incentives for renewable power generation companies, or reduced taxes on interest payments made on loans to fund renewable power generation or the purchase of energy efficient machinery.</p><p> Sanganeria says governments have to find ways to incentivise investors - and examples include incentives for financial institutions to encourage more green lending, such as reduced tax rates on income from loans used for the development of green properties, or tax exemptions for investors on income earned from bonds where the funds are used for green investments.</p><p> \"Property owners could also be incentivised to make their buildings more energy efficient through offering enhanced tax deductions, or a partial tax exemption on gains from green property sales,\" he says.</p><p> Toh points out that it would also be worthwhile for governments to review their existing incentive schemes - and enhance them by incorporating certain green parameters. \"In Singapore, for example, existing tax incentives such as the Development and Expansion Incentive typically have capital investment expenditure requirements. A qualitative green element could be included that requires corporations to undertake green projects, commit to a certain carbon emissions level or source materials from sustainable sources to minimise the carbon footprint of their supply chains.\"</p><p> On other measures, Yeo says he hopes the Singapore government can consider setting aside a sum over the next three years to co-fund pilot programmes around packaging waste reduction, targeting the F&amp;B (food and beverage) and e-commerce sectors. \"The focus areas can be to incentivise first-movers to reduce packaging; collect packaging for reuse or recycling; conduct consumer or industry outreach on packaging 3Rs (reduce, reuse, recycle); encourage use of recycled content in packaging material; and improve recyclability of packaging.\"</p><p> In this vein, Addy also says that he hopes to see an increased prevalence of plastic taxes, aimed at both businesses and consumers, to encourage a switch to renewable options.</p><p> But, regardless of the fiscal scheme, Toh says, there should always be appropriate measures to monitor the progress of projects for accountability of the funds disbursed.</p><p> Woo concludes: \"Tax policy has a role to play to influence behaviours and catalyse actions. It is hoped that in the continuing debate on the design of a fit-for-purpose international tax system, due recognition can be given to the positive role of tax policy in promoting environmentally responsible sustainable growth.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Yeo hopes the Singapore government can consider setting aside a sum over the next three years to co-fund pilot programmes around packaging waste reduction, targeting the F&amp;B and e-commerce sectors.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-385770</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64NH-1891-JCF2-84VN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
